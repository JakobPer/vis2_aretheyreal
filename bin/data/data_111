I was outside in the outskirts of downtown Lowell, MA, last evening when I saw two bright, red lights in the northeast.  My friend also witnessed what I saw and I pointed out the lights to a couple of other people.  The lights were probably 10-15(?) degrees up from the horizon.  They did not move.  After a minute or so three other red lights appeared near them.  They stayed there, seemingly not moving for a few minutes, and then slowly faded away one by one.  The lights were red, maybe a bit orangey and roughly the same apparent brightness as Mars or Jupiter as they appear this summer. I took two photos, which unfortunately, are poor quality.  However, I was able to plot a line on a map showing which direction the lights came from using buildings beneath the lights in the photos and where I was standing as references.  The lights appeared above a facet of a building I can see on Google maps, so I believe the line of sight I made on the map is pretty accurate.  I could not tell the distance, but I believe they were at least some miles away. I am aware that red lights can be military aircraft.  To be fair Lawrence Municipal Airport and Pease Air Force Base are somewhat near the line of sight I plotted on the map.  However, there were no other colors and the lights didn’t move or blink.  Also, they didn't seem to be as deep a red as lights on military craft.  They also didn’t line up with the runways of the two airports.  They didn’t go behind clouds or the buildings nearby, they just faded out. I have been an avid sky watcher all of my life.  From watching airplanes, to viewing planets and meteor showers, I am always looking up and telling friends about celestial events.  I am fifty years old, and have never seen anything I could not explain before.  I recently saw a very bright light traveling overhead and some Googling proved that it was the International Space Station flying over the Northeast.  What I saw last night was not usual.

Surfaced like a lightning bug. It's almost 3 a.m. Earlier tonight we decided to take the five minute drive to the beach here on gorgeous Venice Island.  The vibration around midnight is quiet and calm with the background sound of crickets starting to audibly tune in to the land's energy, or could it be that the sound is tuning the land and the airwaves?  The Stars were a million in the sky.  The New Moon was yesterday, July 4th, 2016.  Tonight's sky was so clear without a moon, that looking at it made us feel as we we were one with all of the vastness.   We are. Yes, we all are. We each had a beach blanket and a chair.  Kaitlynn was on her beach blanket, staring up to the sky as I had my focus on my camera, looking away at the perfect time to catch a bright shooting star sailing across the sky.  Within a 20 minute time she saw 4 more falling stars, as my eyes were intent on getting the perfect shot.  The camera is new to me and it certainly doesn't lie. Ever.  Especially when I'm a little shaky with the hand, it always tells the truth, and nothing but.  My camera is my boyfriend. We sat back in the chairs for one last look before we left.  Kaitlynn pointed towards the pier, slowly following something with her eyes and her pointer finger, asking if I see ""that.""  I saw a blurry, short white line of faint, slow but steady flashing light, that appeared to be moving south to north amongst the top of the low clouds on the horizon.  At first I thought an airplane, but the light was too smooth, too straight, and low, plus we could not hear anything to reference that it was a plane.  A plane that close to the water would echo.  It was silent.  I said ""Someone on the pier must have a laser.""  It did appear that they were shining a little laser light into the clouds, moving it forward.   When it was at the point in front of us, it instantly changed course moving west to east under the surface of the water, directly toward us; dim, yet now, solid light.  Its size did not change as it moved toward us, coming from the horizon. As its distance closed in on us, about 20 feet away under the surface of the water, Kaitlynn grasped onto her chair handles like bracing for something, this was real.  The moment after she braced, it moved to the north a little and emerged about 10 feet away, 4 feet off of the ground, looking like a firefly, then gently hovering just over the sand.  It lingered along the shore momentarily.  Us, losing it in the darkness, like it was hiding it's light.  It came to check if we had noticed it, and we had.  We started to walk towards where it surfaced, but since it was not lighting up, we did not find it and had that certain feeling not to look for it any longer. I would think that it would appear to grow larger, the closer it came, true?  It's mathematical.  This did not change its size, although each atmosphere that it entered, it was a different and a constant other size.  In the clouds it looked like a small plane but mathematics ruled that down to someone pointing a laser echoing in the humidity of the clouds.  In the water it appeared as a quarter-sized white light, over the sand it was the size of a lightning bug and yellowish.  Kaitlynn saw a blue color at some point too. Prior to the sighting, I wanted to hear a song that describes the sky perfectly since it fit the moment.  A few lines are simple metaphors that we all can relate to.  I love lyrics like that.  ""...the sky resembles a backlit canopy with holes punched in it."" was this starry night.  The song is Incubus' ""I wish you were here.""  It goes on to say ""I'm counting UFOs, signaling them with my lighter ... and in this moment I am happy.  Happy.""  A few minutes later was the sighting.  This is real. Whatever it is was mind-blowing.  I don't know how else to describe it.",2016-07-08T00:00:00,27.065819,-82.39104

I was not wearing a watch, but the weather news (Channel 3 KYTV broadcasts 10:35 PM - 11:37 PM) had just started when I went inside to tell my husband what I had seen.  While I have been writing this report, midnight has come and gone so this is Thursday, July 21, 2016, and it covers an event which occurred on Wednesday, July 20. The sky was clear and I could see some stars.  I was facing east when I caught a glimpse of a very large object over my left shoulder.  It appeared to be moving through the sky in a straight line from SW to NE and disappeared from view behind tree tops in my neighbor’s yard. It took about five seconds to cover less than a 90 degree portion of the sky. There is a full moon, tonight.  I know that the moon seems larger near the horizon than it does at the zenith, so it is difficult to compare the size of what I saw to the size of the moon – but the object was gigantic, more like the moon than anything else in the sky – exactly the size of a nearby street light, and as bright.  I do not mean that it illuminated the ground, but that it appeared as bright as the street light I could see at the same time. The object was yellow with a tinge of red, and looked like a flame without any sparks or smoke.  It was nearly round, tapering just a little toward the back end, but it had no tail, left no trail.  It did not blink or change its intensity. It was silent. Our local meteorologist says that, at that time, the wind was from the south at 8 miles per hour.",2016-07-22T00:00:00,37.19880653950953,-93.30922288828337

They were NOT moving at a high rate of speed…….  After a few moments of us observing these lights they stopped moving and changed color from bright white to an orange/pinkish color.  Both objects stopped and changed color at the same time…..then they dimmed/faded and were gone from our sight......  While we were looking straight up at them directly over our heads.

I sat back down hoping it might reappear.   A minute or so went by, when it reappeared back in the area where it flew in circles before. It was doing this again, when it suddenly flew back towards the west and stopped roughly where I had first seen it.  Just as quickly, it made what appeared to be a tight angular change (this is when I saw another red light and a blue light).  At this point, it flew back to the east and out of my line of sight. As I sat hoping it would reappear again, I noticed a plane in the southwest.  The speed seemed so much slower and I realized another thing.  The plane made noise.  This object seemed to be silent.",2016-07-22T00:00:00,28.51724827586207,-81.78506551724136

A single white star-looking light (non-blinking, high elevation) appeared to break apart into three separate non-blinking lights.  The lights rapidly, as of being repelled from one another, moved it three separate directions that originated from a single point in the sky. The brightest light was moving straight north.  The two other lights (both white) were moving in an almost 33° angle from one another.  One was heading south east the other in a south west direction.  They initially were moving at what appeared to be an extremely high rate of speed, but from my location they both appeared to slow over a 10 to 15 second time frame before becoming too faint to see.  There speed seemed to be equivalent to one another.  Perhaps the other two lights were jettisoned from the northbound light. The northbound light remained bright white (non-blinking) and appeared to keep a steady speed.  I watched it for almost 2 minutes before it was out of sight.  It clearly was moving much faster than other air traffic in the sky. I didn't hear any sounds.  I was out walking the dogs on a dark walking path in a non-illuminated area with an unobstructed view of the sky.",2016-07-22T00:00:00,46.92450254041571,-114.02240554272517

I was outside in my side yard looking West when from my left (South) I observed what appeared to be a fireball entering from high in the South.  It traveled North North West.  It was approximately 3 times brighter than Jupiter (which was up) and very bright white yellow orange and had a slight tail pointing South.   I instantly thought fireball, but the object was slowing down, so I instantly thought this object was space junk.   This object was ""dropping"" what appeared to be hot material that was same color as the object.  The object continued to slow down and dripped the strange material two times on its trajectory before the object slowed to a complete static stop.  I was baffled to say the least.   As the object remained stationary, it dripped the bright material momentarily.  The flight time from when I saw the object to when it came to a complete static stop was approximately 10 seconds - which is far too long of a time for any fireball or space junk, which I've witnessed countless times.  I observed this object stationary for approximately 2 minutes in absolute amazement.   I had my iPhone in my hand and shot one still photo of the object prior to it coming to a complete stop and I shot video as well.  All you can see is a small dot due to iPhone camera not suited for shooting in dark.  It also showed up on the video.   While observing the object stationary for approximately 2 minutes I decided to take a chance a run in the house a grab a real camera, which only took about 2 minutes to retrieve, when I went back outside it was gone and I have no idea what happened to it.   I've been a dedicated amateur astronomer for over 40 years and I know the sky well. Also visible were commercial jetliners in the sky in the same general area of the sky.  This was neither a fireball or space junk - they don't slow down and come to a complete stop in the sk! y as this object did.  It was not the Moon, which was up and in a different part of the sky. It was not Jupiter, which was up and in a different part of the sky.  It was not Mars, which was up and in a different part of the sky.  It was not a satellite.  It was not the ISS.

I was a small boy, (age 9) living in Rural Western Pa.  It was late August, early September, because the wheat was still standing in the fields.  We were watching our new TV, when suddenly we had no power. When we went outside to see if there was a problem, my entire family, (4 of us) saw an impossibly huge (750 ft.? or more) object coming over the wheat fields toward our house and barn.  All the animals were very upset and made a lot of noise, then suddenly went silent.   The object came over the fields toward our house.  We could not see the object per se, but we saw glowing twinkling lights everywhere in a cigar shape, with many different colors.  In the areas not lit, we could not see the stars but also could not see the object.  A solid object appeared to be behind the lights. I remember being so impressed that something that big could move that silently and that slowly and not fall out of the sky.  It was moving so slowly and absolutely no sound.  It was no more than 100 ft. above us, just sort of floating there and moving slowly.  It seemed so strange that something so big could move silently and not disturb the standing wheat.  Wheat ready to be harvested will move in the slightest breeze. We could see our neighbors across the road had come outside and were watching and pointing at the object, (family of 3).  Another elderly neighbor (farmer) was plowing his field by the moon, and was out on his tractor.  His wife also saw it.  I believe at least 9 people witnessed the event. With no sound the object turned and went up route 288 toward Ellwood City, Pa., but stopped a 1/4 mile away from us and rose to the top of a large microwave tower located on Tower Road.  Workers on the tower had told us the tower was 365 ft. tall and had 4 very large bell shaped objects attached to the top of the tower. The object rose until it was even with the top of the tower and it seemed to dock with it.  At that point,all power on and around the tower dimmed and surged as object stayed joined to the tower approximately 5 minutes.  The colored lights were constantly changing and dimming and brightening on the object during this time as were all lights on the tower.  The object seemed to be drawing power from the tower. Very slowly,(almost stately) the object turned and started back down the highway toward our farm. It seemed to almost follow the road.  I remember my entire family was silent as it passed our farm and continued toward Fombell, Pa., and Zeleinople, Pa.  All with no sound at all. The objects lights gave some light all the way to the ground, not bright more like a glow.  It passed over (our neighbor) the farmer on his tractor with his tractor lights on but they too went off.  It was no more than 50 feet above him.  His tractor was surrounded by the soft glowing light.  He actually stood up on the tractor and waved his hat to it, with no response visible.  It then went back to the road and followed it toward the local drive in (Blue Sky Drive In Theater) about 1/4 mile away.  I never heard of anyone at the theater seeing it.  The screen faced the opposite direction. It then veered to the left and slowly went cross country, no sound at all, then suddenly sped to an impossible speed and disappeared into the night.  All of us were more than a bit shaken.  Immediately after all our electricity came back on as did our neighbors.  The lights at the drive in never dimmed. I was raised in a small close knit rural area, a very religious group of people.  Most people that saw this object, talked little about it, or dismissed it as ""God's Will"" that we saw it, and we should not question what happened, nor talk about it.  Till the day he died, my father refused to discuss the sighting. I am 68 years old with lots of later in life flight experience, (Navy Air Crew) and I never have seen anything remotely like this. I know it happened and remember it like it was yesterday. I still cannot explain what I saw. To the best of my knowledge there was never any further incidents of this sort, in our area. No one seemed eager to talk about it in our community.  After all these years I still cannot explain what I saw. To the best of my knowledge, there was no written report, or any sort report made to authorities.  Nothing appeared in any local papers that I can find.  I do not know what entity owned the microwave tower.  To the best of my knowledge the tower no longer exists.  No mention was ever made of damage to the tower.

That night was clear and the saucer low and moved soundlessly and slowly.  You could make out the outter diameter outline as perfectly circular.  Not blimp shaped.  It had smaller diameter of a dozen or so lights on underside.  I remember thinking at the time how ironic that a ufo would look exactly like the underside of jupiter two of lost in space but i suppose the tv model is modelled after actual sitings.  This was early 70's suburban area.  No hot air balloon and no testing site for aircraft.  Never saw anything like it since even on tv shows showing debunked cases.

My UFO Experience  This is what I saw in September of 1999.  (Exact date unknown)  I was working at the MCI building at Garden of the Gods Road and 30st Street in Colorado Springs.  It was about 8:45 to 9:00 am and I was driving my Datsun to work.  The sky was clear and blue, with no clouds to West and no noticeable wind.  I was driving West on Vindicator when I stopped in the left hand turn lane for the traffic light at Centennial Blvd.  The light had just turned red in front of me.  The red light for traffic coming from Vindicator lasts 40 seconds.  There were only a few cars on the road at that time.   As I sat there, I happened to look up toward the West.  I saw a round, soccer ball shaped object in the sky over the Mountain Shadows neighborhood.  I just stared at it for several seconds not believing what I was seeing.  I rubbed my eyes and blinked several times to make sure I was really seeing something in the sky.  The object was a light silvery color and was to the West-Southwest of where I was stopped.  The object sat there motionless for the entire time the traffic light was red and while I was watching it.  I did not see any windows or markings of any kind on this object.  My first thought was that it was a hot air balloon as the Labor Day Balloon Classic in Colorado Springs had just occurred.  But there was NO basket or harnesses hanging from or attached to this object. I tried to judge the height and distance while looking at it.  I was thinking that it was to the East of the ridge which runs on the West side of Mt. Shadows.  It looked like it was above the Western most point of the Flying W Ranch Road (which is what Vindicator turns into on the other side of Centennial).  This would be about one mile from where I was.  The height of this object seemed to be a little above the high points of the rock ridge in back of the Mt. Shadows area.  The high points in this area are a little over 7000 feet.  The intersection where I was at is a little over 6600 feet. While I was stopped at the red light watching this object, I noticed people going into and out of the Walgreen's store across the street.  Other cars were traveling on Centennial Blvd. in a normal manner.  I did not see anyone else (walking or in cars) viewing or appearing to view this object. When the light turned green for me I made my left hand turn and proceeded South down Centennial.  I don’t believe that there were any cars behind me at the traffic light.  I tried to keep the object in sight, but the object was to my right and there were houses and trees along the road I was traveling.  It took about 4 minutes before I arrived in the MCI parking lot.  (I later timed this trip at 4 minutes, 15 seconds and the distance was 2.3 miles)  When I got to the MCI parking lot, I looked back toward where I had seen the object, but the sky was empty.  I looked in all directions and there was nothing.  If this had been a hot air balloon it would have still been visible to me somewhere in the sky. I don’t know exactly what I saw that day, but it Was there and it was Real…. At the time of the sighting I was working as a software quality assurance tester at MCI.  My occupation for the previous 40 years was as a software developer and software tester for several large aerospace companies.  My positions at these companies required me to obtain security clearances.   I was 60 years old at the time of the sighting.  I remember the object I saw as being very vivid in detail.

This was at a little past 10:30PM  It is almost pitch black up here near Heavenly Ski Resort, so the constellations are perfectly bright and visible.  That’s when I noticed a few “stars” that aren’t part of the constellations I am familiar with.  And we noticed them slightly strobing and moving, and then the movements got wilder and we saw that these weren’t single lights, but clusters of lights.  They appeared triangle-ish, but we could make out as many as 9 stripes of light on two in particular.  While watching we saw several lights appear and disappear without getting a chance to make out their shapes. We also saw a plane pass overhead which gave us a comparison to know that these other objects were definitely not planes.  The primary object seemed to be getting closer to us while maintaining it’s relative position against the visible stars in the sky.  We couldn’t tell how far away it was, but it seemed like it was really only a mile or so above us.  At first it had seemed like it was celestial, but as the light formation changed shape into a more triangular pattern, it looked to be near the top of the atmosphere and lowering.  We have no fixed points by which to measure the distance, but we both had the same thought when the lights become more visible that perhaps we were looking at something that was a lot closer than we had initially thought. I used my camera phone to try and see if I could capture an image or video, but nothing in the sky was reading on my phone.  My wife has a professional Nikon D90 with a zoom lens and was also unable to see the objects through the lens finder.  We started to notice that quite a few of these objects were moving but enough to be planes.  They also seemed too high to be helicopters.  It’s frustrating because they were perfectly clear to our naked eyes, but capturing lights in the sky on our phones was not happening. When we came back to our rental, we looked online to see if there were any reports of UFO activity.  I went back outside to our balcony and we saw two more of these triangular objects in the sky flying in erratic patterns.  Mostly they hovered, then they went in straight-ish lines but then would sort-of bug out of pattern and continue.  The original object was still hovering in place were I originally spotted it as we went outside to check on it after I started typing this. An hour later it is now gone.

I’ve always been a skeptic, until this day.  We are not alone and I am now 100% certain about this.  A very unsettling event, here it goes;   12 May 2016 @ 2300 (Shanghai, China)    My wife and I went out in the evening to walk our dog and headed to a newly built public park about 2 km west of the HongQiao airport.  It was a great and comfortable evening with a clear night sky with temperature ranging between 20-22 degree Celsius. We actually walked quite a while during that evening and so needed to take a rest somewhere to cool down our dog.  So we headed to a bridge structure in the middle of the park. My wife sat on the bridge, the dog lied down resting, and I lied down flat on my back, looking up in the sky.  I personally like looking at stars during a clear night sky so whenever I get a chance, I take it and simply lie down flat on my back like this and look up; make wishes, say hi to my long-gone love ones, etc.  Weird behavior I agree but there you go – that’s me!   It’s at this moment that I’ve spotted this V-shaped (triangular) craft with 7 amber color lights on it.  The craft was heading north and was travelling way above supersonic speed.  Certainly faster than anything else I’ve seen flying before (e.g commercial or military fighter jets).  I’d say about twice faster if not more.  As it passed in a straight line right above us, and 3-4 secs later, you could only see the two lights from its tail and it instantly disappeared.  No sounds whatsoever, completely silent. When I first saw the craft, I instantly sat down and pointed the sky with my finger and shouted ‘ufo ufo ufo’ to my wife (it doesn’t take long to figure out what’s happening when you see such a distinctive shape in the sky, 1 second, literally).  All happened very fast however.  As I was pointing up and shouting ufo with a breathless little girl tone, my wife tought I was pulling a silly joke on her so it took her quite a while to finally look up.  Took her about 2 secs to realize I was NOT joking and then looked up.  She unfortunately missed it but reported seeing a strange formation of clouds where the craft passed – where I was pointing with my finger in the sky.  She also reported that the clouds she seen forming disappeared gradually but rapidly. V-shape craft description.  Color:  It all happened very fast, so I had literally 3-4 secs to process what I was seeing.  The craft was the same color of the sky on that evening – possibly reflecting off the yellow’ish ground lighting of the Hongqiao district.  It was certainly not transparent as I could see its very distinctive v-shape.  I was slightly grayer than the background night scene. Size:  Hard for me to judge its size with no reference nearby.  The only thing that was up there were stars and those aren’t much of a reference for sizing.  I can’t even say for sure what altitude this thing was flying at.  I could see some of the details clearly so it had to be more or less 2000meter above us.  Like I said, all happened very fast so this part is rather missing.  From my angle, and judging from other commercial aircrafts flying during that same evening, it was certainly 3 to 4 times bigger than the size of a regular 747 jet plane. 7 lights: 7 or 9 lights, I am not 100% sure.  Certainly had one on its nose and one on each side of its tail with 2 (or 3) on the each side of the craft itself.  Those were clearly solid amber color now that I am 100% sure.  Amber as between yellow and red.  Not flashing, not pulsing, just plain simple amber dots evenly distributed around it. Travelling Speed: Faster than anything else I’ve seen before.  Much slower than a shooting star but much faster than a fighter jet flying at sub/supersonic speed.  I’d say twice faster than a military jet and yes, I’ve seen quite a few fighter jets shows during my younger years so I can make this judgement quite easily. And that’s it really.  That’s all I have really.  Like I said it all happened quite fast but I’ve seen just enough to get me to sweat quite a lot, I was nervous, trying to pull jokes at the same time (come and get me I’ve shouted on that bridge lolll), I was not panicking but certainly wasn’t well.  It really hit me when I got home and pulled up google image (keyword “triangular shape ufo”).  Many of the pictures from other ppl who witness similar flying objects really hit hard on me.  Didn’t like the feeling at-all.  We are NOT ALONE :/   Ps.  We stayed on-site a few minutes after the sighting hoping to see a reaction from the Chinese military.  Nothing happened.  Commercial flights were doing their thing roaming the sky as usual, etc.  No jets scrambling, nothing at all.  Very strange.  Either the Chinese are used to these visits, as-in they happen daily, or their radars simply weren’t aware of the craft.  One thing for sure, there was many commercial jets flying on that evening, at the same time, so someone, somewhere must have seen it as clear as I did. Can’t wait to hear.",2016-05-20T00:00:00,,

Anyway it was moving very slow and you could really only even make it out, at first, because of the perimeter lighting.  I am no aeronautical expert by any means but it was certainly lower than the normal craft we see flying around here (but I don't know what that elevation is...) I am going to guess that it was at around 8 to 10k feet.  This just happened so I am a little excited, I apologize if I am skipping around.

Shasta City. I live in Mt. Shasta, California.  I am about 60 miles from the Oregon border.   About two weeks ago, I saw a cigar or tube shaped craft flying northward, and my eyes and my daughter followed it for about 5, or so, minutes duration, until out of sight over the Mountain. I saw the same kind of craft last year that was somewhat higher in the sky this this latest one.  Oddly enough, they both took the same flight path though a year apart. South to the North and out of sight.  Both days I/we saw this, it was a clear blue sky with the sun behind us.  We used binoculars on the first one, from last year and I will attached a picture of that one. I can't embed the picture with this report as the computer says I'm missing some DLL file.  I will send it separately using my name and today's date. This year’s sighting was of the same type of craft, same flight route. Low enough to get over the 14,000 foot mountain and not much  more.  At no time during either sighting, there were no wings visible during the whole sighting, which literally was watched from the south to the north.  No flashing lights on either sighting.  No noise was heard. It wasn’t flying that fast. No tail rudder, no wings, no exhaust, no noise, no windows, no writing on it, no flashing lights or a hint of wings in the sun at any time produced a sight other than a tube or cigar shaped flying craft. It should be noted that both of these sightings were to the east side of the regular planes normal N/S flight routes.  I would think that during either of these sightings, there must have been regular planes that saw it, being in the regular N/S flight area. So to recap last year and this year I , and others saw this tube/cigar craft flying N/S air routes, with the object this year was higher than the 2nd one. I also have seen this same type of craft fairly up close and personal when I was when I was 6.  It should be noted that this first sighting was over the old drive in movie theater, and was HANGING STATIONARY with a tilt like this:  /.  I’d guess by the size of the trees now, that it was no more than 2 to 3 hundred feet in the air, not moving or drifting, again no sound, windows, writing or any burnt marks (as my dad showed me a paragraph it made in the Sacramento Bee, which claimed it was space junk falling to earth)  That was absolutely not the case, even though it was about 1966 at that time, I had watched many rockets lift off as we enjoyed watching together.  So I had an idea of what a regular rocket vs plane looked like at that time. I noticed many cars pulling off the road to watch this thing hanging the air at a such a low altitude, and not falling, flying, or moving at all.  This was at the junction of HWY 89 where it enters I-5.  Lots of cars pulled off the road to wat! ch.  It actually got a bit boring to me as a kid, it wasn’t doing anything but hanging there and we finally left. So I told my Dad about it.  After a few days, he showed me a newspaper report on the sighting which reported it as falling space junk.... I said no Daddy, that’s not right.  It wasn’t falling and there were no words on it, it was silver, not white, and no burn marks on it.  My mother and younger sister were with me.  My sister does not remember it. When I made the report of this first sighting, there was only 1 pilot who had also made a report of seeing this tube/cigar, in the air while he was flying in the area. Attached is the picture of the one I saw last summer.  It is just like the one from a few weeks ago, same S to N flight, only higher than the one a few weeks ago. Thanks you for listening to my story.",2016-04-22T00:00:00,41.3181,-122.3202

I ignored it for a while and then decided to open the window and see what sort of noise it was, thinking maybe it was a compressor or generator.  The noise did not match any description that could have been made by either a compressor or generator.  It did not sound like a helicopter. I would definitely say jet engine. I decided to go downstairs and open the side door.  When I looked out I saw a large craft in the sky above our road, a little bit higher than our tallest tree in our front garden.  It was flat underneath and had blinking red and white lights.  The craft was completely motionless and did not move. It must have been there for at least half an hour.  I just stood and stared at it. The other members of my family also saw it. I called 911 and told them that there was an unusual craft in the sky and I was told it's probably a helicopter out looking for a missing person.  Firstly, there was no searchlight on the craft, and even if they were using infra-red there was no circular movement suggesting the craft was looking for anything.  Within one minute of hanging up, the craft slowly turned round and moved in the opposite direction.  The noise it made was definitely not that of a helicopter, this was a continuous roaring sound, like a jet engine, and similar to a report filed for Mt. Holly in 2013.  It was very dark so I could not see the outline of the craft but it looked flat underneath.

It was a clear night with no clouds.  It was a calm, windless night and there was no detectable sound from the lights passing overhead.  There were no associated blinking or colored lights as on an aircraft. The lights were brighter and more focused than stars, and were flying at an altitude far lower than high planes yet higher than any low planes.  The lights moved straight ahead with no side to side movement, and traveled too fast to be a high altitude plane or a satellite, but slower than a low altitude plane. The lights were in a straight line formation too far apart to be just a single plane.  Although no associated shape was detected, it seemed as if the lights were positioned with one at the front and one at the back. What was so startling and attention-getting was that the direction of travel was entirely not in keeping with the normal flight paths of either ELP or Biggs Army Airfield, nor of the high altitude commercial flight paths crossing El Paso.  The witness is a nightly observer of the constellations and the local commercial and Army flight paths across Northeast El Paso.",2016-04-15T00:00:00,31.7923281835206,-106.3748488764045

So at this time of year in Eden, it's still light outside, but the sun has gone under the mountains, so it's brightest around the rims of the mountains and fades darker as it gets further from the sun.  Basically dusk.  This type of lighting makes it very easy to see airplanes that typically fly over Ogden, because of the nearby SLC International Airport. I had just walked upstairs and sat on my bed, and I have a direct view of the mountains separating Ogden and Eden (Eden being where I was.)  There was a plane flying right over the North Ogden Divide, so I looked up from my laptop for a second to look at it for a moment. It was then that I noticed a strange formation of lights to the right of the plane. There were 5 lights, each one about a half of the size of the plane.  They were in a slightly curved formation.  Three of them were in a straight line, and there were two slightly lower than the others on either side of the three. It was so large I feel like it spanned about a mile, because it hovered over an entire mountain peak.  Each dot was completely unmoving.  The color of each dot was indescribable, and I'd never seen the color before.  At a glance it was white with a reddish hue, but then it was also blue or purple if you looked again.  It was as if it was all of those colors at once. Within a minute of me spotting it, it started disappearing one light by one, before it was gone completely. I'm not sure if it was a single craft or 5, because it was only seen as multiple lights. It was very bold and I noticed it the moment I looked up. It was just so bright and bold that I was surprised I wasn’t getting fearful texts from my friends and news stories breaking out everywhere.",2016-04-15T00:00:00,41.22037658119658,-112.00587333333334

Early this morning, I got up and went out on my back deck to enjoy the beautiful morning weather and night sounds.  It was still dark and the sky was clear.  I sat down for about 2 minutes, then looked up at the stars.  I don't know the constellations, but I could clearly see several points of light without any obstructions.  Directly in front of me (facing northwest),  I could see a group of three stars immediately flanked by two other lights to my right.  At first, the two lights were stationary so I didn't really think about them.  But soon they both started to slowly move from their stationary position to my left.  I thought it odd that satellites would be still and then move in apparent unison.  With my right arm fully extended, I estimate they were a hand width apart.  Very high up but still very clearly visible.  I watched them move slowly in unison, then stop in unison, then resume moving in unison in the same direction.  They followed their motion f! or approximately a five count, then the lead light simply went out, while the second light continued to move in the same direction.  When the second light reached the point where the first light went out, it too went out.  No clouds, no obstructions at all.  I'm an avid UFO person so naturally I interpreted this as a possible sighting and said out loud ""why do you always blink out when I see you?  How do you know I'm looking at you?""  I thought this might illicit some kind of response, but they didn't reappear.  I've been fooled by birds before, but these lights were too bright and way to high to be birds.  I ruled out airplanes because they went from stationary to moving and I didn't hear any jet-related sounds like normal when a high flying jet passes over.  Helicopters don't go that high, or I'm not sure why they would, and again no noise.  Perhaps some kind of experimental craft that can go stationary, then move with no noise.  Just seems odd to me.  I've seen! these lights before and always just as I notice them, they bl! ink out. This pattern of seeing them, then they disappear suggests to me whoever they are, they know I'm watching them.  It's happened too many times to be coincidental.",2016-04-29T00:00:00,39.100835139760406,-94.56447929264118

At approximately 2:45 A.M. I decided to go for a late night walk on a nature trail near Walnut Creek in Nortwest Austin.  I stepped outside my front door and noticed an acrid smell, which I would describe as being like burning copper wires.  I could smell it for several yards until I got near to the trail, where the only thing I could smell was soggy Juniper and Live Oak bark. While heading back home after a walk up the trail, I noticed something in my peripheral vision in tne sky, at 3:32 AM.  I looked at it for 5-8 seconds. It was a very long, thin, and dimly-lit dark object with roughly 7 distinctly spherical lights on it.  I watched it fly across the sky and out of view (trees obscured my vision).  It appeared to be dropping lower as it zipped across the sky. I have no training in how to discern the size and distance of objects that are far away, but my intuition tells me it was roughly 1200 feet in the air, nearly a half mile away, and maybe 400 feet long. I must emphasize that this object was very dimly lit and that it would have been very difficult to see it the sky wasn't cloudless, and the moon as bright as it is tonight.  It was a very bright night.  The lights on this object were like weak LED lights. The object was moving from South to North at around 300-400mph over Walnut Creek Metropolitan Park and headed toward 1-35.  I was located near the St David's Medical Center building on the railroad tracks. I am 100% certain this was not a plane because it made no noise at all. The moment I saw the object I got an ominous sensation and the hair on my head and body stood up.  After I lost sight of it I immediately ran out of the trail and on to Park Bend Dr, and sprinted home. I would describe this object as being more like a drinking straw than a cigar.",2016-04-29T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

It was cloudy and I couldn’t spot the moon, but the moon was out because it is on full moon phase.  Odd enough I didn’t worry too much.  About ½ a mile, I reach the shop, buy a cigar, and I leave.   The first thing I see in the sky is Spica, the brightest star in the constellations. Nothing new. I then look to the right and I see the orange moon, looking as if it were an eye that were half closed.  I begin to ramble with myself about the moon, I thought, “It decides to show itself, when it wants to.”   As I continue to walk home the moon unveils itself more.  It just captures my attention!  Closer to home the moon is out of view, but I’m still keeping my eye out for it.   I get into the complex, I see the moon, it’s beginning to look like somebody is wiping their forehead.  I say to myself, “Show me something tonight.”  The moon now looks like a raccoon face or a ninja turtle, a mask over the eyes.  I am reaching home stretch, I then look up and see a red light in the sky, it flashes blue and white.  I think it’s a plane, then I quickly change my mind and noticed it wasn’t moving.

This sighting was made during the ""Contact in the Desert"" event, held 3-6 June 2016 at the Joshua Tree Retreat Center (JTRC) in Joshua Tree, CA.  Spanning an approximately 10-minute period beginning at about 10:30 PM, we (my wife and I) observed a total of seven (7) continuously-luminous flying objects approached JTRC at very high speed over the Western horizon (direction of Yucca Valley).   The objects arrived singly, one after the other, and in pairs at irregular intervals over the approximate 10-minute observation period.  None of the objects exhibited standard red, green or white blinking aircraft navigation lights.   Each object flew exceedingly smoothly, silently and rapidly towards the East and then each turned smoothly toward the North/Northeast when they arrived directly North of the JTRC grounds. The distance to the flying craft was estimated to be less than two miles, but could have been as little as one mile away at their closest approach to t! he JTRC.  Throughout their approach from the West and eventual disappearance to the North, the objects emitted a continuous pale bluish/green to soft amber light.  The craft were sufficiently bright and large to be very easily observed without the assistance of night-vision optics or binoculars.  At irregular intervals during their flight trajectories, each craft displayed bright flashes of an iridescent green glow.  The glowing flashes did not appear to emanate from a fixed point on the craft, but rather seemed to be diffuse in nature and sweep over the craft in an uneven manner.  The flash duration was about 1 second or less.  As mentioned above, the craft were fairly close (estimated 1-2 miles) and when the green flashes occurred, it was just possible to make out some kind of hull structure to the craft, i.e., the craft did not appear as sharp points of light or amorphous balls of light.  When the craft were targeted by one or more hand-held lasers, they sometimes flashed green.  But they also flashed a green glow at times when they were n! ot illum inated by lasers.  From its first appearance on the western horizon, each object took about 30 seconds (or possibly less) to complete its west-to-east flyby past the JTRC, perform the sweeping northerly turn, and subsequently gradually disappear over the northern horizon.   The estimated distance of the objects when they first appeared over the western horizon was 5 miles.  Similarly, the estimated distance to the point of disappearance in the north was also 5 miles, resulting in a total (visible) flight trajectory of 10 miles.  Assuming this distance was traveled in 30 seconds or less, the minimum speed of the objects may be estimated at about 1200 miles per hour.  Importantly, no sound of any kind was detected as the objects flew past, which would be consistent with an unconventional (i.e., non-jet engine) type of propulsion system.",2016-06-10T00:00:00,34.1578,-116.2732

The occurrence was witnessed by, and is conveyed by sworn testimony equivalent to, and with all judicial authority, as stated under oath by the signed witness, Mr. X.  There are several items preceding File #00701, including and limited to; one drawing of Object ABC articulated by Mr. X in the presence of a close kin.  After explanation to kin about Object ABC, Mr. X was asked by kin if he could draw, or recite details of Object ABC.  Mr. X did articulate the main features of Object ABC on an old small paper bag.  That image was then destroyed.  There is a second document articulated by Mr. X detailing the occurrence encountering Object ABC. As Mr. X was exiting the freeway into Fresno, California, using GPS from his phone as he navigated to his destination.  The GPS on the phone he was using began giving false readings, and performing out of its normal functional character.  Mr. X attempted to adjust the GPS as he drove on the off-ramp from Freeway 99 into Modesto, CA.  About 50 to 100 feet from completing the exit ramp, Mr. X saw a strange thing seemingly hovering off to the left of the exit over-pass.  As he began to focus on the object, the object seemed to flip, or slip, or shape-shift, landing in the middle of the road, on top of the over pass, directly in front of Mr. X’s vehicle.  He stopped the vehicle before running into the object. Mr. X stopped the vehicle, and tried to comprehend the sight of the huge craft, and make sense of what he was seeing.  He tried to wake his children, and co-passenger.  One 16-year old son sitting in the front passenger seat, one 14-year old son sitting in the rear passenger seat on the left side, and one female 18-year old female passenger sitting behind the driver’s seat.  All passengers were asleep at the time of the sighting.  Mr. X tried to wake everyone up, and even shook his son sitting next to him.  Mr. X began to speak aloud thinking that someone may be awake and listening, “what is it?  Look at this you guys.  What do I do?  I don’t understand.  What am I supposed to do?”  He asked.  When no one responded, he tried once again to wake his son, then decided to do something he thought might be stupid.  He thought that he couldn’t leave this moment without being absolutely sure that what he was seeing was real, and with no obstruction between his own eyes and the stran! ge object.  (He didn’t want to wonder in the future, because he knew he was seeing something that he never had seen before.)  He stepped out the vehicle with one leg, and stared at the huge object, with one hand on the door as he stood straight up.  He looked at the object for about what seemed to be 7 to 11 seconds, only looking into the vehicle for a split second at his passengers, and asking if they could wake up, then looking back at the object.  Just then a vehicle horn honked and when he looked back, he noticed there were two vehicles stopped behind him, and a third pulled off to the right.  The Third car was the vehicle that was honking.  At first, Mr. X thought that they were honking at him to get back in his vehicle before the strange craft did something to hurt him. (like he was crazy for standing out in front of the craft like that, so close.) Mr. X looked again at the craft as he got back into his vehicle, and as he clasped his seat belt, the huge craft just vanished in the plume of faint smoke or gasses, which quickly dissipated.  The Thing that Mr. X is calling smoke, or gassed, can a! lso be called a mist, and even visible fumes, or a cloud of something.  This action of the gasses had a visual effect something akin to a visible fume, without a smell, and was all around the craft. Mr. X then began to proceed the remaining 15 yards, or less on the off-ramp to the light.  He continued to look for the object, and look at his GPS to find his way.  The GPS still did not give correct magnetic north, flipping and changing routes sporadically.  He drove from memory, until calling his friend that he was going to visit, and having the friend guide him to his friend’s home. Mr. X pulled into his friend’s driveway in about 8 minutes after that.  As soon as Mr. X passengers began to awake, he began talking about the Strange Craft.  The first thing he said to his friend after saying a brief “Hi.” Was “I just saw an Alien Space Craft”.  The friend just thought he was joking, but he wasn’t joking at all, and as Mr. X began to walk, he lost control of his legs, and became weak.  The friend had to hold Mr. X up and assist him in regaining balance.  The passengers, Mr. X, and the friend all entered the home, and went out back to sit in a rest area of the home for a moment. The Craft was huge, Brownish-Gold, with tints of Green, Red, and Lots of Black.  The texture was Hexed, or X / cross hatched, with some kind of braces running vertical along either side curving with the surface of the craft from top to bottom.  The braces were of the same color, and were about three and a half lanes apart, on either side from the center where I was.  The craft was about 50 to 60 feet high, and obscured at the top and sides with the strange black cloud, or fumes.  At the bottom of the craft, about a foot and a half off the ground was pitch black, where the outline of the craft could be seen as it hovered close to the road.  The craft did block the view of anything behind it, and the street under it.  The craft made no sound, and had no smell.  Just an eerie silence.  Mr. X did get out of the vehicle, and look at the craft with his own eyes, and he did have glasses on so he could see the craft very clearly. The craft did appear from hovering off to the left of the freeway, and did move very quickly (impossibly quick), and stopped on a dead stop in the center of the roadway.  The craft did vanish, with the gas or smoke leaving a few seconds after the craft vanished.  The roadway became clear and lit, and the yellow center, and white lane lines became visible all the way across the overpass, where Mr. X was to drive. This is the sworn testimony, and statement of Mr. X, who is identified yet requests to remain anonymous for as long as possible.  The events described within this report are true and accurate to the best of my recollection, and in in no way fabricated, or made-up.  I swear to what I saw, and I am MR. X.  I have no understanding for what I saw, and I know that the nature, and actions of this strange craft was not of anything that I have seen on Earth. I hope this report helps, as I was asked to document the events of the evening on which I saw this Strange Unidentified Craft.

Standing behind my garage near my neighbor's back yard facing northwest.  Adjusting phone camera settings, when coincidently look up to a large figure moving less than 10mph above my neighbor's back yard moving in a straight path northwest.  Looking up at the object, I estimate it to have been between 50 and 60 feet high as it was just above the trees in my neighbor's yard and took a sharp right turn over my yard, to where the garage I stood behind blocked my vision.  I observed this object  for only about 7 seconds.   These were my observations:   1. Boomerang Structure with 50-60 foot wingspan,  2.  Less than 10 feet tall,   4. Surface color(s): Deep Black Borders Surrounding The Various Components of its underside,   3. Small White Rectangles Aligned Closest to the Sharp, Anterior Edge of the craft (7 on each side),   4. ""Components"" or intricate plates comprising the underside, most of which had edges parralel to the adjac! ent edges of the craft itself,   5.  Simpler Patterns alongside edges of the craft, and no middle, dividing borderline,  6.  All observed edges but the anterior edge were curved/smooth,  7.  Craft gets thicker getting nearer to the center. 5-10 minutes later:  An object less less than 500 feet away and 100-150 feet high, moving in a straight path at around 70mph Southwest. A Yellow ""Mist"" forming an arrowhead with its anterior corners separated.  Object was not thick and nearly flat, with a wingspan of around 80 feet.  The separated corners merged into the middle part of the craft after about 4 seconds of observing it to then zoom into the distance and out of sight. During this observation I stood in the driveway of my backyard. 10-20 minutes later:  Standing in front of my house on the sidewalk this time, moving lights catch my eye coming from the East and Moving West about 500 feet high descending to less than 100 feet in altitude after moving about 1000 feet in a perfectly straight path. These were my observations:  Pure White Circles And Ovals Forming a capital letter T, 1. The front, horizontally aligned ovals, both at each end slightly larger than the ovals in the middle(4 total),  2. The ""tail"", perfect, pure white circles level with one another and most of which were aligned in the center but never symmetrically.  The ""tail"" had a difference in elevation between the front part of about 30 feet, 3. The circles forming the ""tail"": Flat with a diameter of about 15 feet,  4. All "" T-shaped"" formations moved between 70-90 mph in a straight path East to West, 5. At least 4 were witnessed, 3 of which I can make accurate depictions of and all of which appeared betw! een intervals of 10-20 minutes. Another Yellow ""Mist"" but this time shaped almost as an equilateral triangle moved under the first ""T-Shape"" formation I witnessed as it passed just above me, with each side being 40-50 feet long. This object moved Southeast to Northwest at about 30mph in a straight path about 70 feet high. Again, this ""Mist"" was flat and seemed transparent because of that, making it somewhat faint, but nonetheless glowing. Observed for only about 5 seconds.  Last hour or so of this 3 hour event: Large Boomerang Formations of Perfect, Pure White Circles began to appear moving East to West but taking very wide left turns Southwest and Moving at speeds of at least 100mph just above the houses North of my position. From all formations observed but one, the circles never formed symmetrical Shapes. Some were triangular and some were very wide-angled boomerang formations. All but one took the same path as the rest of these light formations. The one I am referring to is the only symmetrrical light formation I witnessed and the closest object I observed that night: I noticed a line of circular lights approaching me from down the street but moving above the houses, and as it approached I noticed it was rotating slowly counter-clockwise as a whole and as soon as it did this, 3 of these flat white circles aligned themselves individually into the right side of the formation but we're already near the rest when I observed this. As it passed o! ver me and my house, it was in an almost parralel to the street suggesting that this maneuver was only made to avoid the tree in my front yard which is 50-60 feet tall. This formation was level with the ground until it was completely aligned and symmetrical to then tilt leftward at 40°-60° and take a wide left turn Southwest and gain significant speed(100+mph). I chased after several of these formations. At least 5 witnessed and 4 of which I can accurately depict. Even from close proximity, no noise could be heard and no temperature changes felt nor structures Observed surrounding these lights. These circular light were about 10-15 feet in diameter and the formed formation of at least 100 feet wide. When in a triangular formation, the lights were farther from each other than when formed in a boomerang formation. These lights were visible on both sides, conforming that no visible structures surrounded them. I cannot say the same for the ""letter T"" formations as I w! as not able to observe them from close enough proximity to dis! tinguish this.  Between these last sightings, a unique UFO in comparison to the rest: A blue light bordering the bottom of an invisible craft rotating counter -clockwise. From the center, 3 lines extending and protruding out each corner. This object was about 1000 feet away from my position and about 100 feet high moving East to West at speeds of at least 100 mph. Each side being 50-80 feet long.",2016-05-06T00:00:00,44.3278,-93.2776

It had no wings or propeller with no noise coming from it at all.  When it reached a valley far ahead it made about 180 degree turn back towards me and landed in the valley.  But when it was doing that it's color and shape changed into a medium gray rectangle.  I was scared on account of two reasons, trespassing on RR property and by the craft itself. But 2 days later I walked down the railroad track to the valley.  But the property was fenced and I could not get a total view of the valley and I did not want to get into trouble for trespassing while looking for imprints in any soft soil.  At first in the back of my mind I thought that it was a drone but drones have wings of some sort, propellers and they make noise when they are that close.

As I was outside I noticed a rectangular shape in the western sky, moving slowly and quite low.  It did not have the usual red/green lights on wing tips—it had no visible wing tips.  What it did have is two rows of lights which reminded me at first of a domino. However, the front two lights were white, blinking (not appear to be strobe) and the others were various jewel toned colors of blue, green, yellow, red and possibly orange.  The object was about a mile and half downrange 25 degree and under 2000', closer to 1300-1500', heading WNW (as if flying to Eglin AFB). As I tried to determine if it had 8 or 10 lights, disregarding the colors I saw and trying to count (there were no “middle dots” of lights like on a domino) another rectangular craft appeared, about a mile 20 degree NNW of me at the time, at maybe 1000'.  It, too, had  lights but all were white and it only had 8.  Then I knew the first one had 10 lights.  The second craft went dark, which is why I didn't notice it at first. I tried to take photographs with iPhone which only showed a non-round shape and no colors.  I went into the house for my Canon T3i but the battery was dead.  I returned to the back yard to finish viewing the object(s).  The second rectangle became visible once more and then dark again and I did not see it again.  It had lights on less than 30 seconds both times. There was limited moonlight (moving from 1st quarter to full) , low groups of clouds moving in and heavy variable winds (a front clashing with sea breezes?) The Sun Life stadium is just east southeast, as is Miami International, slightly farther and southeast and Ft. Lauderdale AP north, with North Perry (small ap) 4 miles due east.  Plenty of air traffic since new runway opened MIA 2 years ago. At first thought was a blimp, but saw no shape and am not aware of any lighting configuration.  There were no events at the stadium that I am aware of but a music festival in Ft Lauderdale.  Since the craft were moving slowly I did at first think blimp, but have never seen 2 blimps in the air at the same time in over 60 years.  Plus, the craft were flying too fast for blimps in the heavy winds but too slowly for jets. I then thought of helicopters flying some kind of lighted panels, but there was not enough sound (was there any?) of engines tugging anything in the wind.  Helicopters fly overhead all the time. At one brief moment the clouds allowed the moonlight to reflect more on the clouds and I thought I saw a giant circular shape above (as if attached to) the 10 lighted rectangle...but it was so brief it could have been my imagination.  It was only grey and would make the craft 3x  in diameter of the width of the light “panel”. I've viewed the stealth bomber  flying at about 300' overhead near HAFB before US was admitted we had it...viewing/securing?  The downrange flight of a shuttle launch at night so I wasn't spooked but couldn't figure these out.  Called my aviation brother immediately 23:04 and discussed for an hour.  He had no clue.  Posted on @FAANews inquiry. Today, there's heavy air traffic and I was using it and photographs online to help in computing distance and altitude as best I could (difficult since I do not know what I was viewing and had no size references) when I found this site.",2016-05-06T00:00:00,,

The date of occurrences are between April 19-24.  I saw these objects while visiting my family in Terre Haute, IN. I’m a smoker and a night owl and had to go outside to smoke.  As I watched the night sky, usually from 11pm to 3am, I would notice one object that frequented the northeastern sky.   Another appeared on occasion southwest of it.  A third appeared in between the two on only two nights.  One night, I saw two flying across the sky as if together; however, one was at a higher altitude than the other.  At the time, I wondered why two planes would have been allowed to fly so closely together.  Turns out, they were not planes. The objects were very high in the sky and appeared to be bright stars.  All three had a steady white light.  I also saw the haphazard flashing of a green light, and sometimes a red one pulsating from each.  The objects were so high in the sky that I couldn’t make out a definite shape; however, the pulsating colored lights may have been underneath the objects as if suspended from helicopter skids.  It is possible that the objects were triangular but that is only speculation. The northeastern-most seemed to be the most active with its flight path.  All three objects seemed to hover most of the time but sometimes would move ahead, execute a tight circle, then move forward again.  They all stayed in their designated areas.  Their actions were similar to a remote control toy being repeatedly moved then stopped.  Sometimes, when executing a circle, a turn, a sideways maneuver or acceleration, bursts of firefly-looking exhaust emitted from them. . I believe that Terre Haute is in the flight path of some planes leaving Indianapolis International Airport.  On more than one occasion, I was able to compare the planes’ pulsating lights and chemtrails of jets to the UFO’s.  The jets were probably close to their highest altitude but were not nearly as high as the UFO’s. I also compared the objects to the stars.  The objects were at a much lower altitude than the stars but much too high to be planes or helicopters. The only background was the night sky.  The objects were only visible at night.  They were not visible when overcast.  They did not emit any sound.",2016-05-06T00:00:00,39.429084183673474,-87.3756556122449

A little before 10pm, in North Haven, CT, my children and I were driving home when we spotted three very bright images, resembling stars, in the shape of a triangle.  We could tell they weren't stars because they were so much lower and brighter than anything we've ever seen.  We drove approximately 2-3 miles before stopping to observe. There were numerous helicopters in the sky.  The helicopters were not using much light, if any at all, so they were difficult to detect, but there were approximately 20 of them.  We videotaped the entire time but mainly focused on these three bright lights and these helicopters because we weren't sure what was happening.   Just before the three bright lights disappeared, my son thought he saw a lightning because he said everything turned white for a split second.  I did not notice this, however, in the video just as my son was saying that he thought he saw lightning, our video camera went white and our sound got knocked out.  At this point you can tell we are still videotaping the sky because the stream of tape shows that it's black, but yet when you watch the video, it's pure white with no sound. Once we arrived home, still unsure about what was going on, we quickly watched the videos.  We noticed in the videos that there were many objects that we had not seen before.  It seems like every time we watch the videos we would see more incredible things.  At this point, we realized that we were surrounded by UFOs. In the videos and I don't like can you see numerous floating objects, you can also see what appears to be the bottom of a very large ship hovering just above us. This was the most incredible thing I have ever witnessed and I am happy to share videos and pictures. I will attach a link to a video here. In the first few seconds if you look to the right near the telephone pole you will see two blue lights.  Next if you look at the highest street light on the screen, you will notice that there objects moving around the light.   Additionally if you look into the black sky right above that same light, you can see what resembles a metallic (almost octagon shape) moving fairly slowly.  I believe this is the bottom of the ship.

Me and my friend were standing on my back porch, cooking steaks and enjoying the evening.  It was a very clear and mild night by West Texas standards.   Rising out of the east was a beautiful almost clay red moon that, in my estimation, illuminated at 97 percent visible.  My friend in awe of the natural beauty of the moon's presence in the night sky proceeded to document on his cell phone camera. The event that immediately followed was recorded on his camera. With my back to him and tending the grill, he became vocally excited about something he was witnessing in the eastern night sky as he recorded on his phone camera.  He exclaimed to me that he had just had visual on something that was amazing and though he may have captured the event on camera.  Seconds later, I walked up behind him and viewed his phone screen over his shoulder.  What he had recorded amazed me. This is what I witnessed immediately after he had stopped recording the documented footage.  To the east in a medium low horizon was the moon with what appeared at first as a bright star on a lower plane on the right side (southern side from viewed position).  Watching this, my attention became enhanced as this star seemed to be drifting horizontally in the direction of the moon.  At this point what appeared to be a smaller star ejected out of the larger original star and moved rapidly across the lower horizontal plane of the moon. The fast moving light moved across the field of view of the camera and disappeared.  After viewing again we noticed a faint flashing light on the north side of the moon in which the fast moving object appeared to be heading in the direction of.  The lights came close to each other but the traveler passed by the faint object’s lower side. I immediately viewed the event he captured on his cell phone and experienced his excitement as it occurred in real time.  The phone these images were captured on was a Motorola E Android 4.4.4 .  Also, the video is rotated 90 degrees counter clockwise after downloaded.  Meaning the movement of objects actually is from right to left horizontally or from south to north from our view point. Afterwards he noticed his cell phone camera was displaying some anomalous time date information on his phone settings.  He said he had never experienced that before with this phone. Video was forwarded in email to: director@ufocenter.com   Please call if there was any problems receiving the recording",2016-04-01T00:00:00,,

My time was well spent as she is a lovely young lady going to college now.

I love going out in the desert looking for geodes and thunder eggs; the grand kids enjoy going also.  So we all got in the Rhino and we were off to the hill where we’ve had good luck in finding rocks, etc.  It is just off Hwy 14 between Mojave and Rosamond, CA, close to Edwards AFB. We have a picture my husband took on his phone while we were on the hill where you can clearly see a UFO when the picture is enlarged.  We did not see anything unusual at the time.  We had been looking up at a B2 bomber flying over that in its self was amazing to watch.  I went off with the kids looking for rocks and my husband stayed at the Rhino.  He told me to look at all the contrails in the sky then he said there was an airliner flying over putting out more contrails behind it. My husband's account of the time we were on the hill:  Was at the top of a hill looking for geo rocks when a B2 Bomber jet flew over at around 2,000 feet above us.

We had followed an old logging trail with multiple switch backs to an elevation that was probably 400 feet above the valley floor.  We were camping alongside a cliff in my 1970 VW Type III wagon. We had grilled dinner on a hibachi and sat by a small camp fire until approximately 23:00 hrs.  We then turned in for the night inside the wagon with the hatch door up and side windows open as it was fairly warm that night. At approximately 02:30 hours on the next morning, I woke up and noticed bright white flashing lights that were coming from the direction of the valley below as the light was illuminating the headliner of the car.  There was sufficient light to see the (still working) VDO clock on the dash to verify the time. I thought, 'This is odd that lightning is coming from the valley below' and ""I can't move'. Then at a later time that I cannot determine, I woke up and heard a faint buzzing noise, complete pitch black darkness, the sense that someone or something was at the rear of the car, I was in a perilous situation, I was moving slowly out of the back of the car (I remember a momentary glimpse of the car headliner and hatch door hinges which should have been located near my feet), and the feeling that I was being rotated facedown as I was moving feet first out of the rear of the car. My fiance and I woke up feeling like we had bad hang overs and we were pretty woozy like we would have felt after anesthesia. We were both very hungry and felt like we hadn't eaten in a long time so we took off for town to find a restaurant.  When we went into the restaurant I headed for the restroom to throw cold water in my face and wash up.  Then I noticed that my beard looked like it was 2-3 days old and I had shaved the morning before. We bought a newspaper before eating and noticed that it was dated two days after we had camped in the forest. We didn't talk much about it for several days as we were in a kind of daze....

I was visiting friends near Naples, FL, and due to some relationship problems between the couple I was visiting, I felt it best to leave about 10 hours earlier than planned so they could work out their problems.  I quickly packed my things, said good bye, and headed for Alligator Alley - straight shot through south Florida - right over to I-95 outside Ft. Lauderdale and head back to Brevard County.   About forty minutes into my trip across AA, I started thinking about how incredibly dark and peaceful the everglades were - and noisy - no AC in my $1200 car so I heard what I presumed were big bull frogs serenading the crickets and locusts.  I thought it might be better to not think about the late night noises and figured some tunes would be good.   Well the only station I could get was WABC in New York. how does that happen in southwest Florida in 1978?  Then the next three songs that entered my head were the next songs played by the DJ....hmmmm interesting - then I started thinking about safety again and thought oh I have plenty of gas... no worries as I simultaneously recalled pulling my wallet on the back of Teri's toilet while I dug my brush out of my purse and left my wallet lay on the toilet when I left.  What a bad time to think remember that but not to worry - I always keep mat money for emergencies.  Doesn't everyone keep 10-20 bucks under the car mat just  in case... so I was still ok... and then I thought the unthinkable - what if I have car trouble - I am so out of luck... but I decided not to worry about that since I had not seen another vehicle since I got on AA going in either direction and the weather was hot and clear.  And then I grabbed on to the steering wheel for dear life as I felt the Fiat swerve as the left rear tire blew out on Alligator Alley.    As I careened forward trying to stay on the road and out of the everglades I noticed for the first time the beautiful blueish silver disk shaped craft hovering behind my car probably! at about 40 feet off the ground.  I was very concerned about the animals and nature and decide not to move from the car.  I had my school notebook behind my seat and started to write a note to my sister ((name deleted)) thinking I was probably not going to see her again even though Ted Bundy was back in prison after his last escape....I sat there for 45 -2 hours but I was frozen in time and it was still hovering.  It was closer to my car some of the time but I was not turning around as I was trying not to move...  Eventually I saw it glide parallel to the water/road and dart up and glide in a very rigid manner until it was gone.  I saw headlights coming from the west and put my emergency lights on and jumped out of the car and flagged down a dude - said he was a dr. or something in Ft. lauderdale.  It turned out that my spare was no good and he kindly took me to an Indian mechanic to get what was needed to change my tire and get me back on the road.  He was a saint.

I lived approximately 8 or so miles east from Luke AFB. At about 2015 hours or so, I noticed blue lights, lighting up a large cloud to the south of my house.

The light looked to be coming out of the cloud but there was no visible beam to it, so I was not sure if it was making it to the ground.

The object had many sets of lights all over the haul and there were no viable wings on it.  The objects structure looked metallic bluish-gray in color.  The object made zero noise.  At the speed it was traveling and the size of the object not hearing any sound from it made the sighting very uneasy. The object traveled through a few more clouds and went west heading towards Luke AFB, but ended up shooting up into the sky and almost vanishing in seconds. a few minutes after I lost track of the object, I smell something similar to burning electronics or something like that and my eye became a little irritated.

It was a solid white color.  It was flying fast through the sky then entered a cloud where it vanished for a few seconds when seconds later I see something similar exit almost the exact stop where it entered.  But this time it had two lights on each wing with a flashing red light in the center. when I noticed that was a plane and the other object finally exists the other side of the cloud.  Realizing they were both flying at about 35k ft,but the white object was much quicker and I watched it   travel across the rest of the sky untill the end of the horizon while passing several other planes, with one looking to be in pursuit but who knows at the time their was an unusual amount of air traffic.  All the planes exhibited the same features with the same two lights on each wing and re! d flashing in the middle.  It was clear at this point it was not a plane.  Too low to be a satellite or space dandruff or ice falling it flew across the sky never loosing elevation.  This most likely rules out drones flares or anything man made.  I also saw a meteor fall from the sky half hour after this and it was completely different.  I've seen alot of orbs and flying objects, since I look for them after a terrifying sighting which left me a believer yet still skeptical of just anything I rule out all possibility and do research to back up my claim.

My husband and I were walking up our driveway around 8:45pm, extremely quiet night & the sky was still bright.  We noticed a really bright stationary steady light (brighter than a planet) in the northeast sky.  No other stars or planets were out.  Just seemed out of place. It didn't move for about 10minutes (we were trying to figure if it was a planet or space station).  Also, it was not where a planet would be (calibrated StarWalk to moon & nothing bright should be there).  My husband was caught off guard & mentioned how it was changing colors.  Then, it disappeared.  We looked for it about 2-3 minutes and all of a sudden reappeared in same position (small light that got brighter and brighter until it was as bright as before..and there were no clouds to distort the view), stationary about 1 minute then IT STARTED MOVING northward (to the left) about the speed of a second hand on a watch. It moved, by perception, about 4 inches across sky then light just quickly phased out.   As soon as it disappeared again My husband saw a pulsating LED light which flashed 3 times, then paused, and flashed 3 times again (about 3 flashes in 2 seconds) coming thru the trees from southeast toward the west.  He mentioned there was a plane coming although there was no noise (we were still looking for the light in the sky).  He thought it was a plane until it stopped on our side of the treeline.  Brilliantly white bright light. Then I saw it.  It followed right under the top tree line (about 50 ft up).  When it got in front our trees but still in the branches, behind our house, then the lights started  going south to north following our tree line (sometimes a little lower in the tree line and then sometimes a little higher but was never lower than about 50 feet) until it got to the top of our  most northward tallest tree & then disappeared.  Just 3 flashing-then-pause-then flashing little but amazingly bright LED-like white lights.  I thought maybe a drone but there was absolutely no noise.

It was on riva road, mostly rural, 8 to 10 miles south of Annapolis.   We came over a small hill on a short straightaway before a larger hill.

It was very large, stereotypical of the flying saucers from the movies.  It was perhaps 80 to 100 yards across.  It was a metal gray color,with a dome or bubble in the center.  It sat there hovering silently, then suddenly tilted one side down towards the trees.  It very slowly moved down, still tilted at an angle, as it did white lights started going on and off in sequence.  They weren't overly bright, but looked to go on and off completely around.  As it neared the treetop it leveled off.  Then quicker than I could blink the object was on the other side of the road.  It stayed there a few seconds then it was gone.  It left so fast it seemed to disappear.  All the while,it stayed completely silent. I drove towards Annapolis with us scanning the sky but it was gone.

I have considered reporting this many times over the years and have finally decided to tell what happened, in the hope that others may have seen the same objects and they will come forward as well.  I wish to remain anonymous.   It was in late October, middle 1970’s, during the week of Halloween.  The three of us decided to go out play Halloween jokes on our friends and neighbors.  We had been running up and down the street, yelling, and having fun.  When we got to the West end of the street, which was quite a distance from the last streetlight.  We then noticed a car coming into town on Route 265 which runs parallel to the street we were on.  Playing as children do, we ran to hide from sight of the car driver.  I ran out into the weeds near the edge of the creek and the others ran the opposite direction, back towards the street light and up into a yard above the street to hide in the bushes around a house.   When the car had passed by I started walking back in the direction the other two had gone to hide.  When I got under the streetlight I saw both of them standing on the hill above the road, pointing towards the light pole and moving backwards.  I looked up at the pole and found I was standing under three dull silver discs that were hanging motionless about three feet above the light pole.   The discs were all identical and had the look of brushed aluminum with a bright white light on the bottom.  While the light was bright, it was not clear and resembled the look of a ceiling light with a frosted white shade, only brighter.  They were ten to fifteen feet in diameter, somewhat curved on the bottom and around three to four feet thick from the bottom to the centerline of the disc.  I could not see the top half as I was standing almost directly underneath them.  I do remember hearing a buzzing sound but I’m not sure if it was coming from the streetlight, as many of those lights made a noise at that time, or if it was coming from the discs.  I turned to look at my sister and our friend and they were standing some distance back on the hillside at a level that would have been about half the distance from the bottom of the discs to the ground.   I turned my attention back to the discs and started to bend down to pick up a rock to throw at one of the discs.  As I bent down I saw the disc on my right, which was the one farthest West, start to wobble and move slowly to the West.  I backed away from them while watching the moving disc tip up and down like a boat does when riding moderate waves.  This disc kept moving off slowly to the west and I watched it until it had traveled about one quarter mile then I looked back up at the other two.  They had moved off to the south and were steadily moving up and away at about a 35 degree angle.   My sister and our friend came down to the street and we watched them all move off until they were points of light that faded from view.  We ran home to tell our parents and they really didn’t pay us much attention as we were out playing jokes when this happened and they thought we were joking with them. Never since have I seen airborne vehicle that resembled these three craft.  I didn’t see any windows and I don’t recall seeing any seams, joints, rivets or indication of assembled panels.  The color most resembled brushed aluminum.  As I remember, I didn’t feel fear but just awe for what I was seeing.  I believe my sister and friend were somewhat afraid, but still amazed at the sight of these objects. I hadn’t seen my childhood friend for quite a few years, when I saw him at a dinner and the first thing he asked was if I remembered the discs.  We talked about our memories of them and we still recall the series of events in the same way.   Occasionally my sister and I talk about that experience as well.  To this day I wish I would have hit one of those discs with that rock to see what reaction it might have had.  If I ever have another opportunity, I will do whatever I can to strike, shoot, or damage the object in the hope of invoking a reaction.

I lived in a regular neighborhood, not in a rural area.  My best friend and I were relatively interested in UFO's as he had noticed a few strange occurrences in the skies over his home, which was about 1 1/2 from mine.  Sadly, he passed away in 2015. His memories of what he had seen stoked my interest as well, so I began to spend the evening hours outside as much as possible, to have a look.  I don't recall snow on the ground, but I can't say that it was all that warm, either. One night, my sister was also outside (1 year younger) with me, while I looked at the stars.  I don't know which stars I would have thought they were at the time, but I noticed them because they seemed quite a bit brighter than the others.  They were not ""close"" to us at all, as far as I could tell, just ""bright stars"".   Well, while I was looking and pointing to them, each star made a half-arc, for lack of a better term, until they were level with each other, then sped away from each other in opposite directions across the sky.  I was excited to say the least, and ran inside to tell my parents.   In the ensuing week or two, while I was still spending a lot of time outside, I watched an airforce jet fly wildly all over my part of the city...as if chasing something (at that time, I believe the only base of any size in Illinois was Chanute), and this was also confirmed by my friend, who had watched the jet from his home.  A few nights later, I heard a deep rumble ! that seemed to take its time getting to us...I figured it was a helicopter.  By the time I went into the front yard, the house was shaking, and a dozen military helicopters, in formation, passed over my house...really almost exactly over my house, heading in the direction of my friend's neighborhood, roughly. I think this was really the lead-up to what eventually occurred a few nights later.  I hadn't quite given up on ""watching"" when I could.  On this night, it was dark already, as it was during the other activity.  I was sitting on the front porch steps, and could hear what I can only compare to a distressed, grinding engine, not something I would think was in good working order.  I didn't think too much of it until the sound got louder and stranger.  I walked down the front sidewalk and saw, through some trees, ""red lights"" that seemed to be in the same location the noise was.  The strange thing (as if this isn't strange enough) is how slowly it was moving.  I had time to run in the front door, grab my father, and run to the back door.  As we did so, it moved just off the top of a tall tree in our back yard. It had red lights around the perimeter, and I don't recall that they were blinking, I believe they were solid.  The deep engine/grinding continued.  As it passed! over head, we could not make out any shape whatsoever...what ever it was, it was just black.  No outlines, no reflections, nothing.  If I had to guess a size after all of these years, I would say 30 or 40 feet in diameter.  Strangely, I don't really recall the lights as being part of a ""circular"" object either.  They seemed to be irregular. While my father (a Marine) shouted for my mother (a Marine), I watched is travel slowly in the same direction, which took it deeper into neighborhoods adjacent to mine.  I would have a hard time believing we were the only ones to see it. I will make an observation though. I've given this a lot of thought since this happened. It almost seems as though one is looking in a direction, or at a group of stars, or in the right place at the right time, more than coincidentally.  It just seems like a stretch to look at some random cluster of stars on a random night, and have what followed, follow.  I wonder if you have had similar observations.

So it would have been close to early 90s.  During late afternoon, clear blue skies, no storms, no clouds anywhere. It was a sunny clear day, while playing outside of my grandparents house.  I was with my younger brother, he would have been around six years old.  We were playing with a large bouncy ball.  I remember watching as the ball rolled down the yard towards the street stopping just before going into the street.  My brother walked over picked it up, I will never forget watching him as he stood there with our ball looking up at the sky, he was motionless. As I walked over to my brother starring upwards, he asked me whats that?  As I looked his direction of his gaze, there in the sky at about a 45° angle appeared to be a star like object.  The object was the size and shape of our brightest star you can see in our night sky.  The star like object was white and motionless, and I remember saying to my brother, ""It’s a star.""  But then I thought its daytime, I've never seen a star during the day. After about 30 seconds, the object began slowly flashing or changing its color from white, to red, blue, green, yellow, purple, and orange.  Each changing color lasted about two seconds, and it almost seemed to pulse these colors, as they appeared to get brighter in between colors. So while watching this object slowly start to flash this vivid spectrum of colors, it began to slowly fade out.  It did not fade out quickly, it took maybe ten seconds or so.  Only the very split second this object was not there anymore, something caught my eyes In a different part of the sky. The object was first seen while facing a north east direction, as soon as it faded out I could see it in a Southern direction slowly appearing, just as it slowly faded out, it slowly appeared the same way.  We watched as this object did this vanishing act three more times.  Almost losing sight of it, I couldn’t see it anymore my brother said, ""there it is"".  A large tree was obstructing our view of it, and as soon as I looked it was fading out again. After the last fade out behind the tree, it then returned to its orginal point in the sky where we had first seen this strange object.  It then began to start flashing its colors again, only this time the flashing or pulsing of these lights were much, much faster.  Flashing different colors at around three colors a second. Then while watching it violently flash these bright colors, It all the sudden just went crazy is best described.  Its hard to convey while writing what this object started doing.  It just shot off moving every direction at once, Traveling huge distances in the blink of an eye.  Within just a few seconds it had traveled almost my entire field of view, but not just from left to right, but going left, right, up, down, and every angle in between. This really scared us, when it started zig zagging.  I remember my brother turning away from it and running back to the house screaming ""mom"".  I also remember running back up the driveway scared as well.  Only I stopped at the top of the driveway, while my brother ran inside. I stopped and turned back around to this object that was still zig zagging every which direction.   Hearing the front door slam shut behind me, as I continued to watch this weird thing. The last thing I remember seeing, was this object making its crazy impossible maneuvers.  and it slamming to a stop, then shooting straight up at a slight angle, and appeared to leave our atmosphere. Now here comes the weird part, I was around 10 years old, my brother was only six years old.  My brother still remembers this very clearly, even though he was at a very young age.  Somehow I had forgotten this memory completely, untill about seven years ago, while talking to my brother on the phone one night.  He was at our parents house, and telling me that he was telling our mom about the U.F.O we saw as kids.  I remember laughing and saying U.F.O?  Yeah you don’t remember ""NO""   All he had to say was "" you don’t remember playing outside of our grandparents and seeing that star?"". OH MY GOD, STILL TO THIS DAY I HAVE NEVER HAD SOMETHING COME OVER ME THAT STRONG AND INTENSE.  After hearing him ask me about the star, It felt like a lightning bolt hit the top of my head, and slowly went through my entire body all the way to my feet.  I stopped my brother in mid sentence of asking about the star and I remembered it all.  Every detail recalling way more than he could remember. This memory is so strong and vivid, how could I have forgotten this amazing aerial phenomenom.   I am Thirty four now, so from age ten, age I witnessed this up until my brother tells me over the phone, I was twenty seven.  Seventeen years passed and I had somehow had forgotten all of this.   It doesn’t make sense to me because I can clearly remember this event, every little detail. So after recalling this amazing experience, and researching, studying, filming, I am left with more questions than answers.  I think about that object every day, because it was so extra ordinary, and have come to this conclusion.  I know what I saw that day, but I do not know what it was.  This was NOT a plane, a star, a comet, or weather phenomenom.  I have lived here my entire life, normal upbringing, planes have always flown day and night because of U.P.S in Louisville KY.  So im aware of planes and what they look and sound like.  Stars don’t behave in this fashion, comets don’t make sudden stops and disappear and reappear in different points in the sky and they do not zig zag every direction in a split second.  Weather phenomenom like ball lighting, is only seen while a storm is in close proximity.  These are facts. So I am left asking myself what did I see that day as a young child?  Could it be military?  I guess, but what kind of pilot could survive the intense G forces that this object was making during its ""crazy"" maneuvers.  So I am left to ask what else could this have been?  I am a very normal hard working family man.  I don’t like jumping to conclusions on anything, I am very rational thinking, and always assume the most obvious in different solutions. I have to look at what this object was Not, then rule them out.   Aliens, I don’t know, I never seen aliens.  I have heard a lot about project blue beam fake alien invasions, and this is a possibility, I cannot rule it out because this could explain the crazy maneuvers. I am left with either military, aliens, or the military using projections of u.f.os.  I understand this is my experience, and for others only a story but, WOW.  This thing  witnessed is the holy grail of experiences that people go out and look for and probably will never see. If I were able to go outside right now, and see this again.  Get a camera and record on film the details I have shared with you, people would watch and probably immediately think that’s fake or a hoax.  Because of how odd this thing acted and the light speed that this object was able to make.  So let me tell you while watching videos on the internet, I am still trying to find a similar sighting like my own.  And when I see these crazy videos that look fake I always keep an open mind.  Because people would not believe what I have seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2016-03-11T00:00:00,38.32784732142857,-85.69607053571428

About a month prior (3/25) my mother came to visit and went outside to smoke before bed (around midnight).  She asked me to come outside and look at the sky.  I can’t explain it, and have never seen anything like it in my entire life.  Over one section of the sky above my house, the sky was lit up like daylight and had a pink hue to it.  It was cloudy and bright/pinkish in color.  The rest of the sky was completely clear and pitch black.  We were both so disturbed by it that we went inside.

One white light was on each side and that was all I could see.  I woke my husband up and we watched this craft just hover without moving for a few minutes between the trees.  Then is slowly stayed in a straight line and moved to the right until it was out of our view. I am unsure of what is going on around here.  I stay up late, and look outside often because I have floor to ceiling windows and doors in every room.  I have never seen so many strange occurances in such a short period of time.

I’ve been looking for ufos my whole life, but have never actually seen one.  My grandfather was a ufo “quack” and said he’d seen a few, and told me you can identify them by their movements, because they can move laterally, unlike a plane, and up and down as well.  These objects were beyond the brush of trees separating my yard from our neighbor’s yard, and I thought initially they were just extraordinarily bright stars, though I wondered why there were three of them (at first) in a unique formation. I noticed those first, and kept smoking my cigarette, then saw what I thought was a plane or two fly across the sky overhead.  I had never anticipated ufos having flashing lights similar to those of planes (that’s how I know that what I see when I occasionally observe the sky thinking to chance to see a ufo—mostly out of nostalgia for my grandfather, though I do find the subject interesting—are just planes).  I heard the sound of a plane passing by, but since the sound is delayed from that distance, I didn’t know which objects were emitting the noise.  I followed the objects across the sky, and they went in the general direction of the other objects, but didn’t “meet up” with the others, as I half expected them to.  At this point I still thought the two I’d seen overhead (not in the sky across my neighbor’s yard) were planes, but then I saw a passenger plane with its lights on fly straight (and only straight) across the sky, and pinned the noise on that. I kept watching to see if once the nearest plane passed, the delayed sound of its flight would remain as I scanned the other objects, but it didn’t.  When I looked back at the sky across my neighbor’s yard, these two objects—two flashing lights (red and white, I believe) at each end, it seemed—were flying slowly and soundlessly in an ascending pattern, then dipping again.  I wondered if they were drones (flying illegally), because maybe drones make less noise than planes, but counting them all together, at different points in the sky, I believe I saw about six, so I didn’t know what to make of it.  I thought also they might be helicopters, for a fire nearby or something, but they seemed close enough to emit some noise (like a helicopter would, I think), and emitted none. The objects (speaking of these last two primarily) seemed also to appear slightly larger and smaller at various points, as if they were also not just moving laterally and up or down, but also ever so slightly (from my visual perspective) in my direction and then back again.  At this point there were two objects left, and I made out (I think) the shape of the one to the right.  It was hard to know the shape of the others, but they all seemed to have blinking lights (again, unexpected), but between the blinking red and white lights at each end of the one I could see, there seemed to be a cigar-shaped body to the object.  These two objects made their way up, and then slightly down, moving to the left of my vision at a slow but steady pace all the while, and they seemed to concentrate themselves (this is in general of most of the objects I saw, but these two as well) into a bright single point of light occasionally, something resembling like a lightning bug or a fairy in a disney m! ovie. I got in my car and drove down the street to the martinsville part of the mountain (I live on the mountain section of warren nearby), trying to trace the lights, and drove around for about a half an hour looking for them, but came back without successfully tracking one.  When I got back to my house there were no objects left in the sky anywhere around. I’m a grad student in english lit at montclair state university.  I live with my cousin and a friend of ours. I grew up in flemington,nj and went to hunterdon central high school.  I worked for a few years at central medical supply delivering equipment but then decided to go back to school to hopefully become a professor (hope that’s enough background info.).",2016-04-15T00:00:00,,

I live in a small town on the Southern Oregon coast, and I was in front of my house last night, viewing the night sky, and thinking about nothing in particular.  The sky was crystal clear, with lots of stars and star formations visible to the naked eye, and I observed Orion’s Belt, the Big Dipper and Little Dipper, to mention just a few star formations.  As a reference, my house is roughly 90 feet above sea level and the front of my house faces exactly northwest (plus or minus 1 degree). At around 10:30 PM, I was staring at the night sky and saw a flash of light, directly in front of me (facing northwest) at an angle of elevation of approximately 45 degrees.  The diameter and brightness of the flash was close to the same diameter and level of brightness as one of the brighter stars I was viewing at the time, and I assumed that a passing cloud had blocked it out of my vision.  That said, there were NO clouds in the sky last night.  The flash appeared, stayed illuminated for roughly two or three tenths of a second, and then disappeared. About one second later, another flash of light appeared, roughly four or five degrees below where the first flash appeared.  It was the same diameter and the same level of brightness and duration as the first flash.  About five seconds later, the same pattern appeared again and in the same location and same angle of elevation.  The distance between the flashes stayed constant; roughly four or five degrees of elevation.  This pattern of flashes continued, repeating every five seconds or so, staying in the same location in the sky.  The third time I saw the two flashes of light, I pointed my index finger where they appeared in the sky, and held my arm as steady as I could, just so I would have a point of reference. After about three minutes, the flashes started moving south very slowly along the same angle of elevation (approximately 45 degrees).  When they moved to the SSW position in the sky, from my northwest facing position, they then started slowing moving higher in elevation.  When they reached approximately a 60 degree angle of elevation, which took approximately three minutes, they stopped and stayed in the same relative position (still pointing my index finger at them) and stayed in that position for another three or four minutes.  The flashes of light then started moving very slowly further south. There is a large pine tree blocking my view, just beyond the SW corner of my property, and when the tree started to block my view of the flashing lights, I got up from the chair I was sitting in and walked further northwest so I could see the lights better.  They continued in a southerly direction and when they got directly south of me and over the Pacific Ocean, they disappeared.  I continue standing there for a few more minutes, but they didn’t reappeared. At no time during this ‘event’ did I hear ANY sound; no near or far off jet engines from either a high or low altitude commercial or military plane.  We have a very small airport north of our town, but rarely do planes land there at night.  They are all small, privately owned planes as well, primarily prop-driven, although there is at least one small Learjet that we see occasionally.  There is no noise or air pollution here (no industries) and with a population of only 6000, the noise level at night is VERY low.  It’s a small and very quiet town, especially at night. On nights when the weather is good, I sit in front of my house and stare at the sky, mostly because we can see SO many stars at night here.  It is a star gazer’s paradise and I know several people who have telescopes, although I do not.  I’ve never seen anything before like what I saw last night.  If it was ONE object, it must have been HUGE.  That said and given the relative distance between the flashing lights, it appeared that it MUST have been two objects, whatever they were. Whatever it was, it was flying, it wasn’t making a sound and I could not identify it, which I guess technically makes it a UFO.

Observation of a Fast Moving Lunar Transit Anomaly Jacksonville, Florida, June 23, 12:31 EDT.   At about 0:31 hours (12:31 EDT, to the nearest minute) this morning, I was observing the waning gibbous moon from our driveway with a 4.25” f/6 reflecting telescope.  At the time, I was using a magnification of about 100X with a # 21 orange filter.  Although the rising moon was still low in the SE, seeing was quite good, and there were no clouds or haze. While observing features on the lunar terminator near Mare Serenitatis, I noticed a fast moving, solid black pentagon-shaped object traversing from west to east [moving from the terminator roughly in the direction of Mare Imbrium] across the lower (mid-northern) portion of the moon.  The estimated time of passage before it swept out of the eyepiece’s field of view was – my best guess – well under five seconds.  As I was not wearing a watch, I immediately went inside and looked at a wall clock (known to be accurate within a minute or so), and recorded the time. The most unusual aspect of this observation was the shape of the object.  Because it swept across the field of view so rapidly, I am not 100% sure that I am getting this exactly right, but my recollection is that its silhouette was something between a pentagon and a five-pointed star, as shown on the accompanying drawing.  This rendering is based on a quick pencil sketch that I made within a few minutes of seeing the object.  The thing that sticks in my mind is that this object was inky black and perfectly symmetrical – with no change of shape or tumbling effect as it crossed the face of the moon. As to the object’s size, I have tried to relate it to some of the named lunar craters in this area, and – again, to the best of my ability – it seems to have had an apparent angular size midway between that of Menelaus (27 km) and Manilius (39 km), so my best guess would be an apparent size of about 30 km, as projected against the lunar disc. Based on its eastward trajectory, moving roughly in line with the ecliptic, my suspicion is that this is some kind of large, earth orbiting satellite – but what could it be?  Although I have never witnessed a lunar transit by the International Space Station, I am familiar with its appearance, both as it has been imaged in telescopes and as it has been photographed traversing the moon, but the object that I observed looked noting like this. Has anyone else seen anything like this? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides very nice illustration of what the object looked like in the field of view of his telescope.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Hello Peter -- Thanks for your follow-up email on the report that I submitted this morning.  You wrote: ""You do state in your report that the object appeared to be moving from west to east.  Am I correct in assuming that your statement implies west to east, as the witness faces the Moon, and not as he is looking at the (reversed) image in the telescope?  I think your drawing pretty well answers my question, but I would like to be certain on that point.""  Yes, you are correct, moving from west to east across the face of the moon as shown in the diagram.  In my reflector's eyepiece view, everything is of course inverted but not mirror reversed, and I corrected for this in the drawing.  Always confusing.  One of these days, I am going to get a good penta-prism so I can get non mirror-reversed views in my refractor, lol. Of perhaps more interest, I shared my report with a friend, a retired aerospace engineer [His wife is a retired aerospace engineer, too, lol.] who was able to take the data -- with a few assumptions about a probable earth orbit height -- and perform the following simple calculations: ((calculation)) Hello ((witness name deleted)), You don't need trig for this one, just algebra. 30km (object)/ 376364km (Earth, Moon Distance - surface to surface) =  X/200 miles.  Solving for X, we get .0159 miles which at 5280 ft/mile  gives a size of approximately 84 feet, about right for a large spy  satellite or old booster tank.  Likely just more space junk. ((name deleted)) PS. You may find this site interesting. http://www.stuffin.space/ Click  on an object to see what it is. Hummmm.  84 feet is not as large as I thought it might be, but it would seem to ""fit"" the data pretty well  I remain puzzled by the odd symmetrical shape, but perhaps this is the way that some satellites are constructed.   Anyway, thanks again for the follow-up on the report.  My feeling is that we have now, most likely, gone from a ""UFO"" to an earth satellite, albeit of unknown origin, lol.   PS--Yes, you have my permission to post the drawing, and -- if possible -- it might be interesting to post Richard's back of the envelope calculations as well as a postscript, so long as there is no need to specifically identify him. PPS--I always enjoy hearing your segment on Coast to Coast, and hearing about what other people are seeing in the sky these days.  As I have mentioned to you, my only ""real"" UFO observation was made back when I was a kid -- almost sixty years ago, now.  The truly amazing thing is how much data has been gathered about this phenomenon over all of the intervening years, but how little we still seem to know about what it all really ""means.""   Clear Skies -- ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((BEGIN ADDENDUM #2)) Hello Peter --        As for my friend's calculations, you are correct, there was indeed some bootstrapping involved, lol.  At my suggestion, he made the assumption, as a starting point, that the object was in low earth orbit at an arbitrarily chosen altitude.  Then, he applied the simple geometric calculations that you see to get its approximate size.           Obviously, if the object was not in this type of orbit -- in a higher orbit, or much closer to the lunar surface -- then it becomes much larger, and far more problematic in terms of an explanation.  The limiting case would be a huge object -- on par with the diameter of a moderate sized lunar crater -- flying at incredible velocity over the face of the moon.  Think Independence Day II, lol.        On the other hand, its [unhappily, not very well] observed transit time can also serve as a geometric limiting factor.  That is, if something is seen to cross the entire face of the moon in, say, five seconds, then this (from the application of simple geometry) gives us a strong indication about where -- and how fast -- it must be moving relative to the earth and the moon.  In this case, all of the parameters, working backward, seem to ""fit"" the more mundane explanation that this is some kind of earth satellite, but it still might not be... Going Down the Rabbit Hole        As I mentioned in my last email, the most interesting / deeply troubling aspect of all of this is that most of us -- you, me, and the Coast listenership -- seem to be struggling to come up with some kind of logical, rational, and more or less coherent and comprehensible ""model"" of what the UFO phenomenon is all about and what it might actually ""mean"" in practice.  Sadly, this is not the model that ""our"" government seems to be pursuing -- cf, the contributions of everyone from Richard Dolan to Dr. Steven Greer -- and we never seem to get much closer to a real understanding of what is happening.        As I remember you observing many years ago, such a deliberately orchestrated denial / obfuscation of reality is absolutely toxic to our form of representative government, and this would help to explain everything from the pent-up anger of the public [The Brits seem to have voted to leave the EU yesterday.] to the near total dysfunction of Official Washington.  We are, at best, living in a carefully manufactured official reality where very little is what it appears to be, including the sundry aerial phenomena that you record every day, and yet nothing much is ""done"" about it.        Unlike the more optimistic assessment of Dr. Greer and others, my fear is that we live in a world in which anything like official disclosure (or even a simple confession of ignorance as to the exact nature and purposes of the phenomenon) may never occur, and The Powers That Be will simply do whatever is necessary to make sure that their version of reality ""sticks,"" even though an increasing majority of citizens know better.  How our present system of government can survive such a dual reality in which everyone knows that its public officials are lying in their teeth about important things is open to question*, but it took quite a while for the Soviet system to implode, and TPTB now have much better ""tools"" with which to mold / coerce society**. *As seems to be taking place in the election of 2016, lol. ** See, for example, Jane Mayer's recent book, Dark Money. As a number of people in the field of ufology seem to be calling for at this point [Many of these people have appeared on Coast and in other venues.], perhaps the best that we can do is to continue creating a citizen-sourced, distributed network model type of investigation that simply gives up on the idea the gov'mint will ever come clean with the public in this area.  Instead, we will, I hope, end up with something like a Wikipedia of UFO-related material that will constitute (for most people, probably) a viable alternative to the manufactured ""reality"" that the government and / or TPTB continue to shovel in our direction.  Then, based on this open, public consensus version of reality, perhaps we can begin to ""do"" something--whatever this might turn out to be--about our objective situation vis a vis the things that everybody keeps seeing in the sky. Thanks, as always, for your help with this -- ((witness name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM #2))",2016-06-24T00:00:00,30.266904680969628,-81.6163728336584

There was nothing between the sun and those peaks.  There was nothing moving out of the area heading west as far as the eye could see.  Many miles to the west (about twenty miles) I could see Sky Harbor International traffic along the I-17 corridor flying from north to south, but those shadows would be cast further to the west.

It IS a UFO in the truest sense of the term, although I can't say with any assurance that it was a ""space craft""  it is most definitely an enigma.  I was able to follow it relatively smoothly for a couple of minutes before it disappeared behind some building and tree in the horizon.

It seemed like they were moving in formation but then some moved faster than others and then some disappeared.

On Monday, 6 June, 2016, from approximately 10:30 to 10:35 a.m., under a clear blue sky, with sun shining and no obvious haze, I witnessed a strange silvery-gray aircraft(?) fly over my property.  I stood in my garden and watched it for what I would guess was just under 5 minutes as it seemed to glide or “slip” through the sky.  (I did not have a watch on, but looked at the time when I went back into the house a few minutes later)   The craft was long and thin, rather spindly, than cigar-shaped, with tapered ends, and it appeared to have no wings or means of propulsion.   I did notice what looked like a shadowy line or slightly darker area running vertically about two-thirds of the way back from the leading end or front of the craft.  Other than that (and I should stress that that mark was truly nothing more than a shadow-like area—not a clearly defined stripe or change of color from the rest of the craft--almost more a “suggestion” of a stripe) there were no marks, visible protuberances of any kind, lights, color or decoration anywhere on the object. It was simply long, smooth, and silver.   I watched it as it came into view from the southeast—keeping it in sight until it disappeared into the northwest—but I never heard a sound (not even the suggestion of sound) or noticed the slightest change of shape to indicate that previously unseen wings or other parts may have been hidden by the angle of flight. The craft appeared to be at a relatively high altitude—extending my arm fully and pointing it at the craft, I could almost cover it with one finger but it was not quite as long as two finger widths.  (Maybe an inch long at arm’s length when pointing to what would be about an 11 o’clock position in the sky, if the horizon was at 9 o’clock, and noon was straight overhead.)   I saw it coming towards me, as it went past, and then as it went away from me, but nothing in the way of wings or anything else ever showed—even in suggestion.  It was 100% smooth.  However, I don’t want to mislead anyone.  I was never presented with an absolute end-on or front-end view that might have allowed me to see it in cross-section.  My observations were strictly from below and to one side, although the fact that the length of the spindle grew longer, then shorter, as I watched its progress, shows that I did see at least a slight three-quarter view as it followed its path across the sky. There were two rather interesting and puzzling things about this object that I find hard to describe (other than its being soundless, wingless, featureless and having no vapor trail at all, I mean) ... The first is that it seemed to have a kind of very faint luminosity about it that did not seem to be the result of light reflection.  It somehow managed to look as if it were both a dull silver-gray AND lit up from the inside at the same time.  Sort of like a faintly charged glow-in-the-dark object but with a clearer, colorless light.  I imagine it might be what you’d see if you put a light source behind a mylar sheet, but there was no focal point of brighter light.  It was diffuse and very faint, as if the light came from the object’s surface, rather than interior. The second thing is that the entire object or craft appeared to have a kind of halo or aura in a perfect circle around it a fair distance from it.  The aura was something like the corona you see around a full moon under certain conditions except that it was dark rather than light and so faint as to be nearly invisible.  I actually thought my eyes were playing tricks on me,, at first, and that I wasn’t really seeing anything but those annoying “floaters” people sometimes get.  I tried rubbing my eyes and even looking at other parts of the sky to see if the phenomena was in my own eyes, but I could not see it except while looking at the craft.  After ascertaining that there really was something there, I began to wonder if it was some sort of rotary device—like helicopter blades—spinning so fast that it was nearly invisible, but I think I would have heard something like that, especially when I started thinking about how enormous it would have to be.  If the craft was approximately an inch across at arm’s length, the circle around it would have been more like two inches across by the same measure—much too large for a rotor, I would think.  And of course, it floated completely independent of the craft.  There were no connections between that circle of faint darkness and the craft itself. I wish I could describe this better, but despite being on many an Air Force base and at airports around the world in my day, I’ve really not come across anything quite like this before. Let me correct that …  This marks the fourth time I have seen this craft over the last several years.  (I cannot recall the exact dates, unfortunately, but I would say that I first saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and have seen it twice more between this sighting and that first.) In each case, except the third occurrence, the sightings were on clear, sunny days in late spring or early summer and each time the flight path appeared to be either east or southeast to west or northwest. I live in a very rural area near a national forest and have goats. In both of the first two incidents I was out with my goats and got a very good look at it.  The third occurrence was less distinct because I was preoccupied with something too important to stop doing and I only got a chance to glance at it a bit in between.  However, I do remember that it was also a fine day, though I do not remember what time of year it was or which direction the craft was traveling. You will wonder why I am reporting this now when I did not report it before.  I can only say that because I have a rational mind I have spent the intervening years trying to convince myself that what I saw was nothing more than an unusual aircraft of unfamiliar design.  I was helped in this by my husband who has always maintained that I did not see wings because the angle was wrong or light got in my eyes, or something …  He explained away the lack of sound by saying other sounds may have disguised it; it was not traveling in a direction that allowed me to hear the sound right away; or I simply mis-remembered it.  The same for all my other objections.  I began to be half-convinced that I was simply mis-remembering everything … until today. I watched this thing for long enough to be judge and jury today.

My wife called me at work to report seeing an object descending from sky in a rainbow-like arc.   She was driving by herself, returning from store.  She turned north off of St. Luke Rd. onto Sunrise Rd., and about 100 yds from first house, in her peripheral vision on right (easterly), spotted basketball or oval shaped object and size, bright on front, red flames coming out back as it descended.  The trajectory looked like it might hit neighbors' house, but then disappeared.   She believes object got as close as within about a football field length from where she was.  Neighbors 2 young grandchildren were coming down the road on there 4 wheelers and my wife stopped and asked them if they saw that.  The youngest (about 6 yrs old) said she saw it but other child did not.  Wife's car windows were rolled up and radio going so she didn't hear anything.  Did not see any trail, only reddish flames that looked like they were extending 4 to 5 ft out back of object. This is on gravel road in rural location.  We see meteorites all the time in the country and wife said she saw this object for approx. 5 seconds, much longer than we ever see a meteorite.  I asked her if possibly fireworks rocket and she said no way. Coincidentaly, about an hour before, I saw a Google Earth camera car drive by my office in Marshfield, MO, so I questioned her if maybe it might have been a drone?  Maybe related to Google activity, but she didn't think it looked like a drone. We also experience occasional low flying military aircraft on exercise, and I asked her if maybe it was a missile that got shot by accident, but she wasn't sure.  I asked if maybe an engine that fell off a jet?  She isn't sure about that.   I called one of the local ranch hands and talked to him about it.  He hadn't seen anything, but would mention to some of the other hands and would let me know.  She is adamant that it descended from a higher altitude, in a rainbow like arc.  Did not see any crash, hear any noise or smoke or anything else after losing sight of object.  Haven't questioned the girl yet.  Going to call her mother tonight to see if she can describe what she saw.  Sorry we couldn't get a pic.",2016-06-10T00:00:00,37.5117,-93.0373

3 slow moving orbs chased by fast walker,Santa Cruz,CA,2016-04-29T21:45:00,egg,4 minutes,"Occurred : 4/29/2016 21:45  (Entered as : 4/29/16 21:45) Reported: 4/30/2016 12:06:42 AM 00:06 Posted: 5/6/2016 Location: Santa Cruz, CA Shape: Egg Duration:4 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/127/S127110.html,"3 slow moving orbs chased by fast walker On Friday night, 4/29/2016, between 9:15pm and 10:00pm, I observed 4 objects I could not identify as aircraft.  Three of the objects were egg or spherical shape, with a red/yellow/white illumination with a slight flickering of these colors. These 3 objects were separated in time by about 20 seconds, moving towards the ocean in the direction of Monterey.  Each of these 3 objects traveled at the same speed, which was slower than a small fixed wing aircraft.  Both the 1st and 2nd object appeared to stop dead in the sky, at the same point in the sky, for at least 10 seconds.  They then resumed their same speed and disappeared from view, but it seemed to me that the extinguishment of their light was not a function of moving ever farther away, the lights just went out.  Each object was the same size, and  I measured with my pinky finger held out at about 30 degrees elevation.  The object took up less than half the width of the nail of my pinky finger.  The objects were s! ilent, and emitted no trails.  I estimate the height of these objects in the hundreds, but not  thousands of feet. I'm not sure if the third object stopped dead and moved on like the first two. I was startled to view a very fast moving streak in the sky proceeding in the general direction of these objects. The speed of this ""streak"" would be about the same as a military jet traveling at a supersonic speed at low altitude.  While I was not startled by the initial 3 ""orb like"" objects, the fast moving streak seemed ""wrong"".  Another way to describe this streak would be about the same as a meteor one can often see during meteor showers. I thought it was a meteor, but the angle thru the sky was too flat or horizontal and too low. This ""streak"" trailed a smoky, silverish color.  There was no sound. This streak quickly vanished in the direction of the other objects. I can't estimate the size of this streaking object. It was projectile shaped. I sighted these objects on a neighborhood street where I walk every day, both day and night.  I am familiar with the behavior of aircraft - both large jets and small planes as to  their lighting and travel time in this sky, as well as to what sounds could be present, or not present.  Sometimes even small planes are silent at even short distances.  During this sighting, both light and larger aircraft were higher up in the sky. So, the progression of lights would be these unidentified objects, with light planes and commercial traffic above them, and then the stars above those aircraft. My guess is that the first three ""orbs"" could have been lanterns, except that the first two stopped dead in the sky and then resumed their travel. Another possibility is drones. The streaking object is why I am reporting this. It seems an odd coincidence that these  slow moving ""orbs"" were chased by a very fast object. I am writing this report about one hour after the event. I am a retired technician/engineer, 64 years old. I am offering this report in the event others may have seen some of what I did, especially the fast moving streak. Mr. Davenport, thank you for keeping records of these sightings.",2016-05-06T00:00:00,37.011256646216765,-122.04450858895706

My girlfriend and I (during our college spring break) were driving near my home in Kenmore, WA, at around 9:50 PM.  All of a sudden, we spotted strange lights overhead.  We started freaking out because of how eerie these lights looked, and we opened the doors and got out of the car several times to take pictures and look at the lights.  They were orange and very illuminated, sphere shaped, and were ""floating"" in a certain pattern in the sky.  They seemed to be clustered into triangular formations, 3 in each triangle.  All in all, around 15 lights were seen, maybe more, and no more than 7 or so lights at any given time. The lights vanished at different places, and when I say ""vanished,"" I don't mean they simply faded instantaneously.  When they would disappear, my girlfriend and I could both clearly see the back of each light when the front would vanish, almost like they were ""sucked into a portal.""  While that sounds corny, it's the only analogy I can really think of.  During the entirety of the sighting, all sound was noticeably quieter, almost as if it were being suppressed, with the exception of an odd rippling sound coming from an unknown source.  The window on the driver’s side of my 2006 Trailblazer wouldn't roll down during the sighting, and has been faulty since.  A plane was spotted flying near the lights during the middle of the event, and about a minute or two after the last light disappeared, another plane flew in the direction the lights were headed, this time at a speed faster than a plane normally flies.  All of the lights were going exactly west, towards the! Puget Sound.  The final lights were seen shortly after 10:00 PM. Throughout the encounter, both I and my girlfriend were freaking out.  My girlfriend was scared during the entirety of the sighting, and I was on edge as well.  While neither of us have any background or extensive knowledge about any types of aircraft, we both agreed we had never seen anything like it.  I have one good video taken via snapchat, and while it shows several of the lights, it doesn't even come close to what the real encounter was like.

This is not a one-time sighting, they’ve been around for quite a while now so that’s why I’m able to record them.  I started to film them in 2015, but I have been watching them for a long time.  I usually only see them during the summer.  Most of the time they fly around one spot near some trees (the spot in my video), but I have seen similar lights at other locations, which I unfortunately did not capture on video. Description of objects (Video: www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_NymzvWSto)  They are tiny and agile small spheres of light, completely silent. You can watch my video. I’ve seen them do all kinds of maneuvers.  They seem to appear out of nowhere and then just disappear, there doesn’t seem to be any solid object behind the light.  When I first saw them I thought they were just fireflies or maybe some other insects but as I continued to observe them I realized they couldn’t be insects.  I’ve also seen other unexplainable lights that indicate to me that they’re intelligently controlled.  Unfortunately I didn’t film it and cannot prove it so therefore I won’t bother explaining those sightings.  But I still do have plenty of footage.  I have tried to approach them with and without my camera but then they simply won’t show up, like they were never there. Possible Explanations   1.  Light reflecting off of insects.  I thought a lot about this, but I’m sure they can’t be just reflections.  They are way too bright, and there is clearly no light source so they can’t be reflections.  There are street lamps a few meters away where you can compare real insect light reflections with the UFO’s, they don’t look the same at all. 2.  Fireflies/Lightning bugs.  They cannot be fireflies, since we don’t have fireflies in Sweden. If you’ve ever seen fireflies in real life, you would understand.  Otherwise I suggest you watch a youtube of fireflies and see for yourself. Fireflies don’t fly like that, and they can’t get as bright as these objects. 3.  Drones/Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or other man-made technology.  They can’t be drones because they fly way too fast and make abrupt changes in direction & speed which you can see in the video.  If these were drones they would’ve crashed into each other or into the trees.  They fly too close to the trees and each other. In some of my footage you can also see that there’s no solid object behind the light. 4.  Extraterrestrial explanation.  Perhaps they could be some kind of extraterrestrial technology.  Why would aliens do this?  What is the point of coming all the way to earth to just fly around like this?  It would be very hard to prove this explanation so I won't jump to any conclusions.  They are still unknown to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2016-03-18T00:00:00,,

After each flash the light moved a short distance.  However, after a total of seven flashes the light seemed to have moved in a deformed circle.  When the light flashed on a fourth time it illuminated the underside of a craft.  The craft was in the form of a triangle and the white light was in the center of the triangle.  Each apex of the triangle wa! s rounded. Each side of the triangle was about 4 feet long.  The color of the craft was a very light brown tan with a tint of yellow. The flashes stopped.  I watched for another couple of minutes.  I ran inside the house.  It was now 10:55 pm as shown on the digital cable clock.  I came back outside and continued observing until about 12:30 am.

This happened one more time, one blinked the other blinked then moved upward.  At this moment, they both seemed to blink off as they moved up farther into the sky and I could no longer see them. When I saw them blink the first time, I motioned to my sister to look.  She caught a quick glimpse of the last movement they made upward, then out of sight. These objects were very high up, presumably out of the atmosphere.  From where I was standing on Maluniu Av, I was looking almost straight up, slightly toward Kalaheo High School area.",2016-03-18T00:00:00,21.4024,-157.7405

This is what I saw in 1999, July 7th.  It was about 9:30 pm on an evening where the sky was an indigo purple and the stars were just coming out.  Jupiter flashed brightly, low on the western horizon.  This was in SW corner of British Columbia, Canada, and I was a passenger in a car traveling south. We were on a high plateau, and when I first noticed the light, it was coming in from the SW, far over the Pacific.  It was about half the size of what you filmed here when I first noticed it.  When I turned my head to mention the 'light' to the driver for just a moment, it was gone already by the time I turned back, and I had an unlimited horizon view.   Puzzled as to where it went so quickly, I forgot about it until about half an hour later when we were traveling north, heading home along the Fraser River on the east side of the river.  It was full dark by then, and we were on a narrow, winding road with considerable traffic.  The river was to our left, on the driver's side, when suddenly he said, ""There is your light,"" and pointed casually out his side window.  There it was, but picture it about 20x bigger than what you filmed.  It was diamond shaped and flashing brilliant rainbow colours, glittering like sunlight on water.  It was simply breathtaking, and it hung maybe 100 ft above the river.   I begged the driver to stop, all I wanted to do was to sit still and gaze at it, but the traffic and narrowness of the road made that impossible, so we watched it as we drove along.  Suddenly, it SPLIT INTO TWO! I felt like I was in a dream.  As soon as it split into two lights of the same size as the original, THEY DANCED A CRAZY FIGURE 8 AROUND EACH OTHER A FEW TIMES, then merged into one object again, hanging their motionless once more, dazzling and flashing with a brilliance that did not hurt the eyes. It was incredible, and how many years later, I am still in awe of what I saw that night.  Eventually the road took us away from the river and ! away from the display.  What was odd about the entire time we saw the l ight, no one else driving slowed down or crashed into anything, as may have happened on a busy highway with such a spectacle going on just about over our heads.  I reported it to the ufobc website, and was interviewed by phone the next day, but as far as I could discover, there were no other reports about it anywhere. Surely something so obvious would have hit the news?  Even the people in the car with me were not interested in talking about it later.  It was if they wanted to forget what they had seen. To me, that was crazy, but I soon found myself an island in a sea of indifference.  For all of these years I have been watching videos of sightings to see if I would ever see that kind of ufo again, and yesterday, I did, but not near as big or as dazzling, via video upload at Youtube Channel: Steven Barone.

The house sits at the top of one of the highest points in Naugatuck.  My kids were all outside playing on a swing-set when something spherical in the sky caught my eye.  I was on the deck while my kids played outside on that swing-set.   I saw a craft just hovering and not moving or making a sound, in the sky.  It was just hanging perfectly still in the sky.  The craft was spherical with a brassy like color.  I heard nothing at all coming from this spherical craft.  I could definitely see what looked like ""L"" shaped individual panels making up the sphere.  I could see what looked like divots attaching the ""L"" panels together to make up the sphere.    It was approx 25yards away, maybe closer, from where i was standing, in the sky.  It was very close to me.  I starred for a few minutes and then called out to my Bro.inlaw to come take a look with me.  I hadn't taken my eyes OFF this craft, all the while asking my Bro.inlaw to come out and look at this sphere with me.  We both did not know what we were actually seeing.  At which point i asked him to get binoculars so we could get a closer look at it.  My eyes still fixed on the craft.  I did NOT take my eyes off of it, at all.  But, at the same time, my kids were calling up to me...""mom, mom...""  I finally looked in their direction, and said""what?"",  and when i looked back...the sphere was gone... in an instant!  In one second!  There were No signs of noise or trails in the sky.  I even looked thru the binoculars to see if i could find it.  But to no avail ... There was no sign of it on the horizon, or above it, at all.  But as to where this sphere went, neither of us knew.  I looked in every direction possible..  It just vanished, in an instant.  I believe that perhaps a cloaking device may have made this craft disappear.  Only because nothing that I know of, mechanically, can vanish so very quickly without some sign of it travelin! through the air.  I also had a feeling that they were watching me also. Because it didn't vanish, or even move, until i looked away, for that split second.  No noise, no smoke, no trails in the sky.  It had just disappeared into thin air.  A spectacular sighting.

The fireball flew what appeared to be extremely low, lower then any plane and then appeared to speed up and continue below the clouds for apprx one min and them disappeared off in the distance.  I only say disappeared because the flame went out making the orb no longer visible. Approximately 30 seconds later another fire orb appeared at same altitude but much faster across the sky, them 2 more fire orbs back to back with the same altitude equally spaced apart came across the sky.  All four came from the same direction and had the same exact formation as the previous fire orb, I have never seen anything like that.  Complete silence with a bright light in the sky visible and then just disappeared as if the fire flame was turned off.  At first I chalked it up to a flare from a military plane but the more i thought about I realized that flares don't follow each other back to back across the sky in the same formation and exact same direction.

The lights were brighter than anything else in the sky, even greater luminosity than the moon for their size.  The lights were bright enough to cast an orange reflection upon the waters of Fish Lake.  The objects were at about 70 degrees above the southern limit of the sky and lasted for approximately :50 seconds.   The objects were very bright orange balls but did not appear to be fireballs due to their constant luminosity and lesser speed.

I was sitting at a baseball field in the bleachers with my boyfriend, just chit chatting and enjoying the night.  The sky was so clear that night.  We were looking up at the stars.  I then looked straight ahead and saw what I thought was a bright blue star.  It was completely still and shining a bit brighter than the other stars and it was definitely a blue-ish color.   I then pointed it out to my BF.  As soon as I pointed at it (and we were both looking right at it at this point) it moved quickly to the right and changed colors - to a reddish blinking light. It then jerked up, then left, then down, then right.  The turns were very sharp - almost like it stopped in the air and turned right back around to go the other way.   The way it moved and the speed it moved, my BF and I agreed it could not of been anything man-made (that we know of, of course).  We saw it moving for about a minute then it disappeared behind some trees.   A few minutes later we saw two triangular pla! nes (one after the other) flying parallel to us the turn left toward where the object was.  Those planes looked as if they could of been military fighter jets.  They weren't moving too fast and the turn looked normal to what I've seen as far as planes go.  It definitely could of been coincidental as they turned towards where Logan Airport would be (we see planes fly over all the time in Cambridge).   I know what I saw was something different and no one will convince me otherwise.  It was not a plane, helicopter, drone, laser light, or anything like that.  This thing was completely idle like a star, started out blue, and changed to red lights and moved erratically right after I pointed it out to my BF.

On 05-21-15 at 2050 hours, I observed multiple orange circular objects in the atmosphere traveling at high rate of speed, and what I judged to be 1000 feet or slightly more in elevation.  The objects grabbed my attention because they appeared to be on fire, until I observed several more, consistently coming from the Northeast part of the sky, and flying over to the Southeast part of the sky crossing the full moon before dimming out.   I observed these objects from a residential area on the West side of Murfreesboro, TN, with one other witness.  In addition, I could hear multiple other people in the area making noises every time the objects would fly over.  I could not see those individuals, and did not make contact with them.  The objects flew in a line formation, and then transitioned into a close triangle formation.  They gained altitude extremely fast, which I was unable to judge the speed, and they slowed down at times to a near stop in the middle of the air after traveling extremely fast.  Over a period of forty five minutes to an hour I observed twenty or more of these objects flying over the clear night sky.  There was no sound, no visible beacon light, no visible wings, and no observed aircraft spotlight.  The entire object was a bright orange, and no matter which direction it went it remained as such.  There were two aircraft seen in the same area during the event one flying at or around the same altitude, and was clearly heard and known to be a plane with definable wings I could see with the moonlight, and beacon lights.  The other was harder to hear and was flying what appeared to be higher than 30,000 feet, and I could see its beacon’s flashing.  Neither of the two planes was flying in the manner in which the twenty or so objects were.   Originally, I suspected they were meteorites or asteroids because they appeared on fire.  However, they slowed down changed formation dimmed out and then got brighter.  They appeared to be in a controlled flight pattern.

While starting to drive my car away from a party at 9:45 pm, Saturday, May 21, in the Mission Hills area of San Diego, I saw what was like a constellation of bright white stars, maybe about 12, in the area clear of trees above the street, towards the west.  I thought to myself, ""What’s Cassiopeia doing there, and the Big Dipper, too low in the sky and in the wrong direction.""   I pulled my car over and got out, and saw that the lights were slowly moving from west to east. Seeing them in motion was quite a shock. Not planes, not helicopters, just steady bright white lights floating slowly to the north of where I was, from west to east.   I ran back to the house and told everyone to come out to see what was happening.  The 15 or so still there came outside onto the driveway and sidewalk to watch the show.  The lights seemed to be drifting, slightly changing position in relation with one another.  They seemed to be slowly ascending as they moved east they neared the posi! tion of the full Moon, which had risen about an hour or two earlier.  They gradually faded from sight.  A retired policeman was among the witnesses.   Our guess on the most mundane side was that they could have been balloons with attached lights, launched from Ocean/Mission/or Pacific Beach and were riding the nightly onshore breeze which was taking them to the east, directly over Mission Bay then Mission Valley to our north.   I later went to Ocean Beach and asked fishermen on the north side of the pier if they had see balloons launched from the long stretch of these three above beaches to the north, but none had seen anything.  I recall seeing in the news a similar report of floating lights a year or two ago, also in San Diego.   I was just visiting in San Diego for the weekend, from Minneapolis, for my brother’s memorial service.",2016-05-26T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

I heard a bunch of sirens outside my apartment, so I looked out to see what was going on and what direction they were going in.  I live in a pretty big city and a bad section where there’s always something going on.  I thought I had heard a car chase so that was what had me curious.  It was twilight and the sky was that beautiful mix of colors -of dark blue, light blue, green, yellow, and  then pink and red.  I saw two lights in the far distance rising up into the sky.  I could tell immediately that they were odd by the way they were moving and the way they looked.  They were floating at two different spots.  Blinking on and off.  Red all the time and the white was flashing.  I could tell they were on the horizon but not as far away as stars would be.  They were not planes.  They made no noise.  They flashed on and off, moving at the exact same speed and in the same direction as the other.  Then they simply faded, disappeared, vanished before my eyes.  Just like the ones in 2013.  I could not tell the shape.  All I saw was two lights moving and flashing at the same speed, vanished at the same time.

On the evening of June 12, 2016, I was sitting in the living room of my aunt & uncle's house, talking to my cousin.  I was facing a large bay window and through it I saw what I thought was a plane.  It was heading south, towards us, and had 3 blinking lights.  Two on the left (when facing us) and one on the right.  These lights blinked 2 then 1, 2 then 1, left then right, left then right. As it got closer I couldn't make out its shape so I asked my cousin, ""What's that?""  He thought it might be a helicopter.  To check if it was a helicopter I went outside to see if I could hear it.  I could not. By now the craft was overhead and west of us.  It was essentially flying over the Narrows Bridge along the course southward over the Puget Sound. This is when I took out my iPhone and shot about 35 seconds of footage.  It was now 7:42 pm. I stopped filming because some trees would soon obscure my view.  So I went in the backyard to continue watching it.  I asked my uncle what it was.  He didn't know.  I asked if it could be a helicopter, but he said it was too high.  It was definitely very high and flying at a constant velocity on a flat trajectory. I asked my uncle if he had binoculars.  He went inside and grabbed a pair while I continued watching it.  I pointed out the object to my aunt and 8 year-old son, too.  None of us knew what it was. The object continued moving southward and was soon nearly too small to see.  When my uncle returned with the binoculars I was only able to find the object in my sight once before losing it again.  The sun was lowering and bright enough to where I needed to block it with my hand.  It made finding the object at a distance challenging.  The object then became too faint at such a distance and I lost it. The whole event must've lasted approximately 10 or so minutes.  Maybe 15. A review of the National Weather service showed that at 7:53pm in that vicinity the wind direction was NNE and velocity of the wind was 5mph.",2016-06-16T00:00:00,47.21257223776224,-122.4597204895105

Movement caught my peripheral vision, causing me to look up.  What I noticed surprised me a great deal.  Over my head, traveling quite slowly at, I'd estimate maybe 20mph, was a very large seemingly solid V-shaped object, marked at intervals by slightly yellowish-whitish round lights.  I was so taken aback by this silent figure, I stared very intently and noticed that in between these lights, it was not possible to see stars, which, to me, indicated that the lights were part of some craft, which I had never before seen.  It was a very clear night, and stars were visible in other parts of the sky.   I was so surprised, I turned around and walked back through our courtyard to get my father, who I was certain could conf! irm what I was seeing.  I walked in and explained to him what I saw and that he needed to come outside, but by the time we both arrived back in the courtyard, the lights were much further away and we couldn't examine it further.   My friend later arrived and stated that he, too, had seen the strange formation of lights and watched it disappear on the horizon to the south, which had been the direction it was traveling when I'd stood beneath it.

It was just before 9 PM local time.  I looked up in the northern sky, which was dark.  Normally I see air traffic on final approach to LAX, which is only a few miles north of my home.  Traffic moves East to West on final approach for normal wind patterns, and hence traffic moves right to left as one looks North to the airport.   Tonight, I observed three bright lights, quite high in the northern sky.  They were irregularly spaced, and quite bright, of roughly the same brightness, in roughly a horizontal line (not precisely), and all were orange in color.  The color was strange to me, given the normal landing light (white) and navigation light (red and green) colors.  Usually, with LAX traffic, one can distinguish individual lights on the planes coming in for final.  These were single points as far as I could tell, and no flashing anti-collision lights.  The trio must have spanned 10 or 15 degrees from my vantage point.  Many times the size of a full moon in terms of angular separation between the leftmost and rightmost lights.  The other thing that seemed odd is that they were moving slowly from left to right - in other words Eastward.  That is very unusual for traffic at LAX. I kept my eyes on them on and off as I drove Eastward myself on Artesia Blvd (and Slausson) to the restaurant.  I pulled into the restaurant parking lot, and just as I was looking for a spot, I noticed that the lights were fading out.  No change in flight path.  Soon afterwards they disappeared entirely.  It was unclear whether there was low cloud cover in the distance that was obscuring the view to the lights - the sky was dark so it was impossible to tell.  But the lights never re-appeared.

"Three incredibly white, bright lights in a row that did not change their angle as I passed them, despite being incredibly close.",New Paltz,NY,2013-04-01T00:30:00,light,5 minutes,"Occurred : 4/1/2013 00:30  (Entered as : 04/01/13 0:30) Reported: 3/7/2016 9:54:04 PM 21:54 Posted: 3/11/2016 Location: New Paltz, NY Shape: Light Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/126/S126252.html,"Three incredibly white, bright lights in a row that did not change their angle as I passed them, despite being incredibly close. I was a student attending SUNY New Paltz and was driving home at the time.  It was late at night - I remember it being after midnight, and before 2 am.  More close to 1am. Some time into my trip - perhaps 20 minutes or so - I saw a great blob of lights in the sky that I know to be the lights of aircraft converging into one when viewing at that perfect angle from a distance.  Being that this area is around many populated airports, I thought nothing of it - though I was looking forward to taking a good look at it.  I consider myself to be a skywatcher, so I tend to inadvertently ""memorize"" flight paths, repeating light patterns, types of aircraft, etc....though I can't say I have a ""formal"" knowledge on the subject.  I am just attentive to the sky. I'm watching this series of lights for quite some time waiting for the lights to become detached from their ""blob"" like position (in other words, I was waiting for my angle to change enough so I can glimpse the airplane perhaps coming in to land).  However, it became apparent that these lights were significantly closer than anticipated; what turned out to be a large craft far away but coming in for landing turned out to be quite obviously just over the highway and not much higher than the tree lines. The light was a bright white - typical of aircraft. However, it was a solid ""chain"" of lights in a straight, horizontal line:  1 bulging white light on the left side, a small one in the center, and a bulging white light on the right side.  On top of that, it was incredibly bright - I remember the light, when hitting my windshield, refracted outwards somewhat in a way where the light was ""diffused"" through the glass.  It is difficult to explain, perhaps it isn't even worth mentioning, but it just seemed TOO bright. I'm still thinking that this is definitely a landing aircraft.  But why over the highway? Surely these lights are so bright because they are landing lights.  But why is the craft not moving? Is my speeding too rapid for me to accurately discern the movement of this craft?  I figured in the affirmative, but my startling and persistent thought was that regardless of how fast I was going (60mph or more) it should not have mattered when dealing with large aircraft coming in for landing.  A Helicopter, maybe. Now, I'm very close. I begin to feel fear, actually. I was surprised at this. The reason I felt fear was that I realized that the 3 lights did not change angle despite the fact I was rapidly approaching it. If one were to approach 3 lights in a horizontal row from a distance and proceed to walk passed it, one would logically expect that due to the limitations of our line of sight, at one point while passing the horizontal chain of lights, they would converge into a single point due to the fact that I am currently passing it.  Just the same as looking down a paper towel roll is a simple circle, but turn it sideways and it is a cylinder. What scared me is that I realized that the lights were not changing in relation to my angular change.  As I passed it, it was the same exact 3 lights in a row with no variation. It almost gave the impression that there must have been lights fixed around the basin of the craft equidistance, but even then I did not see any indication of more than 3 lights even while close.  If I could spot the cabin lights on the occasional low flying aircraft, I would have thought that I would spot incredibly bright lights fixated on the bottom of a craft not far above the treeline.  However, it was just the 3 bright lights. At this point, I took a glimpse at the craft while it was directly at my 9 O'clock. Again, 3 straight lights, and perhaps a slight indication of other lighting - but no indication of anything similar to the initial 3 lights. I had rolled my window down quite some time before this part of the scenario. Despite being on a highway, my mind told me that a hovering helicopter or a landing aircraft would yield enough noise for me to hear over the highway.  At the very least, I felt that I would be able to differentiate between the typical sound of the highway when travelling, and perhaps a sound that is out of the ordinary in addition to that sound.  I live in a populated area and often hear helicopters landing for car accidents, and like I said, I'm not knowledgeable with aircraft, but have certainly been exposed to airports, driving near low flying craft, etc. I did not hear a sound.  Not a thing over the highway.  The ""whoosh"" of the driving was loud, sure - but if you were to see the lights, one would think that it would indicate a large energy/audio output.  This was not the case, even after I slowed down to 50 mph. I would also like to add that there were people driving me behind me at this point in time that would have very obviously seen this craft.  It was not able to be missed or overlooked.  However, it could be said that the fact that no cars passed me while I was going at a (comparative) snail's pace at 45-50mph on the highway looking at this thing and not a single vehicle passed me could maybe indicate that these individuals, too, saw this craft and were indeed were slowing down to take a look at it.  Of course, this is speculation. I want to be very clear here - the odds of this being a truly anomalous sighting are nil.  The frequency of aircraft in the area, active airports and things in that nature lead most (and myself) to lean toward the terrestrial aircraft explanation.  However, I bring this to you due to my recent study into your work, and I felt inspired. I would like now to include the hyperlink to the video I took of this object. I do believe that it is a good insight into my mind set at the time - I saw the object from a far enough distance away to prepare my phone that I was going to record with.  Because I became increasingly bamboozled and fearful as I approached this object, my voice in the video becomes obviously elevated and uneasy.  In addition to that, you can hear my roll down the window to listen to the object as I stated above.  In other words, I essentially speak aloud my exact developing mindset as I become increasingly confused.  I really, really felt silly taking my phone out to film this at first.  I hit the record button, kept driving, and realized I had something interesting. Please make note:  If you examine the comments on this Youtube video, I am going to attach, a gentlemen recently left a comment explaining that he saw the craft up close and it flew over him emitting no sound whatsoever.  He also indicated that he felt a brush of air wash over him as the craft passed overhead. This was a development I did not know about until just 3 days ago when he left the comment, which was the last comment this video has received in quite some time.

The second is zoomed in, from the same step location, immediately after the first. I did not notice anything in the sky when I took the photos.  My intent was to get a photo of the city at night. Later when looking at the photos, I noticed the row of lights in the clouds.  I can assume reflection in the clouds, or reflection on the camera lens, but a few observations leaves some doubt.  The lights change position in relation to the buildings.  The lights keep their same relative size to the buildings. I take that to be the lights were in the sky above or beyond the buildings, and the lights moved in relation to the buildings. The other item is that the lowest light is brighter than the 7 above it. The sky was cloudy.  I estimate the distance from the photo position on the museum steps to the tall buildings in the photo is 6000 feet, scaling from a map. Please review the photos I emailed and let me know if you think the largest probability is that it was city lights reflecting, and how to discount the relative position change with the buildings.

April 16, 2016, between 5:45pm and 6:15 pm Vancouver, Canada, at the Queen Elizabeth Theater. I was sitting in front of the Queen Elizabeth Theater on Hamilton Street facing SW.  You can actually see the exact location I was sitting at and the building I'm going to reference by typing in the following url (google maps):  https://www.google.com/maps/@49.2802229,-123.1138337,3a,75y,134.77h,89.03t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1stq4hKv_aL179G_0htw5Qcg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1   This url will bring you to the exact location and you will be facing the same direction I was and seeing what I was seeing. I was sitting right there on the benches in front of the plaza and the building I'll be referencing is the tallest building on the left in the distance.  The large building on the left in front adjacent to the plaza is the Queen Elizabeth Theater. I had arrived early to an event and so I was just sitting there looking at the city when a man on the very top of the distant building on the left caught my eye.  He was wandering along the edge of the building looking over it.  I became very alarmed thinking that he was going to jump off the building.  I was very intent on watching him when way up high to the right (up from the flag poles) a dark disc or sphere shaped object caught my eye.  It just appeared beneath the clouds. It began moving toward the man on the roof, and as it approached him, I could tell that it was moving closer in our direction (later I determined it was heading NE).  It came over the top of the man and for a moment I thought I was going to witness an abduction, it just stopped and hung there, as though observing him. It was much higher than the man and he didn't seem to notice it as he was looking down over the edge.  Another man appeared and the two of the men began talking, as they turned to walk in the other direction, away from the edge, one of the men pointed to the sky, and both of them momentarily seemed to be looking at the same object I was.  They then proceeded to walk out of view (away from the edge) and the object then moved back in the same direction it had come from and disappeared into the clouds. It was very windy that evening, at least up high, as birds were taking advantage of the winds and sailing at high speeds across my view.  The disc shaped object made no sound, wasn't effected by the wind, it traveled in a general north easterly direction, came to a complete stop, waited about 60 seconds, and then traveled back the way it had come and disappeared into the clouds. Meanwhile, I had my cell phone and could have videoed the whole thing,  I even thought about videoing it but thought it was so far away it would be too hard to capture on a cell phone video. In hind sight, I could kick myself now, it would have probably been a very interesting video. The weather data for that day and time was:  Wind velocity:  9mph.

It was moving at a rate that would be consistent with a low-flying small airplane.  There were no running lights, just a bright steady light.  I instantly realized it was an unusual light and quickly called my wife outside.  As I turned back to continue watching, as my wife came out to see, I realized there were two lights.  I pointed out the second one to her.  If this had been a small aircraft at 5,000 to 7,000 feet, we would have easily heard engine noise.  I can't make a good guess of altitude, as there was no way to compare it to anything at the time. The first object I saw was the brighter and larger of the two.  It was slightly brighter than Jupiter is tonight.  My wife and I ran to the east about forty feet to get beyond the trees which were blocking our view momentarily.  She comment that the brighter light seemed to have a shape.  I said it had an angular look and she said, ""Like a boomerang,"" to which I replied, ""Or a crescent shape.""  The color of the brighter object had a  very slight a warm hue, the dimmer object appeared white.  We both watched as the two lights continued eastward at a steady rate, then disappeared behind the peaks of Prater Mountain.  Total elapsed time was about fifty seconds.  Total degree of travel, approximately WNW to ENE from the time I first saw them is about eighty degrees of sky, from my left to my right. The brightest object was about twenty to twenty-five degrees off the horizon.  The dimmer smaller object was closer to thirty degrees off the horizon. The two were separated by approximately three degrees horizontal and five degrees in a downward angle of fifty degrees, the brighter being below and to the right of the dimmer light.  They maintained the same relationship as they moved.  There was absolutely no sound. I grew up living near three air bases and a major civilian airport, and am familiar with many types of aircraft.  My father was a night sky watcher, a veteran navigator in the U.S. Army Air Corps during WWII.  I spent many hours outside with him and our amateur astronomer neighbor watching the skies over Northern California from 1955 to the late 1960s. I have seen many, many aerial phenomena in the skies over Montana and Idaho, and these two objects were certainly among the most interesting.

As I continued to ride home, I thought the lights were just a couple of helicopters.  5 min later I saw the lights again, but they seemed closer and I could see them more clearly.  The two lights were not any aircraft as they were moving too fast back and forth.  So I got my phone out to try to take a video but it was too dark but for some reason I could take clear pictures, so I spent and hour taking numerous pictures as the objects disappeared and reappeared every few seconds.  They were not red or blue but just a plain white colored light, so a good 30 min passed before I finally decided to go home. Once I got home, I've noticed a pattern of the lights, they were not two objects passing back and forth, but two lights going around this one circular object.  I saw this by the way the lights pointed as they disappeared and reappeared in this pattern behind the clouds in the sky.  I don't know if the object was the shape of a sphere, circle, oval, or cylinder as I only saw the lights going in a circular motion.  The best way to describe  what a saw was this circular object with two white lights on the object going around it.   Three hours later I decided to go outside to see if the lights were still there and they were.  My father, sister, and I saw these lights.  I would say the object was pretty massive, no where near the size of an airplane.  The way the lights were traveling around it I would approximate the size as the length of 10 planes or even bigger.

We could see it over a tree line rising 80 feet, as we stood about 100 feet away from those trees.   The flash was to the southeast, and moved in an eastward direction.

Evans in the West, and Longs Peak in the North, but we had no idea the sight we were about to see and it wasn’t listed in any brochure that might have been available. We had just finished the food we had brought with us, shared on a picnic table situated close to the edge of a small cliff that overlooked the Rocky Mountains.  We took the remnants of our food to Larry’s car, placed what remained in the truck and meandered over to a tree that stood in front of the cliff.  There was a valley beyond the tree and beyond that valley were the Rocky Mountains.  Larry stood on one side of the tree, and I on the other side in awe of the sights before us.  We didn’t say a word, just looked at the view enjoying the pristine air, the trees below in the valley and the Rocky Mountain range, so close we could see the green of the pine trees. We must have been standing there for several minutes not saying a word when something came into view that startled both of us.  As we watched, three objects came flying over the trees at great speed and so close they should have touched them.  They quickly dipped down into the valley and hovered over the ground.  I wasn’t sure if I should say something because once those words left my lips I was sure Larry would think I’d gone mad, but discretion was not something that was needed at that moment. And so the words came out of my mouth, “Larry do you see what I see?”  Larry being as stunned as I was said, “What is it you’re seeing?”  Now the cat was out of the bag and it was time to say what I was seeing. “That looks like flying saucers to me.  What do you see?”  At this point I felt a sense of relief flowing over Larry, although neither of us moved an inch from our positions.  “That’s what it looks like to me.”  Larry stated still in awe at what was transpiring before us.  I could hear it in his voice. And so we stood there watching three flying saucers as they flew halfway between us and the Rocky Mountains and then stopped in midair.  A rational moment was somehow needed, so I asked Larry if he thought they were government vehicles, did he see any numbers on them.  Of course no was the answer that came back from Larry which agreed with what I could see from my location. What followed was a four minute conversation between Larry and I trying to make sense of what was happening.  By now one of the flying saucers had gone down to the ground and the other two hovered over it.  As we were trying to figure out what they were doing one of us moved but I’m not sure which one.  I was too absorbed watching those saucers.  The one on the ground had about a three second delay and then flew up to the other two saucers.  By now my mouth was hanging open as one of the saucers started flying toward us.  My mouth flew shut as I yelled to Larry we had to get out of there. We ran to his car as fast as our legs could carry us, arriving at the car as Larry dropped the car keys in his haste to open the door.  “Hurry Larry, it’s almost here.”, as panic took over and all rational thoughts flew out of my head.   Larry backed up the car and started moving forward toward the road that had brought us to this spot just as the saucer started hovering over our car. Just as a child is convinced sheets can protect them at night from scary sounds in the middle of the night, I calmed down surrounded by the safety of our car and looked up at the saucer hovering over us.    I looked at the size of the saucer, it was about 15 or 20 feet across, as far as I could tell from that location, and the bottom of it was a smooth looking type of metal without any rivets or seams of any kind.   There was no propeller and no dust flying around us.  It seemed as if the saucer was flying by some unseen force as my eyes gradually went up to the top of the saucer base.  There were clear looking windows in a circle above the base and I held my breath as I looked up in hopes of seeing what was driving this vehicle.  When I looked into the windows, all I could see was the top of the ceiling. It was bright and sunny when I looked up and just as suddenly it was almost dark outside with me not wondering why there had been such a sudden change in the light.  Larry and I drove off into the now dimming light as the flying saucer returned to the other two saucers and flew back over the Rocky Mountains. I was so excited on the drive home telling Larry we needed to report this incident.  We had seen this in broad daylight, we hadn’t been drinking anything alcoholic and both of us witnessed this event together.  He turned, looked at me with his face screwed up a bit and said he’d lose his job with the Air Force if he reported what we had seen as he was in training at Lowry Air Force Base.     He made me promise I wouldn’t tell anyone, not even my parents as he dropped me off at my home that evening. I would have thought that would have been the end of our adventure, but I was surprised it wasn’t over yet.  A week went by and I was sitting in the shade of my home in the cool grass when a black car came driving up and parked in front of my house.  No one was home at that time; as a matter of fact no one was on the street at that time other than me and this black car.  I was startled to see two men come out of the vehicle.  I was startled because they both had black suits on despite the fact that it was so hot that morning.  Who’d wear black suits in this weather was my only thought as one of them approached me and the other one stayed by the car. It’s difficult remembering that conversation other than a few significant items that have stayed in my head and will forever remain there.  He talked about what I had seen that day at Daniels Park, said that if I ever told anyone about what I’d seen my father would lose his job at Martin Marietta and they would make sure he’d not be employed again.  He was working on the Titan Missile among others things at the time.  Who were these people, how did they know my father worked for Martin Marietta and how did they know I was there that day?  I was in Larry’s car, not mine.  I thought it was silly threatening me when I had told Larry I wouldn’t say anything, but I guess they hadn’t talked to Larry.  I got a hold of Larry on the phone later in the day and was met with another surprise. Larry told me they had been to see him and now he could never see me again.   I asked him over and over what they had said to him but he refused to tell me.  He just kept saying he’d lose his job with the Air Force if he ever saw me again.  I hung up the telephone puzzled and sad.  I had lost someone who I found to be very special to me and all because I’d seen some flying saucers in the summer of 1965. I didn’t tell anyone what I had seen that day so long ago in Daniels Park for concern my father would lose his job with Martin Marietta, but I would have been released from that when he died.  I still kept this story quiet because of other factors that had come into play including my job with the government. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Walking North back from my garage to my house at 10:28pm, I spotted a red light, very bright, in the sky, Northeast from my perspective. It was moving in my direction as I spotted it.   I first thought it was a typical airplane as I live not far from Nashville International  airport approximately 30-40miles south of me and  I see airplanes frequent.   As I was walking up my drive I gave it a second glace and it seemed to stop, so I stopped to get a better look. It just sat there still , I could clearly see a single bright red, and a single flashing green.  I wasn’t sure if it was a single red or two reds that were possibly close together.  I was tyring to figure out what I was looking at when it made a u turn maneuver and started back northeast and then stopped again.  I started walking up my drive quickly as I was trying to get passed a tree until I reached my back door.  I stood there watching it spin and do small maneuvers  almost dancing like.  It never made any noise that I could hear.   I called my brother, he lives next door,  in hope he could run out to see it as well. He was not home but driving home  just seconds away, I was talking to him on the phone as it again turned and flew out of site. He missed it by merely seconds.  The great thing was my brother managed to trip the motion sensor on my front porch cam as he is driving toward me, so I did get about 8 seconds of footage before it moved out of site. Now I’m not saying it was aliens, but a true UFO certainly from my perspective.  I have a fascination with the skies and frequently look at stars and anything moving in them.   Actually I think it was probably military according to lights. It did seem to move like a helicopter, but it made no noise that I could here.  I live in a very quiet town and I can here planes and heilcoptors on a regular basic, even the more stealthy military choppers I can here at that distance, but yet I never heard any noise. 	I was excited to finally see something I couldn’t explain what it was.  I have very good perception of different  things I see in the sky.  I am a model aircraft pilot and enthusiast and I’m aware of the possibility of a drone or an unmanned craft.  It didn’t  strike me as any model type craft.  Funny thing is, it almost seemed  like it saw me looking at it and it did’t know what to do.

I turned to my left and saw her looking out the sliding glass door window and into the cloudless, eastern blue sky.  I asked her what it was she was seeing.  She said, ""There, up in the sky.  That thing is shiny and floating slowly away!  Is it a balloon?""  I got up from the dinner table and walked over to the window and looked out.  In the distance, across and up in the sky–I would say about a few hundred feet in the air, I saw a slow moving object with an oblong oval shape.  It appeared to be more wider vertically than the top and bottom which was more shorter in height than its width.  The bright western sunlight reflected off the object, which appeared to be like a bright and shiny metallic surface.  The size of the object appeared a little smaller than the body length of a Cessna plane. My mother asked if it was a drone or a helicopter.  I told her, ""No,"" as it did not make any sound.  My dad then came over to the window and he saw it.  He was giving the same description that I saw on how it looked.  The strange thing is, this craft was coming from the direction of the runway at nearby Paine Field airport where planes take off and land, but we knew that it could not have just taken off from the runway because it was moving too slow, and was too high since it was so close to the runway.  My dad and I then noticed the craft seemed to climb a few feet higher with its back end in the air and its front lowered at an angle. We watched the craft drift along to the south for about five minutes. Then before we knew it, the craft, which was still visible and not too far off, quickly started fading and disappeared against the blue sky just moments before a large airliner appeared from the south as it was getting ready to land at the Paine Field runway.  We are not sure what this craft was as the entire duration of it went from the north eastern sky to the south.

UFO REPORT:  On June 23, 2016, my buddy and I were talking outside the shop building where we work the night shift.  It was a clear night sky with stars visible everywhere.  I heard the jet engines of an airplane so I looked straight up and it was directly above me and it was being followed by a yellowish/orange light.  I said, “Holy ((deleted)), look at this!”   My buddy jumped out of the chair he was sitting in and looked up.  I said, “There’s a light following that airplane!”  He confirmed that he saw it too. I estimate the airplane was approximately at 20,000 feet.  I say this because normally when jets fly overhead at 40,000 feet by the time we hear them they are already past us and high enough up that all you can make out is the blinking lights.  This plane was low enough that I could see the outline of the plane itself, and as soon as I heard it I looked up and it was directly above us. The light was about the same size as the stars in the night sky and was following the plane at about two airplane lengths behind it, and did not appear to be attached to any other object as I could clearly see the stars without anything blocking them out in the background.  The light was not blinking and remained constant.   As we watched, the light appeared to move under and ahead of the airplane.  Then it got closer to and moved ahead of the plane, got closer to the front of the plane and moved ahead of it again several times. I looked at my fit bit and noted the time was 10:55 P.M. Mountain Standard time.  I also noted the plane and light were moving from east to west. After about 40 seconds of observing the plane and the light, my buddy noted that the airplane's navigation light began blinking.  Up until then we had not seen the lights on the plane blinking. I can’t say for certain, but I suspect the plane was a B-1 bomber flying out of Elsworth Air Force base from Rapid City.  They fly into our airport often and the roar of the engines are unmistakable.  This plane had a similar sound to the engines. After about one minute we lost sight of the plane and the light. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  He said that he would try to induce the other witness to submit a report, as well, but he was not confident that the individual would be willing to do it.

A moment later, we heard knocking at the door. I knew it was my brother and assumed he forgot his phone or wallet and needed to get it before leaving. When I opened the door, my brother asked me to come out and see something strange.  When I walked outside he pointed to two orange lights just above the tree line towards the Northeast.  I immediately dismissed the lights as aircraft.  He corrected me and said they were moving unlike normal aircraft.  He described the objects having moved parallel to each other before rotating and changing direction.  Again, I dismissed him as I only saw two orange lights.  One was stationary and the other was moving similarly to an airplane. He asked me to note the orange nature of the objects and compare them to the light blue stars and the light blue lights of another obvious aircraft behind us. After the comparison, I did admit to the variation in light but simply dismissed the one moving object as an airplane.  The other object I assumed was a planet due to its stationary position and orange glow. By this time, the moving object had disappeared behind the tree line while the stationary object remained in view.  My brother attempted to explain the strange nature of the object's movements when, suddenly, the stationary orange dot began to move.  This startled me.  I watched with astonishment as the object moved along the sky and was temporarily obscured by the tree line before coming back into view.  A moment later, the object faded away like an ember flickering and going out. I was honestly shocked and embarrassed by what I saw.  I am not the type of person who likes attention or believes in intelligent extraterrestrial visitors.  But I do believe in UFOs...  In the purely defined way of something being unidentified.  And what I saw could not be identified. These dots of light were orange, looked like bright stars and appeared to be distant.

I don't know much about drones, but I don't think they go that high and I don't think they have orange lights that flicker off.

At about 4am, my friend and I were standing in our backyard, which is surrounded by strawberry fields.  We are away from the bright lights of any city, and we often stargaze on clear nights.  This morning, while looking towards the northwest sky, we both noticed a bright and shining light that seemed to (at first) be pulsating...we have an app called sky guide that shows us where objects are in the night sky, and this was not an object identified on any of our apps.  As we continued to watch, the light appeared to be moving in various formations, and actually seemed to split off and away from another similar entity before returning back to the object (or beside it maybe)....it hovered and zoomed about as if it was teleporting to the side/to and fro from the central origin point and appeared to be at least 2...probably 3 in formation moving in unison.  What was most amazing was the rotation of colors that presented!  We are typically used to seeing the GPS aircra! ft above us (they have red, white, and blue blinking lights) that are VERY common, especially in the past few years.  To a novice viewer, these GPS craft can very easily seem exotic.  This was NOT any type of craft or sky object that either of us had ever seen before-in fact, I couldn't stop staring in amazement as each second seemed more and more unbelievable.  Right above the distant silhouette of the tree line, this ""light"" actually transformed  itself from a glow similar to that of a bright white star to greenish blue to red (in rapid succession) and then eventually back to white while hovering, glowing brighter (similar to watching the backside of thrusters being engaged) then fading and appearing to finally move away and quickly increase altitude until it was GONE!   Afterwards, I studied the placement of the stars, etc, Mercury was at the same height of the entity but directly southwest vs northwest where the light had been.  The only bright star between Mercury ! and the strange light was Vega...this craft or crafts were brighter.  Sunrise came about an hour afterwards.  We will continue to search the skies for this as well!",2016-06-10T00:00:00,30.6372,-90.5493

When I first saw the object, I thought it was a satellite but when the object came closer towards me I could see individual creamy white lights on it.  The white lights were solid and did not strobe.  The object also seemed to be oval in shape as I could see an oval or boomerang shaped front that was silhouetted in the night sky.  I did not observe any red or green lights on the object.  At 45 degrees, I would estimate the size of the craft was about a quarter to an eighth of the size of my thumb. The second thing was a bright strobe-like light that lit up the sky.  Not sure where or what caused the strobe but it was very bright and white.  The light was seen in the south to southwest sky.

Its distance was only about 2 miles from where we had sighted it, flying over the West Ward of the city.  I could only guess at the size of the craft, possibly being 70-75 ft. from tip to tip of the wingspan. When first noticed, the bright-white lights on its underside were facing us, as it was banking 90 degrees on its port side.  There were at least four, but more probably six lights, all white and very bright. When I had first spotted it, the aircraft was flying in an easterly direction in this 90 degree position, then it hooked sharply and headed NNW, immediately leveling out its flight after completing the turn.  I believe one red and one green, slow-flashing light was positioned respectively on the left and right wing-tops as it headed away from us. The total time of observation was about 30 seconds. I've never seen a craft of this size move this slow, traveling this low and making such an immediate hard turn.

Some people that I have described the sighting to, believe it may have been a military drone.  Possibly, of the TR-3 family.",2016-05-06T00:00:00,40.68146598360656,-75.2432762295082

As I unhooked the chain I was drawn to look up towards a bright moon.  It had been somewhat cloudy and I had not noticed any moon up until now.  When I looked up to the light I saw a very bright, flaming blue egg, travel from east to west very quickly and disappear from sight behind the hills behind my cabin.  This was to the south of where I stood, at about 55* angle looking up.   I have the impression that it had traveled from the south and turned west, but I did not see it actually turn or change direction.  I did see it travel, and it was quiet, fast, had no trailing tail of smoke or light, and was like it was on fire in a colour similar to natural gas (without any yellow or white) when used on a cooking stove.  I had seen falling stars, planes , jets, helicopters, lasers, fireworks, this was nothing like them.  I was once in a place and two of us heard a crackling and looked up to see debris coming thru the atmosphere, this egg was nothing at all like that.   I have seen lightning appear from the sky and seen it shoot from the ground, this flaming egg was similar in colour, but not in line of travel. I have never seen anything like this. I am an intelligent normal person, was not under the influence of alcohol or anything disruptive. This sighting bothers me because it is a ufo for me and I have no explanation. I saw this from the town ""site"" of Miller River Washington, west of Skykomish.  I believe it traveled west much closer to Mt Cleveland than Dorothy Lake, perhaps towards Coney Basin.  Was pretty hard to tell, this happened very fast, none of my neighbors were home to ask about it either.  I immediately called a friend that lives a few miles east of me and they were in Monroe and saw nothing.   As of this time no one has said they also saw something.  There are very few people that live in my area exactly, FYI. but I will keep asking around.  I also texted my son, hoping he would check online for any s! ightings, none found so far.

This object looked like a plane, but not one I've ever seen before.  There were no markings no lights, it was large and dark beige in colour, twin tail.  It might of been flying around 300 feet.  The real odd thing it didn't make any noise and it had 2 props.   Also it was heading in a west direction then pulled a 45 degree turn with out banking, (like driving a car) and headed south I watched it for about 2 minutes, and it disappeared.   I've never seen a plane like this before.  The other odd thing it was flying very slow.  It should have crashed at the speed it was going. I've never seen anything like this in my life.  I wish I had a camera with me at the time.  I think it flew over the school to see what was going on there.  They have been doing some upgades and repairs to the school for the last 3 months.   Some of the workmen on the roof might off seen it, if they had looked up, but when you are working on a roof, you are usually looking down, and since it made no noise, they might of not noticed it up there.

It was still, not moving at all, for the first 30 seconds or so that I saw it, and then it started to slowly float across the sky.  The object was not making any sound at all but it did have bright white/yellow lights around the object.  I quickly woke up my husband so that he could see this thing, and he also thought it was strange.  We both saw the object slowly float through the sky and I followed it as much as I could before I could not see it anymore. I also noticed there was a regular airplane further up in the sky at the same time which seemed to be traveling normally across the sky.  We live by an airport so I am used to seeing normal planes fly around our home.  But this object was flying way closer to the ground than an ordinary plane would, it made no sound whatsoever, and it was just standing still for a while before moving slowly away-which is not typical airplane behavior. There were two vehicles that were driving down my street at the same time of the sighting and I am certain they had to see this object too-I was hoping to find a sighting report here to confirm that we are not crazy.  :) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first I believed it to be a helicopter, as military flights are common in this area, but unlike any aircraft I have ever seen (military or otherwise) it had no red or green navigation lights.  The only lights I could see were several bright orange ones (approximately four, but it was difficult to tell exactly as they were very close together) which were pulsing, going dim and then becoming bright again, unlike typical aircraft lights which flash rapidly. I observed the object traveling towards me for over a minute, after which it began an eastward turn out over the ocean, which is also very uncharacteristic of aircraft (both military and civilian) in the area as they always travel right along the beach, never turning out over the water like that. At that point I could see that the orange lights were arranged in somewhat of a diamond pattern with one light out front, one light to the rear, and two lights in between those two with one being slightly higher and one slightly lower.  When the object had completed its turn and began to head out over the water, the lights quickly began to fade and the object had vanished entirely a matter of seconds after making its turn.  The object appeared to be much too low to have disappeared into the clouds, which were very high and sparse and would not have hidden the object from sight for more than a few seconds anyway.

The object was fixed in the sky, and I could not determine the distance from my home.  It appeared above the mountains.   Using binoculars I could determine that the object was displaying three different color lights, red, white and green.  The object stayed in a fixed position until the clouds obscured it, and later when the clouds were gone, it was daylight.   I was concerned that this might just be a star, or something, so this morning, I awoke at the same time to observe the sky in the same position.  The object was not there.",2016-06-16T00:00:00,,

My husband said that’s weird the lights on those planes aren’t blinking.  I was like oh ok who cares.  Then he was like also one of them isn’t moving, they are just hovering.  Then we thought helicopter??  But it seemed really high for a helicopter and we couldn’t hear anything, we can usually hear a faint roar when a plane flies over.   So then one of the “lights” starts moving really slowly through the clouds heading east, while the other stayed still.  An actual plane flew by as this was happening, the plane was much faster with blinking lights and we could hear it.   The east light moved for about 5-6 minutes then stopped and hovered.

A storm clouds had just passed Kingsville...there was no rain but still enough sunlight.  I looked up at the sky and noticed a bright light almost like a bright star!  I wondered how could I see a star when the sky was completely covered with dark clouds!  I looked around and also noticed another bright star around 1/2 mile from the first one.  I asked myself if it was a drone or what could these two shining objects be?  Where they under the clouds or above...it either case, the objects were like stars blinking on and off and not moving.  After 5 minutes, I contacted the Kingsville Police Department to send an officer to see what I was seeing.  The department was too busy to send someone.  I kept looing at both stars and noticed that one star had completely disappeared.  I kept looking at the other one left for about five minutes.  It was not moving.  I noticed that lighting was traveling from cloud to cloud on the west side, but I kept staring at the only star left.  All of a sudden, the star turned bright ""red"" and traveled to the direction of the lighting.  It moved so fast (without me hearing any sound) as a spacecraft as seem on television.  These two objects were not from earth, in my opinion. These stars to me were attracted to the lighting and one of them headed in the direction of the lighting.   I telephoned the Kingsville Naval Air Station this morning and spoke about what I saw.  That individual said that is was only an electrical event and nothing else.  I do not buy this theory!  I am very skeptical about life beyond earth, but after seeing what I saw… I believe that there is life beyond earth! I am religious and spoke with some religious leaders about what I saw.  They informed me that it was a sign from God to me to ask Him what He wanted from me?  That what I see was only meant for me to see and no one else!  I do believe in God, but cannot accept from these religious leaders what they told me.  Since Tuesday, May 17, 20! 16, I will always believe that there are ""beings"" from space that are watching our earth.

I was sitting on top of Mt. Umunhum with two of my friends.  We were smoking a cigarette when I noticed that slightly over a mountain to my left there was a red orbish looking craft moving similarly to a bumblebee, jolting back as it moved left.  After about 30 seconds of this the craft paused, then started slightly ascending and moving to the right.  It was still redish orange at this point.  About this time the people I was with saw how oddly it was moving.  It started ascending higher and higher before moving to where it was centered from out perspective to the city.   At this point it had gone from more red to slightly more orange and had quick flashes of blue. As it moved over the city the flight patterned changed from a jolty flowing pattern to soaring through the sky above the city until it just stopped.  Once it stopped it alternated between red, orange, blue, and white before flashing what I could describe as an almost yellow light.  The shape seemed to have! changed as well going from a distinct orb to a diamond.  The light being emitted was the shape of a diamond with a gap through the center of the diamond.  It did this for about 30 second or so before going back to a red orb and flying west away.  Being terrified me and my 2 friends were trying to figure out what we just saw for about 10 minutes.  Then around 1 AM, the craft hovers over the mountain northwest from us and starts flying distinctly in our direction, very confidently.  As it got closer I looked away for a second before I hear ""it disappeared"".  At this point we said 'we have to leave now', and as we drive down the mountain I see it once more just floating in the sky.  It was white with an orange tint around the edge of emitted light.

From afar it had blinking green and red lights with a bright white light in the center similar to a Cessna 172 or news helicopter.   As we drove under it, I realized that it was hovering and it was not a helicopter. The craft was triangular and either completely transparent or black like the night sky with red and green blinking lights on the corners and a large white light in the center like an engine of some sort.  It was about the size of a small plane and was spinning slowly as it hovered. Unless this was a very advanced stealth military drone i can not explain what it is that i saw.  I am a 16 year birder having seen over 300 species in my lifetime.  I am also familiar with all current U.S military aircraft and i have seen stealth bombers and fighters before, and this was different.

Then after about ten more minutes, I saw it again, more directly east, it was stationary and was about 30 degrees above the horizon.  (I am not good at knowing degrees, so I am guessing but you can observe it from my photos). There was a boat out in the ocean that looked as it may have been trying to go towards the object, I presume for curiosity sake.  Then a small plane and two helicopters flew around above us at the beach. The black helicopter was  hovering over the ocean, then moved over the beach (going east to west , yet sideways????), most likely trying to photograph it from a distance????  Not sure.  Very odd to hear the two copters and a small plane at the same time in the same area.... I decided to take photos with my iPhone to document it, as it was not a usual sighting.  Maybe it was a weather balloon? It was just odd....so bright -enough to stand out.  It did not scoot around...but did go from south east to east within the 45 minutes I observed it, and it had disappeared during the location transition. The object was still there when I left.

My father was driving me to Elizabeth City, NC from Greenville, NC to visit my sister. We made a stop in Hertford, NC and visited my grandmother for about an hour or so.  This day was very bizarre when it comes to UFOs..  Earlier, my sister was watching a UFO documentary.  When we arrived in Hertford, NC, and my uncle was watching a UFO documentary. Anyway, We finally left around Midnight.  As we were about to make a left turn to head to Elizabeth City, NC, I noticed 3 lights hovering in the sky out in the field.  I demanded my father to pull over so we could get out and take a closer look.  I told him ""Dude!  There is a UFO over there!  I swear..  Please trust me just pull over.  That thing is huge!""  I was very shocked to see it. So me and my father got out of the car and walked about 10 or 15 feet behind the car so we could see the object behind the trees.  I thought I was going to have a heart attack I was so worked up.  My blood pressure was sky high.. At this point it was quite low and not moving at all.  One of the three lights kept going dim.  The object was making a loud swooshing/wah wah sound.  Unlike any sound I have ever heard..  I asked my dad, ""Do you hear that?!  That's the UFO making that noise!  That must be the engine or something""  We were very shocked.  He said he's never seen anything in the sky like that before.  They definitely were not stars.  After staring at the object for a few minutes, we resumed driving to Elizabeth City, NC.  The object was still in the sky.  Very large, I'd say the size of a football field if not bigger.  I said ""This must be a Mothership."" So, as we arrive at my sister's house in Elizabeth City, I ran inside to get my cousin.  Because me and him experienced a UFO sighting about 10 years ago in the daylight.  But that's another story.. He came outside with us to view the object.  He said ""Wow seriously?  I was just inside watching a documentary on UFO's!""  I found that very bizarre, as my sister and uncle were also watching documentaries earlier. At this point, it was higher in the sky and 2 of the lights were very dim.  Also, you didn't hear the noise it was making in Hertford. He said, ""That's the mothership!  They were just talking about this on TV!""  I was amazed he said that, because I had just said that about 30 minutes ago, when we first saw it in Hertford. I went back outside at 3AM and the object wasn't there.  It was very cloudy at this point.   This was a very cool experience and I was very happy to experience with a few family members.  You had to have been there to really understand this sighting.  What a crazy night. I was able to capture a few photographs of the object, but they didn't turn out very well.  I will try and add them to this post. Thank you very hearing my story!  - ((name deleted))",2016-05-10T00:00:00,36.197514999999996,-76.35684499999999

(Husband's perspective) My wife and I took our sailboat to Beauty Bay in northeast Lake Coeur d' Alene, ID.  We like this part of the lake because it is secluded and quiet this time of year, with buoys that we can tie up to.   We arrived at about 8 pm and went to into the cabin to sleep at about 9 pm.  No other boats were in the area and there is only 1 house on the bay. At 10:26 pm, I woke up to the boat rocking back and forth pretty intensely, like it would if caught in a storm.  The water in this bay is still and calm, even in the busy part of the year, so I was concerned.  Still in bed, I glanced around the cabin and saw white light coming in from the port side windows.  The boat was still rocking hard, which then woke up my wife. She was scared, and I turned my attention to her.  She said, ""Oh my god, I think someone's on the boat, did you see that light?""  I was looking at her, and away from the cabin entry door, which she said filled with light as though from flashlights from someone above us. She asked me to go check it out. By that point the boat stopped rocking, maybe 15 seconds after I woke up.  I grabbed my phone, turned on its flash light, and tentatively opened the overhead sliding door.  I looked around the cockpit of the boat, and saw nothing.  The water at this point was perfectly calm and the area was awash in silence.  Everything appeared normal and there was no sign of intruders.  I turned to look at the bow of the boat and saw nothing. Up in the southeast sky (or maybe south west, I don't know which direction the boat was pointing at the time) I saw a bright white light that I at first thought was a helicopter.  The light shined down toward my area, but was rotating in circles, as though looking for something.  The craft was relatively low, just above the neighboring hills, possibly lower as it made its way over the bay. The craft made no sound. I assumed it was a helicopter and retreated back into the cabin. We woke up in the morning at 7:30 and talked about the night, trying to rationalize what happened.  I can normally explain events with science or justify them with surroundings, but this time I had nothing.  What rocked the boat in a calm, lonely bay? What filled the cabin with light?  What was the silent craft pointing it's light down toward us?  My wife called the local police, who said there were no helicopters, police nor medical, in the area.  They also called Spokane, who also didn't have any activity in the area.  The lady on the phone recommended we contact the UFO reporting center, which is something I never thought I'd need to do. I am 39 years old and own a marketing company.  I'm college educated and have never touched drugs, nor do I drink alcohol. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with both the husband and wife, and they both sounded to us to be quite sober-minded people.  We suspect that they are highly reliable, and capable, people.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESSES, FOLLOWING RADIO APPEARANCE ON JUNE 01, 2016.) Bright light and rocking boat on calm waters. ADDENDUM to original report by ((husband's name deleted)) and ((wife's name deleted))  There are a couple of pieces of additional information I feel we should mention. The boat rocked hard at an estimated 15 degree angle, back and forth port to starboard roughly every second for about 15 seconds.  After the boat shook, my husband said the water remained glass-like and perfectly still.  He was on deck just seconds after the boat became still, yet the water showed no turbulence or other signs of disturbance. After checking the boat for intruders and scanning the bay for other boats, ((husband)) noticed the light in the sky and watched until it faded away.  He said it was about the altitude of the surrounding hills and smaller than the full moon but very bright.  The light was likely in the southeast sky moving northwest.  (Determined by the most likely positioning of the boat in the water.)  The light didn't streak or shoot away, just faded. ((husband)) then came back into the cabin assuming it was a helicopter. I questioned why it wasn't making any noise and wondered where it went after he lost sight of it, but we didn't have an answer. After the incident occurred, we crawled under the covers, held each other, and both fell back to sleep very quickly.  Morning came in a flash.  The relief in knowing there wasn't anyone else on board our boat was comforting and the bizarre circumstances didn't begin to alarm us until we had time to ponder the events when we woke up. In addition, we were awakened by the chirping of at least a dozen birds the next morning.  When I finally peeked out of the cabin door, I had to take a video because there were birds chirping and fighting and flying quickly all around the boat.  That hadn't happened on other boat trips.  After stopping the video, more birds tried landing on the metal railings on the boat and flew back quickly, seemingly unable or unwilling to land.  Others were able to land on the canvas cover on the back of the boat, but fought for the area. The birds were not unique...  Their behavior was.

Quiet night on the boat disrupted by shaking and bright lights (wife's perspective),Coeur d'Alene,ID,2016-05-06T22:26:00,light,1 minute,"Occurred : 5/6/2016 22:26  (Entered as : 05/06/16 22:30) Reported: 5/7/2016 10:24:58 AM 10:24 Posted: 5/10/2016 Location: Coeur d'Alene, ID Shape: Light Duration:1 minute",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/127/S127215.html,"Quiet night on the boat disrupted by shaking and bright lights (wife's perspective) My husband and I moored our sailboat at a buoy in Beauty Bay in north-east Lake Coeur d'Alene, ID, on May 6th, 2016.  I awoke to a bright light coming in through the spaces around the cabin door (roof of the cabin) at 10:30 at night.  At first, I thought someone had boarded our boat because it went from perfectly still to rocking intensely from side to side.  This rocking only lasted about 5-10 seconds before it was still again. My husband was also awakened by this and, while he didn't see the light coming from the door, he saw it outside the window.  I urged him to investigate and when he went up, hesitantly, he said he saw a bright light coming from the sky searching the area. When I asked him what was out there, he told me that there weren't any boats approaching or leaving the bay and that there were still no other boats in this tiny bay. He said all he could see was a helicopter searching the area.  I thought this was bizarre since neither of us heard any noise as one might expect from a helicopter or airplane.  When I asked him if it was shaped like a helicopter, he said all he could see was the light, not the body of the aircraft.  He also said that the one bright light was moving in circles searching the area (not the aircraft, just the spotlight). I called the Coeur d' Alene police department and asked if there were helicopters in the area.  The lady I spoke to looked and said that there weren't any police or medical helicopters in the area, but there was one medical helicopter at the south end of the lake.  She also said that, being a medical emergency, even if it had gone through our area, which was unlikely, it wouldn't have hovered or searched with a light.  She then contacted the Spokane police department to see if they had come into Kootenai County and they said their helicopters were in Medical Lake, WA, at that time last night. I'm logical and skeptical and search for scientific explanations.  I am 35 years old and healthy and have never done drugs in my life.  I have a Masters degree and work in the field of education. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to us to be quite eloquent, and quite sober-minded.  We suspect that both she and her husband are reliable witnesses.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESSES, FOLLOWING RADIO APPEARANCE ON JUNE 01, 2016.) Bright light and rocking boat on calm waters. ADDENDUM to original report by ((husband's name deleted)) and ((wife's name deleted))  There are a couple of pieces of additional information I feel we should mention. The boat rocked hard at an estimated 15 degree angle, back and forth port to starboard roughly every second for about 15 seconds.  After the boat shook, my husband said the water remained glass-like and perfectly still.  He was on deck just seconds after the boat became still, yet the water showed no turbulence or other signs of disturbance. After checking the boat for intruders and scanning the bay for other boats, ((husband)) noticed the light in the sky and watched until it faded away.  He said it was about the altitude of the surrounding hills and smaller than the full moon but very bright.  The light was likely in the southeast sky moving northwest.  (Determined by the most likely positioning of the boat in the water.)  The light didn't streak or shoot away, just faded. ((husband)) then came back into the cabin assuming it was a helicopter. I questioned why it wasn't making any noise and wondered where it went after he lost sight of it, but we didn't have an answer. After the incident occurred, we crawled under the covers, held each other, and both fell back to sleep very quickly.  Morning came in a flash.  The relief in knowing there wasn't anyone else on board our boat was comforting and the bizarre circumstances didn't begin to alarm us until we had time to ponder the events when we woke up. In addition, we were awakened by the chirping of at least a dozen birds the next morning.  When I finally peeked out of the cabin door, I had to take a video because there were birds chirping and fighting and flying quickly all around the boat.  That hadn't happened on other boat trips.  After stopping the video, more birds tried landing on the metal railings on the boat and flew back quickly, seemingly unable or unwilling to land.  Others were able to land on the canvas cover on the back of the boat, but fought for the area. The birds were not unique...  Their behavior was. That's when we descended back into the cabin to discuss the possibilities and try to explain the strange night.  We ruled out cars passing on a shore road, ruled out other boats, and ruled out someone getting on the boat.  We even wondered if a car had fallen into the bay.

Background that may be relevant:  I live in a remote area outside of Telluride up in the mountains (around 10,000 ft elevation).  A few months ago I was SURE I had seen a disc-shaped UFO land with white lights land below the mountains that comprise our ""view"" out of the picture window in our living room.  At the time, I convinced myself otherwise and figured no one would have ever believed me.  It was gone before I could get a picture and I was sure I must have just mistaken a private airplane since there are folks in the area with them.  That being said, what I saw was NOT the shape or size of a private plane.  It was much larger (perhaps because it was lower than planes usually are) and completely NOT a plane's shape.  I kept this sighting to myself. Fast forward to last night at just after 3am.  I was alone with my toddler at home and was awoken by an insanely bright light being shone coming down into our house angled from above.  It was blinking on and off at a normal interval (for 3 seconds or so lights would be ON, 8 seconds they would be OFF).  It seemed to be coming from above the area in between our home and our neighbor's home which is actually the guest house on the property.  It was like my whole house was getting lit up by a flood light.  Because we live in the middle of nowhere on a mountain top, that amount of light is noticeable and jarring… This went on for about 45 minutes to an hour - pretty sure it was just hovering above our property or parked in the trees?? (I think - I was actually terrified and just put the covers over my head after walking around the house a bit and making sure doors were locked (as if that would matter, right??)). Because my husband is out of town, and I let my 4-year old son sleep in our room with me, I did not want to wake him or scare him and I was way too chicken to actually go out and look at the full shape of the craft (or get a picture - DUH!!), but I believe it is likely a craft like the one I saw before (disc-shaped with white lights on the bottom) based on the way the light was hitting our home and the one across the way. I cannot tell you how insanely BRIGHT the light was. All of the lights in our place were off and this lit the whole place up. I am regretting I didn't get a picture for proof, but I was actually a little worried about my safety because this thing was right outside our window above the house.  Whoever or whatever was in there would have definitely seen me and I did not want to see them!  We had our blinds shut in our bedroom save for a 2-3 inch crack at the very top which is why the light came in and was shining right on my face and woke me, but at the same time, I could not actually see the whole ship either (these are the kind of blinds that drop from the top of the window).  Our bedroom is the one room on the side of the house that the light was coming from but the light was hitting in through to our living and dining rooms as well. Not sure what else to say - I know I didn't fully ""see"" a UFO this time around (though I now believe I saw either this same craft or one like it a few months back), but I KNOW that I fully experienced it.  I can't wait for next time - I'll be ready and think to get phone or video then (if I don't completely freeze up and chicken out)!!!

We asked whether the effects she describes above might have been caused by a sighting of Venus, and she was emphatic in assuring us that Venus could not have caused the flickering effect of light she witnessed in her home.

We were all talking and laughing, and all of a sudden a bright round object caught my eye as I was gazing West along the horizon.  It appeared to be a “ball” or point of bright glimmering light, and it flickered different colors: red, white, blue, and maybe green. It was visible just above a stand of trees obscuring the horizon, and was in a solid position in relation to an electrical pole and wire, so we could all judge its lack of movement.  It appeared to not move, and just hover in one spot in the sky for close to one hour.  It did move very slowly over the course of this hour, however.  The only reason we could perceive this was because of the electrical wire, and its position around it.  But as I said, the movement was so slow that it wasn’t perceivable otherwise. It was quite far away - I cannot guess how many miles or kilometers, but it was so far away that we got out the binoculars to get a better look at it.  It was very difficult to focus on (just from the unsteadiness of our arms holding up the binoculars) but from the best of my knowledge it just appeared to be a ball, or point of light.  It continued to flicker different colors, and was very beautiful to look at. Towards the end of the hour, it seemed to recede and the flicker faded as well.  It very slowly got further and further away, as well as closer to the horizon (and trees that were blocking our view).  It finally moved behind a tree, and we could no longer see it.

I looked up into the sky and saw an object moving around, appearing as a row of 6 or 7 lights across what I would say was the front of it.  This appeared to be one object – not 6 or 7 objects.  I got the impression it could have been round, but could only see it as a row or line of lights.   The lights were usually white, sometimes there would be a red light or two that would appear, and then vanish.  At times it appeared the lights were rotating, but there was no consistent pattern.   The moon was bright in the sky and even though there was a very thin layer of haze from clouds, for the most part the sky appeared clear.  It was possible to see the stars through the haze. Size of the object was difficult to estimate.  The “front” of the object appeared to be similar to what the length of a typical commercial passenger jet would be at that same position in the sky. What caught my attention the most was the way the object was moving – up, down, side to side, back and forth, fast, slow, doing “turns on a dime”, and having such sudden acceleration to “hop” around the sky while it was changing its direction.   Sometimes it was moving fast, other times slower.  No conventional aircraft – plane (jet or not), blimp, or helicopter – could have done these maneuvers, especially at speed.  It displayed varying rates of speed, which were not linear, and it did not matter whether it was climbing, turning, etc.  There was no correlation of direction of movement to change of speed.   It certainly wasn’t a balloon, either.  The area of the sky in which it appeared is just west of the usual flight path of jets, yet there were no aircraft in the area that I could see until right before it disappeared. I have lived near military bases and airports and have never seen aircraft do these types of maneuvers.  I did attempt to video the object but there was too much ambient light for it to show up.",2016-04-22T00:00:00,36.354024242424245,-86.76205

This occurred in 1978 but the memory lives in our minds as it were last night.  We feel highly appreciative for the experience and are not afraid to openly discuss it without any intentions of financial gain. It was the summer of 1978.  Santa Clarita Valley is located north of the San Fernando Valley and north of Los Angeles.  Santa Clarita was then a small and laid-back community mostly referred to as Valencia.  We recently relocated back from a two-year international management assignment followed by a two-year management assignment in Arizona.  We then were transferred to California and chose Santa Clarita because of the open spacious country living, low crime statistics, no smog, and nice neighborhoods.  I purchased a two-story corner house with a swimming pool. One Friday evening, around 7:30PM, I was using a long pole with an attached brush designed to sweep the walls of the pool.  Our children would probably swim early the following morning and I wanted the pool to be clean.  As I reached upwards on the pole to push downwards I saw a craft approaching.   The craft was at a distance equivalent one or two short blocks away and not flying parallel to streets but on a southeastern direction directly towards my position.  It was immediately obvious to me that the craft was not a helicopter nor airplane since these would not normally fly that low and the physical characteristics did not match these.  At that distance the craft seemed wider, with luminous lights in the circumference area of the frontal section (referred to as leading edge).  I stared at it for a brief perplexed 10 seconds.   After realizing that it was something out of the ordinary, I ran down the steps from the poolside deck platform where I had been standing.  The platform was about four feet higher than the pool water and the opposite surrounding pool deck area.   It was about 15 fast running steps from there to the backyard entry to the family room.  My wife and two children were watching television there.  I yelled for them to come outside and see, but only my wife came out, the children were watching television.   My wife and I walked fast, perhaps 30 feet, towards the side of the pool opposite the platform side where I had been standing.  By that time the craft was right over our pool area at an altitude of no more than 50-75 feet and perhaps even less. The craft had come to a complete stop in proximity over one end of the pool area as we stood almost bellow it.  The craft made no sound whatsoever.  It wobbled slightly as if it was moved by the wind, but there was no noticeable wind at that moment.  The craft leaned forward and downwards and then we saw a large forward angled window, located bellow the leading edge that was perhaps 8 feet in length and 3-4 feet in height. We could see an orange bluish glow from inside but no occupants or controls.  As the craft leaned forward I could see light emanating from its upper section and not from the pool lights reflection since the pool lights would be unable to reflect on the upper section.  The craft seemed to be manufactured as one solid piece.  There were no visible seams or rivets. The bottom of the craft was concave towards the center.  In the deepest section of the concave center two rectangular objects were visible, which ran the length of the deep concaved section and seemed to be a few feet apart from each other.  The craft had an upper dome with porthole like windows but no internal visibility.  The upper dome was round and centered in relation to the lower part of the craft with no visible seams.   The total height of the craft appeared to be the equivalent of a one and half story typical track residence or less.  I calculated the height by comparing it to our two-story house.  The diameter was a! pproximately 50-60 feet or less.  There were no visible markings, insignias or identification on the craft. Under the front leading edge of the circular craft was some ski like protruding devices with two side-by-side configurations.  The design I cannot replicate even though I always scored high in I.Q, tests where design progressions (similar to mathematical progressions) had to be decided from multiple drawing choices.  I also remember thinking they were too far forward from the crafts center of gravity something we studied in Group Propulsion in relation to the length and loading of aircraft.  The ski-like devices were similar to the letter “S” with the top of the S facing forward but with more elaborate details filling the gaps.  At the time my conclusion, at the time, was they were some type of hanging or anchoring device. During the entire experience lasting some 45 seconds or longer, my wife kept repeating “Oh my God!” over and over again.  I tried to concentrate on details and in my mind kept repeating “take me with you.”   We were both frozen in awe and disbelief.  It was like seeing a large bus that I previously described as a Greyhound bus floating over your house.   Both of us looked upwards and did not speak to each other during the sighting.  There was no fear, an unprompted paralysis, and a high respect to what we were seeing.  We both had the sensation of being watched primarily because the craft maneuvered downward at an angle towards us, and then regained a level position parallel to the ground. As a part of my analysis during the experience I listened for other engines, other craft, or the possibility that this craft was being suspended from another craft as a hoax but concluded there were no other man-made craft in the vicinity.  The craft then began to move at a very slow speed of around 20 miles per hour. I jumped on a wall that surrounded our backyard so that I could see the trajectory.  I saw it between houses as it continued at that speed for at least 7 miles from our house, and heading in a southeast direction from Santa Clarita over a mountainous section of eastward Los Angeles County.  I instructed my wife not to discuss it but to try to draw what she saw and then we would compare drawings.  My drawings had more details.  Then we began comparing the experience and both had seen the very same details. My conclusion is that the craft wanted us to observe it or perhaps was examining us. I am 100% sure this was not a man-made craft or technology.  I am also convinced by the event that U.S. Government intelligence agencies know we are being visited by extra-terrestrials and are hiding facts.  To me, the only rationale reason is because they lied once about their existence (perhaps Roswell and others) and the complex structured secretive system is unable to reverse course, or that disclosure may cause the loss of statutory governmental powers as citizens realize that borders, religions and global federal governments are meaningless and helpless.   My conclusion leads me to think that the visitors do not wish to work with a single government as they are roaming global skies making their presence known.  There were lingering questions in my mind after the sighting.  Since the craft must originate from an advanced civilization why do they need windows?  My technical assumption is that a! n advanced civilization would have cameras on the exterior that are able to duplicate exactly what is visible outside of the craft.   Why were we allowed to see the interior through the large window but not the occupants?   After reporting the experience to the local Sheriff, he said they had no additional reports.   Later someone who claimed he was with NASA automated airport sciences called me and said that his call was unofficial. The only somewhat related experience was during a father daughter overnight camping event.  The event was prior to our sighting experience.  Several of my neighbors were FBI agents.  During the outing two of the agents who had daughters were standing close to each other looking at the visible stars.  One of them whispered to the other that he heard that strange crafts were often visible in the area.  I was standing a few feet away from them and could hear them.  During my earlier education, I graduated and was certified in Group Propulsion Systems and had a choice to either continue studies as a Flight Engineer or Aeronautical Engineering.  I selected Aeronautical Engineering.  Afterwards studied business management and was an early participant in Information Technology, as a systems analyst, followed by executive positions in the computer and software industry.  I eventually formed my own international management consulting and international business services for Fortune 100 companies.

I was coming out on the balcony for a cigarette (I do not smoke illicit drugs nor I don't drink alcohol; was wearing eye glasses at the time of the event). When I was siting on the chair and looking outside (photo attached) I saw strange looking triangle/grey object.  It didn't have any lights whatsoever and it was slowly moving from right to the left (as on the photo) and (north to south on map).  I knew right away that it is something strange and can not be airplane.  We don't have airplane flying this way, I have never seen one.  And all airplanes, helicopters have flashing light this was as dead piece of ring like round concrete color object in the air. I wear glasses and I had them on during sighting, after seeing that it is something strange I quickly opened the balcony door and grabbed my Celestron 15x70 Binoculas (which I have always ready staying beside the balcony door (I watch birds, eagles, airplanes, etc).    When I got binoculars and looked back it was right on the top of the building and moving slowly south.  It is hard to identify it quickly in binoculars.  That's why I looked at the building first, then up, and I got image sharp exactly at the object.       My knees shaking a little, and I screamed to my wife to come and see.  I probably looked at it 6 seconds, and I just could not believe what I see.  I will describe it here:  As you can imagine first it looked just like something large grey ((?)) in the sky, but after binoculars magnification it was clear as day.  I saw a grey colored like concrete round object.  it was reminding me as a vehicle tire as if you would put it flat on the ground but without center (wedding ring like).  It was grey without any lights or windows. It looked in some places  like it was dirty dark/black dust.  It looked like an old spaceship after entering atmosphere burned in some places.  It definitely looked not as shiny as other people describe. It was grey ,made object with black dust parts all over it.  It felt like this ship went through places for sure.  What was most interesting that it didn't just fly straight left, it was gliding like a rock if you throw it on the top of the lake.  It was gliding on the air and it looked so light not like airplane fly heavy in the sky this object was gliding and I felt that it was crashing. I turned around to call my wife and screamed for her to come over, when I turned back it was gone. In measurements I would say it looked in length of Boeing 777 and round like a ring with a hole in the center. Why I was lucky that it was couple days after full moon and it was still bright and big.  The moon was exactly behind me that moment, so all moon light was going towards this UFO.  I believe only because of this I saw it.  It is easy to see birds flying at night when the get light from the city or the moon on them.       I draw how it looked right away and I took a photo of the view (edited in Photoshop of exact dimensions how it appeared to me on that night). I hope it helps and maybe someone would recognize seeing the same. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone, and he seemed to us to be a quite serious, and sober-minded individual.

They were spotted in the South West sky.  (not over the ocean like the infamous ""Orange lights"" I have previously seen.)

Right before I went under the overpass at exit 5 I rolled down my window and got a good look at the object.  It was a dark brown or black colored triangle (not a boomerang shape) with two white lights on each side of all three points of the triangle (almost like quotation mark! s), as well as a red blinking light that blinked about once per second not directly in the center of the bottom of the object, but a little left of center of the bottom.  I also considered it possible that this was a drone, since I have one and am familiar with how they look in the night sky.  But once I came out from under the overpass, I was in total amazement at how big and close it was to me.  It was enourmous, and it was absolutely not a drone or a plane.

Coming down our road we noticed a light in the air that strangely was not moving. Pulling into our drive, we stopped and observed it directly hovering over our neighbors house (which conveniently was a farm house).  Observing it, we quickly came to the conclusion that it was not an airplane. A sudden gasp was heard from our Jeep as the three hovering lights turned into a large white ball of light, like a spotlight, blinding us.  This ended in a matter of seconds. Immediately we called the farmer, but he wasn't able to see it.  We saw it clear as day, it was like nothing we had seen before. Even pulling into our wooded driveway, it was bright enough that we could still see it.  We sat talking to the farmer for around 5 minutes watching the craft go in a back and forth pattern with sharp turns over his house.  Here it starting moving closer to us. We pulled the rest of the way up our driveway, and the garage was having trouble opening (most likely a coincidence, it does it sometimes) so we sat and watched it longer.  At this point it was dangerously close to our house. From this point on and when we got inside, you could see a triangle of different color lights (white, red, green, blue) that changed colors, similarly to an airplane it seemed at first, but this was not functioning at all like an airplane.  Then the whole craft turned red. My father here pointed out that he could hear it, and it sounded like an airplane, until the sound abruptly stopped.  Before it was moving very slowly, but now it was moving quicker and making very sharp terms. Finally, it moved out of our sight, slowly again.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  The only explanation is brand new military craft or alien ship. Coincidentally, I was talking about UFOs to my father a few nights prior, which was strange.  Pictures were not taken due to a lack of a good camera, and my mother yelling at me not to take pictures (Why?  I don't know.) for the fear that ""It might know.""  If I could, I'd swear over a bible to let you know that all of this that I saw is true.  Long story short, I will not be sleeping tonight.",2016-05-06T00:00:00,41.330799999999996,-81.2294

March 28, around 12:30 PM I was at my dining table working on my laptop.  The room became very very dark, quite quickly, as if a large and very thick cloud was passing over.   However, the fact it became so dark, so quickly, and cast my dining room into such deep shadow, felt so unusual to me that I decided to go outside to my patio to see just how large a cloud might be passing over.   Even though it was a windy day and there were scattered white clouds in the area, a cloud capable of such a shadow just didn’t seem logical to me.  When I got outside and out from under my veranda roof, I did take note of a large cloud moving away from the sun but as the sun was still partially shrouded the cloud I couldn’t look directly at it… the sun was too bright.  The cloud was moving northeast and the sun was high and to the south. A very large red-tailed hawk attracted my attention, soaring against a clear blue background of open sky at about 1000 feet or so, and slightly to the north.  Its markings were clear and distinct, a beautiful thing to witness, so I whistled a hawk call, twice.  It turned, and I whistled the call again.  At that time a bright sphere appeared far above the soaring hawk, a point of light, bright, white…  Not bright like a star or a landing light.  But it was a point of light, very unusual… so I fixated on it.  I focused on it for around five to seven seconds, and observed it grow in size, and it didn't move much either.   Then a streak appeared to extend from the right side of this ball of light, like a flare, and I recall thinking I would describe flare as “feathery”.  All at once the white sphere seemed to flash, to expand and was gone, and then, in its place and right next the soaring hawk that had originally attracted my attention, appeared an identical hawk.  They soared in formation for a bit, criss-crossing paths, something I'd seen before, and after 20-30 seconds the original hawk turned and headed to the south/southwest.  The hawk that had just appeared turned north and I lost sight of it. I know the human eye can play tricks on the mind, and there may well be a logical and natural explanation for this sighting.  The other hawk may have been far above the first, and out of focus in an empty field of blue sky considering my eyes were moving, following the first hawk.  It is possible the second hawk decided to dive directly down to join the other and was backlit by the sun as it dove.  But for this to happen right overhead, as I was calling to the first hawk... strange.  I am not given to fantasy or wishful thinking…  I was a 3000+ hour USAF pilot, and after that, an engineer for McDonnell-Douglas and Boeing.  I retired from Boeing 10 years ago.  I have a degree in Biological Sciences and am somewhat well grounded in the basic sciences including physics and chemistry.  I consider myself to be an objective observer and am quite familiar with the principles of science and experimentation.  I also am an avid observer of nature, and have been for years.  I live in the country, on an acreage, near Tucson, Arizona. Whatever I saw was remarkable, even if explainable by natural avian behaviors and the orientation of the sun.  However I will tell you that I have seen large hawks soaring at great heights before diving right down to near ground level within feet of me, and with the sun high.  The hawk in that case was a dark speck that quickly grew as it sped toward me, wings tucked.  It didn’t come out of a ball of light. So I’m wondering who else might have reported some similar experience.  A hawk coming out of a ball of light, the light flares and poof there's a hawk.  As I said, I’m not inclined to assume anything supernatural, paranormal, or other-worldly at this time, but I am willing to entertain the possibility.  I’ve encountered UFOs during my flying career and had a friend in the intelligence field who took reports from aircrews who experienced stunning and frightening encounters… so for me, it’s all on the table.",2016-04-01T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

It started with one light, redish/orangish/white hovering over the horizon while me and my friend were parked on my road, facing east.  I live on the east outskirts of Rochester.  It was staying in the same area but floating, dipping, and swooping around.  You could tell it was far away.  I pointed it out to ((friend's name deleted)) and she saw it too, and it proceeded to swoop around and dip up and down erratically.  We both saw it moving.   I was really excited and made her drive closer to where it was.  We drove closer, heading east until we weren't really in Rochester any longer, more Buckhart area.  I lost view of the light on the way.  When our view became clear again, we parked facing the side of the sky we saw it in, the south east whole sector of the sky.  I couldn't find it and then I noticed it in a different part of the sky, much higher.  We watched this light dance around for awhile.  It moved in ways impossible to any technology we have.  ((friend's name deleted)) saw it too.  We were watching the one light fly erratically.   Both of us keep thinking we glimpse other similar lights moving but aren't sure.  The one light is flying over the horizon at a steady speed in one direction, then it slowly fades away and seems to dissappear.  Another (or the same) light pops up much higher in a totally different direction in the sky.  Then we both saw the second one.  Same color of light, same behavior.  I was ecstatic.  At this point it was clear that these could not be planes or helicopters.  And then they kept appearing--they just kept popping up.  These different lights, all the same color, all differing moment to moment in brightness and dimness, sometimes becoming so dim as to be invisible. They all flew the same style--drunk alien, but never in sync; they would swoop, reverse directions in an instant, dip up and down.  There were no formations to be seen or apparent organization.  Sometimes the speed of their movement was shocking, given how far away they were they had to be covering huge distances in an instant.  Some would move in a general direction, but erratically.  At one point I could have sworn a fighter jet was pursuing one of them, but I couldn't be sure and ((friend's name deleted)) didn't notice it.  I tried to keep count and I got to 8 before I couldn't count them due to the number and the extreme dimness of some of them.  I kept trying to explain it to ((friend's name deleted)), but I don't think she will ever understand how much of a big deal this kind of shit is to me.   The sky was alive with dancing spaceships. We were there for maybe two hours. I could not stop watching, it was like being in a trance.  So I was watching the dance of the spaceships when I noticed a light in the sky coming from behind us (high, moving from NW to SE toward the spaceships.  It was different-- bigger, and blinking one light and one color in steady pulses, and moving at a steady speed and direction.  I assumed it's a plane but I watched it because something seemed odd about it. It's not like a light ON it is blinking, it's like the entire vessel is blinking.  And the color is like an old yellow light, like the color cast by old light bulbs.  I notice in between the blinks it appears to glow a very dull red.  It changes directions and comes in towards the ships.  I watch a spaceship closest to the incoming big yellow light and the strangest thing happens, the spaceship seems to become aware of the new interloper, and it swept towards it and back in a few motions, and then IT STARTED BLINKING BACK AT THE SHIP.  And both blinked differently, like they were shaking hands or trading information of some kind, with different rythyms and frequency and color.  This was the first time we saw any of the fireballs blink.  They blinked a bright white.  Then the big yellow ship came in closer to the other ships and slowed down to a stop were it hovered and bobbed.  As it did this, two more spaceships swooped in close to it and began their own unique blinking response.  So clearly it was another UFO, but different from the rest.  After it delivered it's message or whatever it flew away (SE to NE and seemed to go higher than any plane ever could) where it seemed to become a still star.   At this point, I couldn't take it and I called my dad to make him come outside the house and try to see what I was seeing.  This was also a really strange aspect.  Once my dad came outside, the brightest of the spaceships all started blinking red and white, like airplanes.  They also chose a general direction and stuck with! it, though their speed fluctuated.  It was funny because they all blinked with no rhythm or steady pulse to them.  Long story short, all he sees is airplanes of course.  He goes back in and I get off the phone with him and the ships go back to normal and start moving more.   At several points, I made reference points by holding up my thumb or my phone still under the light in the sky, this was an easy way to see that they were moving relative to the motionless point. I can't explain what I saw, but we saw it and it was amazing. A two hour dance that started with one little light. GROUND SIGHTING, AS WE LEAVE:  [A NOTE: we did not see any ship approach the ground or come close to landing] Right before we leave a big solid white orb light maybe a hundred yards behind us floods us with light.  I sa,y ""What the fuck was that?"" because it disappeared quickly and Kaitie said a car.  But the light hadn't come from the road.  It was directly behind us, close to a house on the other side of the road.  Then we were getting ready to pull out, and it floated out from behind the house.  My first impression was it was just someone with a light, but it was much too bright.  And it floated. It glided.  It came out from behind the house and started coming towards us.  We're talking the brightest white light you've ever seen, on the other side of the road not 70 yards away.  Then it's gone. Two seconds of darkness ... and then it comes back on-- except it's glowing blood red now, and more dim because of the duller color of the red.  There was no indication of anything producing the light. I was a little scared and we drove away, leaving the red light back there. That is the end of this report, but I feel the need to mention what happened the next night from my bedroom window. Kaitie was there again:  Over the cornfield in front of my house around 11 PM two lights hovering over the ground appeared and acted erratically.  One was bright and white, much similar to what we saw so close to us on the ground.  The other one was orange, and very odd at first appearance.  It looked to be a bright orange ball constructed of paper with a fire blazing inside of it.  It acted the most erratic in flight before both became almost entirely still.  They stayed until day started to come, and as the light of day  grew, they receded into the distance until they were tiny pinpricks, and then nothing. I have no pictures but if they come again I plan to walk up to them and try and take a picture/just get closer.

I was driving on Route 15 in Hamden after entering the highway from exit 60.  I was headed south west towards Orange when I saw a blue flash in the cloudy sky to my south, probably over New Haven or the Long Island Sound.   At first I assumed the flash was lightning - it was an incredibly windy night and lightning wouldn't have been out of the question - but over 1 or 2 seconds the flash turned green before lingering for another second or two, and then disappearing.  There was no discernible thunder.  The flash could have been one of many things:  environmental phenomena, a flare, a bi-product of some sort of industrial/scientific activity, a bi-product of military testing, or a UFO.   Interestingly, later that night as I was driving in Orange, there was a tree down, (from the wind), in the middle of the road.  I called the Orange PD to alert them about the tree in the road and they sent an officer out to the scene - this police officer said that she had also seen the flash in the sky. One final thing to note - there was what seemed like some sort of fire in Milford/Stratford today. The smoke could be seen and smelled from where I live in Orange.   The smoke from this fire may have weirdly filtered the light from a lightning bolt from blue to green and I may have been unable to hear the thunder because it was either too far off or my car was too noisy.

While attending a LDS/Mormon Easter Pageant last Friday evening at the Mesa Temple in Mesa, AZ... approximately 20mins after 8pm, while there was a break in the play.  Just for a second in relaxing while I was looking up to the stars, noticing a half-faced moon (facing south-west) I noticed during the event/show there were airplane learjets flying from south to north-western pattern which would fly directly over my head say every 50 secs.  This was a bother at times when I'm trying to enjoy the show as these jets were only a few hundred feet above me.  So as I looked up one time I noticed a triangular shaped craft as I took aim with my eyes for a closer examination.  I noticed there was at least 2 circular shapes within this triangle... it was not lit up internally but the shape of this was illuminated from the street lights (Main street which was to my right) and the surrounding lights.  This shape was say 40 to 50 feet above me it seemed like and was taking a! northern flight path.  It seemed to be the speed of like a quad-copter or drone which my first thought was that someone probably is currently flying a drone because it would make a great camera/video of the event that night but after I was examining this object as it hovered slowly at the same altitude there were several brief moments in the play/show where there were no sounds so I had a good listen to the surrounding area while it was flying overhead and I noticed no sound coming from this craft.  After further thought I ruled out it was any quad copter/drone because something that size would be quite loud enough for me and others to hear it's props/engine.  I was asked by my family later when I told them what I saw why I didn't catch their attention when I saw it first but this whole experience took maybe 20-25 secs was all so I was recording this experience and taking in all of my senses in to determine what it was exactly.  Besides, if I would have told them about it and to look up, etc...  I would have missed more of the details! of what I saw.  In another detail of this craft I was prompted to remember the framing of this triangle/object I saw as it had thick bars outlining this triangle... almost thinking it was from an Erector set, haha, but again I saw no evidence of it being owned by people or could be bought in any Hobby store... as there were no sounds coming from it when all around me was quiet for a few seconds.  I following watching this object and even cupping my forehead and face to block other lights around me and it flew a northern path until I couldn't see it anymore as it flew into the darkness.  So it either flew at a higher altitude or flew away so far that the current surrounding lights that I was seeing it could not lite it up anymore. This experience prompted me to submit this post as I couldn't find any other UFO sighting/records around the area/valley with this same experience and description.

After driving as fast as possible down of few roads we thought it might have went we spotted it moving slowly over Arlington avenue then it stopped and tilted back up but only a few seconds later and took off and almost in an instant it tipped over and zipped off into the horizon in the area by Walmart and mernards before vanishing.   During the whole thing it changed speeds and the way it was moving.  It was somewhat erratic and incredibly! huge, the size of a building almost a saucer shape.  Not any flashes but made of a bunch of lights and it seemed to change intensity slightly.   Most incredible thing I've ever witnessed.  Hope more than me and my buddy saw it.

About 1 am this morning, several of us were chatting in our French Quarter courtyard when my wife pointed to the sky to ask what “that” was.  We had turned all of the lights off 15 minutes earlier, so our eyes were accustomed to the dark and we were using my Google Sky app to point out the planets and constellations.  It was a rare clear night (for us) and the stars and planets were particularly sharp.   As I was pointing out Saturn (the brightest point in the sky at the time), my wife pointed out the objects moving in formation about 25 degrees east of Saturn.  There were 7 or 8 points of light, maybe 1/3 the brightness of Saturn and a little smaller, moving slowly towards the North.  2 or 3 in the lead, 3 more fanned out behind and 2 more bringing up the rear.

I didn't really pay much attention until I saw it suddenly come to a dead stop and hover for 2 or 3 seconds and begin to move back the way it had come.

The object appeard to have 3 solid red lights, close together in a vertical triangular shape.  It had a flashing white light very similar to an airplane marker light and that's why I didn't initially react to it.  The object was about the size of a pencil eraser held at arm's length or maybe just a bit larger.  It moved slowly traversing no more than about 10 degrees arc, primarily traversing from our right to left, back and forth, up and down.  It was absolutely silent.  Unfortunately, we had no frame of reference to guage its size or distance from us. I joked about a UFO but also suggested a drone closer to us as it seemed a more likely explanation.

We noticed a small cloud about 30 degrees elevation ahead of us and below it was a long grey smooth shape.  Its length was about twice the diameter of the moon.  It looked like it could have been a cylinder - or the rounded edge of a flat object.  The bottom edge was less distinct than the top and faded abruptly to the blue of the sky, much the same as how the moon looks when viewed in the daytime sky.  Apparently it was very high  to have that effect - and very large. Sketches sent by e-mail.  We watched the object move left-to-right across our field of vision for about a minute.  We couldn't stop to take a picture and we lost sight of it when the road turned. We were at: Lat: 35.7, Lon: -114.9 according to Google Earth. It did not have a cloud texture and was moving relative to the cloud, approximately east.  The clouds were not perceptively moving.

The green lights looked as if they were attached to two separate vehicles one following the other in trail by what looked like, compared to the airliners, about one half mile.  Which is about half of what the airliners typically are spaced.  They appeared to be moving much faster than and above the airliners. Each light was a single light that in size was about the same or a little larger visual angle as the forward facing lights of the airliners.  The weird thing was that the lights were blinking in perfect unison.  This lasted for about 30 seconds or so as they continued to move east. Then, as they were pretty far off but still visible, the lights started blinking completely but perfectly opposite to each other.

We actually thought it was a rocket because of its upward motion.  I have no judge on how fast it was travelling, but it came to an abrupt stop and moved horizontally right, then stopped and moved vertically upward.  After a brief stop, it moved diagonally upwards and to the right.   Then, it covered a distance of over six miles in under a minute, flew directly over-head, at some altitude past Earl Park and over Fowler.  When it flew by, it looked like a normal aircraft carrier.  But the speeds it was moving suggested it couldn’t have been, as it was making several tight turns and had only one bright light on the nose.  When we looked upwards we counted around seven different craft, but none came close to us.  They all had similar movements, vertical to dead stop to lateral movements.  They kept changing directions.   We headed inside to do a quick google, and because it was rather cold, but when we went outside (around five minutes after ten thirty) the craft were gone.
