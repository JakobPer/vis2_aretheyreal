We got out of the car and I stood in the parking lot facing the lake.  I see something in the sky, it was gliding perfectly, slowly, but quickly at the same time.  It sparked my interest because it was SO quiet, there were no lights to it either.  As it glided above me I stared so intently at it, it was definitely an aircraft, shaped like a boomerang but the odd thing about it was that it was translucent, I could see the stars right through it, but somehow could see the shape of the aircraft moving through the sky.  It continued on, going in a straight line quietly heading north west from where we were standing.  I pointed it out to my fiancé and he agreed that it was no normal aircraft.",2018-10-12T00:00:00,,

I realized that it was probably not a man made object.  The elevation appeared as high a commercial jet in a regular high elevation flight.  If there was a good wind on the ground then there would be high wind at that altitude.  A balloon of any type could not stay that stationary and any tethering impossible.

I gave her a call and she saw and photographed it.  The object this whole time was pretty much stationary with a little noticeable drift.  I got home and tried to photograph it with my wife's camera but was not too successful.  I got out my high powered binoculars and could see it fairly good.  The object appeared oval.

I was doing research on Malaysia Flight 370 and was piecing things together with a few friends (such as the fact ""they are not human"" was said in the blackbox recording and the plane had simply disappeared). I was extremely tired so I had decided to put my computer down and to go to sleep. I fell asleep and the next morning I woke up and saw a triangle mark on my right thigh.  I sent an image to my friend, she saw it immediately in the photo replying ""what ((two words deleted)) is that, you probably got abducted.""  That hadn't even crossed my mind.  Then I was thinking about the research me and my friends had done the night before involving the sentence ""they are not human"".  This seemed very stupid to me and I was thinking I had just overthought the situation. A few nights later, I felt a pinch on my rib, and immediately passed out (it happened fast and I had no intention of falling asleep, but woke up the next morning). The area on my rib that felt pinched the night before felt extremely bruised.  I looked at it to notice that it was a triangle mark, and hurt extremely worse than the one on my thigh.  I do not have a picture of this one. Long story short, I woke up with triangle marks on my body,  TWICE.  My orange tabby also kept biting at the marks, which he never bites me.

It was around 20:00hrs and we are at the fifth floor of the Engineering building of the Holy Angel University in Angeles City.  We are about to take our final exams in one of our engineering subjects when our Instructor/Professor called my name and another student (Lawrence) and told us that we are exempted from taking the final exams and instructed us to go outside the room.   We went outside the room and stayed on the balcony to wait for our classmates to finish the exam.  Suddenly while on the balcony, a big ball of light (sphere) started to descend from the night sky.  To describe the sphere, it looks like a giant disco ball but instead of the glass reflectors, you will see port holes with bright light coming out of the holes.  There are also four orbs located slightly lower than the sphere and are descending together with it.  It was the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen.  One thing I noticed is I did not feel scared at all.  I felt more amazed and excited so I kept watching it descend.  The sphere is about the size of a football field and the orbs about the size of a compact car.  The orbs all have different colors, red, green, blue, and yellow and sometimes they all turn into bright white. The sphere suddenly stopped descending and it remained stationary (not moving at all) just above the control tower of the air base.  The orbs started to fly around at incredible speeds. It was a very good thing to see.  I can even see the colored trails that they leave.  Right around this time, there was a power blackout and the sirens on the base started to go (real loud).  The base scrambled fighter jets and I started to count them.  The jets were taking off by twos and I was counting them by their afterburners.  I even asked Lawrence to also count them.   While I was counting the jets, something really strange happened.  I was suddenly at a very different vantage point.  From where I was, I can see the whole city.  Even though there was a blackout, I can see the whole city like it was mid noon.  I did not think much about my change of vantage point at that time and continued to count the fighter jets.  I counted a total of fourteen jets that took off.  As I was watching the jets fly to! wards my vantage point, I was suddenly back on the balcony of the engineering building and the power was restored.  I saw Lawrence standing on the other end of the balcony and he was very pale like he’s seen a ghost.  I asked him how many jets he counted and his reply was, “You are a devil.  You disappeared and reappeared right in front of me.  What now?!”.  He looked very scared and said he will never talk to me again.   When our other classmates came out of the classroom, I started to ask them about the strange lights.  Some of them saw light coming in to the classroom windows but did not see the sphere.  They all heard the sirens from the base and even joked it was World War III.  Lawrence then stopped them from talking to me and told them I am a devil.  To this day,  Lawrence has not spoken to me. Since this was really an unusual experience for me, the next day I was excited to check the news reports and all I found is a TV report about a giant Ferris Wheel in the sky that a lot of witnesses saw.  The blackout they said was caused dead jellyfish and that’s about it. There was no mention of the air base scramble. I tried to research the incident and found nothing more to this day. I would like to know more about this incident if there is more information.",2018-10-18T00:00:00,,

Weather :  Dark, overcast , wind from WNW approx. 25-30 with gusts  Temp:  35/40 degrees as best I remember.  Topography:  Narrow lightly populated canyon with a  two-lane dirt road serving residents.   High steep mountain on the southern side of the canyon, less steep on the north side.   Road to top of  ‘hill/mountain’ both sides  300 – 400 feet.  The road from Big Flat Road deadended some 2 plus miles more or less going west. Was restless that night, nothing on TV to gather my interest.  Took a walk to  clear  my mind. Walked off my property to O’Brien Creek Road and went east towards town.  I could see the lights of town as usual..   Traveled on foot, gravel road, little over quarter mile, then turned around to go home.   Wind was picking up, noticed the clouds were showing ‘star breaks’  where I could glimpse a few stars here and there. Got to the driveway to go up to my house and ‘felt’ strange for some reason.   Thought that is odd.  I looked west up Obrien Creek Road and the sky was pitch black, no star breaks.  Stood there maybe 30 seconds and all around me above, it suddenly went pitch black, like somebody turned out the lights. Turned and looked towards town,  could still see the lights of town reflecting off the clouds in that direction.  Looked up and I could barely detect that something was moving above me.  Rush of ‘what the hell’ of course. Then as I looked up I saw an oval shaped light in a kalidescope of colors moving slowly over me in an easterly direction.  Tried to process all this without much luck.  The colors were moving around inside the oval, not rapidly, not at a snails pace.  My term for it was ‘a normal pace’, don’t know for sure where that came from  In a few more seconds the colors were gone,  and I could see a huge black triangular object moving over me and toward the east.  The black on this object was blacker than the surrounding ambiance, therefore it did have shape and movement.  It was dead silent as it moved, and it covered more than the height of the canyon tops both north and south of me.  Distance from the north and south tops I estimate to be over ¼ mile. Then, it was gone. I stood there,  trying to sort it all out.  Ha. Walked up to my house, took off my jacket, and looked at my hands, they were beet red.  Went into the bathroom, and my face was beet red as well.  Both hands and feet were itching but I thought it was from the harsh wind. Something told me, take a shower, now.

"Large, circular, gauzy light moved in unison with our vehicle, changed shape into an oval, moved obliquely and, finally, straight down",Ghost Ranch,NM,2018-09-30T21:15:00,changing,1 minute,"Occurred : 9/30/2018 21:15  (Entered as : 09/30/18 21:15) Reported: 10/16/2018 10:45:08 AM 10:45 Posted: 10/18/2018 Location: Ghost Ranch, NM Shape: Changing Duration:1 minute",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/143/S143505.html,"Large, circular, gauzy light moved in unison with our vehicle, changed shape into an oval, moved obliquely and, finally, straight down To Whom It May Concern:  On Sunday, September 30th, at roughly 9:15pm, my brother and I were driving south on US Highway 84 and were between the Echo Amphitheater campground pullout and the Ghost Ranch property entrance.  We had already descended the long, gradual decline on US Highway 84 from the villages of Cebolla and Canjilon south to Echo Amphitheater and were on relatively level ground nearer to the Ghost Ranch entrance and approaching the northern reaches of Abiquiu Lake on our right.  My brother (who was driving) looked to his right (past me) and out the front, passenger’s side window and asked, “Is that the moon?”  I looked out the same window in response to his query and remarked, “Well, if it isn’t we’re in big trouble.”  We both looked intently at the object that was presently about 30° above the horizon and appeared as a very hazy, or gauzy, dim, and white light in the western night sky.  We took a few seconds to make sense of what we were looking at and it appeared as the size and shape and color of the full moon behind very heavy cloud cover.  Since whatever the light was traveled at the exact same speed as my brother’s vehicle, it was easy to have mistaken the light as the moon, a stationary light remaining static in the sky; however, what occurred next quickly dispelled our notion that the light we were observing was the light reflected from the moon on an otherwise clear night. As soon as my brother and I had fully absorbed the nature of the hazy light and had agreed that we were both looking at the same object, the light simultaneously compressed into an ovoid shape (the same width as before, but reducing to roughly one-third of its former height) and moved very rapidly at a 45° angle down and to the right.  The light traveled no more than one second in that right-hand, downward direction when it halted at a full stop then redirected at a horizontal angle and moved very rapidly straight to the left, parallel with the horizon, all the while retaining the same ovoid shape that it had just assumed.  This motion took, again, no more than one second to complete.  Just as the light reached a full stop it again changed shape from a horizontally-aligned ovoid shape to a vertically-aligned ovoid shape and sped straight downward for, again, no more than one second. It disappeared from view and we looked for it to reappear, however, it never did and we lost sight of it from that point forward. I fully anticipated the light to move in our direction and across our field of view again, but it didn’t reappear for the duration of our drive.  After the episode, which lasted no more than one minute from the time my brother observed it stationary in the western sky until it disappeared from view, we came to an agreement about two things:  that the light was most certainly not the moon and the light had seemingly become aware of our observation of it. Since we were traveling south on US Highway 84 on a Sunday night a week after the end of the usually heavy summer camping season, there were very few vehicles on the road with us, traveling either south or north.  After the light disappeared we did not encounter another vehicle for another two minutes as we traveled at roughly 60 miles per hour.  There were no other vehicles traveling southbound behind us, either. My brother and I then went through a series of questions to each other as we attempted to make sense of what we had just seen.  Since we had both observed the moon earlier in the day above Echo Amphitheater, in the daytime western sky as a waning half-moon, we knew that it could not have been a full moon that explained our sighting.  We also questioned whether it could have been people with a high-power flashlight and quickly dispelled that idea, too, since we had seen no other cars parked along the roadside between the Echo Amphitheater pullout and where we witnessed the light.  We also observed that the light appeared as a solitary light in the sky and no beam nor shaft of light led to or from the light object we viewed, nor were there any flashing or jumping lights that indicated a source of the light on the ground nearby.  The object we saw was perfectly circular, then ovoid, and without any hint of alteration by the contours of terrain or cloud cover and lent further creden! ce to the idea that the object was the light source and not being created terrestrially and projected into the night sky. I also noted that as soon as my brother and I recognized that we were looking at the same object in the sky, the object (whatever it was) seemed to have realized that we had spotted it. It was at this point that the light began to move rapidly, first to the right and downward, then to the left, horizontally, and, finally, straight down.  It may be a stretch to project awareness of itself, but it seemed coincidental that the light was stationary at one moment and then in motion as soon as we locked our eyes on it. Estimating the distance of the light from our position and ultimate size of the object remains difficult as an object of that size in the sky could possibly be thousands of miles away, however, judging from the rapidity of motion and understanding that the light simply disappeared from view between Lake Abiquiu and US Highway 84, I believe that it was no more than a quarter of a mile away and was, perhaps, 50 feet in diameter or less.  That is, of course, a rough calculation. My brother and I then traveled back to Santa Fe and quizzed each other about what we had just seen.  We still remain in disbelief, but in complete agreement that we saw something highly unusual that Sunday night.",2018-10-18T00:00:00,,

Missed the meteor shower due to clouds and light rain.  I saw something moving high in the sky.  It looked like a star, or planet.  Good sized, like a small moon. I'm familiar with the space station, so I knew it wasn't that.  Plus, it was white and large.  The light it exuded was a filtered or muted white.  Kind of like the moon, compared to a light on a plane.  Round in shape like a big star.  No twinkling or variation in light. It stayed steady and slow moving.  Nothing blinking.  Just a solid white orb, out cruising before sunrise. It was traveling E- SE at a smooth click.  Watched it as long as I could before it was blocked by the neighbors tree.  A few minutes passed and, I decided to check an app on my iPad, ""Starguide"".  Nothing showing there.  And it shows space debris if it's passing. Also, I checked flight radar.  Nothing on that path.  It was a good sized, orb, I guess you could say.  I'm not sure how to really describe it.  It was bigger than, Venus and, Jupiter.  Very visible.  If it was a craft, it was HUGE.  I'm talking, Independance Day, huge.  If you catch my drift.  It was high enough to know it was pretty large in comparison to the stars. I haven't seen anyone posting anything about it yet, online.  I know, I wasn't seeing things. But, I do know, we aren't alone. About 11 yrs. ago, my Husband and, I were outside watching the sky.

Same description, only much more dull, compared to this newest sighting. I am not making any of this up either.  We were able to see it pinging around in a circular motion.  As if it were a pinball bouncing between bumpers.  Only it was stars that were around it.  It was fairly fast in this motion but so dim, we could just barely make it out. Also, dim because it was so high in the sky.  By rights we shouldn't have seen it really. Good thing it was a clear night. I can't even begin to describe how high it was. And, if it was that big, OMG…  I'm scared of the possibilities.  It was kind of hard to wrap my own head around what we were seeing. My husband and I, both, said do you see that?  Yeah, I see it.

Hawaiian Airlines Flight #40 - UFO Sighting on 9-19-18  Location:  Over Pacific Ocean (664 miles southwest of Newport, OR)  Date:  9-19-18 Time: ~7:00pm PT  Synopsis:  This report was personally relayed to me by a friend who I knew many years ago, but who tracked me down after hearing of this incident.  He is now a commercial airline pilot for an airline company that is not Hawaiian Airlines, but rather a rival airline. My friend was piloting a flight across the Pacific Ocean on the night in question.  During the flight, at roughly the time listed above, he heard radio chatter from a Hawaiian Airlines Flight #40 heading Eastbound across the Pacific (flight from Maui to Portland, OR).  They stated they had been observing a very large white ball or sphere that had black markings on it.  The flight was at a cruising altitude of 35,000 ft and the object was on the same Eastbound heading, but at an estimated altitude of 36,000 ft. After initially observing this object, the three crew members attempted to snap photos of it as they gradually closed on it.  However, according to the statements made over the radio, the photos were blurry and did not show the object.  They did state that the object appeared to be very large.  They added that their hands were all shaking whilst trying to photograph the object due to their collective apprehension in not knowing what this thing was, but knowing it was NOT an aircraft.  Eventually, the plane passed by the object as they were apparently moving faster, albeit in the same direction.  That was the last they saw of the object. No attempt was made to gain access to audio recordings of the event as the planes were over the Pacific Ocean too far away from Air Traffic Control Centers.  All communication this far out to sea is strictly “air-to-air frequency”.  It was on this frequency that the communication from the Hawaiian Airlines was heard by my friend and commercial pilot. The location of the sighting was over a point designated as HEKAB (latitude/longitude coordinates: N 39.24.8 W 134.58.4), which lies 664 miles southwest of Newport, OR.

The moon was out on a clear night sky, casting light on the distant ridgelines.  Having driven this route hundreds of times, I was very familiar with the distances.  The lights were a light straw color, 3 large ones in the center,and 4 smaller ones lined up on either side below the larger ones. Compared to the moon size, this cluster was about 1/3 the size.  These lights are a very long ways away, and would be bigger than any aircraft I have ever seen.  I was driving straight towards them, and there was no movement.  After about 4 minutes they just faded out like turning off a wall dimmer switch.

This time there was one more light on the upper left of the cluster.  I watched them for about 2 more minutes and then they faded again.

At approximately 1930 yesterday evening, I was driving home from picking up a pizza for myself and husband.  I was traveling West on a main road, preparing to make a left hand turn onto the road that I live on.  We live in a fairly quiet, rural area.  There are very few street lights on our road. As I prepared to turn left onto our road, I observed an orange glow just through the top of the trees.  I turned left onto our road and continued traveling North.  About 400 feet ahead, I observed a truck pulled over to the side of the road with its hazards on.  As I got closer to the truck, it very quickly pulled onto the road and took off. At this point, I had reached the section of road where the landscape opens and there are no trees blocking the vista. To my east, there were dozens of bright orange balls of light in the sky.  They were in small groups of three (triangular pattern).  Each group was parallel to each other.  The lights were glowing bright orange and seemed independent of each other.  At that moment, the groups of light appeared stationary in the sky.  The mass of lights extended in a ""lane"" that appeared at least 200 feet in length.  There were some single balls of light (not in a triangle pattern) towards the end of the line . These lights were at a very low altitude.  My best guess would be a few hundred feet off the ground.  As I looked out my car window, I barely had to lift my gaze to make these observations.  There was no sound whatsoever. The mass of lights appeared to be moving east to west/northwest. I felt true panic in that moment. And frantically dialed my husband to get outside.  I was less than one mile from my home at this time.  As I continued North, I lost sight of the lights. At about 1/2  mile from my home,  I opened the sunroof and observed some balls of light in the sky above me.  These balls of light were traveling in a singular formation.  Not the same triangle formation I had initially observed a mile back.  They appeared higher in altitude at this point. I passed a vehicle pulled over in the southbound lane and could see the driver with his cell phone out the window.  This helped to validate that what I was seeing was real!   When I reached my driveway, my husband was outside waiting.  He was able to observe 2 glowing orange balls of light to the south of his location, traveling west/northwest.  They disappeared quickly beyond the tree line. Roughly 20 minutes later, we observed a helicopter traveling south towards the location we saw the lights.  We often see helicopters and various aircraft over our property, but hardly do they travel in a north to south pattern.  Especially at night. My husband is retired Coast Guard.  We have lived near many military installations with very active air traffic.  I'm used to seeing helicopters, military aircraft at all times of the day performing various exercises so I like to think that I have a slight advantage over the general public in observing aircraft.  I can say with 100% certainty this was not any type of plane or helicopter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2018-11-09T00:00:00,,

We walked to a boardwalk watch point that overlooks the ocean.  3 of 5 people had walked down the boardwalk away from the watchpoint while my partner and I stuck around and looked out at the sky.  At some point my partner noticed a strange light in the sky.  It is important to note that our location is under a flight zone so there are lots of planes and lights all over the sky. This particular light stuck out though, yellowish beam dead center over the ocean in the sky sort of growing in brightness to the scale of a small circle you would make with your pointer tucked into your thumb.  The strange thing was that it was sort of still in space.  As we kept an eye on it at one moment it diminished to the point of seemingly being gone before reappearing again. We watched it alone for about 10 minutes maybe before our friends walked back and joined us.  They had also now seen this said light.  I don’t believe we pointed it out to them.  At the time we were still unclear if it was anything worth chatting about.  That said we were all now focused on it. Around this point, the beam was no longer fading away, only getting stronger.  It remained around the same size, but now it was lighting up the ocean as though it were the moon.  We were all mesmerized as to how an airplane in the sky would be so bright as to light up the ocean like the moon. Here is where it gets wild.  Suddenly this beam just came at us or to us like the snap of your finger.  It was no longer lingering and just came to us.  I didn't hear any sound of a ship.  It was almost like a ship coming that appeared now appeared dually as a drone like object.  It is though to describe because I have never seen anything like this.  I will try my best. As this ship came at us a drone seemingly came down, but the drone in my eyes was only visible in the moment the ship was crossing over us, almost like it was in two places at once.   For me it appeared as a vertical infinity sign without the bottom loop closed, silvery, shimmery, and almost like a glimmer.  It looked like it came down and scanned us or looked at us.  I thought it was maybe 15-20 feet away but a friend of mine said 100.  To me it seemed extremely close and as it came to us and the ship was passing the aircraft did this magical thing where it turned into something like a shiny silvery stick figure of lights on the ship that lit up as it crossed over us making a walking stick figure light show.  It was all very overwhelming.  It is hard to say if it controlled our emotion (full elation) or if we were just all in awe of what was happening which is also likely.  5 people who all use a phone regularly didn't even think to pull our phones out.  We were completely awestruck at its visiting us.  I almost think we scared it away in our excitement. As the now certainly UFO passed us, we all watched as within seconds it passed and was now over Long Island.  I specifically remember now it was a red light we were following upon crossing us and passing.  I also remember as we watched it go away to Long Island it than made a left as if to turn around and then simply stopped and hung still.  Now a red beam over Long island that we were all watching. I don’t recall what happened to it, if it disappeared or if we started looking for more… You have to understand how overwhelming this was.  We were in shock and maybe not making best decisions (of course now we all wish we took pics).  We spent  awhile after this searching for maybe another ship because a friend of ours who grew up on Long Island and frequented Fire Island throughout her life had described a similar sighting to another friend with us prior to our witnessing this event.  Her sighting was not nearly as close as this one though.  So now there we are thinking maybe we can get another one to come. Also I don’t know if its vain to think we lulled it in, but my partner had given everyone a flashlight which we had been shining at the ocean in random order just for fun not thinking anything of it.  Also at the beginning when it was just him and I he spotted it and was whispering to me saying it likes me … he sensed that it was gonna come to us.  He may have even said watch, it likes me as it zero’d in on us. Ok to back track a bit.  This half infinity like glimmer, drone, orb, but was nothing like anything I have ever seen with my own eyes. I am doing my best to relay my memory to paper. It is possible it controlled our emotion. That's really it.  It was a slow build, and than it happened so fast.  It didn't move like an airplane or in any earthly way for that matter.  It moved in its own space and time. I am not certain my friends witnessed the part where the ship above seemingly lit up in a stick figure dancing bye light show while passing.  I will try and get them to write their experience as well.  I hope one or two of them are willing. Thank you for your time!  Watch Hill is closed until next summer.  I freaking wish I could be back their right now to keep an eye out. Oh, also we had a dog with us that was super spooked after the event.  Its owner said it never acted that way before.  The dog tried to stop us from walking home by jumping at sand pulling us back as well as going in front of us as if to say do not walk this way.",2018-11-09T00:00:00,,

It’s been awhile, but I can remember every detail vividly and for the past 23 years, every time I go outside at night this moment crosses my mind. One night in the early summer of 1995 my parents, niece and I were driving home around 10-11pm from night fishing on the Fox River in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.  My mother, niece and I were in a separate car from my dad who did not see the UFO.  We were driving South on Ohio St (Oshkosh, WI) right after passing the intersection of Ohio St. and 18th St..  My Mom and I both noticed at the same time a dark triangular object above and to our left out the front window of the car.  It was moving at this time East to West and was crossing the street above us just above the tree tops. The craft was a perfect triangle, maybe 2-3 times the size of our car (90’s Buick Lasabre), or about the width of the two lane street. It was black or very dark gray with steady white lights on each corner of the triangle. It also had an inner triangle centered on the craft that was darker than the rest of the craft. Our windows were rolled down and the craft was completely silent. When the object passed over the street it turned south (now on the west side of Ohio St.) and flew parallel to our car for approximately 1/3 of a city block going slightly faster than us. We were traveling at this time only approximately 15 mph. If I had to guess I would say the craft was traveling 25-30mph. The object was getting ahead of us, still on the west side of the street. It went behind some trees and we lost sight of it. We sped up and when we got to the clearing around the intersection of 19th St. and Ohio St. the object was gone. We lived very close to the sighting location. When we got home we all sat down and drew pictures of what we saw. My niece, who was only 6 or 7 was very upset and crying but was able to draw the exact thing my mom and I did. About a half hour after the sighting we could hear loud military jets flying around very high up. We all went outside and watched for awhile as the jets circled the entire night sky. It was an absolute incredible experience that has been ingrained in my mind since childhood, and to this day I cannot go outside at night without looking up at the sky. ** I will email a computer drawing I made off of my memory and the original drawing I made in 1995.  I will also include a map of the UFO’s path.  The title of the email will be 1995 Oshkosh WI UFO.  Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I out with friends in their boat about 50 yards directly off Huntington Beach in Bay Village, Ohio.  Very hot and sunny evening...perfect for hanging with friends and being on the water.  Around seven o'clock an orange orb with a slight shimmer to it appeared directly off the coast, heading directly north.  It was moving at about the speed of a slow plane though at a definite lower altitude that any plane.  My friends were pretty shocked as was I...this thing just appeared right over us with tons of people on the beach and in the water in their boats/swimming etc.  Considering the direction it came form, it must have flown directly over the city of Bay Village.  The size of it seemed rather large, maybe the the size of a small plane...though it was definitely not a plane and definitely not a Chinese lantern.  It also made zero noise. It moved in a straight line with purpose, not floating lazily about the sky.  We were all kind of surprised to say the lea st, though I did not notice the reactions of other people as we were all staring at the orb. About two hours later just as it was getting dark yet another orange orb popped up right off the shore, similar to the other one and made the same flight path north.  A friend got this one on camera and put the video up on a now defunct file sharing page called put file. The video essentially showed an orange ball on a black background.  The ""orb"" had a slight shimmer to it ...it was not just a solid looking object.  The shimmer was kind of what you would see off of a hot road during a summer day.  I was pretty much blown away...two UFO's in one night!  June 3, 2007  -  Sheffield Lake   Two night later, the following Sunday my brother comes running into my room saying he sees my UFO outside.  Thinking he's just excited form my tale the previous night, I reluctantly got out of bed and sure enough the exact same orange orb, this time going west right along the lake coast as if heading to the Domonkas library in Sheffield lake.  I live down the road from the lake and this thing was visible right above the trees.  After moving west at a rather slow and leisurely speed, the orb stopped and shot several multicolored light from the bottom of it, blinked several times and went dark.  My brother says he could still see the shape of the object after it blinked out, though I can't remember that myself.  I've watched quite a few videos on you tube of orange orb phenomena and the light being shot or dropped out is something I've never come across before.  Truly a unique experience, and we were both pretty blown away at what we saw. since this thing was directly over the lake, I thought for sure many others would have seen it.  Anyone walking the Lorain Pier or out on their boats had to have gotten a glimpse of this thing, though there was no mention in the paper or local news.  Of course, I was a witness and did not report anything until eleven years later so I'm sure others did the same.  Whether this was ET or man made who knows whatever it was it was an awesome sight, and something I'll never forget.",2018-07-13T00:00:00,41.4916,-81.9537

On the evening of August 29, 2018 at approximately 7:30 p.m., I drove approximately 1.5 miles south on Highway 375 from Rachel, Nevada, to Back Gate Road.  This is a dirt road and I drove about 300 feet west.  I set up my Nikon D5100 camera on a tripod to photograph the night sky before the moon rose.  I photographed toward the south for a while, away from the lights of Rachel.  Rachel is a tiny town with very little ambient light.   Sometime between 8-8:30 p.m., I turned to photograph the Big Dipper above Rachel.  As I was looking in that northwesterly direction, I saw an oblong orange light over the town or possibly over the mountains behind Rachel.  It was stationary at first and then began moving slowly east before stopping again.  Gradually it descended until I could no longer see it.   While it was moving, I turned my camera toward it and took a couple of pictures.  My shutter speed was at 15 seconds, ISO of 1600 and aperture of 8. When I looked at the photo on my computer, I saw there were four bright round, horizontal, orange lights above the lights of Rachel.  I lightened the photo to make sure they were, in fact, above the town and/or mountains, and that it wasn’t a vehicle or town light.  I also cropped the photo in order to enlarge it.   I am attaching all three photos:  The original, the lightened one, and the enlarged one.  The original one, unfortunately, is a bit crooked since I was in a hurry to snap the picture.  Straightening it would lose the town lights, so I have left it as is.  The lights were not present in the other photo, which I should have kept but did not.",2018-09-13T00:00:00,,

The following is a testimonial of my UFO sighting that occurred in Louisville, KY on Tuesday, September 28th, 2018, between 8:26 PM and 8:30 PM (timestamp on video). I had just exited I-264E, Exit 5A towards Campground road.  While traveling on Ralph Ave, I noticed what appeared to be a meteor falling in the sky.  It was traveling at roughly the same speed as the jets that fly by.  To give perspective, if I were standing (I’m 6’1”) and reached my hand out, its tail would measure ~1.5-2” from thumb to pointer finger and it would take ~6-8 seconds to travel that same ~1.5-2”. I pulled my SUV over at the employee entrance to the Dow Chemical Plant (at 4300 Camp Ground Road) to shoot the video clip.  While recording the video, I start to receive a call (and thus stop recording), I accept the call in the car and drive off, heading south-west on Camp Ground Road.  Interestingly enough, I see what appears to be another meteor quite a distance off in the NW direction that seemed to be leaving its tail in a curve up or spiral-like formation.  I could see both simultaneously.  I did not catch this on film but wanted to bring it up regardless. When I arrived at my friend’s house, I began telling him about the meteor and was trying to describe it’s fiery tail.  I was zoomed in to the meteor when I noticed it.  A black dot blazes by the meteor at impossible speeds, in comparison to fighter jets like those that appear at Thunder Over Louisville.  Slowing the video down and panning back and forth I actually discover another UFO that crosses above the meteor a second before the other.  This was shot on an iPhone X, and you can’t really see it unless you zoom in—but it appears to be a saucer-shaped vessel. I was previously a skeptic, but since I recorded this video myself?  I’m a believer now.",2018-09-13T00:00:00,38.21121446765155,-85.68918456444217

Bright Star Moving & Changing Shape (Square Circle Triangle) Along With Numbers Letters And Symbols,Muskego,WI,2018-07-30T03:20:00,changing,~30 minutes,"Occurred : 7/30/2018 03:20  (Entered as : 073018 03:20) Reported: 8/2/2018 1:20:03 AM 01:20 Posted: 8/10/2018 Location: Muskego, WI Shape: Changing Duration:~30 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/142/S142520.html,"Bright Star Moving & Changing Shape (Square Circle Triangle) Along With Numbers Letters And Symbols In the early morning of July 30th, at around 0320, as I laid down in bed, I noticed a particularly bright star in the Southern sky, to the right and lower than the moon, but thought nothing of it, besides how bright and pretty it was.  However, when I took off my glasses, laid my head on my pillow, and opened my eyes to look towards it once more, the entire area was no longer a star, it contained a kaleidoscope of numbers, letters, and symbols I couldn't identify or make sense of.  To check if it was my vision, I'd close one eye at a time and look with the other, but each eye still saw the same thing independently.  It was completely bizarre.  Then I grabbed my glasses to look at it, but through my glasses it only looked like a star.  I took my glasses off again and back were the numbers, letters, and symbols.  I did this repeatedly over and over until I finally woke my husband up because I couldn't fall asleep wondering what I was watching!  He was too tired to get up and look, but I got out of bed, picked up my cell phone, and started to record at 0338.  The first recording was only about 3 minutes in length and was just testing to see if the star would show up, which it did.  I also panned from the moon to the street lights and then to the star to try for an estimation of distance.  We live in a house in a suburb and have a clear view of the night sky.  I zoomed in as much as my cell phone allowed.  For the second recording, about double the length of time, starting at 0343, I placed my elbows on my dresser to steady the cell phone.  It took me several seconds to steady myself and to find the star again.  Unfortunately, just like when I had my glasses on, the recording did not show any kaleidoscope of letters, numbers, or symbols, which I only saw without my glasses.  After I stopped the second recording, the “star” was still doing the same thing.  At that point, I assumed it might just go on like that all night, and I was just! too tired to keep watching, so I had to go to bed.  In watchi! ng the r ecording, the next day, I was able to enlarge the video further by using my pointer finger and thumb on my phone’s screen.  It was amazing to see how fast it was and the random patterns and shapes.  I’ve never seen something like this; it was intriguing, but it also made me a bit uneasy.  I didn’t want to report it because I’m sure it sounds crazy, but I can assure you that I am not crazy.  When my husband also saw the recording the next day, he had no idea how to explain it, and subsequently the two other people I’ve told are clueless as to an explanation as well.  I will look on your website to find out how to upload the recordings.  Did anyone else see this in my area?  Has anyone had a similar experience seeing a kaleidoscope of letters, numbers, or symbols?  Any help from anyone would be very appreciated.  Thank you!",2018-08-10T00:00:00,42.8776,-88.1338

Untold UFO crash incident in China.  In recent years, the Chinese government has taken a more liberal approach towards disclosing UFO/ET incidents in China.  One of the UFO/ET cases was reported by a retired Chinese soldier who witnessed a UFO crash on the ground of his military complex in Shanxi Province in 1997.  This case captured much public attention due to the sensitivity of the crash location, a military complex, and two injured aliens who were found alive at the time of the crash. One summer night in 1997, when ((deleted man's name)) was serving as a soldier at 28th Army in Datong, Shanxi Province, he witnessed a flying saucer crash into the courtyard of his army camp.  He quickly ran to the scene and surprisingly discovered an unidentified saucer crashed in the trees.  The UFO looked like it was the same size as a satellite dish, silvery white in color.  ((deleted man's name)) estimated that the UFO was approximately two meters high and six meters wide. ‘There wasn’t any obvious damage on the surface of the UFO’ said ((deleted man's name)).  This may suggest that the UFO is unlikely to have been shot down by Chinese military.  ((deleted man's name)) thinks that the crashed UFO may have experienced a malfunction due to weather conditions because it was a rainy night with thunderstorms.  It possibly that the UFO was hit by lightning. The UFO’s door was open when he arrived at the scene.  Next to the door were two skinny aliens, one appeared dead or unconscious, and the other was severely injured.  He recalled the two aliens were slim and short as one meter in height, their facial and body skin covered with fur.  The aliens appeared to have mouse-like facial features, or more accurately described as possum like beings.  ((deleted man's name)) sensed strongly that the aliens had genders, the unconscious one a male and the severely injured one a female. When ((deleted man's name)) was trying to closely approach the crashed UFO to see what was happening, the injured alien looked up to ((deleted man's name)) and spoke some unknown words which he couldn’t understand.  He thought that the injured alien was calling for help, but he was too scared to approach the aliens closely enough to hear them.  ((deleted man's name)) revealed that there were a few people that witnessed this incident shortly after his arrival.  Some of them were shocked by what they saw, but decided not to disclose it as they do not want to lose their jobs if it were to go public. Later that night, the UFO and two aliens were retrieved by the military police after the crash.  The entire army camp was quarantined the next day followed by a notification that no one was permitted to leave or enter the complex.  All personnel involved with this incident were told not to reveal information to the public, including their families. What happened to the injured aliens and the crashed UFO are still unknown.  Has the Chinese military released the aliens after medical treatment?  One thing is almost certain. the Chinese government, like governments in other countries, are studying and reverse engineering extraterrestrial technologies to better equip their military defense systems and create other technology. The Chinese government has not commented on this alleged UFO crash incident to date.

It was about 9:15 or 9:30 on a clear, summer evening in 2013, in the middle of Missouri, along Highway 50.  I had just clocked-out at work and was taking out the trash when my cellphone rang.  It was a friend of mine, calling from his girlfriend’s house, about three blocks to the northwest of my location. I answered and he asked if I had a clear view of the sky; I didn’t.  Where I was was mostly surrounded with trees and buildings, but he was on the edge of town, with an open field behind the house.  He told me to go west of town and look up, because he was “looking at the mothership or something.”  So I got in my car and drove about a mile west to the edge of town.  The sun had just gone down so the sky was still orange in the West, fading to dark blue in the East with a few stars starting to appear.  I stopped the car and stepped out. Looking up, I saw a massive black triangle against the sky, almost directly overhead, but slightly to the north of me.  At arm’s length, it was about two feet long and one foot wide. It was pointing West by Southwest, and slowly cruising in that direction.  It was an acute isosceles shape (but slightly skewed from my perspective), solid black, with no lights and no sound. (I feel that I should mention here, that although I feel my above description to be true, part of me thinks there may have been a dark-red, circular light at each corner of the craft, although I concede this may be a corrupted memory after looking at numerous pictures of these craft types on the Internet.)  Over the course of about a minute, I watched it cruise away and the farther away it got, the slimmer and slimmer it became until it finally vanished from view.  The idea of taking a picture with my phone’s camera never even occurred to me until hours after the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As a long time smoker I knew this would not drastically impair my ability to walk and/or think and that it’d help me deal with the soreness in my ankles from constant soccer.  My cousin did not ingest any marijuana, alcohol, or anything of the sort prior to either arriving at my then home or leaving with me to walk to the store. 15 minutes of prepping and smoking, and 20 minutes of walking later we were nearly there. My cousin, slightly nervous about being out so late and being caught by his father, decided to call my uncle to check in and let him know we’d be in bed soon enough (a lie).  It was during this call that I, while gazing around the familiar neighborhood noticed something above me and not at all far away in the night sky. Only after taking 5-7 seconds to repeatedly blink and rub my eyes did I gather the sense to immediately alert my cousin as to what I was experiencing.  Above us were 6-8 near white lights, forming a perfect circle and a moderately bright one at that.  Past the lights, once hyper focused you could make out the dark saucer shape the lights were obviously a part of. There wasn’t any rotation of said lights, no pulsing, and no odd details.  The object sat stationary while being viewed and emitted ZERO fumes, projectiles, and strangely enough, sound whatsoever.  It was so quiet in fact that I recall the embarrassment of being able to hear my cousin explaining to his father/my uncle what we were seeing and practically revealing that we were outside and not in my home as he’d previously described.  I could hear cars driving by us and in the distance, I could have heard crickets if there were any, just not the craft. After about 60 or so seconds of staring, the craft proceeded to accelerate like no aircraft I’d seen in my 20+ years of living.  The object went from being the sole focus of my vision, to zooming straight upwards and decreasing in size within an instant; vanishing almost cartoonishly.

On Sunday March 11th, 2018, a fairly bright light hovering in the sky caught my attention.  Upon further inspection, I can make out a disk shape in the sky basically parked in place. I'm always looking up hoping to see UFO's but I'm a semi-skeptical person.  So I stare at if for a while.  My little brother is fairly close to me, he follows my gaze and then rolls his eyes and says ""Izzy relax, its probably just a plane.""  To which I respond, ""No David, look.  See behind that thing?  Moving slowly with the light? THATS a plane"" and I point at a plane clearly visible much much farther BEHIND the object, moving slowly, and clearly identifiable by its blinking red navigation light. This proved two things.  The object was definitely parked in place, and it was not an ordinary aircraft because although the sun has set at 7:36, it was around 7:45 at the time and it was still bright out.  NOT bright enough for a normal aircraft to have its ""brights"" on.   The airplane cruising in the far distance only had a faint plane-shaped figure with no other lights on other than its red blinking navigation lights.  We both agree that this is weird, and as he continues to go on with his business (he was washing our mothers vehicle at the time of the incident). I decide to take out my phone and take a video of it. At this moment two things begin to happen.  My mother comes out of her adobe and I point at the UFO and tell her ""mom look, it has NOT moved"" and as I say those words I notice that there has been a change in the object.  The previously bright shining constant light emitted from the bottom of the aircraft has turned into a single light circling around and around the base of the aircraft.  After a few cycles, the light sequence changes yet again, but this time it does a sequential light signal pointing in the direction it is about to zoom to.  After five sequences it zooms at an impossible speed silently. Video can be seen here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IIMh0mU6eI",2018-10-06T00:00:00,28.006814358108112,-82.47646101351351

At approximately 5:00AM, in the middle of August, I saw a perfectly circular object directly due north of my home in the exact direction of Cape Canaveral, approximately 45 miles away.  The object was immediately noticeable because it was very bright.  The object appeared white, to silver-white was completely stationary.  The sky was clear and cloudless with normal humidity for an early morning. In the first few seconds, I could see that the object wasn’t a rocket launch, or even a SpaceX booster return.  It was the wrong color, didn’t move, and didn’t vary in luminosity, shape, flicker or twinkle.  It was appropriately 4-5 the width of Venus, and about the same magnitude when Venus is low in the sky, and at its most bright.  It also was not an aircraft landing light.  That was obvious after watching it for 3-4 minutes and the object remained in the same location, didn’t change intensity, and was too uniform in appearance. After watching the object for about a full minute, I thought to get a picture but, I didn’t want to lose sight of it, and I was positive I would see it do something that would explain what it might be. After looking at the object for about 4 minutes, with no change in position or appearance, I knew I was seeing something I had never observed before. After about 4 minutes, the object began to dim in a very slow and measured way. It took about 30 seconds to a full minute before it completely went dark, still maintaining position of about 30 degrees above the horizon in the same exact location where I first noticed it.  It was during this slow dimming that the object appeared to be just slightly less bright in the center that gave it a slightly spherical appearance. During the entire time I saw the object, I didn’t see any other aircraft in the area or hear any other sounds. Expect for a few low magnitude stars, this was the only object, in the direction I was looking in. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

That it was clearly around disc saucer shape, and when it took off you didn't take off lightning fast it was moderately fast, but slow enough to follow visually.  Right about to the point it was out of sight, it went really fast. Whether it was bending light and appeared to go fast I would say right at the point when it was out of sight but not as it was leaving from the stationary point.

On the afternoon of 08/17/2018, a neighbor called me and, during our conversation about unrelated business, told me to take my phone outside, look up and tell him what I saw.  I told him that I saw the moon, the sun and blue sky.  He suggested that I look to the east, and, there I saw a circular object, suspended and absolutely motionless, high in the sky.  Me neighbor said that he had been watching it, while working outside, for over an hour.  It had not moved during this hour and he asked me what I thought that it was.  I told him I had no idea, and went back into the house for my point and shoot camera, as I didn't think the optics on my phone would render a decent image.  I was not able to 'zoom out' far enough to get any surrounding mountains or trees into the shot to give some perspective of size, etc.  I observed this object for approximately 20 more minutes, until I had to leave for work.  During the time I observed an aircraft flying at about 20,000! feet as it passed well above and to the west of the object; I would estimate the object's altitude to have been about 8,000 to 10,000 feet.  There was no sound, other than that of the aircraft.  I did not get a photo of the plane and the object in the same frame.  It was a breezy, warm summer afternoon, the sky was clear and the temperature was about 90 degrees.  The object was toroidal, or donut shaped, with a solid appearing outer rim or edge.  The center of the toroid was diaphanous, nearly clear.  There also appears to be, in the center, some 'structural', bar-like elements, which were about the same brightness as the outer rim. I showed my photos to several people and at least one suggested that it may have been a balloon; this seems unlikely, as it remained absolutely stationary for well over an hour and, as I mentioned, the weather was rather breezy.  Also, it did not look like a balloon.  My wife and daughter arrived home after I had left for work; I texted my daug! hter and asked her to step outside to see if she could see the! object.

She told me she was going to the bathroom and noticed the hallway was brightly illuminated.  The hallway is typically very dark.  This scared her and she decided to wake me.  The backyard is very dark, even on full moon nights, due to the very close proximity of thick trees to the house.  The house sits on the side of a steep hill, so the crown of the trees are progressively lower and thicker due slope of the yard.  The trees are currently full.

I approached the backyard flood light switches next to rear windows (also next to the bed and a door that leads out to the backyard) and placed my hand on the curtain.  I wanted to turn on the backyard lights, four in total, and open the curtains to observe what I anticipated to be a prowler with a large spotlight.  Before I opened the curtain, I observed what appeared to be a circular light source directly in front of me.  I could see the shape of the light source through the black out curtain due to the intense brightness.  I simultaneously turned on the backyard flood lights and pulled back the blackout curtain.  The unidentified light source disappeared at the same time I turned on my flood lights.  Instantly and with no delay the light was gone.  My significant other said aloud...with disbelief...""It's gone!! "".  I continued to scan the backyard to see if I could detect movement and listened for noise.  I heard and saw nothing.  I proceeded upstairs to get a better vantage point overlooking the backyard.  I also went outside the front door and around to the side of the house to investigate...Nothing and Nothing.

She looked into the room and stated the source of the light was coming from approximately a 2 o'clock elevated position from observing window.

I commented that the dogs,  at the neighbors homes, many kept outside, typically bark at everything during the night were abnormally quiet. The insects were also quiet. The next day during daylight I investigated the backyard and the woods to check for any disturbances.  Nothing unusual was found.  I questioned my neighbors and they did not see or hear anything.

Last Friday, my kids were still asleep in bed, when I  awoke at 6 am.  I was in the bathroom and it was completely dark outside.  All the sudden I noticed a bright light shining in through a large window.  The light was travelling slowly across the bathroom floor, which has 3 large windows in it.  I noticed it immediately, as we live deep in the forest, far away from neighbors.  Our house is located on 8 acres of forested land, and the bathroom is on the second floor.  I walked over to the window and looked up, and to my utter shock and amazement, I saw a gigantic rectangular shape moving slowly just above the tree line.  The window was open, and I heard a low humming noise coming from it.  I was awestruck as I tried to make sense of what I was witnessing.  The craft was as large as a 747 airplane in length, as it slowly passed by.  I couldn't see any of the sides or the top as it was so low down and close to our home, less then 50 feet from the house.  I could only see the bottom, which was filled with rows of red and white lights.  There were 3 rows of glowing illuminated white round  lights  the whole length of the craft on each side, for a total of 6 rows.  In between the white rows of lights were 2 rows of red glowing lights.  The lights were dim, similar to  car headlights pulling up in front of the house at night, but were clearly round shaped. It was only one single craft, and due to its size and low flight above our home, it blocked out the night sky as it hovered slowly past. I was frozen in the spot, and didn't even think to run and try to capture the image on my phone, which wasn't on me.  At each of the four corners were red blinking lights.  The shape was definitely flat and rectangular, like nothing I have ever seen in my life. The craft glided by for about 60 long seconds, and slowly drifted out of my line of sight, over the trees.  As it got further away, the lights turned to look bluish, and I could no longer see the detail of the round lights.  I called my husband right away, as he had already left for work, and then I called to report it to the local police, who had not received any other calls and didn't know how to respond. I was very scared to witness this, and am still having a hard time coming to terms with it.  I know it was much too large to be a drone of any type, and all other indications about its shape, sound, height, and movement prevent me from believing it was anything identifiable as man made.

(I saw this same thing on Monday, October 8th, 2018, 22:55 hrs., in Barrington, Illinois, with clear skies.  Me and my dog originally saw 3 orange-ish lights, all in one line, stacked on top of each other, like a traffic light....the lights were spaced closely to one another, changing color to like yellowy color and back to orange.)   Barrington/Barrington Hills, SW Night Sky...Sunday 11/4/2018 about 9:36 pm/21:36 hrs. some clouds in the night sky, but it had been raining most of the day and night. Cold 48' and ptly cloudy skies.  At time of sighting no rain.  Some clouds moving in night sky. Tonight took my dog potty, and floating about a half mile or less away in the night sky (in Barrington/Barrington Hills sky) were these same 3 orange colored lights.  They were obstructed behind a barren tree, I took photos and a video, but it kept moving and reappearing a few hundred feet from where it was.  I ran into my house, took photos using night mode, and took a video… I am including it for your review. My wife came out, and saw it also and she thought first it was a drone, then secondly, that it was a satellite.  She is unsure what it is. This is my second sighting and now I have another witness and some photos. I do not hear anything, and none of the lights on the object are blinking or flashing red....object does change colors from orange to yellow ish and back to orange. Update I went back outside with binoculars and my camera, and now it is raining, but I took some more photos of the area it was in. I did not see the object/s this time. I would like to know if anyone is seeing/seen these lights/objects in the area?",2018-11-09T00:00:00,42.1584,-88.1592

One lit up slowly then another just off to the right of it lit up while the first faded. then the second faded and the process repeated about four or five times.  The lights stayed lit for erratic periods from 1 to 3 seconds.   I got my cell phone and turned on the video camera then about 45 seconds into the video the same lights appeared again farther off to the west about the same altitude and for about the same duration.   I got off the highway at Georgesville rd and parked in a parking lot and got out waiting for about 5 minutes for another sighting.  But with no luck.  So I got back in my truck and travelled south on Holt Rd. and pulled into my neighborhood, stopped at the stop sign facing west and saw the exact same lights do the same thing again, but this time much closer.  At this point I realized the lights were just south of Bolton Field Airport, but very high in the sky.   I went out onto my porch several times looking west and about 15 minutes from the last sighting me and the woman that lives with me saw a group of 3 to four tiny flickering lights that appeared to be travelling north and over the Bolton Field Airport.  My line of sight was from my back porch facing west and the lights appeared just above my neighbors house that is about 60 feet behind mine roof line.  We watched them for about 6 or 8 seconds before we lost sight.  They were flickering and travelling very slowly.   We got into the car and left and took a country ride to see if we saw the lights again, with no luck.  But after returning home I went back to the porch and a little higher in the sky in the same general area I looked at the stars and saw a white light and htne if lowly went out.  I watched and witnessed this light lower itself in the sky and repeated to light up about every 6 or 8 seconds it seemed several times before it stopped.  We have seen numerous strange lights in the past few years around Columbus including a very large red triangle ufo that lit up through the clouds over the south end of Hilliard, Ohio, in the evening of February of 2016 that lit up twice for about a second or two, but was massive, probably being a mile or so away and hundreds of yards wide.  As well as two separate instances on opposite sides of the city in the distant southern skies were we saw a short string of large orange fiery lights, 5 or 6 fire orange colored lights lighting up at the same time that were very clos to being linked to each other like a small lego, then slowly dissipated within a few seconds, then light up another 1 to two times and disappear. The first time I saw these lights there was another small light off to the side in the distance light up when these light starting going out. I was in Reynoldsburg, OH in November 2016 facing south on this first occasions. And in Kouisville, OH, southwest of Columbus,! Ohio in February 2017 the second time. On the second occasion we  parked and filmed a 14 minute video (but didnt capture those big orange lights ) which we submitted to MUFON that contained several minutes of dozens of sporadic red and white lights  spread across portions of the sky flickering.  We later realized we also captured a very clear image of bright white UFO with what appeared to have a small spout shaped extension extending off to the right and downward to the bottom right corner of it.

On an exceptionally clear, moonless night some 60+ years ago (1950 or 1951) at a peak in UFO sightings, I witnessed an event which I am hoping someone living today saw as well.   When walking my girlfriend home at approximately 10 PM on a summer evening, I witnessed an event develop in the sky which was unique to anything I have seen in my lifetime which includes approximately 25,000 hours of flight time combined as an Air Force pilot and an airline pilot.  I am hoping this account will jog the memory of others who may have witnessed this event and will share their perspective. From the small town of Lynden, Washington, my girlfriend and I witnessed the following event:  A single bright spot appeared like a very large brilliant star to the northeast of our position.  The “star” grew larger as it became closer, becoming distinguishable as four single bright disks descending rapidly, and individually to hover at an estimated 100’ over or near Abbotsford, British Columbia, airport.   The disks joined in a formation, hovering there for about one minute.  The discs then began an ascent to the northwest at an angle of about 45° in a diamond formation, accelerating at an incredible speed, remaining visible for no more than three to four seconds.  They disappeared into the sky appearing to merge together as a single “star” - like any objects flying in close-proximity would with increasing distance.   Their size, while hovering over Abbotsford appeared to be probably 30’ to 50’ based on my estimate of size of aircraft which I had often observed operating out! of Abbotsford Airport which is located approximately 6 miles from Lynden. I have done several searches, but cannot locate any account of it in newspapers, available control tower records, UFO accounts, or through the memory of a few friends still living in the area.   In my flying experience I have been asked many times by air traffic controllers to look in a certain direction for “unknown traffic” (highly unusual above 15,000’).

This happened in the middle 70's. The day that the Harrier was first flown at Fort Campbell, Kentucky I was riding down a county road in the backseat of my car.  (Someone else was driving.)  It was still a little light out and there was something following us close with one bright light.  We thought it was a motorcycle.  I was watching it out the back window.  After a while it started flashing and rose into the air.  When it got to our left and above us we could see that it was round and there were lights all the way around it. We were on our way into the base and we watched it...  Until all of a sudden there was a family hitchhiking.  They said their car broke down but we didn't see it.  They wanted to go onto the base, too.  We took them, but while we were picking them up we lost sight of the spaceship.  We decided that it was there looking at the Harrier and took a minute to contact us.  Who knows, maybe that's where the plans for the Harrier came from.

Travel time was way shorter than it should have been (missing time?),Cincinnati,OH,1994-06-20T09:00:00,unknown,6 hours,"Occurred : 6/20/1994 09:00  (Entered as : 6/20/1994 09:00) Reported: 8/15/2018 9:00:13 PM 21:00 Posted: 8/17/2018 Location: Cincinnati, OH Shape: Unknown Duration:6 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/142/S142748.html,"Travel time was way shorter than it should have been (missing time?) I keep recollecting this incident so decided to submit a report.  This happened sometime in the summer/very early fall between 1993 and 1995, in the days before GPS and automated navigation, and before we had kids.  My wife and I decided to drive from North Alabama to Western New York State to visit her parents.  Since our route was taking us nearby Ft. Thomas, KY, where her aunt lived at the time, we agreed we would stop there for the night and take her aunt with us to New York State. In those days, I prided myself on my map-based navigational skills and ability to predict our arrival time to within 15 minutes, even driving hundreds of miles.  I was never off by more than a couple minutes, ever.  The first part of the trip to Ft. Thomas was uneventful, and we arrived within my predicted timeframe.  The second part of the trip from Ft. Thomas to our destination in western NYS, I predicted to be around 530 miles with a travel time of 7hrs 45 min to 8 hrs in duration (which gives an average interstate speed of about 66 mph, including stops).  All went well and we had a great trip.  I seem to recall that the last leg of the journey (maybe 50-100 miles) seemed a bit off from where I expected to be, like I took the wrong exit, but we easily knew where we were, and we made it to the in-laws as expected. When we arrived, the in-laws seemed surprised.  They were not expecting us so soon, even though I had given them the expected arrival time the day before, and we had spoken to them when we left, so they would know when we started.  The problem was, we arrived over 2 hours earlier than predicted, based on mileage and travel time from KY to western NYS. My wife, her aunt, and I were totally confused about how we got there so fast.  We checked the distances, and reran the calculations several times, each time showing the original, predicted 8 hour travel time and predicted arrival time (taking time zones into account).  I don’t remember if we ever checked the odometer (it seems that we would have), nor what the mileage was.  Getting there in 6 hours would have had us averaging over 88 mph.  I never drive that fast, and couldn’t through the city areas, and would have surely remembered doing so.   After a very short while we shrugged it off and went about our business.  However, in the weeks and years after, we talked about it off and on, and agree we all felt very weirded out.  It was a memorable experience. Other than driving through Cincinnati near the start and feeling like we took the wrong exit and road at the end, I don’t have any particular memories of the trip, of how we actually got from Ft. Thomas to our destination, where/when we got gas or made stops, or if we ate along the way.  Everything is a blur to each of us.  However, I do feel like at some point, I asked my passengers ""do you believe in them now.”  But it is a fuzzy memory, and I don’t know if I asked it, or if I somehow inserted that into my memory of that day.  What I do know is that we made impossible time on that trip, corroborated by outside witnesses, and we three travelers have no idea how we did it.  And I have seen plenty of strange things and had a number of odd experiences in my life, a number of which I have reported to this site.

Our torch batteries had died, so I was flashing his lighter so he could see to re-hook his line, he had his back to the field and I was facing the field.  A spherical UFO shot passed from right to left several feet away close to the ground about tree level, he didn't see it at first.  This was approximately 1am.   I was in shock and wandered off down the pathway alone, I remember seeing a light, then I remember walking back up the path.  My ex-boyfriend asked me where I had been and that I was gone for at least an hour or two, we checked the time and I was missing over 2 hours that I couldn't account for,  I explained that that was impossible I'd just walked down the path and back.  At around 3am I was trying to explain to him what I had seen when it came back f! rom the left side and hovered for sometime above the pup on the hill, we watched it together in disbelief as it pulsated through the colours of the rainbow with a glowing white center, virtually silent except for a deep vibrational hum or buzzing sound that could be felt more than heard, like static, similar to electricity pylons.   After watching it for a while it suddenly shot forward a few feet away and then off to the left again at an impossibly high speed 90 degree angled maneuver.  The other thing we noticed that night was a meteor shower of approximately 11 that we counted. I was 23 years old at the time and had no idea of how to report things like this, I'm now 44 and still remember it like it was yesterday.

Most people watching the fireworks on the Dewey/Rehoboth beach were looking westwardly towards the Dewey Beach water tower so the amount of witnesses is still unknown....13 crafts of various shapes, sizes, and colored lights appeared right above the water.  All of them were able to move  straight up, down, left and right with ease and precession.  Smoother than a drone and were able to fly great distances (miles or more) across the beach and out over the ocean.  It appears that the ufos observed the source of the noise  (fireworks) and lights then they moved in the direction of Cape May (also having fireworks).  When the fireworks were over they all left at the same time and the same direction out to sea. The red sphere was huge and seemed to scan the area. The diamond shaped UFO had a rectangular bright white light (like a large window) at the front tip., the other three tips had inconsistent flashing lights with seemingly no pattern or correlation. The lights would flash colors like red to white,  just red, and  just green.  while some of the other lights were just solid red, green, or white. From a distance they were like dots of light, as they got closer and flew slowly, directly over us, they appeared to be square/diamond shapes. None of the UFOs did not made noise.  Some moved individually, some moved in pairs, but as they departed  they headed in the same direction.  They appeared to mimic planes.  We believe that the lights served as either a communication tool with one another or as a way to disguise themselves as air planes.  Based on the movement and size of the crafts, they were piloted directly,  not remotely . However, with the technology we have available to us today, it's movements are not consist with a  modern day piloted aircraft.  Again, the UFOs more drone in it's horizontal and vertical  movements.  None of these observations occurred under the influence.  The planet Mars was very visible and not to be confused with this UFO event.",2018-07-13T00:00:00,,

B. Becker ufomig@yahoo.com. A young lady and I were enjoying some personal time in my Suburban north of town (Canton). At about 23:00 hrs. we noticed a fairly bright light to the north of us.  It appeared to be an elliptical light just above the tree line and about two miles away.  It would slowly move to the west horizon then streak back to the full east horizon in less than a second.  The light would go out and then appear to come toward us then stop and blink out.  Very erratic flight sudden stops and starts much quicker than any aircraft I've ever seen. After about 30 minutes it went straight up and went out.  We stayed about 1t more minutes and never saw it again. FOLLOW UP:  The light was white.  Most lights of any source I've seen are circular or an orb. This light wasn’t but elliptical, pointed at each end.  It was an object that was illuminated not a light beam.  It was a distinct shape. It's was above the trees at all times.  The tree line at the edge of the field was only a few feet wide; just a fence row with open fields on the other side.  It never went down to the ground that we saw.  It did go upward occasionally. The turns it made were always sharp angles not curving.  The area were at is close to the Mississippi River but this wasn't River traffic lights as I had watched them several times before and since and this was very different.  This light was a focused dot not flared like the searchlights on boats.  At the time there weren't many houses in the area and any town to speak of was 30 miles north.  I had seen objects in the sky both day and night that I couldn't identify before and have since.  Never saw it go to the ground.

It was winter and just happened to be Christmas eve.  The roads were covered in snow, but it was not snowing, but it was cloudy out.  We turned right at an intersection and began traveling due west, when the inside of the cab of the truck began to light up with a soft glowing blue light.  It was a dim light, but visible.  I could not see the source of the light, but both my wife and I saw the blue hue reflecting off the dashboard, radio and interior space of the truck cab.  I immediately stopped the truck on the road and asked me wife if she saw the light and she confirmed she did.  I looked behind us, to the side and front and saw no person, no other vehicles or anything that might have caused this to happen.  I did a u-turn and slowly drove back to the area on the road this happened to see if a house light, laser pointer or possible flood light from properties close to the road, but saw nothing.  The closest house, was a n outbuilding about 200-300 feet away from the road.  We were confused and drove back to the west again and proceeded home.  We did not see a craft, we did not hear a noise, or anything out of the ordinary outside of this singular blue light seemingly terminating from the inside of our truck from an unknown source.  A few days later, my wife recounted this event to her sister who lives due north in Sugar City, ID.

I was standing at my window smoking a cigarette and as I was putting it out I looked up and saw a air vehicle that I thought was a Cessna, that was entering my field of view from the left.  It was over the back of Wasilla lake when I saw it.  It moved slowly like a plane and seemed to look like a concept vehicle at over a couple thousand feet.  It had a red light you would see on the wing of a plane and an engine sound.  What I couldn’t focus on for a moment was when the engine quit running and I thought it would crash.  It was a sound effect of a plane that stopped.  It turns towards me and begins to bring the bottom of the craft upright as it’s approaching.  As this occurred, I put my hand up slowly over my heart and away in front of it.  There was one slow turn until it stopped about 40 feet in front of me.  I acted like shaking its hand and returned my hand over my heart.  As I looked it over, it was floating in front of me pointed parallel to the building I was in and not at me; it had a cross reaching all the way to the sides with no unnecessary markings except for the red light.  This red light was situated on the top part of the cross which represents intelligent action in the way it was on top since it turned towards me from the lake.  I was a few feet from my phone but I was stunned to move naturally and I had my gf sleeping in bed right next to me.  I didn’t want to wake her.  After about five minutes as it seems to be off to my right like presenting me with an award or something, it starts to leave to the left, slowly and in the same position it was in last.  Professionally, it seemed it was checking on a post nearby.  I have experience because I’m a veteran so perhaps maybe I was more valuable than the regular person.

It had 0.5-1-foot-long triangular tail on the flat end of the pentagon.  It was quietly traveling about 20 mph in a straight line.  The object contained no lights or moving objects on it. In comparison to a full moon, or a fist held up at arm’s length, this object was about 200% the size; however, it was in close proximity.  So, my best guess is an object about 3 feet in length. A second or two after this object passed by, a larger object followed within the same trajectory as the first.  The second object also was matte and beige and resembled a large kite.  However, there was no wind at this time and the object went from north to south, from within view to out of view.  This object had a 90-degree angled nose with the wings about 10 feet long.  The whole object was ‘M’ shaped with the back tip of the wings rectangular in shape with triangles on the end.  In comparison to a full moon, or a fist held up at arm’s length, this object was up to 600-700% of the size; however, it was in close proximity.  So, my best guess is an object about 10 feet in wing-length and possibly 14-15 feet wide. These were completely silent.  I felt no thoughts that this was abnormal while it happened.   It took me a couple of seconds to realize this was not an everyday occurrence.",2018-09-13T00:00:00,,

At about 3:00 a.m. a bright flash of lightning and a loud thunderclap startled me awake again.  Looking out our bedroom window, I could see that most of the storm had passed from the southwest and was now mostly east of us.  As I was looking, I saw a white light to the south-southwest about as bright as Mars has been these past few weeks.  I thought, a star, that means the storm must be breaking up and I can get a few hours of sleep. But then, I saw that it was moving and after a few seconds I thought perhaps it was the ISS, based on how fast it was going and the direction it was going - mostly eastward, but with a slight northerly track.  But I also thought that it didn't appear as bright as when I saw the ISS pass overhead a couple weeks ago.  But then the light began a gradual turn and after about two or three seconds continued to the north or to the north-northwest.  Well, that's peculiar I thought, and sat up to look more intently at the sky.  The light disappeared out of my view, blocked by the window frame. Then another light appeared, from more or less the same region of the sky as the first.  It was moving about the same speed, going slightly to the southeast.  Then it, too, turned and moved off to the north.  Up until this time, I thought I was viewing these lights against a clear sky, having thought the storm had moved off to the east.  But at the next moment, a bright flash of lightning in the east lit up the whole sky and I could see that the entire sky was filled with clouds, with no breaks to see the stars, and the area from which the lights had appeared was in fact a large, dark thundercloud.  Reviewing the public weather radar some four hours later, I would guess that the cloud could have been between 20 and 60 miles away, although at the time I had the impression that it was almost upon the city, less than 5 miles away. As I continued to watch, a second or two after the lightning, a third light appeared from the same area of the sky and continued on a path similar to the first one, at first heading east but then turning to the north or northwest.

After about another 10 seconds of the light slowly losing its intensity it was nothing more than a pinpoint of light no bigger than a very small star.  Within a second it faded to complete darkness and I lost sight of it.  The entire episode was about 15-20 seconds in duration. I have seen hundreds of shooting stars in my life.  If this was a shooting star it moved far slower than any I’ve ever seen and did not have a tail. I’m in my mid-50’s, have a post-graduate degree, am a professional, have a wife and children, and have never seen anything I’ve considered completely inexplicable in the air before.",2018-08-10T00:00:00,,

Sunday Evening – 10/7/2018  Highway 128 coming from Mendocino County travelling towards Sonoma County.  As you approach Cloverdale the road becomes a twisty mountain road with hairpin turns.  Towards the beginning of this stretch of road I spotted a large orb made of “strings” of light.  I remember thinking that it looked spiderweb-like.  It was very large like when the moon is close to the earth.  Initially, I thought that it was some kind of natural phenomena like the Northern Lights.  There was no shoulder to pull off on and it was dark.  I kept driving in hopes of getting another glimpse of it. I made many more turns and didn’t see anything.  I thought that I wasn’t going to be able to see it again but soon again I did.  The next time that I saw it.  It looked like the beam of a huge flashlight.  It began in a large circle and the bottom of the beam looked it when a spotlight is directed at a floor with a disc-shaped bottom.  It was very bright and well-defined.   Its beam ended well above the top of the mountain; much closer to the beginning of the beam than to land.  Then, again, it was obscured from my view by a mountaintop. When I next saw it next it appeared to be separate beams of light coming from a star.  Very bright white light. Kind of like the beams coming from the Eastern Star on Christmas cards. The next couple of times I spotted it it was as above. When I was just about at the end of this torturous stretch of road I spotted it again and now there was a shoulder on the road and more light.  I stepped outside of my car to take a picture. Once outside it had moved behind the mountainside to the right.  I walked across the road to take a picture.  I could visualize it but it was a if a dimmer switch had turned down the intensity.  I snapped a pic. Not impressive but it was there. As I headed down the access road to highway 101 the only thing I could see in the area it had been was what looked like a bright star lower in the sky than you would expect it to be.  To my left there was another “light” at about the same height in the sky but it was yellowish in color and less intense.  I’m not sure if these last two items were related to the orb and the beams of light.  There were no other stars that I could see looking briefly. Once home late afternoon on Monday I looked again at/for the picture I had taken along the way.  It wasn’t what I remembered.  It wasn’t discernable at all.  I’m not sure if it was even the same picture because of this.  If it’s not the pic I took, it was no longer on my phone. On Monday I googled “light orb spheres” and found a pic that was similar to what I had seen and I’ll include it here.  I couldn’t find anything else close enough to the flashlight-like beam and beam streams to include. Background of observer: 58 y/o female, registered nurse.

This light sat stationary just above the roof of my house and appeared to change shape, as it slowly descended until the main portion of the light dissolved and flared out.  This bright light measured approximately one-half inch between thumb and index finger with arms extended.  The light sat between two planetary objects, which were also captured in my iPhone still image and video (attached in an email). The principal light source did not appear to be a craft of any sort.

Three continued this way while one approached another and then stopped flashing.   Eventually they seemed to retreat into the distance and the flashing became fainter.  As they faded, they gave the impression that they were reflecting pulses of light rather than emitting flashes because of how the light seemed to scatter as if reflecting off a surface.

It had rained in the early morning and my window was littered with droplets.  Off to the west over the channel about 2 miles away, there were clouds with frequent breaks to blue sky.  I was scanning the sky for any anomaly that didn’t fit the normal airport traffic.  Hoping to spot something before going home.  So, was it my imagination or did it really happen?   As I looked at one particular blue patch in the clouds, I noticed a short yellow streak of light ascending at about 30 degrees from right to left (north to south) could have been several miles away and 3-8,000 feet altitude.   I was focused on that spot and then I saw another and another in the space of about 2 seconds there must have been maybe 10 separate streaks in the same location close to each other but occurring separately.  I thought hmmm, probably weather anomaly or some kind of refraction from the rain drops,  I went to finish packing to go to catch my flight.   About 8:30, just before leaving my room, I took another look in the same general area and as I looked, I saw a streak just like before only this time for the period of maybe a minute, I only saw the one.

Color changes too My wife and I were on our rooftop to watch fireworks on the 4th of July 2018. We have a clear view of The Sears Tower (Willis Center) which is about 2.5 miles away.  I noticed a red light, a bit brighter than what we typically see on top of building or tall antenna for aviation purposes. We also could see that all the buildings had their own red light(s) on top for identification purposes.  The thing that I noticed very quickly was that this red light was above the Sears Tower beacons by a long shot and was no way a part of that buildings antennas. The red light would stay solid for about 20 seconds then off for about 2-3 seconds, back on for about 5 seconds, back off for 2-3 seconds and finally stay on for 20-30 seconds.  This process lasted about 10-15 minutes.  Then the light moved in a completely straight horizontal motion, did the blink sequence and moved back to where it was.  It then moved in a completely straight vertical motion down above another building, eventually moving back up.  These movements were not fast nor slow but for the distance we were viewing from the movement was probably in fact very fast. At the end of this viewing the light switched from green to red and back to red several times and also did a white light blinking sequence for about 5-10 seconds before finally staying red.  These color changes all happened while sitting in one spot at a time.  We finally decided to leave the roof top because a large lightning storm was approaching and the winds were very strong.  In fact we could see the larger fireworks being blown northeast into the wind quite dramatically.  That was also very strange to see this light not moving with the wind as a drone or helicopter might. My first reaction was a helicopter but I have never witnessed a helicopter move in right angles so precisely.  My wife suggested a Drone but I don't believe a drone can stabilize so well in 20-30 winds and if I had to guess this light was probably 3k-7k above the lake.  From our vantage point the light would have been closer to southeast Chicago or possibly even Indiana. When we got back into out apartment I was excited to get my spotting scope set up to look at it but of course it was not there nor did it reappear for the next hour or so while we stayed awake.",2018-07-13T00:00:00,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089

If all of the object's/light's positions were connected with a line it would have been an approximate circle with a diameter of about 10 inches (on same ruler) or about 18 - 20 deg. arc. How did it disappear?  Over some minutes the ""central"" position seemed to drift toward the south (it continued its symmetrical disappearing-reappearing act)where it eventually dimmed out completely. It seemed to be at a pretty high altitude, was whitish or silverish, between a star and a planet in angle (no shape could be seen), it was completely quiet, and we saw no airplanes in the sky at any time during the sighting.  The object's brightness never changed and it left no visible trail or contrail.  Winds were off the ocean and very clear (of smoke) that night.  We know of no earth tremors either just before, during, or after the sighting.  We reported it the next day to Dr. Haines by phone.",2018-08-31T00:00:00,37.85145303030303,-122.52209848484848

I was sitting on the left side of the plane in the window seat, and the storm was directly in front of my window.  I pulled out my phone to take a video of the lightning because I thought it looked pretty cool from how high up we were.  While I was filming, I noticed a flashing red and white light flying.  It was flying the opposite direction of the plane I was in.  The object was flying in a straight line, and then it started to lower, stopped blinking for a second, and then when it started blinking again, it was up high again as if it had reversed.  It then kept flying away.  It looked almost like a drone, but because of how high up we were, there’s no way it was a drone or a building light, etc.  I also thought it could’ve been! a plane, but because of how quickly it moved, I didn’t think it could be that either.  I think I would of been able to see the outline of the plane if that had been what it was also.  It was very small and I didn’t see it’s shape because of how dark it was.

Well after dark I looked up at the ridge we were camped near and was excited to see what we thought was a moon rise.  We watched as the glowing orb rose behind the ridge, but before it was all the way over the ridge it quickly descended (unlike the moon). About 20 minutes later, a little to the right of the original sight, the same thing happened.  This time it was more orange (we thought the orange-ness of it was due to smoke), but it came up – not all the way over the ridge – and then quickly back down again. There is not a trail on top of that ridge, and the glowing orb was way too big to a headlamp anyway.  Both times it really did look like a moon rise, but it definitely wasn’t the moon.

I was in my back-yard working in the yard, around 3pm on Friday Aug 24, 2018, when I heard a helicopter fly above, and looked up.  To the right of the helicopter (helicopter was heading west) I saw a round object moving slowly thru the sky heading north.  The helicopter didn’t appear to be chasing it, as it just flew by and kept going west (though quickly fell behind the house/tree line so I don’t know if it turned back towards the object while out of my view.)  Very rough guess, but comparing to the helicopter that was at about 1000 feet, it had to be comparable in size to the helicopter, maybe slightly bigger.  I live near an airport, and see helicopters a lot, this was just an average size common helicopter.  (local news and police take off from there, and it just looked like the standard news or police copter, nothing military).  This airport is a Maryland National Guard base as well though (in Middle River Maryland.)  The object was slowly moving to the north, while slowly rotating.  Would say approximately 1500 to 2000 feet in the sky.  It was circular in shape, but if you think of it as a burger, it was round with a small bite taken out of it.  As it rotated, the side without the “bite”, it was reflecting a lot of sunlight off the top of the object.  As it rotated the “bite” toward me, it was reflecting much less sunlight.  That was how I could really tell it was a spinning object, but indented on one side (i.e. the bite).  It seemed to make a full rotation every 10 to 15 seconds.  I could not take my eyes off of it, kept trying to rationalize what I was seeing.  After 2 or 3 mins, it finally dawned on me to pull out my phone and record some video.  With the bright sunny day, I was having a hard time seeing my phone’s screen.  By the time I adjusted the screen brightness, got my camera app open and looked up, it was gone.  With how slow it was moving, I would have expected it to still be there.  I’m so upset I did not take out my phone sooner.  It had to have moved quickly out of view, I would say it took me about 30 – 40 seconds to get my screen brightness adjusted, and get the camera app open, and look back up.  It could not have been a plane, it was moving far too slowly.  A plane would have fallen from the sky at that slow of speed.  I did not see any helicopter blades on top, no wings, nothing.  Just a round spinning object, indented on one side.

Thinking it was just one of the amber colored street lights in my neighborhood shining through the treeline as the wind blew.   I then realized there wasn't any breeze and there shouldn't be a street light over in the area from where this light was coming from.  I was bobbing my head around trying to see it flicker again through the trees.  I see it 2 more times each of which it seemed to be to the left of where it previously was. I then realized this was not a street light.  I thought it was a plane at first as I live within 1 mile of T.F. Green airport in Rhode Island but it was not.  It looked more like a red signal flare except that it was not moving vertically upward, but horizontally with a slight ascention to it.   As it finally came into my full view from behind my neighbors' houses and trees, I could tell this was neither a plane nor a flare, as it was too large and bright for either.  There was no tail, no sound and no smoke or anything coming from it.  Moving too slow to be a meteor or comet.  It was traveling slow and low altitude as I was viewing this easily with my naked eyes.   I then ran into the house with excitement to wake my wife and tell her look out the bedroom window.  She said she saw it but I don't believe she did. I then went and got my binoculars and ran out the front door as the object has now traveled from behind my house to the front.  It seemed to be heading in a north/northeast direction coming from the southeast.  When I looked at it through the binoculars I could see that it was a round shaped object with a very bright (like the sun) white/yellowish glowing center and a thick red spiked halo around it which seemed to be pulsating/burning.  I ran back in through my house back out to my deck to grab my telescope to try and get an even better view but! by the time I moved it to a better area I could no longer find the object.  In my amazement and excitement, I didn't even think to grab my cellphone which was right outside on the deck with me and take a picture or video of it.  Someone else had to see this.  I am also sure that the airport MUST have seen this object fly by.",2018-09-13T00:00:00,41.71568450184502,-71.42906014760148

Both ladies were observing it moving around in a small area of the sky near an “aging” airplane contrail.  The contrail was actually providing a reference as it moved along, and across it, and seemed to be making some right-angle moves at times.    I was attempting to see what they were seeing, but not able to do so.  (I was actually mistakenly looking at for the object along the wrong contrail—there were 2 fairly close together and parallel in the sky and the one that I needed to be looking at was higher up, and the roof of my truck was blocking the correct one).  I reached under the seat and handed my daughter my binoculars.  She described it as “round” and either “spinning or pulsating” at about 1 second intervals.  (Still a fairly small dot even with the binoculars).  I was frustrated because I couldn’t see it, but was looking about 10 degrees of arc in the wrong area).

There is nothing between me and pioneer peak but open space and the river.  On Sept. 30, 2018 I took my dog out to go potty around 6:30 am.  It was still very dark outside.  While I was standing outside I look towards Pioneer Peak and saw several stars.  I noticed one that was quite bright and thought  maybe is was an airplane or star.  I watched it for awhile and thought maybe is was moving towards me and thought it was an airplane.  I was dark and I could see no shape just the bright light.  Then I noticed that the light was moving up and down and moving to the right and left.  It would drop behind the mountain and reappear.   The only reason I contacted you is that planes do not move like that and neither do stars.  It was not a drone and if so it would have to be the size of a huge airplane.   The next morning, I saw it again (Oct. 1, 2018)  It was doing the same thing moving sideways and up and down and I did see some flashed of red and green lights.  I took a video of it with my I phone and will try to send it to you.  The colored lights do not show up in the video as it was dark and very far away. This is about all I can say other they it was just very suspicious.  I will try to send the video to you. Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",2018-10-06T00:00:00,61.6092,-148.4657

I'm a highschool student who recently moved from Garden City to Conway, a rather large change considering we now live on a 30 acre farm.  Our property is closer to Bucksville and Jamestown, than Conway.  I'm used to planes flying by, far off of course, from Myrtle Beach International, I can see them from the back corner of the property, they're close enough to see basic details, like color and shape, and sometimes you can very vaguely hear the small rumble of the engine. On June 25th, I was home alone, babysitting our dog.  I was sitting at the dining room table, ((dog's name deleted)), our dog, lying on the floor next to me.  I was standing up to stretch my legs and go grab something to drink, and I heard this loud, deep rumble, and so did ((dog's name deleted)).  I walked over to the windows, about 4 feet away from me, and as I pulled up the blind I saw what was making the noise. Roughly 450 to 600 feet in the air was a pitch black, triangle shaped object, moving at a decent speed.  I was completely taken back by how absolutely Loud this thing was, it kept a decent speed, and moved in a generally straight line.  I honestly didn't believe it when I saw it until I realized ((dog's name deleted)) had come to the window with me and was staring at it.  Both of the cats had also woken up and were acting uncomfortable due to the noise and the vibrations it caused.  After roughly 40 to 45 seconds, it had gone over the top of the forest, the sound still continued until about 30 more seconds later. The only way I can describe this sound was a deeper jet engine.  This craft was small though, and when I say small, it looked to only be less than 4 inches across from where I was standing.  I really have no idea what this was, but I'm absolutely certain it was not a plane, it had absolutely no parts coming out from the main body, so I'm certain it wasn't a drone either. To make a long story short - small, pitch black triangle craft flies over farm at medium speed for 45 seconds, cats and dog notice, sound continues for 30 seconds after visibility is gone.",2018-07-19T00:00:00,33.89340405405405,-78.96144391891892

I can tell you that I have never seen anything like what I saw today.  I noticed a bright light or reflection of some sort coming from what seems like the edge of one of the mountains.  I called my fiancé out onto the balcony to come take a look, and we immediately started recording. Since we could not zoom in enough to be able to appreciate exactly what it was, we remembered we have high quality binoculars.  We grabbed them and took a closer look.  When we were able to focus on the object, we noticed that it had one large light in the middle, and two smaller ones on each side.  We are not sure if what we saw were 3 separate objects, or if it was just one craft.  However, what we can say is that the object was out in the open at 3:00PM in bright daylight, and these lights were beaming so bright.  It was not a reflection of anything as there is NOTHING else on those mountains. We are about 25 miles away from the location where the object seemed to be, so we got into our car and decided to drive a little closer.  As we started driving, we realized that the closer we got, the object seemed to be less visible.  We pulled into a parking lot, and we were able to grab someone's attention and asked them if they had any idea what the object sitting on the mountain was.  This woman said she has lived in Las Vegas for over 30 years, and has never seen anything like it.  We decided to head back home. Unfortunately, when we got back to our house.  We noticed that there was smoke or dust coming from the area where the object was seen.  We did not capture that on camera.  The object had seemed to move to the left, and was still a bit visible. However, left a cloud of dust or smoke behind.  We went out onto our balcony later that night, and this morning, and there is nothing out there now.

I was looking at the night sky and did see several shooting stars during this time.  I noticed a couple of strange things.  One, I could hear a sound in the woods that appeared to be coming from an electrical appliance.  I knew it wasn't natural.  It was low and very subtle but it was there.  I also noticed at some point, don't remember if before or after the incident what appeared to be a star go dark before my eyes.  It was there, then the star was gone.  The light of the star disappeared before my eyes as I was looking at it.  I just thought to myself what the heck was that.

I heard what I can only describe as a very high pitched electrical humming sound.  It started to grow in intensity, so much so that I thought my eardrums were going to rupture.  I didn't experience any pain, but the sound was intense.  As I opened my eyes, there was a wave of pinkish, orange, purple light all around me.  I was surrounded by granite boulders and foxtail pine trees, but I thought the whole night sky was dancing around me in these wave-like color tones.  I was scared, because I knew this was not natural.  In my head I said to God, ""Dear Lord, please help me.""  And then everything went back to normal in an instant.  I don't think this lasted more than 10 seconds or so. In the morning, I shared my experience with the adults in the group.  None of them heard or saw anything.  They thought is was bizarre.

He came inside and asked me to come outside and look at it through his binoculars as this is what he used.  My fiancé is 34 years old, is quite intelligent, and owns his own tree service business.  He is a pretty down to earth person.  As for me, I am 54 years old, high IQ, and am an accountant/bookkeeper.  I am level-headed and practical, but do question life and ponder deep things at times. My initial thought was that my fiancé had spotted a drone perhaps, and at first I could see nothing through his binoculars.  I did get them focused for my eyes and when I got the object in my sights I couldn’t believe what I was seeing and I thought maybe I was crazy.  This object was at maybe 45 degrees above the horizon and it jumped and danced about in an unorganized pattern, within a fairly small area.  It looked like a bright “star” that had been attached to a fireworks rocket, with a trail behind it.  White and blue light(s) were observed, and suddenly it disappeared from my sight.  My fiancé said it had moved behind the trees that were in my view, and I moved about two feet left and was able to see it again, doing the same crazy movements. I looked at two stars overhead to compare them to this object, and they looked totally different – white light, no movement.  I was and am still questioning my sanity, and I really don’t know how else to describe this thing.  I’ve never seen ANYTHING like it in my life, and I’m sure other people who are sky watchers had to have seen this as well.

Disappeared and reappeared 3 times in night sky. In the clear Western sky, I saw what looked like a very bright star or planet, but it was more yellow than white and seemed to flicker.  I watched for a minute or two and it disappeared then reappeared. I went outside and took some pictures and video with my phone.  Zooming in it was definitely not a star or planet.  It changed colors and seemed like a light with a glowing aura that changed colors, yellow to a blueish green and back to yellow.  Each time it appeared it would be in the same vicinity, but not in the exact same place.  It stayed in the same place but appeared to me moving in place if that makes sense. I filmed for 42 seconds and it disappeared on film.  I did not move the phone.  Then it came back for a third and final time and I filmed for over 3 minutes zooming in and out to try to get a better focus.  I stopped filming and then filmed another minute or so and it appeared to be moving and fading in and out until it disappeared again. On the 3 minute video, an anomaly occurred that was only evident after viewing it after the fact.  There is one second that something like a cloud or a vapor passes closely in front of the camera, but the orb never disappears in the far distance.  There were no clouds or mist around me while filming so I have no idea what it was. About 20 minutes after it disappeared completely, large aircraft began circling the area where I saw it and I also have some footage of that, too.  The only thing going on that night near that vicinity was the Indian Reservation was setting off some loud fireworks, but nothing like you see on the 4th of July.  It looked more like lightening.  This orb was off to the right a good distance away and low in the sky, but high enough for me to think it was a star or a planet. Most people are telling me it's a drone, but I haven't seen footage of drones behaving in this manner or that were this large. I am willing to share the footage, but I don't see where to upload it to this report.  Please let me know if you would like to see it.

The light gradually gets bigger and I notice there is a small red circular light behind it.  Gradually it becomes clear I am looking at some sort of cigar shaped craft with the green light in the front and the red light in the back.  It wasn't as big as a commercial aircraft, but not small either, maybe a few cars long (it could not cover the length of the 3 lanes on the parkway). It floated over the parkway until it reached the tree line to my right, and then made a graceful approximately 180 degree turn with the front of the craft as the pivot point then proceeded to return to the other side of the parkway.  At this point, I had slowed down (as did the car next to me) to get a better look and realized the craft had no wings and, as far as I could tell, was silent (I rolled down my window).  It ended up flying right over my car, at which point I could tell that it had a large upper and small lower fin on the backside that were blockier than the average airplane (nearly the same width as the cigar shaped base). In addition, as it reached the tree line to my left again I looked back out my driver's side window and noticed it seemed to have a rectangular chunk missing from the top half of the craft around the midpoint. Overall, the craft seemed to be composed of very strange edges.  The missing chunk from the middle of the craft had very precise geometric edges, as did the blocky ""tail fins"".  They were not really smoothed out in any way.  I could not accurately see the front of the craft because the bright green diamond light obscured it. When I got home I started to doubt myself as I drew the object I thought I had seen since it kind of resembled a plane, just without wings, blockier in design, and a chunk missing in the middle. In addition, when I looked up the area on Google maps, I noticed that Eagle's nest airport was very close by. So there is a mild possibility my sleepiness during a late night drive may have hampered my ability to observe accurately.",2018-07-13T00:00:00,,

My wife and I saw two red-orange glowing orbs over North Charleston, S.C.  They were some distance apart horizontally, but the same exact height in the sky.  It was just before 8P.M. so it was still light outside.  They were below the cloud line, so not very high in the sky.  They didn’t move at all.  They were so still, I can’t even say that they looked to be floating, more that they were just fasten to the sky.  The light they produced was from the entirety of the orbs.  I mean it wasn’t something with a red light on it, that would have looked different.  They were glowing.  We were about to get off the interstate when my wife noticed them, as we got off it we went below the tree line and couldn’t see them anymore.  We drive this way quite often at around the same time and have never seen anything in the sky where these two orbs were.

There I saw Mars and as I was looking at it, I glanced slightly to the right and above the light pole there was a very quick warping light almost resembling a boomerang that was shifting shape, all the while glowing a yellowish light which moved about 8 feet further to the right while in a zig zag motion, with no noticeable flight pattern, before suddenly disappearing.   Upon seeing this, I explained to myself “Oh my gosh, what is that!”.  Before retreating inside to immediately write this report.  It wasn’t a lightning bug since it was too large and too fast.  Definitely wasn’t a shooting star, too large and i could see the light in front of a neighbor’s house.  It almost resembled the form of a bat, but that’s not likely unless bats warp shape, glow, and ! disappear out of nowhere.  It was a very strange light, and it didn’t have a physical form.   My stepdad said that my dog was acting weird on the walk.  That after they cross our block, they both heard something and my dog was very eager to get out of there and back home.

My area usually does not have very many helicopters, so I peeked outside of my window to check it out. When I looked out, I instead saw a saucer flying at a slight angle (bottom facing me) directly above the street I live on. Usually you’d expect an aircraft to be flying quite a bit above the ground, but this UFO was about as high up as a 3-4 story building or a tall tree. I’m not very good at describing things, but the sound of the craft was akin to what a faraway helicopter sounds like.  Not like when you are close to it and you can hear the blades, but just the general rumble of the helicopter. I’m not sure if the UFO had a bump on the bottom like stereotypical depictions, but I don’t recall seeing one.  I was not able to see the top of the craft either. The UFO had small lights on the bottom, but not like you’d see on traditional UFO depictions. The lights were all over the place (more towards the middle than the outside of the saucer) and were colored red and blue. The lights were like looking at a distant street light, they were small and circular. I’d say the saucer was about the size of a jet, and it was very fast too. It was heading towards the nearby military airport as well. It got from where I lived on the outskirts of the city to the other side of the city in about 10-15 seconds. I personally believe that it was a military engineered aircraft, due to the fact it was flying so low, and heading towards the military airport with its lights on while flying straight over the city.",2018-08-31T00:00:00,42.316047787610614,-121.89806106194689

I got out of my car, put my bags over my shoulders, and began walking towards the house. I was about to set foot on the front deck when I heard what sounded like rotating blades on a military helicopter and, incidentally, a train whistle from a nearby track.  I stopped and looked up. I looked in the direction I thought the helicopter blade sounds were coming from (ahead of me, north, relative to where I was standing)...a star was the only object in that general area that appeared non-stationary (“movement” was just twinkling).  The size of the twinkling star was so small (from my vantage point) that, if it had been a helicopter, the sounds it was making wouldn’t have been as loud as they were.  I never saw a helicopter but I didn’t bother to look up all around me either...I thought “I stopped for nothing” (I was on the verge of lowering my head & trudging inside). I’m a trained observer.  My job title is Behavior Analyst (2008 to present).  I provide professional behavioral services to persons with developmental and intellectual disabilities. At 4:40 am, as I was on the verge of lowering my head and trudging inside, a bright streak of pale orange/yellow light (to my northwest) didn’t make any sound while rapidly shooting upwards at a 30 to 45 degree angle (it didn’t just shoot upwards at a high rate of speed...it stretched/expanded upwards from its original position), paused for about 0.5 seconds, and collapsed (i.e., stretched/condensed from its original position to where it had stopped stretching) at an even higher rate of speed than when it had stretched/expanded from its original position (debris was emitted upon collapse). I looked for a specific object but didn’t see one.  The streak may have been an undetected object (of a probable terrestrial origin, statistically) traveling at a high rate of speed.  The streak looked like a long exposure image of an ember popping and soaring from a fire.  Upon collapse, the streak either disappeared or began accelerating so fast that I could no longer observe its presence.  Upon collapse, the emitted debris either disappeared or was no longer illuminated. What I observed was over and done with before I had a chance to think about dropping my bags and getting my phone out.  The duration of the observed event may have been about 3 seconds. Terror/excitement combo experience was hard to process.  I don’t think I heard any sounds at all during the few seconds that the bright streak of pale orange/yellow light stretched/expanded, stretched/condensed, and dissipated...but I’m not sure.  After the streak disappeared or accelerated, train whistle was still screaming but sounds of helicopter blades (not even distant ones) were no more. If a helicopter was present, the pilot or pilots evacuating themselves (immediately after object dissipation) could/would make sense (following orders/protocol). My jaw was on the driveway.  I picked it up, went inside, and got to writing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2018-09-13T00:00:00,36.3022,-82.4825

We headed outside approximately 6:30pm and my husband and I immediately saw this huge ""star"" hovering above the setting sun.  We are always looking at the sky, my husband is a flight director at the Deming Blimp site, so I knew it was way too early for stars.  Mars is the first one in the sky and it appears over the Florida mountains.  This ""star"" was the opposite direction over the setting sun. I took my son inside and grabbed our camera because phone cameras can't pick up stars well.  My husband and I called our neighbors and they went outside and saw it as well.  We watched it for 40 minutes. During that time it never moved with the earth and never blinked like a star, just shown like a spotlight.  It did however change from a circle to a guitar pick shape.  We were extremely excited and nervous and that made for not great videos but we have ! videos and lots of pictures of it.  During the 40 minutes another bright light appeared above and to the left of the original light and moved straight down toward earth and disappeared. Then 3 lights appeared around the original light and moved straight down and disappeared. The original light seamed to join them at this point and moved down and disappeared but it shrank to disappear.  All of this happened in less than a minute.  We rushed inside to download the footage into the computer because I have heard of weird things going on with equipment when things like this occur.  While my husband was downloading the pictures and video onto our computer the orb came back in the night about 8:30 pm.  This time it was in the North.  This time it was close to were the Blimp is in the Deming sky.  This time there was another light with it hovering to its left.  It was there for about 10 minutes and then disappeared.",2018-09-13T00:00:00,32.22860909090909,-107.76305454545454

Around 6:50 PM MT, my wife and I were outside of our home in Deming, NM, when we spotted a bright white light, brighter than stars at night time, during day light hours.  The sun was an hour away from sunset and the sun beams were still on the object.  Air traffic does fly in this region but all airplanes traveling were visible and pictures were zoomed in and taken of them as well just to double check every little light we were seeing in the sky.  Many pictures and video were taken of white lights in the sky.  A Canon Power Shot SX530HS was the camera used with a Tripod for stability. I began zooming little by little to keep focusing in on it.  The item appeared to be shaped like a downward pointing guitar pick with smooth rounded edges.  No detail of body of the object, it was solid white.  Smaller red and blue outline around object.  This was not visible without zoom of the camera due to the brightness of the object.  Smaller light objects appeared near the object, som! e going up and some going down and disappearing.  The photographs of these objects came out to be small white round lights.  The regular commercial airplanes that fly in this region were easily able to be photographed and to see that they are indeed airplanes not to confuse them with any of the other lights.  I checked star maps and planet visibility trajectories around our area to see if we were perhaps mistaken a planet but nothing was due to be in the area or at the time of day we were seeing this light object.  The main diamond/pick shaped object remained in place in the sky for around 35 minutes then it suddenly disappeared.  The moment it disappeared my wife and I could hear packs of coyotes howling and yelping loudly, our dogs began barking, and our ducks began quacking very loudly. This bright white object did not twinkle like a star.   Shortly after it disappeared the first star south east of that object started to appear and I took a zoomed in picture of it as reference of how a star looks from that same perspective near the same t! ime frame.  The two are very different.  The object would have been South-West of Deming and South of Lordsburg.  Severe weather had moved into the boot hill region of New Mexico around 4pm.  So the local aerostat was not in flight, the regional weather sounding balloons were not in flight, and it would have been a horrible time to attempt to fly a hot air balloon.  I would estimate the altitude to be between 25,000-35,0000 feet above surface.  However distance was difficult to factor.  Altitude being based off knowledge of cloud heights for the region at that time of day.",2018-09-13T00:00:00,32.22860909090909,-107.76305454545454

A turkey vulture was riding the air currents at a hundred feet in the sky.  As I traced its glide from dead center of my visual field to my left, I saw the following at well beyond 50k ft. altitude: -	Due Western Sky @ 268 degrees (I checked this later with my iPhone Compass App, thus I can confirm that) -	Conditions of sky/weather:  Clear Blue sky; No Clouds – not one; No precipitation; unobstructed view; “Rural” sky – no city/urban/sub urban type of interference -	Duration of sighting:  approx. 20 to 30 seconds, not having looked at any time device -	Witnesses: Self only -	What: o	Bright white/silver round orb.  VERY bright, which is why my eyes fixed upon it. 	WAY too far up altitude to make out any distinguishing features.  Object well beyond cruising altitude of any commercial jet, never mind military (SR-15 or U-2) type jet either. 	Object seen simply standing stationary in the sky - no movement.  Non-orbiting. 	Knee Jerk mental reaction was, “Why is there a star in the sky so bright that I’ve never seen, and especially because it’s nearing 10 in the morning?”  	Caught my attention due to its brightness and unexpected sight as I pondered the above, staring at it through my polarized sunglass lenses…  THEN! It moved! o	It almost instantaneously ‘zipped ‘from where it had been standing in my eye sight to another “close in the visual field” 2nd location and stopped for approximately 5 seconds.  I continued watching in awe. o	Five seconds later, it ‘zipped’ again almost instantaneously to a 3rd location, still within my “visual field”. There it sat for another 5 seconds. I removed my sun glasses to make sure I wasn’t “seeing things”. It was still visible to my naked eye. o	Then it ‘zipped’ again to the 4th still “close in the visual field” location, where it rested for another 5 seconds. o	Then it ‘zipped’ again to the 5th still “close in the visual field” location, BUT: this 5th location was to the right of where I first witnessed the object, crossing over its previously traveled path o	There at the 5th location, the object again paused for 5 seconds, where after it simply “vanished” from sight.  I stared. I looked for more movement. I scanned my visual field. I put my sunglasses back on. It was no longer visible or locatable anywhere in my visual field. The object did not “zip” to a 6th location from what I could see. There simply was no trace. o	All the above described was immediately documented by me by hand as I rushed back into my residence. This includes a sketch of the objects pattern of movement in my visual field until it was no longer seen.  -	Considerations:  The first person I spoke with after my sighting was Peter Davenport. I found him through a quick Google Search, as I wanted to report my sighting to “not just anyone” – but to an ‘authority’ on such things, not an ‘authority’ that could care less (i.e. the police, the mayor’s office, etc.) I later that afternoon told my daughter, and my girlfriend. They urged me to contact a news organization(s), which I did, but without photo or video evidence they (the news organizations) were disinterested in my account.

Viewed from 33°36’48” N x 111°52’35 W Viewed with a naked eye  Numerous unidentified “aircraft” shaped objects above North Scottsdale, Sunday, August 5th, 2018, at 8:48 p.m. The initial object was a solid bright orange, not flashing, then the orange disappeared and was replaced by what appeared to be all dark with a spotlight being adjusted.  This object was moving NE to SW, then changed direction and moved W, it flew at increased and decreased pitch like a greater-than-less-than symbol. Several airplanes appeared shortly after and began flying towards the object, at which point three additional objects that appeared to look like Military Drones, as they were torpedo-shaped but with large bat or seagull shaped wings.  As it was dark outside, I determined shape by looking at the cast of the light.  Eventually a fourth object that was solely a golden Naples-yellow color appeared where previously I had identified Venus as being with the use of the SkyView Application, as if the lights were just turned on, and then the object began traveling quite slowly North to South. All of the objects with the exception of the identifiable aircraft were silent, and no wind sheer could be heard.  The initial object appeared to be around 15,000 feet high, while the other objects appeared to be above the 38,000ft altitude most commercial aircraft fly at. Then at 9:35pm what initially appeared to be a military aircraft, silently jettisoned across the sky very quickly, North to South, before eventually turning and heading East also seen from Scottsdale.  Though initially it appeared to be a military jet with traditional lighting for perhaps a Stealth plane or an F18 Hornet, then the lights suddenly vanished and a golden light overtook the silhouette of the aircraft and instead of traveling East it made a full loop very quickly as if traveling faster than anything I’d ever seen before, at which point a loud guttural sound was heard, perhaps it was an antique military craft, but all observations do not support that theory.  Throughout the totality of the event a plethora of sounds could be heard from airplane, to jet sounds, to sounds similar to motor boats, as well as sounds similar to Electronic music synthesizers. The initial observer and his fiancée  are a 34 year old man and a 33 year old woman ,residents of Scottsdale, who is originally from Chicago and recently moved to Arizona in 2017, initially moving to Wickenburg before moving to Scottsdale on 1/118.

All were white. I was sunning by the pool at our building in Las Vegas, at the start of a short holiday (because our choice resort in St. Martin was destroyed).  I was looking up, mostly watching the helicopters and planes departing LAS.  Then, I saw the first object. I saw a bright white UFO, moving slowly.  Then I saw the second one.  Then, the first dropped 3 objects from it.  The 3 new UFOs looked like “stars”, except it was about noon, with a blazing sun, so stars wouldn't have been visible.  I thought they might be weather balloons. But, then I realized that one of the larger objects, moved at a MUCH faster rate, than the UFO “mother” ship that dropped the three “stars”.  So, they couldn't be balloons, or they would all be moving at about the same rate, in the same direction.  Plus, they didn't look like balloons.  They looked like “pyramids” and “stars”.  When I saw the three objects falling from the mother ship, I thought it might be a plane, dropping jumpers. But, I realized, it was not a plane. As the first object got closer (more overhead), I could see it was sort of a pyramid shape, but the orientation changed, as the UFO “tumbled”. It did not stay in a constant orientation, like an airplane. The 3 dropped “stars”, moved slowly “below” the mother ship. They didn't drop quickly, like jumpers, which was another reason I realized they were not skydivers. Then, they stopped “dropping”, and moved along with the mother ship, in a roughly North-South orientation.  The four UFOs moved slowly, in more or less the same North-South direction. The larger one was the “pyramid” shaped one, with the three “stars” following. Then, I noticed more of the “star” UFOs. I saw about 7-8 more. They were in a second group, behind the first four, but all moved about the same direction and roughly the same speed. Sometimes, some of the UFOs would stop, and be stationary for a while, but eventually they mostly moved off in the same North-South direction. After some minutes, one of the “star” UFOs suddenly moved at VERY high speed, in the opposite direction of the others, Northerly.  During this whole UFO time period, I saw probably about 7 airplanes. That helped me judge the speed and behavior of the UFOs. Most of the UFOs were moving MUCH slower than the aircraft, except for the one “star” UFO that started moving the opposite direction. It was going about four times faster than any of the other aircraft I saw, and some of them were high-altitude jets moving at their normal speed.  Another of the “star” UFOs was moving about 120 degrees away from the direction of the movement of the others (Northeasterly). As it moved away, it slowly turned as it moved, about 90 degrees to the left, so it ended up moving at about a 30 degree angle from the direction of the others (Southeasterly).  Then I saw another group of around 8 “star” UFOs. They were largely moving right-to-left, North-South, as most of the previous UFOs had before. When one or more moved more overhead, again I could see the “pyramid” shape, with the continuously changing orientation. The rest looked like stars. They appeared to move to the South, in the direction of the Sun. I think that they were climbing, as well as moving roughly North-South, as they got close to the Sun.  Later, one of the “star” UFOs moved off at about a 45 degree angle path away from the main direction of most of the UFOs, and disappeared moving in that direction (southeasterly). Then, I saw one of the “star” UFOs moving away from the track of the others: It looked like it was mostly climbing up, away from the path of the previous UFOs. But, this one was changing in visual intensity dramatically. Sometimes, it could barely be seen, but then it changed to very bright, much brighter than any of the other UFOs, then back to looking like a “star”, like most of the other UFOs. It was changing in brightness at random intervals, the whole time I saw this UFO.  After this, I saw one more of the “star” UFOs. In total, the experience lasted about 45 minutes, and I saw about 20 UFO objects.  They weren't weather balloons, airplanes or helicopters. They weren't drones or RC planes, and not anything publicly acknowledged in a current military inventory.  Note: I was a USAF pilot, and am now an airline pilot.",2018-10-12T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

It was a perfect day for hiking with sunny skies and crisp weather in the upper 50's.  On our way down, we stop to chat with some backpackers who were making their way up the trail.  While I and the other guy were wrapping up hiking talk, his partner said to me and my wife, ""I have to show you something"".   She pointed toward the West where the sun was just above the ridge, and there seemed to be a huge number of floating spider webs that you could see when the sunlight hit them at the right angle.  I though at first there had to be hundreds if not thousands of spiders on this one prominent tree alone to account for all the glimmering threads we saw.  It almost didn’t make sense as there were webs radiating all around, not only streaming off the tree.  I didn’t think I ! could capture what I saw on my iPhone but I snapped off one shot anyway.  The photo shows the time as 3:51 pm.   We parted ways and were still astounded at the sheer volume of these floating and streaming gossamer threads in the sky, neither one of us having witnessed that before. Later in the hotel room I was uploading the photos of the day to my wife's iPhone and to my iPad when we discovered the object in the upper right corner of the frame.  Somewhat coincidentally, both of us had thoughts of a UFO in the area without saying anything to each other until we saw this image later on the iPad.   As we drove to the restaurant for dinner, I began to have an old memory from years before of reading about a connection between some UFO sightings and ""angel hair"" being seen at the same time.

I looked out the window and saw the unexplained craft fly above my home at a low height in the sky.  It flew from north to south.  A prime example, from the PG metro green line towards the West Hyattsville Green line direction.  I was the only one awake at the time.  At exactly 02:04, I took 2 pictures that I have saved on my phone of the craft.  It flew in a circle pattern in the south direction.   The craft had a grey texture of color, from what could be seen from the craft.  As it flew in an angle above heading south, the lights were really bright on the side with, what appeared to be in a triangle shape with really beautiful blue lights on the sides.  Then you could see the really, really bright lights on the front of the craft.  The craft was shape in a diamond shape, but a lot more flatter but not saucer shape.  Then, just like in the movies, it shot out flying at a tremendous speed, heading northeast, with the same electric engine sound, but a lot more stronger than when it flew by above my home.

The witness works at a bayside outdoor bar as a doorman.  He was collecting cover charges from patrons as they entered the bar and appreciating the bayfront skyline, most notably the Port Erie Bicentennial Tower which dominates the skyline view of Dobbins landing which is the name of the district that the bar and tower are situated in.   He first noticed the object because he believed that it was a Lifestar medivac helicopter taking off from Saint Vincent Hospital which is near the place of the sighting.  It began blinking different colors alternating between red, green and then blue and white at random intervals.  It stopped and hovered in mid air and then began making bizarre right angle turns and wild oscillation in altitude before beginning lazy swoops over the bay and then heading over to Presque Isle across the bay before coming back towards the bar. (out of respect for his employers he will let them remain anonymous) it moved from NE to SW, circled the tower a few times and then began to sweep back and forth over Dobbins landing.   His immediate reaction was to observe it and conjecture what it could possibly have been.  It was too small and too quiet to be a helicopter, but the range was too far for a civilian drone and the night was too dark to be taking drone photography.  He attempted to point out the craft to a leaving patron; who was unfortunately too intoxicated to take notice of the craft.  The craft then traveled up above State Street proceeding to the S and then ascended above the cloud cover and dissipated into the cloud cover or was obscured by the light pollution of the city.  His immediate reaction was to tell his friends and immediately try and write down everything he had seen in complete detail.  He communicated this via a smartphone to three of his friends.",2018-07-19T00:00:00,42.09974517647059,-80.07763388235293

I was driving my girlfriend to her doctor's appointment.  Our sighting lasted about one minute or less.  While slowing to exit from one interstate highway to another I noticed what appeared to be a metallic saucer-shaped craft high in the air.  The craft was north of our position at about 45 degrees above the horizon.  I estimate the altitude may have been 10,000-15,000 feet (higher than a light prop plane but lower than a cruising airliner).  At the time there was a sunny clear-blue sky to the north without clouds and unlimited visibility.  There were clouds to the south but they were not a factor.  I watched the craft trying to determine whether it might be an airplane but there was absolutely no discernible movement, nor were there any FAA lights, markings, noise or! vapor trails.  The disc was hovering and reflecting the sunlight.   I'm 58 years old, BS with honors, am familiar with military and civilian spacecraft and aircraft, meteorology, astronomy, and relatives from NASA, NSA, and Army helicopters.  This craft did not appear to be one of ""ours.""   After deciding for myself that the craft in question might very well be an extraterrestrial vehicle rather than a man-made aircraft, I pointed it out to my girlfriend.  She observed the shiny hovering disc for about 15 seconds and came to the same conclusion.  My girlfriend also is mature, college degreed, and the owner/operator of an online store.  We both watched the disc hover, seemingly motionless, reflecting the sun, and then it appeared to vanish into thin air without a trace.   We scanned the clear-blue sky but the ""saucer"" apparently cloaked itself, raced off in the blink of an eye, and/or perhaps disappeared into another dimension of time/space.  We did not see or hear a! ny man-made aircraft in the sky in that direction at the time of our disc sighting.  Only the shiny metallic saucer-shaped craft.  No clouds, airplanes or helicopters.  However, both of us heard a military jet fighter roar over our house at approximately 10 a.m. the same day, about four hours before we saw the UFO disc.   We live in rural King William County about 30 minutes northeast of where we saw the disc. We have seen many black unmarked helicopters over our property, and occasional jets, especially in conjunction with other resident's UFO reports, but I believe this was the first jet fighter in a few months and we found it noteworthy since the fighter plane was monitoring our area a few hours before we saw the UFO. Just a ""coincidence""?  There is an Army base with heliports and airstrips controlled by the NSA, including ""secret"" underground tunnels, about 30 minutes northwest of our home but the aforementioned chopper and jet-fighter flights are not routine and nearly always coincide with MUFON/NUFORC reports by other local! witnesses.  My girlfriend and I believe the ETs are mostly benign and it's the ""shadow government"" and military/industrial/intelligence complex that people should be concerned about.  We believe the ETs probably monitor the shadow government facilities and vice versa.  We believe the latter information and opinion is relevant and should be considered in conjunction with our possible extraterrestrial disc sighting because of the unusual jet fighter roaring over our house the same day.  Note: Our shiny, reflective UFO disc sighting outside Richmond, VA occurred on the afternoon of July 9, 2018, and I reported it to the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) on the morning of July 10, 2018 (MUFON case 93248).    Then on the morning of July 15, 2018 I discovered a NUFORC case from Springfield, VA, about a shiny, reflective possible UFO disc seen in the daytime on July 8, 2018, but posted to NUFORC on July 13, 2018.  The NUFORC case reminded me of our Richmond sighting first reported to ! MUFON.  Bottom line:  Someone in Northern Virginia near Washington, D.C, saw a possible UFO disc during the day on July 8 and then my girlfriend and I saw a possible UFO disc during the day outside Richmond (120 miles south of D.C.) on July 9, and a military fighter jet made an unusual pass over our rural home on July 9 about four hours before we saw the disc-shaped UFO.  All just a ""coincidence""?",2018-07-19T00:00:00,37.558607538635506,-77.50798002261591

I can corroborate certain elements of the UFO sighting spoken of on your program which aired on 29 June 2018 which occurred in Goodwin, South Dakota.  I lived in Hazel, South Dakota, at that time... about 35 miles East-Southeast of Goodwin.  I was living with my grandmother, my father, and mother and we were all watching TV in our living room.  I was 9 years old at the time and sitting much too close to the TV, as kids do, when suddenly my parents and grandmother JUMPED out of their seats and bolted to the window as fast as their feet would carry them and exclaiming, ""What WAS that?"".  They were nearly in shock, very shaken by what they had seen.  An exceedingly bright light had lit up the sky for perhaps 1 second, maybe less than that.  But it was exceedingly bright.  Like daylight according to them, which was what made it so scary.   Unfortunately I was sitting so close to the TV that I saw nothing... (the window was behind me and I was inches away from the TV screen), but there was no doubt as to what my parents and grandmother had witnessed.

I lived in Hazel, South Dakota, at that time... about 35 miles West-Southwest of Goodwin.  I was living with my grandmother, my father, and mother and we were all watching TV in our living room.  I was 9 years old at the time and sitting much too close to the TV, as kids do, when suddenly my parents and grandmother JUMPED out of their seats and bolted to the window as fast as their feet would carry them and exclaiming ""What WAS that?"".  They were nearly in shock, very shaken by what they had seen.  An exceedingly bright light had lit up the sky for perhaps 1 second, maybe less than that.  But it was exceedingly bright.  Like daylight according to them, which was what made it so scary.  Unfortunately I was sitting so close to the TV that I saw nothing...

I have never been able to forget it.  I did report it to LAMUFON and I was contacted about it.  We spoke for at least 1/2 hour. It was about 5 AM around May 1997.  I was walking to Griffith Park to do my morning work out.  As I was going west down Franklin Ave., I noticed (how could I not notice it, it was HUGE) a large very bright egg-shaped object slowly going across the horizon at about 15 or 20 degrees.  As it moved from behind some trees I was surprised at how large it was.  As it continued across the open space between the trees and the houses on the other side of the street it came into complete view and I could see the whole object.  (Did I say it was HUGE?)  As it continued to move past I could see the rear of the object and saw sparks sputtering out of it.  When it got to the other side of the street, it disappeared, and I didn't see it after that.  One of the things I thought was interesting was that the light coming off of the object, as bright as it was, didn't throw shadows and there was no sound. I was teaching at the East Los Angeles College South Gate Campus at the time.  About a week later one of my students came to me and apologized for coming in late to the class lately. He said he had the midnight shift at LAX.  I asked him, ""Were you working last Thursday?"" He said, ""Yes.""  Then, I asked ""Did you happen to see any...?""  That's all I got out.  In a surprised voice he said, ""We ALL saw it.  We said, 'What the **** us that?'  It was way out over the ocean.""  Interesting when an object is verified by others from a different perspective.  LAMUFON may still have the report in their files.  The picture of what I saw was in the report. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Egg shaped yellowish lights that danced around a tree and house.,Kingstree,SC,1994-10-08T18:30:00,egg,15 minutes,"Occurred : 10/8/1994 18:30  (Entered as : 10/08/94 18:30) Reported: 7/3/2018 10:37:45 AM 10:37 Posted: 7/5/2018 Location: Kingstree, SC Shape: Egg Duration:15 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/142/S142038.html,"Egg shaped yellowish lights that danced around a tree and house. This happened back in 1994, sometime in October.  My husband and I were staying at my in-law’s farm house right outside of Kingstree, SC, while our daughter was in the NICU in Florence.  We had been there almost 5 weeks and were enjoying the country life.  It was approaching dusk and my sister-in-law and I were in the house cooking dinner and enjoying light conversation.  Our husbands had gone out into the woods on 4-wheelers and had been gone awhile.  We heard them racing back across a field, the engines were full throttle and they were shouting.  My sister-in-law went to the front door to find out what the excitement was.  I was still in the back of the house but could hear them screaming to get out of the house.  The men were screaming, freaked out panic screams.  I thought maybe the house was on fire and we didn’t know.  My husband got to me before I got to him, he grabbed me by the arm and dragged me out of the house.  My brother-in-law was already hustling my sis! ter-in-law up the driveway.  We followed behind them and I kept trying to get answers.  We got around 100 feet from the house and stopped under a large pecan tree.  I was still asking questions as the men were clearly shaken up and I was jacketless and shoeless and not having fun.  My husband grabbed me by the shoulders and turned me around towards the house.  I stopped talking. There were lights. Orbs.  Balls of light that weren’t quite round but weren’t oval.  They were hard to stare directly at because they didn’t have clearly defined edges.  Like the inside of them was a solid but they were surrounded by a mist.  Like the outside was a fuzzy layer. They weren’t white, but they weren’t yellow.  They were big, even from where we were standing they looked to be around 4 feet long and another 2 or 3 feet high.  There were 5 of them. When I think back to that day I have a hard time counting them in my mind because of the movement, I’m almost 100% sure there were only 5.  They didn’t float, they almost danced.  They were going around the house in an up and down motion. In some rhythm that seemed soothing.  I wasn’t soothed,  I was panicking. I think I was the only one with a clear mind at that point. My husband told me that they had been way out in the woods and had seen them in the distance.  They thought they were swamp gas and didn’t think anything of it.  As they came back towards the house they realized that they were moving in a circular motion and that they were moving towards the house.  They came out of the woods and were on the other side of the sweet potato field when they realized that the lights were headed towards the house.  When they pulled up to the house the lights were still close but were not at the house yet. We all stood under that pecan tree and stared.  I couldn’t come up with an explanation in my mind but I found myself silently watching those orbs dance around the upper floors of the house in that up and down pattern.  All of a sudden they went up in the air, well above the tree tops, shot off to the left and went completely out of sight.  There was a shocked pause and I found myself saying we needed to call the police.  Before I could finish my sentence the lights appeared in the distance and came back just as fast as they had disappeared.  They returned to us but not the house.  They were above us, dancing around the giant pecan tree.  I looked up to watch them winding through the limbs.  They were dancing/circling in the same pattern as before.  They were hitting the limbs enough to cause pecans to fall. We were suddenly being pelted with pecans.  Not a few pecans, it seemed like every pecan in the tree was coming down.  I could hear twigs and branches breaking, but I didn’t get hit by anything but pecans. We ran halfway back to the house. We stopped because I was freaking out at this point. I didn’t want to go back in the house and I didn’t want to stay outside. I was the only one losing it. My husband was saying “maybe it’s lights from the airport, the airport is over that way” and pointing in the direction the lights had gone to and rapidly come back from.  My brother-in-law was still talking about swamp gas.  I interrupted them both to remind them that swamp gas couldn’t and wouldn’t fly away and back at such a speed and that airport lights wouldn’t knock pecans out of a tree.  We started to argue about what to do and my sister-in-law interrupted all of us and said, “I don’t care what it is.  It isn’t bothering us and we shouldn’t bother it.”   Then she headed back to the house. We all followed her back inside.  I couldn’t convince my husband to take me anywhere else and they all disagreed with calling the police.  They put in a VHS copy of 8 Seconds, poured drinks and rolled a joint.  I went back to the front door a few times to watch and even cracked the door open.  I could still hear a few pecans falling and the tree disagree with the dance through it’s upper limbs.  I was killing their buzz and my husband demanded I come back to the living room and stop stressing.  He pointed out that whatever it was, it was outside and we were inside. I smoked with them, which was calming, and then sat by a window and started to watch the movie.  At some point I looked out the window and up and noticed the lights were again circling the house.  They were still moving in the up and down dancing way.  I realized at that point, through the haze of marijuana, that they were floating along in a relaxing way.  The rhythm was nice.  Each one was not going down where the last one went down and each one was not going up where the last one went up.  They were in a pattern but the pattern was changing as they circled the house.  I remember thinking that they could come in through the windows on the second floor and get us.  That was my last thought as I drifted off to sleep. I woke up in a panic.  My memory of the night before was very clear and I was not content to go on with my life like it hadn’t happened.  Everyone else was nonchalant about it and acting like I was a spaz.  It was some great mystery and it didn’t need any further evaluation. I went outside and every pecan had been knocked out of the tree.  There was a huge circle of them around the base. I walked through them, they were inches thick.  I looked back at the house and wondered about the lights, where they had come from, what they were, what they meant, and who was really going to protect me in the future.  I went back in and packed my things, demanded my husband do the same, and we left.  We went back home to North Myrtle Beach and made a daily drive to Florence instead of staying at the farm house. I visited there many times after that, but never stayed the night again.  I never even stayed again after dark.  My sister-in-law later told me a story about 5 people being buried on the property, but it didn’t sit well with me.  She was trying to convince me that it was okay to stay because my husband wanted to spend a long weekend there and I refused.  I think that they would have been more concerned with what was happening if they hadn’t been high before the lights arrived.  I was the only one that was completely sober when it happened.  It broke my resolve and I did smoke and drink that night and I regretted that too.  It made me angry at my husband, who is now my ex.  I don’t want to live a numb life, and they were surely living it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2018-07-05T00:00:00,33.6572,-79.7767

(This was my second Very Clear sighting of an unexplainable object in the sky.)   On 12 November 2004, I was traveling North to South -as I had multiple times- to Cuenca (Quin-kah) from Azougaz (Ah-SO-gass), Ecuador, in broad daylight (5:00 pm).  Rounding a curve, sitting on the right side of a public bus, I was astonished to see a grey/silver colored disk to the right (west side) only 100-150 feet away, above a wastewater holding tank.  The disc was about 30 feet in diameter, rounded on the edges, no windows or ports were visible.  It seemed rather dull -not shiney- & absolutely motionless, as if “parked” in mid-air.  Traveling alone, and the only gringo on the bus, I may have frightened the other passengers as I pointed and shouted, ¿¡Qué es!? - ¿¡Qué es!? .. “What is it!? -  What is it!?”  Then, jumping out of my seat, I ran to the back of the bus to get a few more seconds of viewing it as we passed by.  Feeling a bit bewildered and regretting that I could not stop to see how or where it might go from there, I had to surrender to the fact that it had gone out of view. I would have to appreciate what I had seen-if only for a few fleeting moments.  (There was no shoulder on the road or I likely would have demanded the driver to stop and let me out). Darn... on previous trips to South America, I had purposefully looked for UFOs in the hills and skies in and around Huancayo (Wan-kyy-OH), in the highlands of Peru, the area where Shirley McClain reported seeing numerous UFOs.  I've had numerous stays in Huancayo, and in small nearby villages, but have seen nothing but beautiful night skies filled with stars and a few fast-burning meteors.  This sighting -to me- was just stunning in that it caught me off-guard, had my heart racing, and kept me from sleeping most of that night.",2018-07-05T00:00:00,,

I witnessed a disc shaped craft   black in color matte/ metallic about twenty feet wide it had some type of lettering on the lower half of the object.  The craft seemed to be emitting a field which may have been the cause of me being as if not able to move. There was a feeling of communication through thought with my inner voice.  This was to and from the disc craft.  It moved after I came out of the state of being entranced.  Then I moved as I began to search for it in the surrounding sky I watched it move slowly away then when I pointed at it moved away horizontally and with immense speed far away as the eye could spot it and then up as if it went to space. The craft was I think somehow emitting a field that I could sense like small waves that were so intense.  As if I could almost see a ripple or an aura that seemed to be what was paralyzing me and then I felt like I should think what I wanted to communicate so I said through my mind to it, why do you not intervene to improve our world? I sensed a voice answering because of all the warring.	 I was riding a bicycle on the fish creek trail in Arlington, Texas and stopped along the trail happened to be looking up when I saw a black saucer shaped craft. It hovered   about twenty feet above the ground It was an area with trees and a creek there was a clear area about 40 feet wide where it was clear of trees. Upon noticing the flying craft I was completely consumed with awe and shock it took all my attention away from my two children who did not look up to see the craft because I could not even move my attention from the object.  They sat facing me under the shade of a tree that was to the right and slightly forward of the object.  The tree was thick with leaves so they did not see or look up at it.  When my son yelled to get my attention is when I realized that he had been calling me for about a minute already. “He shouted Dad what are you looking at you are scaring me.”  That is when I broke my stare of the object to turn to him as I looked up again the object moved. When I moved to where my children were I looked up to notice the tree was not allowing for them to get a view of the craft so they followed me as I moved over to where I looked around for where it had moved to.  Then I spotted it again as I was looking at it this time it seemed to be about two hundred feet away 100 feet high moving south it had a blue color hue on the back.  As I pointed to it to show my son where it was the craft sped away without making a sound.  It was so fast that before my finger was able to point at it the thing seemed to leave the atmosphere.

Long Description of Sighting Report thought I should share this with you, tonight on 10/15/16 I witnessed along with my wife, friend and and my son, I witnessed would be my 3rd UFO experience out here in Northeast Ohio at our home.  We live kinda in the country so this as stated above isn't my first time experiencing such an event.  To give you an idea, we leave close to the Akron Canton Airport, so I see plenty of aircraft take off and land here.  I was facing SW when I noticed a bright light in the sky, to bright to be a star that early and oddly placed to be an aircraft landing or taking off.  Before I started filming this UFO it was HOVERING for a good 20 minutes in the sky, no sounds nothing just hovering.  I started filming and then noticed it slowly descending behind the tree line.  I stopped filming after it sunk below the trees as the camera wouldn't pick it up but it stayed behind the tree line where I could see it through the trees for a good 15 minutes.  It wasn't a plane or helicopter no flashing lights, no sound.  I feel gifted to be able to see one let alone three out here within 4 years.  Call me crazy I don't care but I know what I seen. Definitely wasn't the space station. I first seen at 7pm higher in the sky, began filming at 719pm lost sight behind the trees 3 min later, completely lost sight at about 730 ish.  Space station wasn't visible in the NW till 830 ish.  I have video upon request.  I can say it wasn't a plane, meteor, or the space station.  Only leaves two other explanations, UFO or a drone, ive never seen a drone give off such a bright light.  This is my 3rd ufo experience out here in 4 years, each different.  I have video of the event.",2018-07-05T00:00:00,,

A blue hue appeared behind it around the orange and a whistle sound could now be heard.  The blue diminished and the orange sparks started to lessen.  Front point had turned into what appeared to be a growing glowing white round light which at first was a small circle of light but dark in the center and progressed into being all white light as the Sparks continue to diminish.  By now the whistle turned into a hum that sounded similar to a small aircraft not in distress.  When the orange sparks disappeared the hum continued and all that was left was a blueish or green light and a small gold/white/gold/white light and only for a moment a red light.   From there it proceeded out of sight, trees were blocking my view, looking and sounding like a small aircraft but moving much faster than any plane that I've ever known of and the hum diminished respectively with the sight of it.  It first appeared moving South and barely East from my location as it appeared to drop down and made almost a 90 degrees curve to head East but a little North.  About 1/8 of the way towards North from due East.I don't know latitudes and longitudes.  It did only travel in two straight very distinctive lines.  The turn was maneuvered at the point where the orange sparks were brightest and largest immeditely after the turn is when the blue hue appeared and sparks right after that started to diminish and as the sparks start to diminish is when the whistle turn into a hum.   After the Sparks diminished that's when it turned into the bluish light the flashing light which went dark and the red light which only blinked once left only a bluish-green light.  White circle appeared just barely before the blue hue was completely gone, the white circle was! gone when the lights started appearing in the other colors at! the fro nt point.  The colored lights were in the form of a small triangle with unequal sides when the red light blinked but the white and gold appeared in different relations to the bluish green light. I heard the whistle for about one-and-a-half seconds and about 75% of that time was before the curve and about 25% after.  The curve was made instantly. Same amount of time it would take a second hand on a clock to go to the next second after it started to move but before it hit the next second, that's how long it took the curve to be accomplished. If a possible altitude is necessary I can only guess and that would be it appeared from nowhere to begin to fall from the sky and after the curve would be below the average cloud level. It occurred during a clear night, no clouds and could see stars.  Please reply to this message?  I know I can't leave personal info in a message, but I would like to know what that was or at least that someone has looked into it.  And especially for any questions ! or comments that you might have.  Thank you.",2018-08-17T00:00:00,36.109455879967555,-95.93524541768045

He stated he is looking at a strange white round object in the sky. He first spotted it at 6:30am. After reaching his home, I observed this object in the southern sky at about 179 degrees south at an 65 degrees off the horizon.  It was round, with which looked like 'hands of a clock at 6:10, and white in color.  The longer we looked at it and tried getting photos, more details came out. Several photos were taken and drawing in more detail.  There was a wind blowing from the north at about 10-15 mph, so the object was traveling from the southern direction to the north. (See attached photo & drawing)   By 1:30pm the object was at 347 degrees north from my resident at 85 degrees off horizon.  By 2:20pm it was out of my sight due to trees and a butte.   Altitude was hard to determine, as we are at 4300 feet, I would suspect the object was 10,000 or higher.  Size, hard to say without a point of reference. Both Kingsley Field in Klamath Falls and the weather center in  Medford, OR, have been called and message left.

I realized at that point that the sky was heavily overcast; there were thousands of feet of clouds between me and the real Sun.  Whatever this thing was it was lower than the clouds. I can't say how big it was; large enough for me to mistake it for the Sun for a moment.  It didn't move aerodynamically; it bounced around on the south side of the road before crossing over and quickly descending behind the trees on the north side.  It was in view for 1-2 minutes. It didn't change size, shape, or color.  It was featureless; just a perfect circle of bright orange.  I checked the local papers and the Internet, but haven't seen any reports from anyone who might have seen it. I have no idea what it was.  It didn't have the ephemeral feeling of reflected light; it seemed very solid.  It did nothing that frightened me; it just wasn't supposed to be there.",2018-08-17T00:00:00,44.9198,-93.4832

The other was at the same elevation as Jupiter but slightly further to the north.  Both were of nearly the same color and brightness.

This was a strange event and I wanted others to confirm what I was seeing.  I was inside between 10 to 15 seconds.  When I returned outside, the object was still ascending.  The light from the object seemed to slightly pulse in intensity, getting brighter then dimmer every second or two.  My wife joined me outside but my children did not come out quickly enough to see it. As my wife and I watched, the object moved overhead in the sky as if it was now traveling toward the east.  The rate of ascent seemed constant but very fast for an object that was clearly so far away.  We heard no sound associated with the object. As it began to move overhead, it started to flicker more significantly than before.  It pulsed brighter than much dimmer than before three or four times, then simply faded from our view.

The trailing light when above us, moved up next to the other light and maintained side by side formation.  That light then suddenly disappeared.

I was outside, and happened to look up, and saw a strange object in the sky almost directly above my house.  I stared at it for about 5 minutes, and nothing on it moved, it looked very artificial.  Having never seen anything like this before, and given how slowly up it was moving. There was a small Cessna style aircraft flying by, at what appeared to be the same altitude (very hard to tell) if I had to guess the aircraft was probably 500-1000 AGL.   I went inside and grabbed a camera with a 200mm lens.  Went back out after about 3 minutes inside getting the camera and lens.  Snapped a couple photos, but it was either so small or so high in the sky 200mm wasn't enough.  I then went back in got a 2x converter, so we're at 400mm on a crop sensor, so 600mm effective focal length at 24MP.  I took about 10 photos at ISO 4000 with a wide open f5.6 aperture.

Last night I was skywatching with binoculars in the hopes of seeing anomalous craft.  This is an activity that I do along withy my brother with some frequency in the summer.  In the last few weeks we've seen some strange fireballs and flashes that couldn't be accounted for by known aircraft or satellites. My process with the binoculars is to watch one area of the sky for a few minutes, then move to another area and wait.  I often can see satellites not visible to the naked eye this way, and I can track them across the sky easily with the binoculars.  I am an experienced skywatcher and can distinguish most aircraft, satellites, and meteors. I was looking towards the west and a series of objects entered the frame of the binoculars from the north.  It consisted of six white spheres arranged in a straight line, but the line itself was oriented maybe 15 degrees to the right of the direction of travel.  A good analogy is if you took a v-shaped flock of flying geese and removed half the geese. I immediately started tracking the objects across the sky until they reached the horizon to the south.  The binoculars I was using were 7x zoom, and the full width of the formation filled roughly one third of the view area of the binoculars.  The formation was very fast, from the moment I began tracking it to the moment it was beyond the horizon was less than three seconds.  The spheres themselves were several times larger than a commercial airliner appears in the binoculars at cruising altitude (30,000 feet).  The objects themselves appeared to be quite high, but judging by their size it seems unlikely they were in space. The objects themselves are difficult to describe because of their speed.  They obviously were lit, but only dimly.  It almost appeared if they were a projection, perhaps semi-transparent.  They somewhat reminded me of seeing spotlights projected onto clouds when I was a child, but the sky was clear and there was nothing to project onto.",2018-09-13T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

Directly over me while I was riding underneath it I saw four dull white lights straight down.  In a square pattern with a dull orange look. A black line was horizontal in the middle of the square.  While looking up at it.  The four lights not bright at all, but a dull orange look to the four of them. Around the square was a mantra ray shape all black around the square. Inside the manta ray shape but, the box with the black line in this shape was brown, but the manta ray shape was black. I plan to paint this on something.  Soon..  Inside the time I left Peobody, Mass., concert.  Sometime between 8:15 pm and 8:45  I saw this object. My 360 tracker  app should show me the time I went under this object hopefully. I remember saying WTF is that?  Looking up at it . Then I sped up.  I should have pulled over but it really was not that high up.  So I figured if I could see it; it could see me.  As, I spend up, I tried to look in my bike mirrors and saw nothing. WHY write this down because I can hardly believe what I saw but know I saw something. BELOW A QUICK SKETCH OF FRONT VIEW AND A BOTTOM VIEW  I'D SAY IT WAS LOW ENOUGH TO SEE THE LIGHTS AND BLACK AN BROWN COLOR . BIGGER THEN A HELICOPTER OR PIPER CUB PLANE. HALF THE SIZE OF THE BIGGEST JET. LOOKED LIKE IT WAS JUST SUSPENDED IN THE SKY",2018-09-13T00:00:00,42.6363,-70.9404

I am a PhD former chemistry professor, age 56, avid amateur astronomer since age 13 who knows the night sky and where and when planets are visible and can recognize constellations even from a few stars.  Other witnesses include both of my children (experienced sky observers—son has seen other UFOs of different shapes recently; I have not) and several teenage and adult friends of my daughter present at the youth rodeo event we were all attending Monday evening. I had brought my 7x50 mm binoculars to better see events and to check to see if I could tell what phase Venus was in, and if I could see any of Jupiter’s moons. Sunset was at 8:53 pm, and I started to look for Venus to the west right afterward.  A couple of minutes before 9 pm, I saw what I thought was Venus much higher (about 40° altitude) and further south than expected.  It also seemed much too bright, maybe magnitude -5.5 or even -6. I looked at this strange ‘Venus’ through the binoculars and found not the partly illuminated planet, barely resolved at the low magnification I was using, but instead an elliptical bright white object in its place. (I would later compare the object’s horizontal dimension with the spread of Jupiter’s moons, and found the object to be slightly broader). The object’s long dimension was horizontal, and the right side had a brilliant white glint that always remained the brightest as high-altitude sunset progressed and the object began to turn yellow, then orange. I found the real Venus about 20° to the lower right of this object’s position a little after 9 pm, and Jupiter about 40° to the object’s left, about the same altitude as the object above the horizon about 9:10 pm. I discerned no net movement of the object as Venus got lower after sunset, but it did start to take on a distinctly yellowish hue about 9:10 pm, then much more orange at about 9:14-15. It had also faded to about the same magnitude as Venus by then (-4.3 or so).  It rapidly faded from naked eye sight at 9:17 pm, presumably from the sun setting at its rather substantial altitude. The sighting was not over, though, as I was able to find the object, probably +4 magnitude in the still dusk-illuminated western sky with my binoculars.  It was now brownish-gray, only slightly brighter than the sky behind it, but now the right brightest spot had a faint pure white light that reminded me of a white LED.  At random intervals I noticed very faint white sparkles as if other white LED lights were flashing on and off all over the now rather non-descript ellipse.  The slightly mottled appearance it had when most brightly illuminated by the sun, with the very close odd dark halo on the left, was no longer apparent. I was able to find it fairly easily over and over despite not being able to see it with my naked eye because it stayed in the same exact spot where I had seen it, neither moving with the wind, nor moving with the night sky.  The last time I saw it was close to 10 pm, and it seemed much smaller and fainter at that point, but still hovering in the same spot with the faint white light on the right side still going on and off, but now almost too faint to see.   Object overall magnitude was about +6 or fainter at that point, and only its larger size compared to the pinpoint stars could distinguish it from them.  I tried to find it again after 10 pm, but was unsuccessful.  I tried to find it again at the same time period of 21:00 to 21:30 on Tuesday August 7th, but I saw nothing out of the ordinary, under almost identical observing conditions. Sky conditions were cloudless with some smoke from distant fires visible near the horizon. I was downtown in southeastern Buhl at the rodeo grounds, and there were a lot of bright lights both in the arena and the spectator areas, so my nighttime vision wasn’t fully dark-adapted.  So light pollution was a problem, but not terribly so as the arena was to the east and the object was to the west south west.  My son confirmed the shape and overall appearance of the UFO. I considered the possibility that it was a weather balloon, but long dimension is usually vertical with the real ones I’ve seen in the past, and the slight prevailing westerly wind should have moved it from its starting point to much closer or even overhead.  I concede the balloon explanation may fit, but too many strange aspects just didn’t fit a mere weather balloon, hence my willingness to make this report. The fact that the object remained illuminated by the sun for 24 additional minutes after local sunset should prove useful in determining its altitude, despite it being about 40° above the western horizon rather than overhead—I was very careful to note the exact time it started to rapidly fade from naked eye visibility.  I personally don’t know to calculate the UFO’s altitude from these observations, but I suspect it was over ten miles up at minimum.

I was sitting on my deck looking at the sky.  The weather is clear. 2045 I saw a bright light (like a search-light at a distance)  It was in the western sky approximately 2 o clock, traveling north to south.  After about 15 seconds it simply faded and vanished.  Again, no clouds.  No noise and no aircraft strobe.  It was a point of bright light about 3 times the size of Venus and many times brighter.  Venus had already set behind the trees so it wasn't Venus, and Mars was in the 10 o-clock position.  I initially thought it might be the ISS but the shape was not correct.  I've seen the ISS many times and it is bright and fades from view, but it is angular in appearance, almost like a Greek cross. Five minutes later I saw a roughly chevron shaped craft with bright lights emanating from the front leading edges.  This appeared to my north at about the 11 o clock position moving west to east. It also slowly faded and vanished.  No clouds, no noise, no strobe.  I immediately went inside and checked the plane tracker website on the chance it was a plane and I merely misidentified it somehow.  No aircraft were shown in the vicinity. I'm retired and I spend a great deal of time plane watching day and night. I am also ex-military (police) and I've worked for the dept. of defense.  I know a military aircraft when I see one.  And these were not. I often have fighter planes from the neighboring AFB train in the airspace above where I live. (During the day)  The sound is deafening. I know it sounds corny but the way these objects/craft moved, fading and vanishing reminded me of the old Star Trek and ships cloaking themselves.  I know how that sounds but I'm trying to be accurate and convey exactly what I saw.  I have only seen/interacted with an unidentified flying object once before and that was in 1989 in Alabama.  So its not like I see these things ""regularly"".  I know what I saw. (No it wasn't satellites either.

At first they had a bluish hue to them.   I thought that they were spot lights of some kind but began to realize the lights were actually coming from behind the clouds.  They were flying at a great speed.  The flight path was pretty repetitive but at times they would fly in a irregular pattern.  They would also fly at different altitudes throughout their orbit.  After about 10 mins 3 of the lights trailed off and only two were left. At this point the lights lost their blue color and became more silver/white.  I called my neighbor and his fiance to come and look at them also in order to make sure that someone else witnessed this event other than myself.  It is possible that it was spot lights but the  light appeared to be coming from behind the clouds and it definitely was not a regular aircraft.   Also the flight path was not how an automated spot light wo! uld move.  The airspace in which the lights were located was a barren field where there is nothing but farm land.  I believe they were probably flying in close proximity of the Iowa-Nebraska border.     Another thing to note is that the area that this occurred was very close to a major US Air Base.

I live at the tip end of a long valley and only a small portion of the sky facing south can be seen from where I was sitting next to my fire pit south facing. It was a strange feeling I had come over me, all the birds and bees had stopped making noises except for a pair of hooting owls who had been the chorus for the evening, as if that alone was not odd enough.  I suddenly got the startling realization that I was not alone, something was over me observing me almost critically I felt.  There was no one who I could account for since we live out in the middle of nowhere practically and it was only my husband and I home that night and he had gone to bed an hour prior to this experience I began having. At first, I got very scared and tried to refocus my eyes from the fire to the pitch black that surrounded me, but there was not a peep of anything I could see or hear virtually nothing, and that creeped me out even more.  Out of panic and to calibrate my location I looked up to see where the stars were in the night sky, and it seemed they had all but one gone into the darkness as well.  It was very odd that on a clear night sky no clouds I could observe no glittered sky just one single throbbing orange light beaming up in the night sky.  It was very obviously not a planet and was slowly moving closer to my location but seemed at least a mile or so away.  I was locked into its hypnotic throbbing pulsing, slow like the rhythm of a heart and it seemed to be directing all its attention into me!  This may be a delusion, given my frenzied state, however it lingered in the gaze for such a long time I thought if I kept looking at it, it might zap my brain or take my soul from my body or worse, I was not sure really.  It seemed like it was trying to do moriss code as it crept closer but I have no clue what Morris code signal it would be trying to send to lil old me alone in the dark in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night!  Maybe it just enjoyed my fire pit and wanted to say hi.  Either way after about 30 mins of locked focused gaze my fire pit was barley glowing and I had come to determine it was time to go to sleep. One I got to bed I woke about every hour just to take a peek to see if this thing was still out there and it was!  Last peek was the break of dawn, I wish I had thought to take a picture.

I live in a remote part of Alaska along the coast of Prince William Sound (eastern side, Port Fidalgo).  I was opening up my cabin during the spring, when a cold front come through and I went outside at 1:30am to check on other buildings and crack water lines so that they would not freeze during the night.  As I was walking back to another building we have a dock that is on the oceanside.  It was a calm, still, clear black night with many stars out, so I went down to the dock to see if the northern lights were out.  I looked to the East and there was a slight shimmer of northern lights (green).  Then I looked to the West and immediately saw a star I didn't recognize above Bligh Island to the Northwest.  The white light seems to be in proximity to a small native village called Tatitlek about 5 miles away.  The white light was brighter then any star and shimmered across the water like the moon does at times.  It compared it to the top light of a massive commerc! ial boat light when night fishing.  But this light was above Bligh Island and I could see the outline of the island so I could tell that it was not someone standing on the island and estimate it was around 300' above the ridge.  I've looked that direction many times at night and had never seen this bright light before and realized that it was actually in Port Fidalgo above Bligh Island.  As I started to zone in at closer, I noticed that there was a ribbon of rainbow like lights undulating around it horizontally.  I immediately gasped and blurting out ""oh shit"" aload and at that very moment, the light BLINKED OFF.  This was my first unknown sighting and I actually thought if I ever saw something like this I would be excited to have witnessed a UFO.  But the feeling I had was utter dread the moment after it happened.  The reason for this I think is because I feel like it heard me somehow and hid the moment it realized that someone saw it.  Which tells me that it did n! ot want to be seen.  I looked for it from the safety of my cabin deck for another hour and did not see it again. I did see a small plane approach Blight Island from the West and changed direction over Blight Island and started heading southeast at about 8000'.  Possible coincedence?  I estimate the object/light was hovering at 300' above the top of Blight Island.  It was completely stationary.  And when it blinked off the light that reflected across the ocean as bright as a full moon also disappeared. I wrote down notes that night and sketched the sighting. And finally have a chance to report it now. Conditions - Clear night, 35 degree's.  No wind.  No sound.

Sunday 17June2018 at approximately 5:20 pm CT, I noticed a small black object moving quickly in the South Southeast sky.  The day was mostly clear with only a few cumulonimbus clouds.  I watched the black object for approximately 4 minutes.  The object was high in the sky and I had difficulty determining its shape but it appeared to be a three dimensional object that was wider on the bottom and came to a rounded peak at the top.  The object moved quickly but stayed in roughly the same 20 degree area of the sky.  The object moved right to left, up and down, and diagonally.  I did not observe any exhaust, contrail, or other emission from the object.  I did not hear any sound emanating from the object.  Sometimes it would appear to disappear for a short time (~10 seconds) and then reappear seemingly where it had been previously. I thought at first it was a bird but at times the object would maneuver and I would see a bright flash of light as if it was made of a reflective surface. It appeared to be at the same height of the cumulonimbus clouds.  The sighting occurred approximately 15 miles east of the Dane County Regional Airport (Madison, WI).  I observed a commuter plane fly in the direction of the object and the unknown object appeared to disappear.  At 5:24 pm CT I went inside to get my husband and son to see it. At approximately 5:25 pm CT we saw the object again.  My son was able to see it but my husband could not.  My ten-year-old son reports that the object was black and shaped like a triangle with smooth sides.

One evening, sometime around July 1978 (as best I can remember), I was outside on the porch taking a quick look at the stars before heading inside.  It was quite dark, so it must have been 11:00 pm or later.  I noticed 3 groups of dim red lights, in formation, moving slowly from west to east, following the direction of the Mohawk River.  Each group consisted of 5 dim, red lights, each, with a leading light and two on each side such that they formed a triangular pattern.  If one imagines the letter “V”, there would be a light at the point of the “V” with two lights on each leg of the “V”.  The point of the “V” was pointing in the flight direction and the pattern of lights gave the impression that there were swept back wings.  There was an object in the lead and two following, one just a short distance behind each “wing tip” (for lack of a better description)! .  The objects were totally silent.   After watching for a few seconds, I ran into the house because they scared me for some reason.  I never saw them again after that.  I estimated their altitude to be very low, maybe a few thousand feet, based on the terrain and my history of observing aircraft.   In later years, I saw a photo, or video, of a B2 stealth bomber that had lights on its leading edge that looked similar to what I had seen (I looked just now, and cannot find that image on line).  But B2’s were not officially produced until over a decade later, and they are not silent.   However, our house was only about 20-25 miles from Griffiss Air Force Base, so who knows.

Diameter of the craft looked to be about the length of a football field and the thickness of this craft looked to be no more than the height of a 2 story home.  After observing the craft for about 3 minutes, I ran inside to get a pair of binoculars.  I had gone inside for no more than 25 seconds (it felt like an eternity, kind of like if time had stopped or slowed down).  When I came back outside, the craft was nowhere to be seen... like it had just vanished. The strangest thing about all this was after running to get the binoculars and coming back outside, I found my brother was just sitting in a chair staring at the patio door.  I yell at him ""Where did it go!!  Where ((deleted)) did it go!""  But my brother was clueless, he couldn't remember a thing.  To this day he remembers nothing. I observed this Craft at a close enough distance to know without a doubt that what I saw was real and out of this world.

The three of us quickly ran in the direction the object was heading, which happened to be the campsite driveway onto the loop road, where we could get a better view through a clearing in the trees. The object appeared to be about the size of a basketball (if you were extend your arms and hold one out in front of you), however, would have to be much larger since I would estimate its altitude to have been about 300-350 feet above ground and its horizontal distance from us to be about 150-200 feet. It was a perfectly spherical red-orange ball of light that would have to have been extremely bright to be visible against the early twilight sky.  It moved silently and steadily at a moderately slow pace across the sky.  My sister and friend noticed the object had dropped in altitude and at a sharp right angle to its right slightly before continuing on and disappearing beyond the tree line to the west. We were all baffled and discussing what the object could have been when another one appeared from the east, following the same trajectory (although at an even lower altitude and closer distance than the first).  The second object was identical to the first and moved at the same pace, silently across the sky until disappearing over the westerly tree line. I am a consumer drone enthusiast and pilot which is how I was able to estimate the altitude and distance.  Also, a popular consumer drone at that altitude and distance would be audibly noticeable.  I can easily hear the buzzing of the motors and propellers of my small drone at a 300 foot altitude in a noisy urban environment.

The sun had already set and the sky was turning dark above as the horizon still had some orange and peach tones fading away.  I was walking on the bike path behind the Rocklin softball fields towards the westside of the park and returning home from my routine evening walks, when I saw a commercial airline far off into the distance and flying weat toward SMF Intl airport.   I looked directly in front of me and saw three black V-shaped aircraft fly over the Arroyo Grande Condos across the street.  It was apparent that they looked small like oversized black birds in the distance but as I was close enough to see the third object fly behind the second that had flown in a half circle into the distance, it had an open V shape to it and it made no noice nor did it have any obvious lights.  It was a completely dark V shaped flying object.  This is what alarmed me because it was so quiet and made no sound and flew so close to the condos above.  In fact, I questioned myself a! s to whether the craft were oversized birds or even mini drones but these flew steady, relatively fast and far into the sky.  There was no one visible outside by the park on Sunday evening except over by the swings.  The third similar object had no wings nor even a cockpit of any kind.  It was flying about 5-6000 ft above the ground and at about 1000 ft distance between each other when I first noticed them, until the first aircraft flew off extremely fast and ahead of the others. I could still see it if I looked for it far into the clouds. The third tailed the second as if it was the wingman following it in succession. I did not understand how these crafts could fly so low to the ground and yet fly so high in a matter of seconds without an emmission of fuel left behind them like with a plane.  They were solid, dark black aircraft, but because the sun had gone down, you could not tell if they were metallic but only that the third one had a V shape opening to it.  They followed e! ach other like a team of aircraft flying together in unison.   Just as I approached the Condo's across the street from the pathway and within about 5 quick mintues, they had all three disappeared.  I could not see them anymore anywhere.  I did not have my cell phone with me nor was I able to take any pictures of my sighting but I wanted to share the event because it happened immediately over my Condo unit where I reside and flew directly Northwest into the distance over Highway 65.  What struck me the most about this brief sighting was that I had a feeling that I needed to walk back home on the pathway instead of all the way around the north side of the park.  I had a feeling that if I didnt turn around, I would be missing out on something, and there it was. I was fixated on the first object and then within seconds, a second appeared out of nowhere, then came the third.  It was too obvious to me that these V like aircraft were not supposed to be in the sky and so close to home but I am glad I paid attention to my intuition and got a glimpse at some! thing so tangible and real that it spoke volumes that we are not alone at any given time.",2018-08-17T00:00:00,38.81477261146497,-121.27164267515924

It was roughly 9:45pm EST; I was standing on my deck hoping to see some of the Perseids when three solid lights appeared slightly south west of my position roughly 90 degrees above the horizon heading in an easterly direction.  The lights were brighter than most stars and solid, and they were moving about as fast as a typical plane or drone seems to move across the sky (much slower than the Perseids).  I quickly realized that the three lights were maintaining a chevron pattern with the chevron pointing north making it seem as if the chevron was moving sideways west to east.   After I realized the nature of what I was seeing I realized the chevron was also accompanied by a low rumbling sound, similar to a plane but an octave or two lower and a bit quieter.  A few seconds after that a bright light caught my attention in the east sky.  I turned to see a bright stationary light had appeared due east of me approximately 90 degrees above the east horizon.  The stationary! light was initially more luminous than even Mars has been recently.  The stationary light began to move in a south westerly direction directly toward the chevron lights.  As the lone light accelerated to the average speed of a plane or drone its luminosity reduced until it was no more luminous than a moderately bright star.  As the lone light approached the chevron both objects became more faint, eventually disappearing in the middle of the southeastern sky. The entire experience lasted a bit longer than a minute.  During that minute the chevron lights never broke formation.  The sky was exceptionally clear and dark due to the new moon.  None of the lights flashed or blinked in the least, only ever reducing in overall luminosity.  A final note on the size of the chevron...the chevron lights were no bigger than large stars, but the chevron itself, if I held up my fingers, I could fit 2 but not quite 3 fingers between the lights. That distance never changed. The three chevron lights always moved in complete unison.",2018-08-17T00:00:00,44.55190000000001,-69.4438

I called my husband to come look and he saw it as well.  The bright light hovered for about 30 mins in the same spot and faster then I could blink it disappeared.

One bright &quot;ball&quot; like object falls, comes to stop, and redirects itself heading Northeast, till out of view. This evening, at approximately 19:50, I witnessed what initially looked to me as a ""shooting star"", quickly transform itself into a fully capable and manuevering aircraft.  From where I was standing, I had a full view of the northern sky with the moon also in view (waxing crescent tonight).  While conversing with an associate over the phone, this ball of a light quickly took my attention.  Assuming it was going to burn out somewhere within the stratosphere or troposphere (as I've observed in my lifetime amongst ""shooting stars"" or meteors) I continued my conversation.  Then, what I witnessed next blew my mind.  The ball of light came to a grinding halt and I was able to actually hear this flying object.  It sounded like a  loud, ""screeching"",  static electric-like sound.  So powerful, I was able to feel the vibrations under me.  Hard to explain.   After coming to an almost complete stop, I watched it turn and head Northeast.   I hung up the phone, and called my wife outside so she could see this object.  I followed this object with my eyes from the second it's light was identifiable to my periphals. When she came outside, we both marveled over this ball of a light, and watched it as it continued to travel northeast.  This object maintained its physical appearance as an orange ""ball"" of a light the whole way through.  It was very distinctive in a way, that it was very bright and orange. Easily able to differentiate itself from any sort of commercial aircraft.  Serving in the Marine Corps for four years, I can say it was of no military aircraft I have seen before either.  This object stopped almost midair.  We watched until the light faded into nothing, as it continued its travels northeast I would say HUNDREDS of miles.  All within two minutes. Anyone in the San Gabriel Valley, Los Angeles Valley, ..........anyone,anywhere, who happened to look up and witness what they ""think"" to have been something strange flying through the sky, I can assure you, was nothing ordinary or of our ""technology"".   I have (2) side notes to add:  Less than 3 minutes after the object dissapeared, a loud helicopter was overhead, and in my area.  The only thing I could see were the lights from the undercarriage and skids.  It made a circle and dissapeared.  This may have been pure coincidence.  The second thing I wanted add was regarding the noise I heard.  The loud vibrational type noise.  I've heard this before and actually regularly for the past two years.  The weird thing is when I have heard it, the noise's ""vibrational frequency"" has been much louder and sometimes in intervals.  It leads me to believe the area I live in or possibly the mountain ranges  (San Gabriel Mountains or San Bernadino Mountains) nearby are being utilized as a some sort of entry point?  I will continue to record my ""encounters"" as I feel there is a correlation between these anomalies.",2018-09-13T00:00:00,34.0519,-118.04669999999999

Bright object behaving strangely.,San Diego,CA,2018-08-09T20:25:00,diamond,20 minutes,"Occurred : 8/9/2018 20:25  (Entered as : 08/09/18 20:25) Reported: 8/10/2018 10:59:02 AM 10:59 Posted: 8/10/2018 Location: San Diego (17 miles north of), CA Shape: Diamond Duration:20 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/142/S142644.html,"Bright Object Behaving Strangely. I was speaking with a family member on the phone and walked over to my glass patio door to look outside.  A bright object in the sky at about the 11:00 position and to the west caught my attention.  That would put it over the Pacific Ocean.  It was very bright, but was not shimmering like a star.  I’ve seen Venus hundreds of times and this was probably 2 times the size of Venus.  It was roughly diamond shaped (with no defined edges) and had an orange-ish tinge.  It was also much too low to be a star as I could make out the thin, broken layer of high clouds behind it.  So, my first thought was that it was a helicopter, especially given that there is occasionally police helicopter activity in the area and the altitude seemed about right.   I continued to watch it, expecting that the object would turn/move soon and I would see its aviation lights, but it just remained in the same position for about 15 minutes.  Then I thought I saw it wavering sideways just a bit, so I lined up the edge of a palm tree with the object, and sure enough, it had a very subtle back-and-forth horizontal motion to it.  I never saw any aviation lights.  I still assumed it was probably a helicopter, and I was still having a conversation on the phone, so I didn’t open the door to see if I could hear a faint rotor sound in the distance.  Actually with all of the other city noise (i.e., nearby freeway, local traffic) and with the distance, listening for a sound from the object would have given an inconclusive result.   I continued to watch it and was about to lose interest, when things got even stranger.  The object faded out in place for a brief moment and then grew bright again, matching its original size and intensity.  It was like a light bulb on a dimmer switch and you quickly turn down the voltage to the point where the bulb goes out and then you increase the power until the bulb is at full brightness again.   At first I thought perhaps the effect was caused by clouds p! assing in front of the object, but again the clouds were much higher a nd quite thin.  After a few more minutes, the object started becoming smaller and smaller, until it was a tiny spec in the distance.  This had a very different visual look than the dimming.  This time it appeared more like the object flew away at a level trajectory (further out over the ocean) and then stopped.  This changed took only a matter of seconds.   I watched it in the distance for a minute or so and thought there was nothing more to see, so I looked away for another minute or two.  When I looked up at the sky again, the object was back, in the exact location described at the beginning of this report and with the same shape and brightness.   After a few more minutes, it did the same maneuver again – appearing to move away very rapidly at a horizontal/level trajectory with the object becoming a tiny spec in the distance at the same location as before, except this time it completely disappeared. About halfway into this event, I noticed what were obvious airplanes (aviation lights visible) slowly circling far away from the object while it was in its original/stationary position.  It seems that these airplanes had their approach to the San Diego airport interrupted.  I say that because once the object disappeared as described above, an unusually high volume of airplanes started flying through the original area where the object was.  These airplanes were clearly headed to the airport.  //End of Report//",2018-08-10T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

I was on my way home, and I saw four lights that could’ve been no more than 50-60 yards above my local fire station.  I could only tell that the craft wasn’t moving until I found myself on what looked like the left hand side of the air craft.  With that being said, it was completely silent other than a very very low “hum” sound.  One of the strangest things as well was that it almost seemed like there were fumes or “distorted space” coming out of the bottom.  I don’t really know how to properly explain that part.   The craft looked like a peanut that was cut in half with the top half being completely round and the bottom half completely flat and just hovering in place.  I realized that what I was seeing was very strange and unlike anything I’ve ever seen.   After coming to this conclusion I sped over to the parking lot! that it was hovering above but very slowing moving towards a corn field that is only about ten yards from where it was above the fire station and literally in the time that it took me (about 15 seconds) to pull into this parking lot to take a video or picture it had just as silently but quickly flown about a mile and a half over the corn field and just above a tree line until it was gone.

For a couple years, I saw a light hovering about the Mts behind Milford, CA.  I would stand out on the deck with many friends as the years went by watch it, talking about it. Sometimes this ufo would move around or just hover for hours.  Starting at sunset.  It had a bright light that would dim or get brighter as it pleased.  Sometimes we would have bomb fires and the light always seemed to get closer and brighter as if it was watching us.  I called it, ""The eye in the sky"".   In Oct 2013, at sunset, I was out on my deck., I finaly got the courage to buy a telescope.  It had arrived in the mail that day.  I was home alone.  My dog was home with me.  I set the telescope up on my deck.  My dog was on the deck with me.  I pointed it right at the ufo.  It took a couple mins for me to figure out how to get it to focus.  At last I got it to focus.  I had a bad feeling coming over me.  Stress.  Pure stress. I saw a grey disk with lights on the side of the disk.  Bright white lights.  They got super bright.  I looked up from the telescope and noticed the disk was bright and quicky moving towards my house.  Fast.  I got a impending dome feeling in my gut.  I looked at my dog, she to saw it moving towards us. She hit the deck and pissed herself.  I knew we had to leave. I quickly grabbed my computer from in the house and truck keys.  Picked my dog up off the deck and threw her in the truck.  Speeding down my dirt road.  I could see the craft getting close.  I was heading for the highway 395.  I lookeded in my mirrors and saw that the craft was almost to my house.  I finally got to the highway.  My heart pumping.  I looked up at my house.  Which is in the back of Milford, CA.  The craft had stopped and was hovering over my house.  A beam of light was shining onto my house.  The eye in the sky was beaming my house, for about 10 mins.  Time seemed different.  Then the craft stopped beaming my house and slowly went back to behind the Mts.  Just hovering.  I thought I had poked the bear by looking at it.  By spying on it.  I was traumatized.  I didn't go back to my house for 3 weeks.   When I went back the light was still there at sunset.  I never looked at it again with my telescope.  I saw online others had reported this ufo in my area.  Keep in mind I live right outside herlong amry depot.  The closes army base to area 51, as the crow flys.  That's not the only ufo I saw living out there over a five year span.  I saw many and different types. Its a odd area.  I was very scared.",2018-06-15T00:00:00,,

At approximately 10:30 PM Eastern Standard Time (3:30 AM UTC) two fast-moving objects were spotted in the sky directly above Portland, Maine.  The two objects initially followed identical linear trajectories through the night sky, separated by about 5 degrees of arc, coming into sight directly overhead.   The two lights were point-source, with brightness similar to a dim star.  At an incredibly high altitude, the fast-movers paralleled each other with great velocity – much faster than any satellite could travel while still maintaining orbit, and much faster than any known commercial or military aircraft.   Around 4 to 5 seconds after visual contact was established, the two objects immediately jutted to the left and to the right to cross paths with each other moments later.  The movement was seemingly impossible and violated laws of conservation of momentum, as an extremely large external force must’ve been present in order to move them in such a way.  After crossing! paths, the two objects returned to their original distance of separation and, with the same seemingly-impossible course correction, returned to their linear trajectories.  Two other witnesses and myself maintained visual contact until light pollution from the nearby city of Portland caused us to lose contact.

As it reached a position nearly due south of us, it turned north (as jets typically do to make their final approach to the airport).  When it cleared the trees, it was obvious this was no jet.  It was a steadily glowing orange object, no sound, no blinking lights and no sign of navigational lights.  This is when I called my friend's attention to it. We watched it reach an angle of about 60 degrees in altitude from where we were standing, it stopped and hovered, emitting a bright and steady orange glow.  There was no ""beam"" as typically seen from a helicopter search light, just the steady, unchanging glow. After hovering for about 10 seconds, it began to slowly move back southeastward and the glow gradually dimmed until it was just a faint speck.  After it disappeared, we sat back down and tried to find a logical explanation for what we just saw. It was about 2 minutes later, it reappeared again coming north almost straight toward us.  Once it cleared the trees, it  stopped and hovered near the same location for about 10 seconds before nearly retracing its path in a south-southwest direction and dimming till we lost sight of it. This occurrence being between 10 and 11PM, the neighborhood was very quiet so it was easy to discern that there was no sound created by the object.

Returning to Pendleton on Hwy 395, I was buzzed by, for want of a better description, an egg shaped object.  It was Saturday afternoon and I was eight miles south of Pilot Rock, heading northbound, when what first appeared to be a car, standing on end, sailed about thirty feet above my vehicle and cruised on ahead of me. I was doing about 65 when this thing passed overhead; and concerned about being distracted, I decided to slow down.  After getting a better look at it, the object was definitely shaped like an egg.  It was tapered from the top towards a broad base. All white in color, the thing was the size of something like a U-Haul trailer—maybe six feet tall and fifteen feet or more in diameter at the base. For a moment, I considered the possibility that maybe this thing was some sort of drone. But I got to wondering, aren’t drones supposed to have some sort of propulsion?  I couldn’t make out anything that resembled propellers, or an air intake, an exhaust port, something like that. There didn’t appear to be anything that was hanging from the object—landing gear, wheels, struts, nothing that resembled that kind of provision.  There didn’t appear to be any obvious joints or seams, something that might indicate how the object was put together. Interestingly enough, there were little moments when I was certain that the material that covered this thing, although smooth, appeared to change shape.  It looked like it might be elastic, or made of some kind of liquid. I don’t know if that makes any sense, but, then, the entire sighting was odd. For an insurance salesman, selling Life, Home, and Auto—and returning from our office in John Day—this was the strangest thing that I’ve ever seen on the road—or anywhere else, for that matter.

Having just paid, we lined up for the Bainbridge Island ferry in downtown Seattle, on the north side of Colman Dock.  At the time it was 81 degrees F, the skies were clear and blue and visibility was good. After walking to the end of the dock to take photos I returned to the car.  At about 7pm, while watching a jet flying overhead, I noticed (also to the south) a white round or oval object a bit to the west of and much higher up than the jet.  It did not seem to be either taking off or landing so I watched it.  After a few minutes it remained in place so I pointed it out to my husband. He thought its shape was odd (not plane-like).  At first he thought it was moving but after observing it for a minute or so said it was remaining in place. At about 7:05pm we both saw something extend out of it temporarily (for between 15 to 20 seconds).  The extension appeared smaller than and the same color white as the main object and it too was also round or circular.  At 7:05pm I took one photo of the object with my cell phone. After maybe 30 seconds the same object emerged from the main object again.  Again it retracted into the main object.  Thereafter, during the entire time we watched, this happened at the same intervals regularly.  The second object may not have been extending and retracting but only appearing to as perhaps the entire object may have been rotating with something extended from it.  It was too far to tell. After watching for a bit the second object appeared to me to be an arm with something circular at the end of the arm.  My husband saw a round object emerging and returning to the main round object (no arm).  He thought the extension was maybe another (a second) circular object like the main one. At no time did we see anything actually leave the main object.  We agreed as we watched that it was not a plane, conventional drone, kite, blimp, or helicopter (it had no tail, wings, or rotor).  We did not hear any noise from it.  At 7:08 I took a second photo of it with my cell phone. We tried but could not identify it and got back into the car to wait (where it was cooler because of the A/C).  We each looked at the object every so often.  At around 7:10pm my husband said it was slowly fading.  I looked and thought it was maybe drifting south but my husband thought it was slowly ascending.  After a couple of minutes we could no longer find it. Though the line for the Bainbridge Island ferry was about one third full by 7:05pm during the sighting I did not notice anyone else watching it.  There were cars lined up on the south side of the ferry terminal heading to Bremerton but I could not see them so I do not know if anyone there saw it. Based on its relative position: to us where we were on Colman Dock and to the various jets we saw take off, it appeared to have been over Boeing Field or SeaTac Airport, but was at a much higher elevation than the jets taking off.  As it was far above us, there was no way to estimate its size. Neither of us ever did identify it. Of the two photos I took, neither is a good photo but after zooming in fully, the object is visible in each photo.  In the 7:05pm photo it is a white diamond shape with rounded diamond points.   In the 7:08pm photo it is smaller than it is in the first photo, and not a diamond but a blurry conical shape.  No extension is visible in either photo.",2018-07-19T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

On 8/14/2018, at approx. 8:25 pm, I was walking my dog around a park in a populated suburban town on Long Island. It was a clear night.  There was a crescent moon.  Both Mars and Venus were visible, and I was very aware of their placement in the night sky.  In fact, this is why I was looking up.   I observed a red light, which I first thought to be a plane, but noticed it was moving in a zig zag pattern, and it got my attention.  There was a plane either following it or flying with it.   It was north of me, flying east to west.  The light stopped and hovered.  One light became 3, and then 5 or 6.  This was instantaneous.  They formed a circle.  Each was bright red with a yellow bottom which appeared like a light.  They stayed in the circle, and the plane seemed to fly through the middle of them.  The event lasted around 2 minutes, but it could have been less.  Two of the lights disintegrated and disappeared, then another, then the remaining 2.  There was nothing left!  Right before and during this, I kept losing my phone call to my friend. I was repeatedly trying to Facetime her so she could see it.  I did manage to Facetime her long enough for her to see 2 of them. I tried to use my camera, but I was having trouble using that as well.  It seemed to be frozen.  I should mention, that I’m not one who uses the camera all the time, so this might have been because I’m not adept at it. The event seemed to have concluded (whatever it was), and I started walking home.  Around 10 minutes later, to the East, a solid red light appeared in the sky.  This did not have the same yellow bottom.  Like the others, it dissipated, but this happened more quickly.  I observed one or 2 more of the same in the next few minutes.  I stopped seeing any lights around 8:45pm. I felt elated and excited by the whole experience.",2018-08-22T00:00:00,40.7228,-73.517

At approximately 22:00 on August 12, 2018, I observed a UFO with my brother and mother.  It was seen from a second story deck about 400 feet from the ocean.  The light appeared in the direction of the ocean; it was a bright red light.   I shifted my body from side to side to try and estimate the distance of the light from me.  I was able to tell, based on a beachside restaurant that the light was above, that the light was with 100% certainty out over sea.  It was not moving at all, remaining completely still, initially leading us to believe it was a star or planet that was having a strange effect from the atmosphere/light of the boardwalk (again, the light was a very, very vivid red, like a traffic light).   After about one minute of observing it staying completely still, it began to move South, or to the right from our perspective looking out at the ocean. It moved very smoothly; fluidly.  My brother proclaimed that it was just a helicopter, but I dismissed that because there was very clearly not a blinking light of any kind, and we did not hear propellers.  It smoothly came to a stop again after about 10 seconds of southward travel.  At this time, I suggested that it could be a drone.  Even though it was clearly out at sea by a significant distance, we accepted that this was a likely scenario.  Shortly after we reached this conclusion, however, the light went out. As if someone flipped a switch, it was gone.  I did not think a drone would do this, and a helicopter *absolutely* would not. I cannot completely rule out that it was a drone, but I must reiterate that it was a fair distance out at sea, as the three of us had concluded based on moving from side to side and seeing that the light not move while buildings right on the beach did.",2018-08-17T00:00:00,39.9492,-74.0873

((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Jupiter or Mars, we suspect.  PD)) This is a reoccurring event.  Myself and a fellow eye witness have viewed this abnormally excessively bright light in the sky.  The fact it can be seen from varying locations (often several miles from each other) suggests to me this object is quite far away/high in the sky. I have watched this light through telescope, and despite the increased magnification, I cannot make it out as a particular object that I find to be recognizable. I see a light, seemingly in the south east.  It almost appears to be a very bright star or a neighboring planet upon first glance.  Yet I have little doubt it is either of those based on the observations both myself and a fellow eye witness have viewed, due to its movements.  It almost always subtle makes very suble shifts or changes in location, but it isn’t something easily explainable for me at least. When the sun rises the object slowly fades away into the blue of the day light’s sky. I have no issue with some of the more controversial measures our government has taken in more recent years, if indeed it is justified in the fight against our adversaries (i.e. warrantless wire Taps) provided surveillance is done responsibly.  I fear our 4th amendment is eroding though, but I’m hesitant to even report what I’d likely assume to be nonsense if I personally had not witnessed the phenomenon close to dozens of times at this point if I had to guess.  I’m usually the skeptical one in any given group, but  this is truly remarkable to witness.  I see this so frequently in the night’s sky it has become the norm essentially.  I feel perhaps any reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to uav/drones given substantial increases in their use? should be addressed by the highest court, which can be better understood with respect to our 4th amendment through precedents that have become the standard by our judiciary system, or were rather.  Is this big brother?  I know not the! answer to such a question.

At approximately 4:15 am this morning, I happened to be looking out my bedroom window admiring the clarity of the early morning sky.  No clouds in sight, so visibility was crystal clear.  Because the sky was unusually clear, I was looking to see if I could locate the brightest star that was showing.  One star caught my eye as it was a somewhat brighter than the surrounding stars.  It was early morning and as such, my eyes weren’t focusing just then.  I thought at first that this star was simply twinkling hints of blue and red mixed in with white.   After a few minutes of mindlessly watching this star, I start to notice what I thought was movement.  At first, I thought it was just my imagination, but I couldn’t take my eyes off from it.  I reached for my glasses and once I had them on I could see that indeed this star was moving ever so slightly. I understand that the atmosphere can make stars appear to shimmer, so I didn’t become excited.  After approximately 10 minutes of my continual star gazing, I noticed that this same star was beginning to move about more.  The best way I can describe its movement is comparing it to a gnat flying about.  This was not flying like an airplane and I considered that perhaps it was a helicopter, however I quickly ruled this out because there is no way a helicopter could make those kinds of maneuvers without crashing to the ground. I woke my wife up and asked her to confirm what I was seeing, and she observed this object as well. I decided to step outside to see if there was any sound, but I didn’t hear anything unusual.  I took this opportunity to take in more of the sky to see if there were any more of the objects around.  There were no others in my area of sight.  We live in the mountains and there are lots of trees. I was looking NNE and I will approximate the object was at about 30 – 35 degrees above the horizon. I really have no accurate way of estimating the altitude.  I was watching the object through a large gap between trees in my yard and continued to do so until the object was no longer in line of sight.  This entire time was approximately 45 minutes.  I concluded that the object was basically stationary over one area of the sky and due to the rotation of the earth, my view of the object became obstructed by the trees. I am very interested to see if there are any other reports about this incident.",2018-07-13T00:00:00,,

The front third was red and the back was white with the two colors divided by a definite line.  It had a rudder but no tail.  It had a long white something sticking out of the top near the front on about a 45 degree angle forward.  I thought it might be a refueling tube, but it was too big around.

Multi-witness sighting of multiple nearly static glowing objects in the night sky at the Pacific coastline on 08-29-2018.,Ensenada (?)

Yesterday, evening at approximately 8:17 PM (PDT), I heard our neighbor loudly and urgently calling my wife’s name.  When we went outside we were told to come up to the balcony and to hurry.  After climbing the steps I could see the line of lights in the sky they were watching. The line of lights were not in motion and I decided to grab my cell phone to shoot video of the event before it ended.  With the phone in hand I quickly climbed the steps to the balcony and began shooting video. Facing west we could see approximately 20 glowing objects aligned north to south.  They were all nearly stationary with  some small movement near the center of the line.  A second pair of lights appeared above and to the right (north) of the formation and slowly descended near the formation. Shortly afterward, lights began to go off in place.  It was only a minute or two before the lights appeared again in the same formation and location they appeared before.   I used the balcony rail to steady my shot but the vibrations of the balcony and movement up or down the staircase were causing vibrations to distort the video clarity.  Being fully zoomed in to enhance the view exaggerated the vibrations. I estimate the distance we stood from the formation of lights to be only 2 miles distant or less.  The width of the formation was nearly a quarter mile.  No sound could be heard but ambient highway sounds may have drowned out our ability to hear softer sounds. I have seen videos of similar events and heard there had been a similar sighting near this area only four months earlier.  I felt no sense of dread during the event.  I noticed no particular pattern in the pulsations that seemed to affect each light simultaneously. Almost all the event is captured on video between 4 separate clips and a couple of poor quality still shots that I have not posted anywhere online yet.   Upon request, I will provide links to the videos captured for your analysis.

My first initial thoughts was it was a helicopter hovering perpendicular to us, but then as we slowed down the lights moved to different altitudes, but now moving away from us as the same speed.  As we followed, they began to pick speed, so did we. Faster and faster I drove but right before a big clearing they rose up and over a treeline just in time for us to lose them.  I could have put it off as something from the military, but here are the questions that keep me wandering?  They never made a sound.  The distance between the treeline and them seemed like they went through the trees not over. The speed they accelerated at seemed too incredible.  They moved like they had complete control of the environment around them.  It felt like we were chasing ghost.

Pensacola, Florida, June 7,  201,8 1:45-1:55 am  I was at the intersection of US98 and S 72nd Ave, facing south at the traffic light. I saw a light behind the traffic light, and ignored it because it resembled a spot light on a helicopter, and there's much military and civilian air traffic due to nearby bases and airports. I looked again, while waiting for the green light, and noticed the distant object hadn't moved, and didn't have strobe or nav lights.  I squinted to see it better and realized it was a very strange object.  It was about 30° or less off of the horizon, and just west of due south from my location. I turned right instead, to get closer to the object. I pulled into a parking lot at 7575 W Hwy 98, and was directly north of the object.  The area it was over was mostly wooded, I was afraid if i drove any closer I might miss it. At this point it was nearly 45-60° overhead, and was extremely bright.  It was the size of a fingernail at arm's length, it was a clear sky and no reference point made it difficult to discern the size.  My best guess is that it was a 1-2 thousand feet away, and appeared to be between the size of a car and a bus, but i really don't know for sure.  It was ""smaller"" than a full moon, maybe 60% of that size. I jumped out of the car and immediately took a cell phone video, but could see the aperture was too small on the cheap camera and there wasn't enough light to see it on the screen.  I tried taking several unsuccessful still shots, but it was still too dim/small, and didn't show up.  I gave up after 3 shots, and focused instead on observing the object. It wobbled around, much like a top but very small movements.  It also seemed tethered because it stayed in one spot while wobbling. The colors were hard to determine because of the luminosity of the surface, and also there were dark areas that seemed to indicate it was rotating.  It was mostly yellow/orange/pink, the dark areas seemed blue or green, but they were distant and moving. It was shaped almost exactly like a queen's crown, it was rounded like a muffin on top, but had a ring underneath, like the headband on a crown.  There may have been something on top, like a point, or it may have been light glare from the object.  The dark areas were on the sides, like panels or windows. I considered it may have been a Chinese lantern, or maybe a quad copter, or some type of prank drone. It was totally silent, I have heard how noisy drones typically are. I started to shout at it after a minute or two, to see if it would do anything.  Maybe a minute later, a very bright red light just appeared on the 10:00 position of the object, it was a pinpoint of intense really red light.  Astonished, I began to flash my phone flashlight off and on at the object. The red light ""grew"" upwards into a equally bright red line, like a car antenna popping up.  The line was no bigger than the object itself.  It remained a line for maybe 30-60 seconds.  Afterwards, it retracted upwards to return to a single point of light, now with more space between the original object and the red light, but still very close. It remained stationary, when suddenly the objects drifted south.  As the objects started to move they looked like they went into a thick, invisible fog.  There was no cloud, they just vanished/faded into a smoky oblivion.  The entire process was about 10 minutes or less.",2018-06-15T00:00:00,30.462935377358487,-87.26545408805032

In the evening, my family and I sat down on our deck for dinner.  My oldest daughter noticed something floating overhead and said, “wow, look at that”.  My other daughter, wife and I all looked up and noticed what looked like a clear, translucent balloon like object floating in the sky.  I thought it may be a plastic bag, or something similar, but I continued to watch it.  It appeared to be rising very slowly.  I noticed it went just behind a cloud, and was much larger than I first imagined.  Not sure how large, but the lower clouds were probably at roughly 8,000 to 9,000 feet, we are at about 5,000 feet.  The clouds were drifting fairly fast from west to east, but the wind did not affect the floating object at all.  In fact, it was drifting from east to west and still rising slowly. I went into my house and grabbed a pair of binoculars to observe the object closer.  When viewed through binoculars, it still seemed to be a translucent object with two possibly rigid rings.  The rings sort of reflected the sunlight sort of rainbow like.  I observed that is was just above the low clouds now as they drifted by from west to east (our typical wind direction).  So my initial thought of it being some sort of weather balloon was mystified by the fact it was still rising in a westerly direction, into the wind.  The clouds above it were also drifted from west to east, so the wind from that day was typical for our area, out of the west. This is why I decided to send in this report, if it had risen and drifted the same direction as the clouds then I would have been sure of it being a balloon. We went back into the house, did some dishes and came back out a bit later, maybe and hour and a half, and the object remained.  It was a bit higher, but still traveling very slowly westward, while all clouds were traveling from west to east.  We looked again after dark, but did not see the object then. I looked it up online to see if anyone had seen anything like it.  I did see something that looked exactly like it in a youtube video shot over Brazil in 2017.  That video is at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yXoES7Dlp0 .  That video shows the object above clouds drifting in the opposite direction.",2018-07-05T00:00:00,45.0564,-112.8214

At the time I thought they were drones.  I saw a jet fly right above one ( they were below clouds) and it slowly “ drifted “ to around 20 degrees off of pole center and faded in the cloud cover that was heading in.

I forgot to add that there was a weird horn sound on one of the videos that I took and last night while taking it I didn't notice a sound but it was recorded.  My phone was also malfunctioning a bit saying that there was a strange magnetic field.  A little while after I went inside I heard helicopters. I would really like to know what is going on. I live about 8 miles from Lockheed Dobbins.  I assume there is a lot going on.  What I don't understand is how no one else seems to notice or see them except for a select few people.",2018-08-17T00:00:00,33.96188745901639,-84.51021319672131

There were lights on the object, one on each point, and I initially thought it might have been a plane but after standing there for several minutes, I realized the object was not moving.   I woke up my friend who was staying the night and by the time we got back to the window, the lights had started pulsing.   As we watched, the object seemed to change shape and two more lights appeared on the object.  It looked as if there were two poles suddenly coming out each side of the now spherical object and they were radiating almost a rainbowish light.  After a few minutes of watching this, we both became unbearably groggy and sleepy.  In all honesty, I don’t remember going back to bed and neither does my friend. This morning when I was leaving for work, my neighbor remarked that we “had lights again”.  I reported on 12/29/16 that both the neighbor and I had seen two triangle shaped objects above the tree line to the south.  We frequently see things in the sky that seem odd but generally we don’t see them at the same time.  Since this was another case where we both saw the same thing occur, I decided to report it.
