It stopped then started the fall again, slowly.  Then it suddenly broke into 6 pieces, which were more round than teardrop.  These pieces moved in a slow arc around the sky - this was all taking place just over the football scoreboard in the endzone, so it would have been looking toward the southwest - over the Arkanas River or in that area.  This happened several times, each time, the main light broke into pieces.  These hovered, some we could see, some went behind the scoreboard and were lost to our view in the trees.

PD)) I reported this with Mufon. I will use the exact content as in that report:  Long Description of Sighting Report My husband and I noticed an extremely bright flickering object in the western sky last night. We have seen this on occasion, and assumed at the time it was a star. Last night I looked out the window to see if the sky was still clear (we have been pounded by rain in the Midwest lately). I noticed two flickering objects in the western sky, and I grabbed the binoculars to see if they were planes. They did not move like the planes we see over our home, which have a different light pattern, and typically move quicker, either heading to or from the airport. By the time we grabbed the binoculars, we were only observing one object. The other object had moved out of our sight. It looked fairly stationary, so that's why I didn't think it was a plane to begin with, but line of sight maybe created an illusion.  I grabbed my Sony 20x Optical/800x digital zoom 8MM video camera. I had to put it on a tripod to keep it steady as you will get extremely jerky movement trying to zoom in on distant objects with digital zoom. (very sensitive to the slightest camera movement.) I used the Night Shot Plus option (infrared) on the camera to record. I taped about 40 minutes. During this time I had to readjust the camera several times as the object would move out of frame once I had a steady focus on it.  I captured the video this morning an up loadable digital file. I edited out most of the jerky movements caused by me trying to refocus and reposition the object in the camera frame. (There still are some on the video and they are obvious quick up and down movements.) I do have some steady video clips of the object in frame and you can see the object moving left to right out of frame on its own. I put the clips together in one file.  I guess this could be an extremely bright star but I do not know enough about celestial objects and how quickly they should move out of frame based on our planet's rotation. The object also gives off a rotation of colors.  Video clip is loaded up in the Mufon database if you want to see it.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,38.8251,-90.7289

It was around 10 pm under clear skies in late December of 2006. We were almost home from an evening of visiting our son and his family when, as we reached the bottom of the off ramp, straight ahead of us in the air we spotted a ball of orange flame hovering in place in the sky.  I told my wife to 'look at that helicopter up there.' I said that it had to be on fire and she agreed. It was dark outside but a clear night and unless the ‘helicopter’ was completely painted in florescent orange paint with spotlights shining all around it, the craft we saw had to be engulfed in flames. We fully expected it to suddenly fall to the ground, but to our amazement, it instead just quietly hovered in place until finally it made a lateral move, exactly as a helicopter might do.  But where are the blinking lights I said? Any flying craft would have to have some sort of blinking lights on it so as to alert others that it's there, no doubt it's an FAA law. But there were no lights, only that glowing orange ball. It was no more than a 1/4 mile away from us, hovering over the Banana River, roughly about 150 feet in the air. Cars began to back up behind us so we left the scene.  Was it a UFO? I believe so. I thought so then and I think so now.

On New Year's Eve I was at a party outside in Paramount, CA, very close to Long Beach, CA. There were approximately 20 people standing outside and eating and drinking.  Suddenly someone pointed to the sky and we all looked up as we saw five very bright lights. There was a cloud cover that night, but the lights were below the clouds. There were five lights and they seemed to be very high up. Immediately we started speculating and ruled out the chance of them being helicopters, as they were very high and unlike any helicopters I have seen in my military service. We then ruled them out as airplanes, as the cluster of five lights seemed to be hazardous for any airplanes to fly in. Also, there were no flashing wingtip lights as seen on normal aircraft. The third incident, which ruled them out as aircraft to us, was when two of the lights started to converge together. Briefly, they became one light as they met up for approximately 10 second, then they broke off and became two separate lights once again. We thought that perhaps they could be comets, as we could definitely tell that there were fiery sparks breaking off from the lights, which happens when an object enters the atmosphere. But the strange activities of the two lights made it seem nearly impossible for them to be comets. The five lights were not moving in any specific formation, just a round cluster of about three lights on top and two on the bottom, with one following behind the other. We watched the lights for a couple of minutes, speculating, when it looked like one of the lights went out. Perhaps it disappeared into the cloud cover? I do not know, but it looked very much as if someone had put a candle out as the light died out. Right after the first one went out, then slowly and in succession the other 4 lights started to go out, until there was only one. It waited for about 20 seconds, and then that one went out. I would say about 30 minutes later one light reappeared in the sky, lower to the horizon and over the city.  This one! light l ooked very much like one of the five lights previously seen. It zoomed around briefly and then disappeared into the clouds. We tried taking pictures and video on our cameras, but we didn't have good enough zoom to capture the lights, as they were very high altitude.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,33.899,-118.1651

The sky was well lit with fireworks display since it was countdown to New Year.   Initially I thought it was Mars but noticed that the object was contant and there was no flickering.  I noticed the object moving into a slow speed going North.  It took quite some time but the speed was constant and it was straight until it disappeared into the horizon.  By that time, my wife's cousing was with me watching the whole thing.  I thought it was a plane of sort but later ((name deleted)) (wife's cousin) came inside and claimed that the red object had reappeared and heading into the same position at the same slow constant speed.   We watched it until it took the same position as last time and stayed there for quite awhile until it again sped off into the distance at the same slow constant speed.   It reappeared the second time.  This time my aunt and wife were with us.  It performed the same exercise.   The third time, by then it was already 1:00 AM, January 1, 2007, it reappeared and followed the same path and position.  But this time, it was joined by a second smaller red object which flew parrallel its original route.    The bigger object then started speeding into the distance at the same constant speed while the smaller red object reached a point parrallel to the original location of the bigger object.   By this time, the bigger object had already disappeared the smaller object started to follow it, at the same slow constant speed.  I went up to the balcony to follow its route until it finally disappeared.  Time was around 2:00AM.  I noticed that at one point the entire street lamps along our house concked out for a full three seconds before it reappeared.  But no brownout occured.  Perhaps the UFO was watching the fireworks display and perhaps it was thinking that it could not be seen because it was a red dot in the sky.  I tried to take pictures of it with my sony W50 digital camera but I am not sure if anything came out of it.  I have the file and can send it to you.

Magnitude was as great as Mars at it's closest.  Then 2 more appeared behind the roof into view, so we stepped out to see if there were more moving across the sky. 17 lights in total, all within 70 degrees of each other moving South-East from the North-West.  All were the same brightness and color. A bright Orange to reddish. As the first 3-4 moved through the 12 o'clock(meridian) they started to change course. A few slowed then turned about 90 degrees and out of the path, then a few faded and made a left 270. 2 actually stopped, as noted against a clear sky of stars and a bright moon. All in all, about 7 or 8 ""danced"" overhead, the rest continued on course. At this point I recalled we had just bought a new video camera so I ran in, grabbed it and shot the last few minutes of the ""satellites"" continuing across the sky.  At this point, pretty much all those that had not faded were continuing SE bound. Since moving into the country from the city 5 years ago, watching satellites and meteors has become one of my families evening pastimes.  We are quite adept at this pastime now and can identify the difference between Satellites, Space Station, Etc. and Aircraft.  And I have spent the better part of my 36 years, watching aircraft,  As well, I am employed as an ((deleted--aviation specialist.)).  So something like this event really stood out. There were no contrails visible as they would have been with the moon as a backlight. There were no stobe lights or red and green wings lights as associated with A/C.  There was no sound associable with these ""satellites"". The time for the ""Non Dancing"" lights to traverse the sky was about 9 minutes, the same as a satellite or the Space Shuttle.   A quiet check of the net did show that the prevailing winds aloft were moving in the same direction. Lighted Weather Balloons?  ROV's?   I truly hope someone else who might have noticed these lights will also report something.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,38.5369,-122.81230000000001

I have never seen a UFO before in my life, so this was at least significant for me.  I was the only witness to this event that I know of (no one I know made any mention of it, anyway), though anyone could have seen it, provided they had the right view.  At about 12:11 AM on New Year's Day, 1-January-2007, I witnessed a single, strangely bright, white light in the sky north of Cedar Falls, Iowa.  At first, I thought it was either an airplane or an unusually bright star.  I realized it wasn't an airplane when I noticed that not only were there none of the telltale noises of an airplane, but there were none of the characteristic blinking lights either.  My suspicions of it being a star were disproved when it slowly began growing in size and moving slightly upward, as if whatever it was moved closer to my location.  It stopped where it was after about 20 seconds, and at this point it was about the size of a pencil eraser when held at arm's length.  It hovered in the same position for about 40 seconds.  It then moved slowly to the east for about 5 seconds, before moving first up, then down, all slowly.  It returned to its original height, then moved back west to its original position.  It stopped again, then moved west and began the same process once more: up, down, middle.  It returned to its first stopping position once again, and repeated the same ordeal, moving up, then down, then middle.  It then began moving slowly to the east once more, and when it stopped in the same position it had before, I thought it was about to repeat the whole thing over again.  But after sitting still for about 15 seconds, it began moving fairly quickly to the southwest, which, from where I was standing, almost seemed like it was just circling around the east side of the city and heading south.  It became obstructed by houses and trees at that point, and although I continued to watch for it, I never saw it again.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,42.51675675675676,-92.5140972972973

It also appeared to have a central light on top of the raised dome.   I was trying to take a picture of it with my cell phone, but it was too difficult to do while driving on the freeway at 70mph.   I exited the freeway in El Cerrito, but by the time I parked the car, the object was gone.   As soon as I got home, I searched the news and googled 'UFO sightings in Bay Area', but didn't see anything related to what I'd just seen.  So, I posted a rant on craigslist and about 8 people re-posted saying that they saw it too.   One guy SAID he was a scientists and said that we shouldn't be freaked out about it, stating that we're just one tiny planet in a universe full of solar systems and galaxies, and that we're probably not alone.   Another person re-posted and provided the NUFO Reporting Center website.  Anyway, I'm 100% serious, this is not joke, I saw a UFO.   Actually, it wasn't a UFO, because I was able to identify it - it was a flying saucer!!!!!   I'd estimate that it was flying about 1500 feet above the ground.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,37.918,-122.3032

December 15, 2007  My 7 year old daughter and I left our house at 6:20pm heading down to a neighbors house, all of our lights were out in our house because I was in the process of plugging our Christmas lights in. In our area the night sky is really dark and occasionally you can see satellites.  I thought it would be really cool to show my daughter an orbiting satellite if I could locate one.  I was standing in front of our house (which faces directly north) and I looked in a NNE direction in the sky and I witnessed a bright white light slowly heading in a NNW direction. I watched the light for about 45 seconds to a minute when my daughter started to ask me if we could hurry up and go. I didn't want to point it out to her becuase I thought she might get a little freaked out.  As I watched the light move across the sky it faded to orange and gradually got smaller until it completely faded into the night sky and was no longer visible. After about 2 minutes the light was completely gone.  When I first noticed the light I almost thought it could have been a spotlight from a helicopter, but there was no sound and because of the mountains in the canyon we live in, my thoughts are the elevation of the light appeared to be much higher than a helicopter would normally fly.  The light gradually disappeared kind of like when you turn a clear light bulb off and the filament is still hot and glows and as it cools of it goes completely out.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,37.42148,-107.85291833333333

I was on my way from my apartment to my place of work to pick up my paycheck (about a 5 minute drive.) I was alone in the car. There are two ways to get to my work, and if I had chosen the way that I usually prefer to take, I may not have seen what I saw that night. I thought that this other way would be quicker though, so I went that way. I almost made the light at the intersection of Wyoming Road (which I was on, facing east) and Marrow's Road, but it turned red just before I got there, so I was stopped for a few minutes waiting to make a left turn. To the south (my right side) of this intersection is a large suburban residential area. To the northwest (roughly behind me) is a shopping center. Directly east (in front of me) is a large warehouse of some kind, and slightly to the northeast of that building is a highly visible chemical factory building with large smokestacks (which I always jokingly call ""those pretty cloud machines."") I don't think there was anyone else stopped at the intersection. The sky that night was completely overcast; not a single star could be seen anywhere. The sun had set, so it was fully nightttime, but because of the cloud cover bouncing back the light pollution it was relatively light outside. So I was sitting at the red light and just looking ahead of me, when I saw two very bright, circular or spherical white lights come out of nowhere in the eastern sky, above the warehouse. I thought they must be planes at first, and Delaware does have an airport somewhat nearby with occasionally low-flying planes, but these objects were hovering and not traveling in a straight trajectory. The lights on them were also much brighter than on a plane. It was difficult to tell exactly how far away from me they were, and I did not hear any noise. The two lights were close together at first. The one on the right remained stationary in the sky, and its light was stable. The one on the left was blinking on and off, and moved slowly to the left (north.) I got the feeling that the stationary one was in some way controlling the movements of the other one. As I watched this I realized they were not ordinary aircraft, and it seemed that the instant I thought this, the lights stopped moving for a second and then gradually retreated back behind the thick cloud cover. From my perspective, it looked like they faded out before disappearing. I had the distinct impression that they had been aware I was watching, and the whole thing spooked me out. The traffic light turned green and I continued on my way, trying to analyze what had happened and think of any other possible explanations. I was mad that I had forgotten to take out my camera, but I was so shocked by what I was seeing and it was over very quickly (the lights were visible for maybe 20-30 seconds or so total.)  After picking up my paycheck, I went to my mother's house, which is in a residential neighborhood off of Kirkwood Highway. As I pulled onto her street (again facing east) I saw just one of these same bright white lights. The light was not blinking, so I assumed it was the non-blinking one I had seen before (it looked exactly the same), but it could have been the blinking one from before or possibly a third craft. I pulled into my mom's driveway while continuing to watch the light, which was still just moving slowly around in the sky, hovering. I looked at the clock so at least I would know exactly what time it was on this second sighting...it was 6:41 pm. Now I thought of my camera and fished around in my purse for it, but was unable to locate it. (I had taken it out a couple nights before to take pictures of something else and never put it back.) I kept watching the light, and again it was like the craft knew I was watching and conspiring to take pictures of it. Suddenly, the bright light was shut off, but I could still see three very dim lights in a triangular pattern in its place. The lights were (I think) red/pink, blue/green, and yellow/orange. This triangular formation then moved to the left (north) and disappeared behind a house. That was the last I saw of it. When I got home that night, I drew pictures of what I had seen and jotted down the details. I looked up the locations where I saw these craft on Mapquest, and I was definitely looking almost directly east both times. I am a college student in my senior year, and I work part time in customer service. I was not under the influence of any intoxicants at the time. I believed in UFOs and extraterrestrial intelligence before, but now I am even more sure that they exist. I am not sure that what I saw could not have been explained by man-made technology, but I can't shake the feeling that they knew I was watching and altered their movements because of it.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,39.65195779310345,-75.71214262068966

The object was copper coloured and had what appeared to be lines on the underside(?) which formed a thick cross-similar to the nazi iron cross design-there was also a set of lines which went around the outer edge of this thing. This disc also travelled on its rim and climbed into the sky like a wheel. It was not hovering but moving steadily on its rim. I believe i was looking at the underside of the craft and do not know if there was mass or bulk (cabin or infrastructure) on the side i could not see. It was the size of a penny-a canadian or american one cent. i watched it until my head was almost on the dash board trying to see where it was going. Eventually it moved into the cloud bank and out of view. this is a diagram to the best of my memory.

We could, however, see three bright lights in a triangular pattern.  Being an avid reader of aircraft publications, I at first thought it resembled an F-117, but it was hovering.

Below is my February 6, 1997 sighting detail, which I also reported to www.ufoevidence.org in November 2005. Appearance / Description of Object(s): The craft was approximately 20 meters in lenth and 10 meters high. I believe it was triangular in shape, but I am not 100% sure. Because it was NOT dark yet, I could very clearly see that this was a flying vehicle, which accelerated at terrific speeds. It appeared lit as it moved south, after accelerating away from me. Size of Object(s): Again, 20 meters long and 10 meters high. With my thumbs tucked behind, my other 8 fingers may have covered it had I held them up. Distance to Object(s) & Altitude: Again, I believe the craft was about 60 meters away, and flying at an altitude of 100-130 meters. Description of Area / Surroundings: Mesa is a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona. The complex I lived in lies near an open field, train track and silos (south), at the end of a road that leaves the main road through town. Full Description & Details:  February 6, 1997 was my final day living in Mesa, Arizona.  The next day I moved to San Francisco. Done packing late in the afternoon, I left my apartment and began walking east, on the southern edge of the southernmost parking lot in the complex. I was headed toward the mailboxes to retrieve my mail for the last time.  To my right (south) was a concrete retaining wall that lines the complex.  Behind me, to my right were the large silos, which sit next to the train tracks.  There were no cars or trains passing by. Approximately 500 meters from the mailboxes, I began to hear a low humming noise behind me and to my right (south).   In my peripheral vision, I caught sight of a large triangular craft, the source of the low humming sound. The craft was flying very slowly, at an altitude of approximately 100-130 meters. It was flying over the train tracks, which lie about 60 meters from where I was walking.  At the moment that I turned my head to the right and looked directly at the craft, it stopped, turned right and accelerated to a terrific speed and disappeared.  The craft made NO noise above the low humming I initially heard.  It emitted NO exhaust, fume, smell or fire. It was very much like watching a movie, in real life. Can sighting be explained as any conventional man-made or natural object? NO way.  This was a craft that was being flown by somebody. ANYBODY who saw what I saw would instantly have known that.  The only question I have is, who was flying or controlling the craft?  Humans?  Extra-terrestrials?   Witness Background: I'm a teacher in Brooklyn, New York having recently changed careers from advertising.  I have a masters degree in education.  My undergraduate studies focused on marketing and political science and Arizona State University (1990-94). Views on UFOs, before and after sighting: BEFORE the sighting, I was very open to the possibility that some sightings could be attributed to military tests.  However, I had seen some stories and movies that were compelling with respect to the notion that some UFO's could actually be extra-terrestrial.  Beyond that, I paid no extraordinary attention to the question, mainly because I felt the odds of seeing something inexplicable were very, very low.  AFTER the sighting, I spent nearly a month in denial that it even happened.  Then, on national news, I saw the ""Phoenix Lights"" sighting on mainstream national news.  My first response was, ""That's what I saw.""  Then, I was not in denial, but also did not speak much of what I saw except with very close friends.  Within the last year, my curiosity has risen again, though it is very frustrating to imagine that I may never know exactly what I saw.  However, recently I have had very vivid dreams which strongly suggest that what I saw was extra-terrestrial in nature.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,33.42126454293629,-111.772797322253

I remember them standing there just staring blankly up into the sky.  They claim that we got ""freaked out"" and went back inside before anything too detailed happened.  My cousin and I procrastinated feeding the cats outside, so we had to do it in the dark.  I stood outside of the cat pen to make sure none got out and looked into the northeastern sky where I observed two lights.  One beam shot from the other and there was an explosion, which my cousin witnessed.  We ran inside and grabbed my grandmother and we stood in the front yard.  There was still residual light in the sky from the explosion, and more lights started appearing, looking like stars.  Then, as the numbers increased, they grew closer.  There was no set formation and they were all traveling at different altitudes and distances from each other.  I can't recall how many there were -- not that I was counting.  I was in a state of shock and awe.  One craft flew at about treetop level right above our heads as if saying, ""Get a look at me!""  It hovered over us for about 2 minutes.  It was triangular shaped, probably about 15-20 at the base (back end) of the craft.  The edges of the triangle were rounded out.  The color of the craft was a gunmetal gray with a greenish tinge.  I got the impression that it was a soft metal.  There were geometric shapes etched in the metal -- lines and shapes formed together to create symbols.  There were semi-bright, rounded, amber colored lights at each point of the triangle.  They never dimmed or pulsed.  There was no sound, only a humming which seemed to come from inside of my head and the air seemed electrically charged.  It continued on, moving at about 10mph with it's buddies and gradually gained it's altitude.  I'm really not too clear on what happened after this, honestly.  I recall feeling very strange though.

If others have information about this sighting report, we urge them to contact Mr. Sheets directly at the e-address, <mufonofga1@yahoo.com>.  PD)) On 15Feb02, this SD was contacted by a witness known to the writer.  He stated that an incident had occurred the previous year in his home and that he had been trying to determine exactly what it involved, but to no avail. In response to his request, an on-site inspection, an interview and an investigation was began on 11March02. The witness is a 20+ year veteran police officer employed by a major South Fulton County  police agency and has been professionally known to this writer for at least 15 years.  The witness is a former nuclear submariner for the U.S. Navy with all of the attendant training, qualifications, clearances and certifications.  After his naval service, the witness served as a Georgia State Trooper until he decided on municipal police work in order to be able to reside and work in one particular place i.e. no moving around in a far flung region of the state.  This witness spent many years of his municipal career in a particularly dangerous aspect of law enforcement.  His hobbies include traveling the USA with his wife to visit our numerous national parks and photographing other scenic outdoor resorts and vistas, and working with his PC.  The witness lives in a nice middle class neighborhood a few minutes drive south of Hartsfield International Airport.  During the years of this writer's professional association with the witness, he was observed under pressure and in emergency situations on many occasions.  The witness was never known to over-react, loose his professional demeanor or demonstrate any type of improper conduct when dealing with the public or criminal suspects who were often violent. The event site is his home, a well-kept split (tri) level, 3 bedroom house with a substantial wire fenced backyard, the home facing west on a generally N-S suburban street.  The rear fencing is extensive, with the backyard enclosed by four foot wire fence, with numerous wire sub-fencing within in order to make a dog run, and divide off areas for plants and patio-type yard fixtures.  Numerous large boulders outcrop the soil in the rear, and this is evident in other nearby yards. The interview was conducted on 11March02 in the witness' living room.  He was calm and related the experience in a clear and concise manner. He stated that on 28Sept01, between 9:30 and 10:00PM, he had turned in and was going to sleep as he had to work the next day.  He and his wife sleep in separate bedrooms due to their sometime conflicting work schedules, furthermore that she was downstairs watching TV.  Their cat was laying on the foot of the bed as is normal.  He heard the cat make a growling sound, which was unusual, so he rolled over to see what that was all about.  He then observed a (very) white in color rectangular light hovering over his bed, but a few feet up towards the ceiling and ceiling fan (fan was not in operation).  Witness indicated this light put him to mind of a shoebox-top in shape, perhaps 6""x12"", and appeared like a silent white window just hanging there above the bed, but not giving off any light that would illuminate the room. He sat up and reached out to touch it, but it moved away slightly, but maintaining a general position of about 1/2 of the way between the bed and ceiling. He continued to watch it, then reached over to turn on the night table lamp immediately next to the bed (see photos), but could not find it, as if the table and lamp were gone.  He then reached out for the chest of drawers and did not feel that either. After a bit of reaching around, the lamp was found and turned on.  The rectangular light promptly vanished.  Witness said it seemed like there was absolutely nothing in the room during the few moments he was groping around for the lamp, and this was quite disconcerting. (Sidebar:  In previous months this officer had been working at night and sleeping in the daytime, so he had covered every square inch of each bedroom window with tin foil so he could day-sleep in total darkness.  This window covering was left completely intact when he had changed shifts and remained so on the night of this event. He double checked this, thinking that perhaps errant light was leaking from an outside source, but his coverings were still intact i.e. no leaking light incoming). Once the lamp was on and the rectangle had vanished, he got up and went downstairs and related the experience to his wife, and they talked for about 30 minutes.  He then returned to bed and after turning out the light, the white rectangle made a reappearance in the same location.  Witness then sat up and was able on this occasion to stick his finger through the light, learning that it had no heat, no apparent depth, only height and width.  He then moved his hand around the light to double check for an outside light leak, and discovering none, put his finger into the light again.  At that point the light seemed to break into ""a million small specks"" and quickly vanished and did not return.  He added that during the time of the event, he was not ill, had not been taking medication of any sort and was in as generally good health as a moderate smoker could be. He did note that within a few days of this occurrence, he had 3 fluorescent lights to burn out on the same day and thought this to be unusual.  No other unusual electrical problems had  been noted in the home. During additional conversation, the witness said his only contact with anything odd, or seemingly anomalous, was during some photo taking in an underground cave in New Mexico.  When their photos were developed, they noticed some floating semi-transparent 'orbs' on the photos.  We discussed the fact that some researchers, including our paranormal associates in Georgia, had determined these 'orbs' most likely were caused by particles of dust, debris, pollen, or moisture floating in close proximity to the camera and were out of focus, then highly illuminated by the flash unit.  Witness said he'd heard that discussed on TV documentaries.  This writer offered up another opinion regarding the fact that some persons were just more 'sensitive' regarding various paranormal phenomena, which seemed to occur in and around them more often than others.  The witness has an interest in such matters, and has read extensively in that area. The witness prepared a sketch of the rectangular light using computer graphics and forwarded recently taken photographs of his home and property .  He also completed and signed a MUFON Form #1.  This writer took additional photos of the bedroom and it's contents, as well as the yard.  These will be electronically added to the CMS Form at a later date.  The wife of witness did not observe the above described phenomenon, but in essence recalled the same scenario i.e. being downstairs watching TV, her husband coming down and speaking with her about the matter. Witness did state that there had been a severe lightning strike to the fence in back on an earlier date some years before.  The lightning bolt running through all of the fencing. ASD Ralph Howard, a professional geologist and Georgia's science officer, was contacted and made aware of this investigation.  He scheduled a geological survey of the witness property due to the large amount of rock structure that appears to be just under the surface soil.  (See this geology report to be added to the FIs CMS report in the near future). In checking sources for similar events, this writer reviewed William R. Corliss' 'Remarkable Luminous Phenomena In Nature-Catalog of Geophysical Anomalies'.  While his descriptions of some forms of ball lightning, luminous aerial bubbles, and low-level nocturnal lights might be slightly similar to this matter, nothing described therein possesses the perfect geometric rectangular form as illustrated and described by the witness.  Of course ball lightning has reportedly been observed to enter an enclosure or dwelling, but it's conduct in doing so is radically different from what was observed in this case, and not geometrically perfect in shape. While there were no instruments available on the day of this writer's on-scene examination, there would certainly be the possibility of an electro-magnetic field in the vicinity of the bedroom ceiling due to the ceiling fan's electric motor and built-in three bulb lighting fixture, however the fan and light WAS NOT in operation at time of the event.  As stated, the witness noticed no abnormal electrical problems in the home except for the previously mentioned burn-out of three fluorescent bulbs in various rooms on the same day, a few days later. While the witness was in overall good health, the 'Electric Power Research Institute' and 'International Association of Certified Home Inspectors' describe certain health issues sometime associated with EM fields in the home.  One being Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity that could manifest in allergy-like conditions, or else a physiological disorder which might include neurological symptoms.  The witness did confirm that he also spent a moderate amount of time working with his computers, being something of an amateur computer bug. He described no type of personal condition that would lead one to suspect he suffered from such EM Hypersensitivity. (Sidebar:  Information from the above two professional organizations regarding ceiling fans and other small appliances.......that the EM field RAPIDLY becomes weaker with distance from the source........gaging ceiling fans on a strength scale.....at 1 foot--a rating of 50; at 2 feet--a rating of 6; at 4 feet--a rating of 1.  According to this scale, the strength of the EM field does in fact drop off RAPIDLY as the distance is increased). During the course of this investigation in the early spring of 2002, physicist Dr. Eric Davis of NIDS became aware of this inquiry via our thumbnail posting in Filer's Files.  He contacted this writer due to his work in quantum teleportation and researching traversable wormholes in the form of a 'Stargate'.  This writer forwarded certain information to Dr. Davis regarding this event and Davis asked that the witness also provide him with an account via the NIDS citizen reporting form.  The witness agreed and prepared his account for submission.  He had extreme difficulty getting the NIDS data base to accept his account and finally gave up in frustration. At the time, we did not know that NIDS was downsizing and Bob Bigelow preparing to close down NIDS and pursue aerospace operations.  Dr. Davis, along with his colleagues, was released from service at NIDS.  Davis then contracted as an adviser to the USAF Research Lab's Advanced Concept Office, later forming his own company 'Warp Drive Metrics'.  We were unable to reach Dr. Davis after that, and NIDS was out of business. This writer has rejected the possibility that the witness experienced a hallucination or entered a spontaneous altered state of consciousness or underwent a mystical episode in the 'Alpha State' that precedes sleep i.e rejected because the phenomenon was observed twice, about 30 minutes between each event. Based on all of the above, and this investigator's knowledge of the witness' personality, integrity and seriousness, this event is classified as an 'Unknown-Other'.

This sighting took place on Friday night September 28, 2001.   I might also add that one of the friends with me was an active FBI agent and also the driver of the vehicle. We were coming out of Richmond, Virginia at approximately 11:00 PM on the above date when we approached exit 58 on the southbound side of Interstate 95. On one side to the west is state route 150 with high tension electrical lines on the east running parallel to I-95 and (under construction at the time) to the west is  Interstate 895 overpass. We sighted a very odd flying object going from west to east.  What was strange about this is that the object had come in UNDER the electrical lines and was lit up in very bright white lights. The shape was that of a sailor’s cap. This object couldn’t have been 75 feet overhead. The vehicle was maybe 25 feet square and10-12 feet tall.  We had pulled onto the side of the road to watch this spectacle which had also attracted the attention of several vehicles on the northbound side of I-95. The object hovered over the roadway’s columns for a few minutes and then very slowly headed east. I have seen pictures of lots of different shapes of UFOs, but I have never seen or heard of anything like this. Do you have any ideas? We didn’t have a camera or video camera to take pictures of this. All three of us have discussed this several times and agree to what we saw.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,37.558607538635506,-77.50798002261591

Three of them left to go play pool. My friend and I went and sat on the beach around 80th street, a few miles down from the strip. When I first saw the green light, it looked like a dotted line being slowly drawn downward slowly in the sky. It seemed to be very wide and very high, miles out over the Atlantic Ocean. I pointed it out to my friend and we both just thought it looked cool. It stopped abruptly, but about 5 minutes later it returned, a little faster now, and it was a solid line. The light made one streak and then stopped. This line remained visible for quite awhile. My friend and I became very interested after that. I called my mother and a few friends to tell them to look for it. One of those friends was on as boat just off the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and she and her friends could see it from there. We eventually settled back down, but an hour or so later the light returned. It started the same way, making a segmented line. When it came back as a solid line it made a broad, looping stroke in the sky. It was really bright green, and reminded me off a neon sign. My friend and I started to feel uneasy after the second appearance. There were other people scattered on the stretch off sand, and they all began pointing up and acting afraid. There was a group of around ten teenagers there from the Ukraine on work visas for the summer. They approached us and asked if we knew what was happening. Some of them seemed really scared. They sat and talked with us for another hour or so (it was between midnight and 1am) and then the light returned a third time. After its dotted stroke, the light made another sold line. This time the light swooped around a few times before culminating with an incredibly bright flash. At this point I became frightened as well, and I remember thinking we were seeing some kind of unfathomable missile or bomb approaching and that we were all going to be killed. Both the lines and the shape of the flash remained visible for what seemed like an hour. My other three friends came back sometime between 1 and 2 am. We told them what happened and one of them stayed on the beach with us and the Ukrainians. As I recounted the light appearances, it struck me that the three different shapes left by the solid line resembled the numbers 1, 2, and 3, in that order. This wasn’t completely true, however because the ""3"" had an extra swirl at the tail before the flash. We were all completely amazed when it came back again, making the same dotted and solid line as it had the first time. I was scared, but I was also mesmerized and couldn’t tear myself away. We all just sat there watching the sky, wondering if it would keep coming back. When it did (again, about an hour later), it repeated the pattern of the second dotted and solid line. I was sure it would come back and repeat the third line and its flash, and just before dawn it did. I was still completely awed and so even as my companions went to bed, I stayed on the beach. The cycle began to repeat itself a third time as the sky grew lighter. It was still visible after sunrise. I watched as the light again formed its first and second formations, but before the third pattern could be re-drawn, I succumbed to my exhaustion and went to sleep. I remember wanting to see what the newspaper or local news would have to say about the lights, but I never heard anything about it. I assumed the stations would be flooded with calls from people in Virginia Beach and as far away as North Carolina, so I never even considered calling myself. I did do an internet search to see if there were any weird tests being done at nearby military bases, but came up empty-handed. I still tell people about it, and when I run into the friend who had been out there with me we ask each other whether we’ve figured out it was.  We haven’t, of course.

One rather bright light followed by 3 dimmer lights moving from southwest to northeast. Then they dissapeared from view. This happened in exactly the same way about every 5 minutes for 20 minutes or so. People around me either didn't see them or just were watching the show. My mother was another witness to this. I don't know what these lights were but they were very high, perhaps spacecraft. What struck me as odd was that I saw the same lights every 5 minutes.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,42.8369,-96.9833

As we turned down a street a block away we noticed two fiery balls this time. About eight hundred feet above us this time.( nothing like I’ve ever seen, it was like you could really see flames pulsating off of the craft) As they were moving closer the one trailing the other moved down amazingly fast then swooped in front of the other. One would speed up fast then the other and on and on. Never once could you hear a noise coming from any direction it was a quiet night. This year the fire works in the neighborhood we were in were going amazingly high with bright beautiful colors this year. We watched them soar above all of the fireworks going off for about seven or eight minutes. When they got close enough you could see a fireball in the center and a beautiful orange haze like you get around street lights when it rains. I’ve heard stories and seen videos before but this made me a true believer, I’ll probably never see anything like it again in this small town. We’re pretty much smack dab in the middle of the US. 	There is nothing that could move like these objects did but a UFO. They were right above us and in less than ten minutes they were tiny little specs in space.

It was not a balloon but a deep orange colored orb that was moving slowly until it dissappeared out of sight.  This sighting is the second time I have seen this orb in almost the same setting in elizabeth, as I saw it last year.   My theory is that it may be a weather instrument launched out of Newark Airport which is close by and I am contacting the FAA offices at Newark Liberty International to see if this might not be the case.   Yesterday the Sunday the 3rd was a day of heavy chemtrail spraying over Union County which I have documented on film.  Unfortunately I did not take any photos of the orb since I was too engrossed in watching the object move slowly across the sky as I was documenting the cloud anomalies from the chemtrails. The orb passed out of view and then I could no longer see it as it seemed to just vanish in its journey south.  The other time I saw this orange orb-like object last year the same thing occurred as it was there and then seemed to vanish out of sight, although it was floating much higher in the sky then.

In hamilton there is a street called burlington street which goes straight towards the lake, so you can see a full view of lake ontario while you are driving, i drive this was every morning around 7:30 - 7:45ish. My first sighting happened about 3 months ago, when me and my friend were driving down burlington street at 7:45, there was clouds covering the lower part of the lake, but it was a bright sky above the clouds, now all these sightings have happen while i was driving, so we only caught glimplses of them. all of a sudden we saw something shot through the clouds and into the sky, leaving behind a straight line in the clouds. we thought it was really weird.. the second sighting happen at the same time 7:45 while were driving on burlington street again, it was a clear sky, and we saw just a little swiggle in the sky, and it was not moving just sitting there, and i have seen video of the exact same sighting before, it was very weird. But todays sighting topped everything, as we were again driving down burlington street, looking at the view of the lake.. i thought i saw a bird glidding into the wind, but then i relized, it wasnt moving, me and my buddy started to take a closer look, it was a craft!! hovering over the lake, in a disk shaped form!! just sitting there watching all the cars going by on the highway. i know what i saw and it was for sure a disk.

They then vanished into the clouds, when they reappeard about 2-3 sec later they were in a steep vertical climb. They then leveled out and performed in tandem a bank to their starboard side, once again disappearing into the clouds it was very overcast the sky was so dark it almost looked and bluish gray this also made the crafts more visible. The crafts reappeared 2-3sec later again but this time considerably lower in altitude and were abreast of each other equally spaced and were in a port bank, after leveling out they broke off into a group of two and three with the two intrail and about 1 mile behind the other three. the crafts re-entered the clouds and when they reappeared they were lined up vertically one on top of the other equally spaced and hovered in this for about 15-20 sec. The higher craft then dropped down vertically ( No Gradual Descent ) and spaced out equally next to what would have been the ""base"" craft for the vertical formation and were now all horizontal. the craft regrouped into the ""two"" and ""three"" formation heading northwest they ""three"" formation was intrail this time with the ""two"" leading they were abreast of each other one from the outer right side slid up under the starboard side of the outer most craft of the ""two"" formation. the two craft in the rear now climbed slightly above the leading ""three"" but kept their vertical and Horizontal separation the craft were all spaced at equal distance. I observed no ""nav "", beacon , or strobe lights on these Aircraft, nor was there any sound accompanying them. The shape of the crafts' could be compared to that of a stingray except the nose and leading edges were smoothly arched and melded into one with pointed tips going to the rear of the craft along the leading edges of the ""wings"". and from the rear of the craft protrouded a long narrow tail which was thick starting and the base of the craft and thinned out the further back it went making a smooth narrow tip at the end, the undersides of the fuselage were a dark gray almost black color.

My daughter who was about 13 then, said flying object Mom. My son who was  11 at that time, interrupted her and said you mean U.F.O.   I  asked him how  he could  tell that its not an airplane or something. He said, ‘cause it looks like a boomerang with orange lights., and it’s moving too slow for a plane. It had  5 big lights,  looked like headlights , but the one in the middle was white, and the other  4 were amber in color 2 on each side. It was very dark against the dim lit sky, you could see it was in a “V” shape and you could not see the sky between the lights . It was very large and looked to be as long as a football field  from wing tip to wing tip. We watched it all the way to our house , which was only a couple of minutes. We got out of our truck and watched it for at least  10 more minutes as it was moving towards Phoenix it looked to be right over Phoenix International Raceway going towards Sky Harbor International Airport. We could see the airplanes, coming  and going from the airport, and they were much  faster and higher up.

The craft displayed no visible lights, but were lit by background light from the city of Las Vegas.  The speed at which they operated seemed extremely slow by comparison to ""normal"" aircraft that I am familiar with, being an airline pilot. And there was complete silence.  Thier size was larger than any aircraft I had ever seen, appeared to be flying wings or triangles.  I would judge the altitude to be approximately seven to ten thousand feet.  I was so struck by the sight of this experience, I remained motionless and made no attempt to obtain binoculars or cameras.  Again, thier size was incredible as was thier total silence and lack of speed as they ""flew"" overhead.  I first thought that it was some refueling operation, but they were within just several miles of McCarran airport, in the airports controlled airspace.  The craft appeared to be black in color, and reflected just enough light that I could make out thier outlines.  The two craft continued in the formation described, to the west and then blended into the night.  No lights were observed, no sound what so ever, however, not trying to be dramatic, I ""felt"" thier presence, that is the reason I loked up.  At the time I was employed by Continental Airlines, and elected not to mention this experience to  anyone.  I am now retired, and I saw a piece on cable that referred to the ""Phoenix"" lights.

Exhibited non-ballistic motion. I was working third shift at a machine shop in Jeffersonville, Indiana.  Being the supervisor, I had plenty of free time.  I would often step outside and have a cigarette, especially in the summer.   All the machines were running well, and the operators had settled in for another long night.  I walked outside and lit up a smoke, watching the U.P.S jets line up for approach into Louisville International Airport.  There were several jets in line for their approach, as well as a few others orbiting, waiting for their turn.  I can’t remember the exact number, but I would estimate at least 10. I watched this for a few minutes, and lost interest.  I walked around the parking lot for a few minutes enjoying the night air.  When I noticed that all the jets were gone.  I know they didn’t all have time to land.  I thought this was quite strange, and began scanning the skies.  I noticed a very bright, deep red colored, pulsating light.  This light was so bright, that it appeared to ray, like the bright landing lights on aircraft.  The only difference being the color.  And I say it pulsated not blinked, because it only dimmed, it never blinked off and on.  When I first saw it, it was in the sky to the northwest.  The color got my attention, but the erratic movement kept me interested.  It’s the strangest thing I have ever seen.  As the object brightened it would move forward or backward, and as it dimmed it became stationary.  The timing between pulses was approximately 1 second. After watching this for at least a minute, it was slowly making it’s way in my direction.  I had to get a second opinion on this, so I ran inside the shop and yelled for someone to come outside and see this light in the sky.  I ran back outside thinking it would be gone for sure, but it was still there.  And it was a lot closer than when I left. My brother, who was working for me at the time, came outside wondering what the hell I was talking about.  I didn’t even have to point, he immediately saw the object and made a remark along the lines of, ((deleted)).  I asked him if he could hear anything, to which he replied that he couldn’t.  This thing was nearly overhead and didn’t make a sound.  He also noticed the way it would move as it pulsed brighter, and stop as it dimmed.  We both watched this thing for several more minutes, and I wanted to see if my father was awake.  He had a pretty good digital camera, and I hoped he could get a picture, so I ran back inside a second time to call him.  I finally got an answer, and I know I sounded a little excited over the phone.  Explaining what I had just witnessed took another minute or two.  On the way back outside this time, I was positive that this thing would not be there.  But, when I got to the parking lot, it was still there.  There were no other aircraft in the sky this entire time.  The light slowly made it’s way almost directly over the building, when it suddenly released a round object from it’s underside.  We both gasped at seeing this, it was unbelievable!  The round object that was released had no light, but the main object’s bright light reflecting from it betrayed it’s presence.  At this very instant both objects disappeared.  And no longer than 10 seconds after that, a military jet, (an F-4 Phantom I would guess by the twin engines) flew right through the same spot this object had just occupied.  It was loud, and he was definitely looking for the object, because he dipped his wings left and right.  The jet turned around and left in the same direction he came from.  We both watched the skies for 15 minutes, and noticed the jetliners starting to line up again.  I didn’t know who to report this to, and I am convinced that, air traffic controllers caught this object on radar. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

If it would descend, the flaps would cover them up.  The top side of the craft (not very visible to me) looked to be a half sphere. The craft's body was a black/dark purple shade.

If someone can tell me what it is I'd be grateful. In the 70's I had lived in a house in the St George section of Staten Island. It was a lovely old place, on a bluff overlooking New York Harbor. I moved from there in 1975 and the house, along with the rest of the block, was torn down in the late '70's. On my birthday in 1997 I went by myself on a sort of pilgrimage to the site. The block had been turned into a parking lot and by 1997 the lot was not even being used. It was mid afternoon, sunny, I was sitting on a log on the site just looking out over the harbor. I saw a commercial jet coming up the harbor to my right and to my left I caught sight of a flock of seagulls. AND right behind the seagulls was a metallic cylinder, I'd say about 10 feet long and maybe a foot round? ( I'm not sure how to describe the measurements). If I had to guess it was moving at about 100 MPH. The sun was gleaming off the metallic surface. It was moving in a straight line at a steady speed going from Bayonne towards Brooklyn. I just watched it, fascinated. It flew UNDER the commercial jet so it could not have been too high up. Commercial Jets going up the Hudson are in their final descent to LaGuardia, so the jet couldn't have been more than 3000 feet up? And this cylinder thing flew under it. I watched the cylinder continue a on a steady path until it disappeared in the distance as it was heading toward Coney Island. I saw what I think was a UFO 30 years earlier and hadn't seen anything else before this happened, or since for that matter. The thing looked so everyday, so matter of fact that at first I didn't realize it was anything unusual. I've told a few people about it over the years, but I've always wondered what did I see?...If anyone has seen this thing or knows what it is I'd love to find out... For whatever it's worth I just noticed the boxes the boxes about being contacted by an investigator. I have no problem with that, however I don't think I can add anything more than what I've just written. Thanks",2008-02-14T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

The object appeared to be a bright star/light and would change colors from red, white and greenish blue. This was a very fast color change that took place. If you had blinked you would have almost missed it .  The object had appreard to sit idle for sometime in the sky as if were waiting for direction . While sitting idle hoovering in the western sky over the gulf of mexico, it would dim and then just about fade out completely and then become super brilliant in color , always maintaining a star/light like shape or visual appearance to the naked eye. Its movements were not what one would think an airplane could do almost zig zagged at times and seemed to disperse a very faint light like flare or a spark if you will , sent out in any direction.  After a few minutes I telephoned a friend who had witnessed the same type of star/light like object a week prior to what I was observing at the moment and had for the past 3 nights . I asked her to describe what her and her daughter had seen in the skys over Clearwater the week prior because I was watching an object that was very similiar in nature to what they had witnessed. (Clearwater is About 30 minutes from St.Petersburg.)  She described that same light pattern , Star/light like appearance of the object and the same idle and cruising pattern as I had observed and the movements of the object, we talked for almost ten minutes about the object as they searched the sky south west of their home for what  was being  described to them .  The object began to pick up speed and was out of my eye range in seconds (blocked by a ten story building) as it headed east north east over towards Tampa Bay .  Just then I spotted a second Star/light like object with the same pattern of lights, movement and flight path as the first. This object appeared out of no where just like the first had .  My friends couldnt see much due to the Clouds over their area. I wished them a good night and would keep them posted as to what was observed at night . I ended the call and researched on the pc about any sightings in this area or across the state of florida this month or the month prior . Your site had come up on the search and here is my post.  I observed a 3rd object just as typing this post was nearing an end . The object my friend had witnessed was reported to be in the AM some time around 4:30 am - 5:30 am .  The objects that were witnessed by myself appeared between 8:00pm - 9:00pm .  Hopefully others have seen these objects and will have similiar accounts to tell .

This made me stop and pull over at the intersection because as I was sitting waiting for the light, the object made two distinct 90* turn's while still in forward flight, in other word's, it was still maintaing it's forward speed in our direction but jumped to it's right without turning or making an arc, and the back to it's original position in the same manner. I stopped the car after rounding the corner and pulled off in the dirt, my son and daughter both opened their door's and looked up with me, at this point it came to a halt directly above us and hovered I would say between 2 and 3000 ft, the biggest difference the object and a helicopter was that aside from the serious lack of sound from this thing, was that as it hovered, it's movement's were likened to that of a plate with a string superglued to the middle on it's top and being spun by hand kind of gently as to give it a slight wobble, the light from our area of town was slighty lighting up the bottom of the craft so asid from the emmission's of it's own light we probaly could have seen it to some degree with it's light's off if we knew where to look, the shape of the object was as best as I can describe it was semi-rounded on it's forward direction but fasceted to some degree on the rear area, the object started heading by my reckoning to the south-east kind of heading down the valley, not fast at all but it would hold-up in a position for short period's of time while makin small directional change's within the are! a it was stopped in. The manerism's it had for making directional change's was the oddest part for me, if you have ever seen a radio controlled aircraft go through directional change's, it's kind of jerky and eratic, but still make's nearly 90*turn's, I contacted sacramento metropolitan airport but found no one who cared, oh well!!",2007-10-08T00:00:00,38.7082,-121.3299

Was just outside, around 10pm my time, having a smoke and looking up at the constellations. Watching for shooting stars and satelites like I always do. Out of the corner of my eye I notice 2 bright white lights that are sitting right over my head way up in the clear sky. They are a little ways apart, but definately sitting right next to eachother. My first thought was ""Why are there two super bright venus's right over my head tonight?"". I just wasn't comprehending what I was seeing. It shouldn't be there.  So, I am watching these two very bright stars that have never been there before for about 2 or 3 minutes when suddenly they start moving! They go north a bit. Then they stop. The one on the left stays put and the one on the right takes off! It goes North a bit more and then stops, winks out.. I'm thinking I'd lost track of it at this point. But no... it lights up with this brilliant white light, fades out for 4 or 5 seconds, travels and then positively pulsates with brilliant white light... goes out for 4 or 5 seconds, lights up again. It eventually gets too far north for me to see and I lose track of that one after about 2 more bright pulsations.  The one on the left is still hovering, after another 30 seconds or so it fades a little like it gained altitude, starts to move, and then... zip.. shoots off after the other one.  Neither object made any noise. As bright as they were I would have expected to hear something if it were any kind of conventional aircraft.  I am still trying to comprehend what it could have been. I was so awestruck.  I am an ex military wife and have done some government work. My husband is disabled and I am returning to college concentrating on the health information technology profession.  We live in the path of Salem airport and I am used to seeing air traffic and even some odd looking experimental type planes traveling north to south and back.  This was something I've never seen before. There were no planes within sight during the sighting.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,44.9901,-123.0262

The light is north of me, so I went and grabbed my binoculars.So once I had them and took a look I was and am still not sure what I saw. Very bright green then red then blue and white flashing lights. Now this sounds strange but I thought it changed shape from a small star shaped light to a triangle shaped light, all the while change colors.

Unsure if my eyes were playing tricks on me I asked my roommate who was sitting next to me if he thought the star was changing colors. He agreed that is was definitely flashing different colors. Being extremely high up it was hard to make out a definitive shape but it was flashing red blue green and white light. 	He reasoned that it could be a plane extremely high up and heading straight for us and that was why it looked like it wasn’t moving. However, after about half an hour of watching it continued to remain stationary. Also, agreeing that neither one of us had ever seen a plane that flashed that many color and in such rapid succession. The flashing most resemble the flashing of a police car if you added green and white into the mix. I looked at other stars to see if maybe there was moisture or something else in the air that could be causing the color changes however all the other stars, including ones near the UFO appeared normal not even showing much scintillation. 	I grabbed a pair of binoculars and peered at the object however they were to low power to help much. The colors and strobing was easier to make out with the binoculars but not much else. I took some pictures with my digital camera to see if it could give many any detail however it is to old and cannot zoom so it was of little use as well. In conclusion, we both agreed it was not a star however we cannot explain the multicolor strobing no why it remained stationary. The object was still in the sky when we retired to the house. 	Keep in mind that both my roommate and I always look for the most likely causes for this type of phenomenon but were not able to reason one on this night. It should be noted as well that neither one of us was on any king of drug or medication at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Oregon. My friend and I were hunting out in the desert about 100 miles south of Burns Junction, when just at dusk I saw what were extrememly large Chevron shaped amber/orange glowing lights all in sink, shaped into a ""V"" (but a horizontal V), approximatley 20 miles away and each one was about the size of the moon.  I yelled for my buddy to hur ry up and come look, and within that time, 2 of the lights, one by one, went out, then they came back on. Then a few minutes later, all of them went out.  About 10-15 seconds went by, and the 5 lights reappeared again, however, this time they were about 100 miles away and the lights looked about half the size of the moon.  Then they all disappeared at once and we never saw it again.  There was no sound whatsoever during any of this, and normally, with how close, we should have heard some type of sound from it, butbeing out in the middle of nowhere, you could hear very well, and we heard no sound at all from this aircraft.  We were extremely weirded out by it as we have NEVER in our lives seen anything remotely like this.  Even my buddy who is a retired Federal Agent - and neither of us feel this was any aircraft from here, unless some type of undisclosed govermental experiment as it was just too large and eary.  We are truly perplexed by this.  We got a little worried and decided we should pack up early and get out of the area and go home.

It was a typical Monday, I went to my regular state job which was between 7am to 4pm.  After that I went to my part time job.  There was nothing to my mind that was out of the ordinary.  It was a boring day at my regular job and slow at my part time job since there was hardly any customers.  After getting out of work I went to Target to buy a coke and Doritos flirted with the cashier and went on to the bus stop that takes me to the corner of Wickersham and Oltorf.  This area is at a high point and you can see the downtown area and it’s sky line.  There was a thunderstorm also moving in and was coloring the sky red then lightning would flash. As I was walking to my apartment I saw something flying over the downtown Austin area heading south.  I was standing in the middle of the side walk between Oltorf and the High Point Apartments looking at this thing because it was slowly making it’s way south and it was flying to low and too slow to be a plane.  When I thought it could be a blimp it flashed several colors of red, yellow, blue, in a multiple square formation.  A helicopter with one spot light was flying south and keeping it’s distance from the object.  I would say it flew above the Ben White HWY area and it was flying higher then the object I was looking at.  That was when it reversed it’s direction and headed north east.  (It did not make a U-turn).  I needed a witness but nobody was walking near by.  I called my sister via cel phone but did not answer.  Then at 8:55pm I called a co worker who was outside her house and told her to look south and she let out a big gasp she yelled, “what is that”!  She lives in north Austin.  We stayed on the phones looking at this thing.  As it moved back to the downtown area it moved around the downtown area and moved north east.  It then picked up speed and moved faster and out of my sight.  We stayed on the phone for a while more reveling at what we saw and then ended our call.  I told my roommate of what I saw.  He said he believed me and I told him if he were to come in that night and said he just saw what I just saw I would not believe him.  I am typing this because other people have come forward in the past on a web site called http://www.ufomaps.com/city/Austin My co-worker and the people who saying they saw the same thing I saw is more then I want to think about.  Why it was not in the news I do not know.  About an hour later my best friend called to talk about a possible hunting trip for December.  I did not talk about what I saw.  To me it is now the difference of living my regular way of life.  I do not do drugs, don't drink, nor was I on any medication.  I do not consider myself wanting any special attention from strangers.  I will never mention this to anybody even if the subject is about UFO’s. I do not know where to go from here.  I think UFO’s exist I just would never think I would ever see one myself.  This to me is just plain mind numbing.  I don’t want to think about, talk about, let alone write about what I saw that night.  This will go as far as I would want to go.

Upon further viewing I noticed that there was more than 1 light (8 or maybe 10) in a straight line formation going across the sky from East to West. The line was a series of dots (a bit like tracer bullets being fired). These were in a perfect straight line but for a moment the back 3 or 4 fish tailed up then went back into formation. They travelled faster than a jet and were uniformly spaced out. This is a legitimate sighting but I have no other proof. I asked my wife had she seen it but she put it down to a plane.

I have lived in Darrington most of my life, and I have to say that there are strange lights here all the time.  Just early this morning around 5 am I was out smoking and there was an unusually bright light above Gold Hill mountain, there seemed to be like rays of light coming from it and no sound and it would appear to get closer and then go farther up, I watched it for about 15 min and then went inside. I tried to take a picture, but it just showed up as a small line on the camera.  I read over the reports on here from the Arlington area and a lot of them say that it looks like the lights they see head towards Darrington. I have seen these same lights for years. They are bright lights that at first look like stars, but then they will start to move side to side, or up and down and then after a while they will just go up really fast and dissapear. I am not the only one who has seen this happen either.  One time this last Spring, my daughter and brother, and I were out in the yard at night and I saw this bright red light move slowly across the sky, it was big and bright and I have never seen anything like it before, I expected there to be a noise or a fire because it looked like the light went down in the mountains, then about 3 min later there were jets flying in the same direction.  The part that caught my attention about the reports in Arlington, WA is that more than one person has reported seeing jets following these lights, and in the last few years I have noticed the same. If you go out at night and watch, almost every clear night you can see these strange moving lights here, and a lot of times within minutes after seeing them there are jets flying in the same location, which I find very strange. Also I have to add that on none of these occasions of seeing these lights has there ever been any noise coming from them. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??

As I was staring out the windshield into the sky I noticed an  unusually bright light in the sky. The object looked like a star but appeared to be in the sky at or about the same level a plane would be. The object did not appear to be moving, so I immediately ruled out that it was a plane and it was also much to high to be a helicopter. After staring at it for a few minutes I noticed that the object actually had moved slightly in the sky and was no longer in the spot it was just a few minutes ago. The light appeared to be about 5 times in diameter bigger than the north star. When I zoomed in on it with a camera, I noticed that the object actually was not bright white but it was actually blinking other colors of light. Red, green, blue and yellow lights were blinking one at a time. But when you looked at it with the naked eye it appeared to be just bright yellow or white. After driving around for a short while I tried to figure out exactly where in the sky the object was. I estimated that it was somewhere between Brooklyn and Manhattan as I was staring at it from the eastern shores of Staten Island. Staring at it with the naked eye, the object looked like a white flair that was not moving in the sky. Just a very bright and close twinkling white star, but as I said when you zoomed in on it, it appeared to be blinking different colors. When my girlfriend attempted to take pictures of it, it would not appear on camera. For a split second we were able to zoom on it very well and see that it was actually a circular object. I have never seen anything like this in my life and I am wondering if any other people saw this object because it was in the sky for about 2 hours.

The object came into my peripheral vision from the right. I was standing facing due-north. At first I assumed it was a bird, but when I began visually observing it, it was obvious that it was wasn't, as it had a smooth, man-made appearance. Also, it was obvious that it was fairly far off and at a much higher altitude than one would expect to see a bird. This is especially true since in the region in which I live, during this time of the year there is little bird activity, especially at night.  The object appeared to be flying at an altitude of around 1500 feet and at an slightly oblique angle to me. It appeared not much smaller than a C130 at that altitude, but I could not make out a fuselage, etc., that one would expect to see on an aircraft.  The object moved rapidly, much faster than a helicopter - perhaps several hundred miles an hour. It appeared to bank to the left (north-west) as it passed in front of me. It was an extremely smooth banking turn and the full wing shape became quite visible at that time. As it reached full bank (object perpendicular to the ground), I lost sight as it passed behind a building. Due to the my angle of observation, that's the last I saw of it.  The object was gray in color. It blended well with the cloudless night sky (especially as effected by urban light pollution). There were no visible markings. Intriguingly, the object made no sound. At that distance, if it were an aircraft like a C130, one would have definitely heard the engine drone clearly. Also, there was no jet sound as one would expect to hear from a jet flying so close. I thought that, as in the case of an A-10, I might hear the sound after the craft had passed overhead. I heard no sounds.  The flight characteristics exhibited seemed to indicate it was an aircraft. But as previously stated, it lacked a fuselage, any markings and was completely blacked-out. There were no lights of any kind visible. Furthermore, the object left no contrail. I  am, as one might expect, fascinated by what I saw. But I certainly cannot explain it. Though it exhibited some aircraft flight characteristics, I could not identify it as any aircraft I've ever seen (in person or through research).",2007-11-28T00:00:00,41.68120227272727,-86.86613181818181

I tend to think that this was a man made object - I do not believe in UFOs. I could have dismissed this as some kind of balloon - except that something struck me odd. This was some kind of oval shaped object - perhaps the closest thing I can think of is football (american). No visible things protruding outside the eliptical, oval shell shape. I can't remember the color, but I think it was sort of greyish. This thing was so benign and innocent that you would see it but would not even notice it. So naturally fitting in the sky.  I realized that there were three things odd - (1) it was high in the sky must be roughly somewhere between 1000 ft to 10000 ft - a plane flew from San Jose airport and its size and height was of the comparable order. So, I thought it perhaps is not a balloon as I have not seen balloons of  plane sizes.  (2) It was moving at an incredible thing. It did not look like any object having an engine - no audible noise, no smoke trail, and it was sort of gliding - something like an orphan kite. But it was going from west to east, and speed seemed 10 times faster than a jet. It cleared the whole sky in my view in less than 15 seconds, while I think a plane would have taken at least 2 minues or so. (3) towards the end it was so far that I would have lost it anyway but then it sort of started gaining altitude. Significant gain in about a couple of seconds. If it was not for logically thinking about these things, I would have completely ignored and not even remembered about this.  I was with my Dad. As I felt something odd about this object, I pointed it to my dad. He saw this as well. I pointed to him my logical inconsistency of speed - he seemed to agree. We were in Great America Parkway waiting for the fireworks when this happened. Time must be between 8:00 to 8:30pm. There must be a few thousand people right there looking into the sky. I did not talk to any one, but I was hoping that someone else saw it. I surfed web to see any information, tried to dismiss it as some sort of balloon. But could not find any conclussive evidence either way. Nor did find any one else mentioning this. So I decided to report it. If there are more people who saw this and can conclussively identify this as man made object, I would be thankful. This would solve the puzzle and satisfy my curiosity.  Please note that I am not an expert on aircrafts, balloons, natural phenomenon, or any other such things that could explain many of the so called UFO sightings. I know this, it was no optical illusion as it was a solid object. It was not any of the usual kind aircraft with wings etc.. as this object had nothing protruding out of its shell.

(this was shortly after sunset, & the sky was just getting dark) I saw a Red ""fireball"" that got my attention, which was similar to a flare being fired.  I went outside a few minutes later to look in the sky & see if any of my neighbors might be shooting fireworks or flares... there were no other ""fireballs"" that followed.  I kept watching the sky, and was looking at the ""Big Dipper"". (Which is almost perpendicular to the land horizon this time of year) At 8:45PM I saw a thick, white, ""flash/streak"" of light ""shoot"" through the center of the ""cup"" of the Dipper.  It came in from behind the ""handle"" & traveled between the 4 stars that make up the ""cup""..... (Megrez, Phecda, Merak, & Dubhe.)  It was a perfectly centered path through the cup, & was 1/2 the width, or thickness of it. (If you were to scale the cup of the Big Dipper at let's say, 4 inches deep, the ""flash/streak"" would be 2 inches thick, by 4-6 inches long, & split the center perfectly, leaving an inch on both sides.)  The ""object""/flash/ was not a bright streak like a meteor, but was more of a ""beam"", or ""pulse"". It was faint but clearly visible.  I'd say the brightness could be compared to the glow of the Milky Way on a good clear night.  It was a quick pulse, lasting about a second or just under, & then was gone.  It reminded me of the ""flash"" & ""beam/contrails"" of the 1991 Space Shuttle Discovery Video ""STS 48"" ..... ...where an ""object"" is seen coming over Earth's horizon moving in a straight direction..... & then in the lower left corner of the screen a noticeable ""Flash"" occurs, which causes the ""object"" (along with a couple others) to suddenly change directions at a 90 degree angle & accelerate outward away from Earth.  Immediately following the mysterious flash, there are 2 ""beams/pulses/contrails"" that are visible speeding toward the direction of the main object that rose up over the Earth horizon.  The ""Flash/Pulse"" I saw go through the Big Dipper, was very similar to the ones that appear to be ""fired"" at the mystery object in the STS 48 Video.  This was unlike any other ""UFO"" sightings I've seen, & don't feel that it was a craft of any sort.... but then again, I just don't know.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,35.7174,-86.8926

PD)) More luminous objects sighted in night sky Following up my two previous reports (for 5/25/06 and 5/26/06), here is my report for the morning of Monday, May 29th. I was not able to make observations for Saturday or Sunday mornings as I was out of town. In terms of numbers, this was the least eventful night so far, but it was the subject of perhaps the most dramatic sightings.  I started observing at 0058. The sky was almost totally clear at first, but clouds became thicker as the night went on. The following are the particulars of the objects sighted.  1) 0102 - object seen moving from southeast to northwest. It was moving slightly faster than a passenger aircraft as seen at 36,000 feet. It was visible for just under 2 minutes, from first appearance to flying towards my direction and out of sight.  2) 0122 - object suddenly appeared in the southern sky (as if a light had been turned on), then moved extremely fast to the east before disappearing (as if the light had then been turned off). There was no cloud obstruction, it was low in altitude, and had an angle of elevation of 30 degrees. It was approximately 1 magnitude dimmer than Sirius, and travelled a horizontal distance of the tip of my thumb to my wrist held at arm's length in just under a second. Its light was a quick movement of light, similar to taking a flashlight and moving in front of you from one side to the other as fast as you can. It was not a lasting streak (a line) like a meteor or flare. Like all previous objects, it had no other lights other than its white light body.  3) 0138 - object seen moving from south to north. It was very faint, and moved with a slow, stop-start motion, like a person trying to walk in sludge. It disappeared overhead to my left after about 1 minute.  4) 0216 - object seen moving from southeast to northwest. It was very similar to the previous object, very faint and with a jerky type of motion.  5) 0225 - object streaked across the sky from east to west at incredible speed. It had an angle of elevation of about 45 degrees, and, like object #2 from tonight, was at a lower altitude than the others. It was 1 magnitude brighter than Sirius, with its light characteristics similar to object #2 as well, i.e. it was a quick movement of light and not a lasting streak line. I got the sense that it was closer in distance to me than any of the other objects seen over my 3 nights of observations.  6) 0234 - object seen moving from south to north. Its movement was slower than the other objects seen tonight; I would almost call it graceful. It was about the same speed as a passenger aircraft as seen at 36,000 feet.  7) 0238 - object seen moving from northwest to southeast. Like objects #3 and #4, it had a slow, stop-start type of motion.  8) 0240 – a conventional aircraft was seen and heard moving from west to east. It had an angle of elevation of about 45 degrees, and an altitude of, I would estimate, 10,000 feet. It had a setup of lights consisting of a white anti-collision light on the underside of its fuselage and 2 red position lights on each wing. The blinking of the lights was very unusual to me - it is best described as imagining an object bouncing through the lights from one end to the other; it was an alternating fashion of blinking which I am not familiar with. As mentioned in my previous reports, aircraft (apart from fighter jets and other two-seater military training aircraft) are very uncommon here.  9) 0258 - object seen moving from south to north. It was very dim, but did not have the peculiar movement of the three previous dim objects. It passed straight over my head and out of sight after about 1 minute.  I stopped observing at 0320. This was another eventful evening that, once again, at times left me speechless. I am planning to contact the local air force base later today to see if I can glean anything from them.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,,

That car had 2 occupants (male and female, I believe).  Off to the right ride of the Interstate, there were some hills a few hundred meters away. A bright white-yellow light became apparent over the hills in my peripheral vision. I turned to watch the light, moving much faster than my car (70mph) and at least 200 meters away. It was traveling in a mostly S direction (the same as my car), streaking down in a 30-40 degree angle, and fast approaching the hills. At first I thought it was a crashing plane, but the speed and the angle of the motion resembled no plane that I have ever seen. The trajectory was completely smooth. The size of the light was far too big to be a shooting star. As it approached the hills, the light's speed slowed dramatically. Then the light disappeared completely, perhaps falling below the hills.  After the light disappeared, I slowed my car down considerably to study the hills. There was no smoke, no sound, nothing. The other car traveling near me slowed down as well. We were both going between 30 and 40 mph. I looked into the front of the other car and the two occupants were both looking towards the hills as well. I felt that they had seen the light as well and were also trying to make sense of it.

I was watching Reverend Horton Heat at the Austin City Limits music festival on this Friday night.  It was at least half way through the show so it must have been about 8:15-8:30.  I can't remember why but for some reason I glanced over toward one of the main stages to the west of where I was.  I saw it about 20 degrees over the horizon and about 30 degrees to the north of the sliver of the moon.  I saw a flashing light and a steady dimmer light.  At first I thought was a helicopter since a police helicopter had flown over the festival several time that night.  If it was a helicopter I would guess it at about 3 or 4 miles away based on the separation and brightness of the lights.  Then it did something that freaked me out.  Suddenly a huge triangular pattern of big bright green lights began flashing very rapidly.  No two lights seemed to flash in sync, it was just wild random flashing of too many lights to count.  The lights were all on the parameter of the triangle pattern with none in the middle.  The weird thing was that if it was a helicopter putting on a light show, then the lighting attachments would have to have been at least the size of a football field or two.  Compared to the distant object I thought I'd seen a second before the triangle light display was enormous.  The light display continued for about 10 seconds as I stared in disbelief trying to figure out what the heck it was.  Just as I started to get the attention of my friend the light show stopped.  I was left explaining to him that the tiny flashing light that he couldn't hardly make out from the other distant aircraft in the sky had just put on a massive light show as if it was right over the festival.  It continued to fade into the distance until I couldn't make it out any more.  I'm ready to accept that this was a human aircraft putting on a lighting display.  The only thing that doesn't make sense to me is the brightness and sure size of the triangular green light display compared to the other lights.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

The first formation looked like a horoscope constellation and then they formed a square with three dots below.  I counted what appeared to be a total of eleven metallic gray crafts biding time playfully in the sky.  The bright light look just sort of changed to actual craft-disc appearance.

I looked at my cell phone and I think that was the date I saw. There was a main, large UFO that was  just above the tree line across the lake we were on. Three of us were on the dock of my friend's parents lake house. We were drinking alchohol but we were winding down and quietly chattering under the cover of my friend's dock. I noticed an object out of the corner of my eye reflecting across the lake almost like how the moon does. This was not the moon. It was seemingly hovering, almost bouncing very quickly, so quickly it was kind of blurry. But while it was bouncing the object was moving from left to right and up and down but staying around the same spot. It was a round bright blue ball of light. It did not make a sound. Later on it changed colors,we all agreed on that. It turned a lighter bright and not so blueish but more white, but at the top it looked kind of green.I could see the stars in the background and that was how we determined it was moving. There was no air traffic that we could see. No airplanes. The whole lake, as far as we could tell, was out. It was dark everywhere and there was not a light on anywhere. It was cold. We sat and watched it for a long time. After a while we began to see other objects in the sky moving around and then stopping. They looked like stars. As the main object started to slowly shift little by little higher up in the sky these small star looking things moved with it. It would move then stop then on of them would move then stop then the one below it would move then stop. We also saw these object moving sideways across the sky it got brighter to bright then it dimmed to out of sight completely. My friend says he saw something I must of missed. He says he saw something that looked like a star, I think, drop out of the ball of light and move across the sky. The other person who was with us was a friend of my friend and she saw everything we did. She pointed out the smaller objects mov! ing in p attern ever so slightly with the big ball of light. The UFO moved around but stayed above the treeline until after about an hour then started to shift upward with the smaller objects. It seemed like what ever this was, was trying to make anyone who might be watching them think they were stars, I guess, moving with the rotation of the earth. But I saw the stars in the background while this thing moved around side to side, up and down, and bouncing so fast it was blurry. There are only so many things you typically see in the sky at night which is the moon, the stars, shooting stars, which we saw earlier, airplanes(military or not), and helicopters. This didn't make a sound, but it was clearly moving as far as we could tell. One of my friends are licensed to work on planes and they viamently agree with me about what we saw. Even more so. It was absolutely unidentifiable and in the sky. We watched it along with the 2 smaller star like objects go up into the sky slowly and then slow down to a stop. Completely still. We also started seeing airplanes blinking red and white in the sky. We started seeing the planes between 5 and 5:30 a.m. We went inside the house to sleep around 6:15. By this time we very cold,tired,hungry and got sick of watching it. In retrospect I guess we should of tried to keep watching but we were bored with it. All the factors I mentioned attributed to us going in. In all this time we didn't leave the dock to go wake anybody in the house up until we went in to sleep and we didn't attempt to photograph at all. We just watched. I stopped drinking when I first saw it, I can't remember if they did or not. I haven't seen a point in reporting until now. I feel kind of obligated to report it. My sighting has made me a believer. I didn't and don't think anyone would believe us because we were drinking. But it was a sobering sight. I can't speak for my friends. But we all do agree that we saw something very unusual and it wasn't an airplane or a helicopter or like anything any of us has ever seen.I have not told them I've made this report but I'm going to tell my friend next time I talk to him.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,34.4534,-83.2018

It was a light in the sky. It moved and changed directions extremely fast and then disappeared. I only saw it for a couple of seconds. The next morning I went outside to go get breakfast and looked in the sky to see a shiny object that appeared to be wobbling. It was hard to make out the shape but everytime it wobbled the sun would reflect off of it differently. It quickly disappeared while I was looking at it for about 1 minute. Later that day (the 1st of oct.) I was staring in the sky outside of my window when I saw airplane fly by. In the opposite direction of the plane was a ball moving through the sky. It was clearly a ball and I thought it was going to hit the plane but it didn't. It then disappeared out my vision from the window. When I went out side to take a look it was gone. I look out in the sky almost daily for UFO activity and know that Albuquerque doesn't have many spottings. I don't think it is a coincidence that I saw three here in that one weekend as well as many other people. I tried to get pictures but they didn't come out well.

As I was sitting in my hot tub last night the sky was extremely clear.  I looked up at Pleiades and then straight down to the Belt of Orion.  What I saw right between the two was a giant triangle consisting of what looked like 5 stars.  The thing was about 2/3 the size of the dipper [not counting the handle].  In all the years I have been looking at the stars I do not remember ever seeing a triangle in this area of the sky.  I have even taken college level astronomy and no mention was ever made about this.   I can running back in the house and looked up the sky charts in the Night Watch book by Terence Dickinson.  No triangle is suppossed to be there.  There are 3 star triangles in other areas of the sky but no 5 star triangle under the Pleiades.  What made it even stranger is that as the earth rotated, the triangle did not match the speed and location of the other stars.  Sometimes it looked to be out in front of the Pleiades, and sometimes in line with it.  Then again sometimes it appeared to be moving straight and other times tilted upwards.   The sky was very clear and maybe this thing is supposed to be there but it is a first for me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I rolled down my window to hear the engine thinking that would help me figure out what it was and there was no sound of any engine, but the object was close enough and low enough that an engine should have been heard.

The object stayed stationary for about a minute, continued towards downtown LA, then paused again and continued without any visible lights.

Nothing I know of makes color shifts like that all within one second.  After fifteen minutes I called my neighbors and they saw it too.   At 22:25 EST it became unviewable as clouds came by.  I checked again at 22:55 and the sky was clear but it was gone. I am an ex military aviator and a good photographer and think this was an unusual long term sighting which lasted almost an hour.

We cannot be certain that this is intended as a serious report.  PD)) I saw several flying lights heading from north to south It was around 22:00 hrs on May 1, 2007, I saw through the window of a bedroom on the second floor of my house an intense light in the air at a half-mile distance. The light was so intense by far several times the light of any star. The object was also a short distance from the surface of the ground. The light went up straight vertically, diminished its intensity and moved to the left from north to south and disappeared.  Since the local fire station is located in that direction and about the same distance I thought that the object might be a helicopter, however I was curious and decided to investigate some more. Immediately I grabbed my car and went to the fire station to see what was going on. My sister was with me in my car. When we reached the fire station, one of the garage doors was open and the truck was in there and nobody around. We passed the fire station when I saw the light again, this time farther out to the right of the road heading from north to south.  I decided to drive in its direction to get closer and make sure it was a helicopter. The light disappeared when I entered one of the streets on the right. We went out of those streets and went back to the road heading east for about two minutes when we saw the light again this time it was to our left like a half mile away and in the air. I don’t think it was the same object since the previous one we saw disappeared to the right of the road and this last one appeared on the left of the road heading from north to south. The flying object crossed in front of us from the left to the right of the road and dissappeared going from north to south. We tried to follow it, making a right in an intersection where was about to the point the object disappeared but we couldn’t see it. Then, we started to head back home going from south to north for about two more minutes when I saw again another light in the air. It looked like an helicopter in the distance because of its movement. It was flying slowly from north to south relatively close to the ground, so I was sure it couldn’t be a plane. Its light was not intense. I reached an intersection and stopped because of a red light of a traffic light, while the object was heading to from North to South while I was facing South to North. The object was coming to my direction in the air. At that moment I remembered I had binoculars in the glove compartment of my car and I grabbed them and give them to my sister, it turns out that! she did n’t know how to use them. Since the car was stopped she pulled down the window and took her head out and looked up and saw the lights of the object and introduced her head back into the car. I immediately took the binoculars out of her and pulled down the window of my side and took my head out of the car completely and used the binoculars to see the object. At that moment the object was right on my head a short distance from the ground, probably a four or five-block distance from the ground. I looked at the object using the binoculars and saw the chasis of a spaceship, the shape was triangular and flat. It had lights on the base, but those lights were not intense at all, but they shined enough to light the base of the chasis and I could saw the frame of the spaceship clearly,  not only the frame but all the flat metal part of the space ship which was lighted by the round light sources on the chasis. Those lights were no intense at all. They were just lighted spots one next to the other one covering almost the total area of the triangular chasis. I had never seen anything like that before in my whole life.  Since I was stopped by the red light I did all these things very quickly and only could see the bottom part or chasis of the flying object for a quick second. But because it was flying slowly close to the ground and I was using binoculars I could see it clearly. Also I realized that it did not make any sound. It was just flying slowly and quietly. When the traffic light changed to green I decided to follow the flying object to see it again, but U-turns were forbidden at that intersection and I had to turn to the left. While driving in the new road I stopped in the middle part of the road between the lanes and made a U turn and in the same interception where I saw the object I made a right turn to head in the same direction the flying object was flying but I could not see it anymore. Then we returned home. I particularly do not think these lights belonged to the same flying object, since all of them were moving from north to  south, I actually see in total four flying lights heading each time from north to south, but only in the last one I could see it using my binoculars and determine that it was not a helicopter or any plane.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,39.14072038404727,-77.20584416543575

After he picked me up, we drove to a spot in west Davis, off of a road surrounded by empty fields, somewhere to get away from the city lights.  We really were not that far out, maybe half a mile to a mile from decently lighted areas, but it was the best we could find on the spot.  We arrived at the scene, just off of a two way road at about 10:30 PM.  After spending about 10-15 minutes setting up the telescope, we quickly were able to find and focus in on the moon.  The view was very clean and clear, filling most of the viewfinder. After enjoying the moon for a few minutes, we decided to search for stars.  We turned the telescope the other way, facing north-west.  As my friend tried to focus in on a star at about 10:50 or earlier, I noticed a orange-blue/green light that seemed to be phasing from colored to not visible, or in and out of light, about every 1-2 seconds.  It was brighter than a star, and seemed to be at airplane altitude.  I could not tell how far away it was.  For this reason, I quickly dismissed it as an airplane.  As my friend continued to search for a star for a bit, I tried to figure out the light again.  By this time, the light had not significantly moved in any direction, and appeared stationary to me.  The light was still phasing.  I told my friend to stop bothering with the telescope, and to just look at the light with his naked eye.  We began discussing what it could be.  By now we had both agreed that it was not an airplane because it was not moving significantly, and that it was not a star, because it was a phasing orange blue light.  I had him focus in on it with the telescope.  It didn’t take long before we found it, and it appeared to look like a ball of orange with a blue aura around the edges.  Also, it seemed to change colors between orange and blue/green  The image was probably less than half the size of what the moon looked on the same telescope, from the same spot.  The oddest part of the object was that the insides of the ball seemed to have little dots and random patterns in them.  When I first noticed, I was instantly reminded of biology videos you see in school, with the cells being looked at from under a microscope with the little dots inside the cells moving around.  It was all very odd.  We could see the ball seemed to change colors from orange to blue/green and combinations of orange/blue.  Both me, and my friend were very confused and didn’t understand what it could be.  We also noticed with our naked eyes that the light seemed to be moving a bit.  We were pretty sure that it was not an eye trick, but the object seemed to move side to side.  After about 10-15 minutes of watching the object, it began to slowly disappear in a short span of about 10 seconds.  As it continued to phase, it slowly became dimmer, and was gone.  It might have been that the light got further away from us, or that it just stopped being visible.  We did not know what the case was.  This was at 11:06 PM.  At 11:14 PM, we saw another light with similar characteristics to the first one, however, it was much closer to the horizon, and must have been at a much farther distance, because the light was very small compared to the old one.  The light appeared to have a more orange/red color and had much more slight back and forth wavy motions to it.  Even under the telescope, the light was a spec compared to the other light.  If I had to guess, I would say it was about 1/8th of the size of the other light that we had through the telescope just minutes before.  We could not see any of the cell type characteristics on the telescope, because the light was just a tiny orange colored dot on it.  We were not sure if this light had any correlation to the previous one, but we did not rule it out, because this one had appeared to us out of nowhere.  At about 11:26, we noticed the light was getting dimmer, until after about 20 seconds we could not see the light anymore.  We might have dismissed these lights as something random, but after seeing the craters on the moon so clearly, then seeing the ball of light behaving so oddly and appearing so different, we knew it was not something wrong with our eyes or the telescope.  Something was definitely different here, but what it was, we don’t know.  Please feel free to contact me, I am very curious as to what this might have been.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,38.485225,-121.64357625

Initially, I believed it to be the sun reflecting off a plane but noticed that the object had a very short tail (diagonally down to the right-hand side).  The tail was not long enough to be a shooting star or a high flying jet plane and the object appeared to be motionless and not streaming across the sky.  I lost track of the object soon after spotting it under cloud cover over some large chimney stacks.  I tried to take a photo of the object using my phone (5mp - pretty good) but after clicking the button repeatedly the camera would not come on.  As soon as the cloud cover came over, one click and the camera switch on.  This spooked me a little bit!  Pulling out of Didcott Station I then saw a dark coloured helicopter (not a traffic or police helicopter) fly over the train from right to left and head in the direction that I spotted the bright object.",2008-07-05T00:00:00,,

I don’t know really what to say and I am a little bit hesitant to send anything, but I think this may be better than calling the police and asking if anybody else saw anything and then people think I‘m crazy.  I live in northern Indiana in a town between South Bend and Elkhart.  Although it is close to town we live in an area where there is not a lot of city light, or other things like that.  The night sky is very clear and visible every evening, obviously unless it is cloudy, but anyways.  My background is that I have a small computer business, married, have two little boys a degree in computer science and am an amateur pilot who flies a lot in a Cessna 172 that my father-in-law owns, so I’m not sure that I believe in UFO’s or anything like that, but I know I have never seen anything like what I saw last night. I was outside watering flower pots at approx. 22:00, so it was completely dark.  There wasn't anyone outside but me and it was completely quiet except for crickets and birds, etc.  I happened to just be looking over at my neighbor’s deck which was in a south-west direction from where I was standing.  I saw a reddish-orange oval float up over the top of the trees.  We have many very large old trees in our area, so I am guessing the oval was between 75-100 feet off the ground because of the distance it looked to be above the treetops.  It looked almost like there was a candle in the middle of it, but it did not flicker about 20-30 yards away.  It hovered for a few seconds then started moving slowly to the east.  It didn’t look to be that large, but I couldn’t really tell about the size of it because I wasn’t sure how close it was or its size because of the glowing kind of haze around it. The object moved very slowly but steadily for a little ways and I thought it might be a balloon, but there was some variable light winds and it was not bouncing around at all, so I kind of dismissed that.  It also seemed to be moving in too straight a direction to be a balloon, but I don’t know.  It was also strange and it might be paranoia, but I was sure that when it passed over the thick area of trees behind my neighbors home (that was only about 20 yards from where I was standing) that all of the noises of crickets and bugs and birds completely stopped.  You can always here the bugs and birds and other animals, day and night in our back yards because there are lots of trees and a large ravine behind our houses, so there are lots of animals, bugs, birds, etc.  The object then seemed to pick up speed as it moved to the east and I could see the light and shape very clearly for a another minute or so at least.  There was a full or mostly full moon in the background so the object stood out even more.  It then just disappeared from view completely after that and that was the end of it.  I’m kind of confused and not sure what it was, but maybe someone else saw something or knows what it was, but it wasn’t anything I have ever seen before.

On Tuesday, it was reported that Leonie Ras, the administrative manager of Lephalale saw a strange object fall to the ground at about 04:33 on her daughter's farm east of the town.  She was lying in bed checking her SMS messages when she heard a noise ""like an Airbus aircraft firing up its motors"".  There was no thunder or lightning and the noise grew louder, eventually sounding like a million turbines screaming in unison, said Ras.  She walked to the bedroom window and saw the clouds taking on a bright orange-red colour.  She described the object as a bright object that ""plunged from the clouds to the earth, at a terrible speed, and hit the ground with an almighty bang.""  It looked like Haley's comet, ""round in the front and with an orange-red tail following behind"".  On Wednesday, the Lephalale police station reportedly received numerous enquiries following the incident.  But the area was vast and there was no way of knowing where to start looking, said Superintendent Wessel Geldenhuys.  He added that the object could have fallen in Botswana, which is situated about 45km away.  Geldenhuys said that Ras's neighbour had also seen the UFO, but that so far, no one else had seen the object or had any idea where it was.

At first I thought I was crazy but then I quickly asked my mom if she saw that thing, and she told me that she did and she was just as amazed by it as I was.  Well I saw the english version of the parade on channel 5 and the didn't catch on theyre channel. So maybe if you can get the recording from the parade on the channel 34 los angeles i think you will definitely catch it to. call me back I would really like to see you investigate this thing.

One evening in december of 2007 about 8:00 pm. my husband,two children and i were driving in town to the bank. We were traveling north. Now we are turning left at the light. I look up in the sky to my right and see an orange red glow. As I'm telling everyone to look all of us except my youngest which is four, see the one red orange glow.  At first we were thinking maybe a plane blew up or a star fell from the sky. Then right after seeing the first glow, we see four or five other round orange, reddish glows below it and slightly to the east.  It was one glow and stayed glowed until the other four or five lit ,but they either had just appeared or lit up at the same time. They were not in a circular formation. They were in more of almost a straight line curving slightly east with the last two even more so to the east.  From the distance they seemed to be the size of a basketball.  They stayed in one spot and glowing for no more than 10 seconds,it was just enough time to get a good look and then there was no glows..so we assumed they were gone.    At this point we are all looking at each other saying we never saw this before.  After going through the drive thru teller as we are leaving we all look up across the street hoping we see this again so we can take a picture with our camera phone.  We are further west now than what we were but only about three blocks down the street.  About two or three minutes later now leaving the bank we are starting to traveling east and my husband, oldest and self start yelling at the same time look their they are again.  It was the same thing pretty much the same formation as before.  They stayed in one spot with the same glow.  Again they did not stay long.  Its like the glows were there and gone.  I didn't get a picture. It probably would not have came out good on a cell phone but I would have like to have tried.  You could clearly see they had moved, in the west direction.  The orange red circular glows best described, looked like the tip of a cigarette lit..that bright orange color.  Now after doing some research we believe these could have been some sort of ufo space craft.   I do believe that we do have visitors that come to earth and some don't.  I'm sure most people don't want to talk about it either since people will think the ones that do are crazy.  Could you let me know what you think. Thankyou!

We first spotted the craft at 18:15 EST.  It was dark here in Florida.  I noted the time because as soon as my wife said we have a UFO we checked the time.  The craft appeared WSW of my home and at a very high angle, almost overhead.  I would place the craft almost due west of Saint Petersburg proper.   There was heavy periodic cloud cover with some moonlight. The size of the craft to the naked eye appeared to be just larger than a star so it was very high.   However, we had low power binoculars, and night scope. When viewed through these two aids it was clear it was a triangle and had lights.  There's no doubt this was a craft as it was clearly intelligently guided.  It would dart to the right, left, back and forth at amazing speeds and do a strange wobbling motion in concentric circles.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,27.79451493256262,-82.67515963391138

I was sat in the back seat and looking out at the stars as i have an intrest in them. I was looking at one particular star because it was so low down it seemed to be hovering over a smalll estate of houses in the distance but i just asumed that it was a greater distance than the others then something else struck me....was the star moving? I was entranced not to look away, I couldnt decide if it was moving because we were travelling in a car but I suddenly realised it was when it was closer and futher away from the other stars...thats when i realsied it wasn't a star. I decided it was a plane even though i couldnt see the usual blue and red flashing lights that planes usually have. I still kept watching the star/ball of light and then was it just me or was it gettnig bigger? i watched amoazed, i didnt call my nanna coz i was afraid that when i pionted it out to her that it would disapear. I watched the gettng bigger butit still remained as a ball of light then it began to shrink back down and then disapeard. I was thinking about the strange star and gazing across the field out of the window when about 10 minutes later it happened again, i noticed a star that was lower and i again tried to figure out if it were moving but i realised alot fatser that it was when i watcehd as it began to dance around the sky, it was zig zagging and swirlying around and then got bigger..shrank and disaperaed for about 20 minutes after i was still shocked at what i had just seen but carried on looking out to the sky. We driving up towards a groupe of buildings when another star shot up from bhind the closest wharehouse/building and disapeared, it did accurr to me that perhaps the third star was a fire work but when we rounded the corner i saw behind the wharehouse/building was completely desterted then i thought it could of been a firework in the distant...but dont fireworks make noises? and they kind of sizzle out  and leave tiny glints of silver when they shoot up...where as the as the moving stars didnt. I should eb traveling up in that direction in the next past week or so and this time Im taking a camara of some sort even if its my mobile phone. These moving stars, where no bigger than normal real stars. They couldnt of been a plaen or helicopter as there was no noise, planes and hellicopters dont zig zag and dance around or get bigger and shrink then disapere. Like i say it was close to bonefire night, but these were certanially no fireworks. They were small balls of light that apeared, shrank, grew and finally disapeared. This may have just been one ball of light disapearing and appearing but overall it was really freaky. When i am in the same place again I will take pictures of where I saw the objects and hopefull may be able to film the stars in action if they return. I havnt told anyone in fear of not being believed but this isnt the first time i have seen wierd things in the sky. I will try and send the imges in asap.

My friend and I were on our way to Millington from Munford, Tennessee, which is about 15 minutes away. It was already pitch black outside.  As we pulled out onto the highway, we saw what appeared to be lights from a large cargo plane flying overhead. It was not unusual for cargo planes to be doing test fights at night in this area, so we ignored it for the most part. 5 minutes before we made it to Millington the ""plane"" was next to us in the sky to the right.  We didn't think much of it until I realized we were going faster than the plane was. It was following along with us then slowed down to a stand still. I thought it might be a helicopter, but this thing was huge with a wide wingspan.  It then turned around and headed back towards Munford. Then it again turned around and flew over us.  I was shocked.  Then I saw it go below the tree line and then looked like it was about to crash into the church that was off the highway. It actually landed then took off again from the field. I was thinking it might be a crop duster helicopter, but it was so late and dark. It wasn’t until we got out of are car that I realized it wasn’t a helicopter. We were in the Lowes parking lot and the craft was floating over the highway. It was so close to the ground and so large. I was shocked to hear no sound hardly coming from it. I could hear more of the traffic passing than I could hear the craft. I could only make out the lights from the craft and not the actual craft itself. It had two bright white lights in the nose of the craft, then it seem to have wings which held one bright white light each. Behind the nose and the wings was two red lights and one red light seemed to be on top or near the nose. They blinked in sequence one after the other. The craft turned around again and then landed in the field next to Lowes. I walked over to see it and saw it in the field. I was about 350 yards away from it where I watched as it began to take off again. It took off like a normal airplane but with less runway. It wasn’t! very lo ud either. It had two sounds coming from it. One was a deep low roar, and then a high pitch jet sound. I'm sure it was some sort of Jet hover craft. Obviously man made. I don't believe it was alien or anything. It was just mysterious and was out of place. We have many aircraft flying around sometimes. Its not uncommon to see a jet fighter fly over you a close range to the ground at extremely high speeds. But this one was just weird. It hovers in mid air, lands in fields, takes off like a plane but shorter runway, extremely quiet. I am sure thousands of people saw this, I saw many people in the parking lot looking up at the sky at it. It was strange. It continued to fly even after we made it back home. It just kept flying back and forth down the highway from Munford to Millington.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,35.35345777777778,-89.89556999999999

It startled me with its size. Then an identical orb appeared from thin air to the right of the 1st orb. Now I knew something wasn't right. I tried to get closer to the objects, as the treeline got higher, they became harder to see. Then about 30 seconds later 2 black U.S. Stealth Fighters flew over the top of my car towards the objects. Another two would follow about 10 seconds later. Perhaps chasing the objects or what not. The military fighters stayed in the air and kept making their rounds for a good half hour before they left the area.

My house is in a populated suburban area on the end of the neighborhood, making it on the road. Diagonal, but in plain view from my porch, is an orchard. Its one of those random things where houses were just built around. We were eating popcicles looking over there and all the sudden I was overcome with emotion as I saw a glowing white, tripod like figure raise out of the orchard. I knew my friend was looking at it to because she was silent. If you have seen Zenon, the Disney movie, the ""aliens"" in that movie is what resembled what we saw. The only difference was it was brighter and a little smaller. It proceeded to rise about 12 feet and hover for 3 or 4 seconds. It than began to spin rapidly, turn in to a ball/disk thing and stop. It was so surreal and strange because it looked like those fake ones in movies. A circle with blinking red and blue lights on the side. It kept changing color for about 7 or 8 seconds, shot down a yellow beam of light, sucked it back up, than zoomed across my neighborhood and out of sight. It moved faster than ANYTHING in the air I have ever seen move. When it was behind the trees we heard an almost explosion and ran in the house. We both swear to this story and can each give you the exact same story. It is very strange but, when we talk about it, we get kind of emotional. I never believed in these things but now, i KNOW they are real. I know what we saw and it was real. I still to this day get funny when I see anything moving in the sky at a fast speed.

To my right was a wide open field were cattle are sometimes kept and to my left was a large mountain were Elk wonder. To my right in the field I saw 3 bright, white lights moving across the field, at least a 1/2 to 3/4 mile apart from each other looking like they were searching for something, scanning back and forth, and as I drove along the road watching them, the lights were always pointed in  my direction as a drove the probably 10-15 miles stretch along the field. They weren't bouncing, dipping in and out of sight like a 4 wheeler moving along hills, or weren't that yellowish tint of a 4 wheeler light. And no rancher i have ever known would be up that late doing anything on a Tuesday night, and it wasn't calving season, the only reason a rancher would be up that late. The reason this scared ((deleted)) me is because on the other side of the field about 30 or so miles alway is Douglas, WY, and I knew a guy that was a Fish and Game Warden and he said one night a few years before late at night a guy came in to their office and told them that someone was spotlighting deer in a field off the interstate and you could see the light searching for deer or antelope.  He and another man drove out to where the light was, watched it from the top of a hill moving from animal to animal moving along searching for something.  They drove down without their headlights on to sneak up on the poacher, but when they got to where the light was, there was no truck or 4wheeler or anything, the light was coming from above.  They looked up with their binoculars and couldn't see the belly of any aircraft of hear anything, and the light just kept moving as if it never saw them.

I was at my grandparent’s trailer cabin for the weekend with my parents. (About 4 miles south of Harpers Ferry IA and a few miles north of Effigy Mounds Natioal Monument). I went out to the porch outside to talk on my cell phone. At the time it was about 10 P.M. and I was facing eastward toward the Mississippi River. While talking on the phone, noticed a light near the cabin directly to the right of me. I saw it with the corner of my eye; it caught my attention enough so I turn my head to look. I then saw nothing; I figured that it was just an individual with a flashlight. I continued talking on the phone like nothing had occurred. At about 10:30ish, a half hour later, I am still talking on the phone when I noticed a light again with the right corner of my eye. This time around when I turned to look, I saw a bluish-white light about the size of a basketball or a large flashlight. It was about 2 feet off the ground and moved to the right side of the cabin out of my sight. At this time I figured for sure that it was someone with a flashlight but there was no noise of gravel from footsteps or sounds of any kind during or after, just the sounds of insects and other bugs. An hour later I was done talking on the phone but was eating a snack on the porch, mainly looking at the night’s sky. No manmade lights to distract from the star light, a great night to stargaze. I was getting done with my snack and was cold so I was about to head inside for the night when the main event occurred! I saw the same bluish-white light across the Mississippi River at a small island a few hundred yards away. It was moving in a straight line southward a few feet off the ground. It was moving about as fast as a car and that’s what I first thought it was till I realized that no roads existed on the small island. It stopped immediately then came back northward on the same trajectory. During this time I was thinking it was an ATV or some other motorized vehicle of that sort. It made no noise and did not change shape or brightness. It moved over the River and moved westward toward my direction (I am sitting at about 150 yards away) and then moved southward down river at the same speed and same height above surface. I then knew this was a UFO of some sort and it seemed to be flying over the surface in a grid like formation. I was no longer sitting in the porch chair and was now standing scared. I said to myself if this thing gets any closer, I was going to run inside. It then moved northward aging still flying at the same lined trajectory and stopped, it came toward my direction even closer. I ran inside as fast as I could not a look back and hid in the cabin trailer of my grandparents. The following night at about 11pm Saturday, I went outside on the porch with my mother. As soon as we got outside she was the one who pointed out and asked me about an object that was hovering a few feet off the waters surface. I looked at the object and it was the same bluish-white basketball sized object! It was flying downstream on the Mississippi River and we stood watching it till it was out of sight.  As of 3/27/2008, I have not seen it again or anything else like it.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,43.1758,-91.2082

Sighting lasted about 10 minutes beginning at about 8pm CDT on Thursday, 5 July 2007. I was sitting in a lawn chair outdoors at a swing and big band concert offered by the city in downtown Ralston facing south.  The crowd was of about 75 was mainly made up of people in their 50s to 70s years of age and some in front of me began pointing up to the daytime cloudless sky, and I looked up to at first see five bright silver starlike points of light in the sky stationary and in a zigzag like pattern.  Within minutes I counted 7 and then I counted 9 and then 10 in all stationary across the sky of various intensities and all silver in color except one fainter one which had a reddish tint.  None blinked or pulsated but looked more like how Venus currently looks in the western sky vs a twinkling star affect. Since the sun was low on the horizon, the brightness appeared to be reflection.  Knowing how bright the International Space Station can be after sunset when its orbit is just right and how bright satellites can be in the early evening, these objects could have been at a very high altitude and hence could have been seen across a widespread area and hopefully others have seen something similar. The lights were not evenly spread out but some were alone and some were in somewhat close groups of two or three in no particular pattern.  After about 5 minutes, three of the lights moved in all different directions and the group farthest to the southeast made a  tight triangle around the reddish light.  After a few more minutes, in this same area, four lights moved close to one another to form a rough letter C. About ten minutes after first seeing this strange event, a high flying aircraft flew across the sky from east to west and when it did, coincidentally all but one of the lights vanished and by the time the airplane crossed that area to the west, the last light was gone as well. I did not have nor did I see anyone there with a camera or video equipment to record this event. I saw no more starlike items in the sky until after sunset an hour and a half later when Venus was visible and by 9:45 several of the brighter stars came out as normal. I am familiar with planes and satellites and what I saw was not those.  I am familiar with the brightness of white-breasted geece flying and how the sun can reflect off them and what they look like and what I saw was not birds.  I have always been interested in astronomy and earth sciences and am a meteorologist by profession.  I have never seen an object in the sky I could not reasonably identify until late Thursday the 5th.   I made a report to the Omaha World Herald news tip line an hour after the event and they said no one had called about the lights but they would check with the Ralston Police Dept (I had not notified them, just the newspaper). I came across your website today with the phone number and called.  No one at work on Friday when I posted an e-mail on the bulletin board responded as having seen it and I took a good bit of ribbing about it.

We stopped the car and got out.  We watched the object for 10-15 minutes.  It flipped end over end slowly and moved as if floating like a balloon from east-south-east to west-north-west.  It almost seemed dormant and non-deliberate if not for the fact it was floating opposite the direction of the wind.

Portland, Oregon On 6 July 2007, at approximately 4:40 PM (Pacific Daylight Savings Time)in the afternoon, my wife called me on our house phone (I was upstairs, where I was working as usual at our home-based business), using her cell phone, to say that she say a UFO, and that I had better get out there (where she was: on the back deck) pretty quickly or it would probably no longer be there. I thought she was perhaps joking, as less than a minute or so previously, she had called me to ask me to take a look at the good job she had done constructing a makeshift sun-screen to protect the plants on the deck from the excessive heat and sun.  (The temperature was in the mid 80s, relatively hot for this area; the sun was quite bright). I thought her second call might be a way to get me to show up outside quicker than I might do ordinarily. When I was outside, she pointed into the bright, blue sky, where a quite bright ""dot"" was drifting slowly in the sky, very generally in an S or SE direction.  The ""dot"" appeared to maintain very generally the same apparent altitude.  Although much sunlight was apparently reflected from it, it was difficult to make out any size for the object, as if it were extremely bright but extremely far away or extremely tiny in spite of its brilliance. The object did not appear to vary noticeably in brightness during the time it was observed, which was perhaps a minute by myself, and an additional (preceding) minute by my wife.  The object showed no signed of rotation, or any sort of jerky motion that one might expect e.g. a helium-filled balloon with some sort of attached string to exhibit while being (presumably) buffeted by the wind. The air in the vicinity of our house at this time as not particularly windy, but also not necessarily totally calm. The angle of the line of sight was about 40 degrees, and certainly no more than 45 degrees; the line of sight was essentially parallel to the slope of the roof on the back (SW) portion of the second storey of our house.  The object was seen to be about one half to one inch about the slope o the roof, as estimated via fingers held out at arm's length. In discussing the sighting briefly with my wife, I referred to the object as being exceptionally shiny, although she referred to it as being very white, which I would agree with.  The color of the reflection seemed (to me) to possibly be strongly suggestive of a metallic-type reflection. Seeing the object did not result in any immediately-obvious other-worldly sensations; it seemed unusual to be seeing such an object, and there was some degree of discomfiture in not being able to classify it as to the sort of thing it was, or why it was there, or what it was doing, etc. The sky at the time was generally cloud-free, and certainly in the ESE direction toward which we were looking and where the object was seen. The object appeared to drift in the sky, until it was obscured by the upper leaves of some neighboring trees and then no longer visible. The object drifted perhaps two inches (per at-arm-length finger measurement) during the time it was observed; it was not moving particularly quickly at all.  It was most certainly not stationary, however. Attempts to contact a local (or any) FAA Flight Service Station to obtain information regarding the magnitude and direction of the winds aloft were unsuccessful, as all that was apparently readily accessible over the phone was prerecorded weather information for the vicinity, which gave just the surface winds(?), which (if I noted this correctly) were ""310"" (the heading presumably) at ""12"" (MPH?) for Portland (Oregon), or at ""6"" for Troutdale (Oregon).

Adams with my business partner.  After the conference, most of the attendees joined up in the field to sky watch.  Mt. Adams is well known for its paranormal activities. While we waiting for lights to start firing up on the mountain, as it has done in the past, we noticed a glowing globe setting low in the western sky above the trees.  I had a spotting scope and my partner started to track it.  It was large, yellowish/white, globular and undulated with millions of teeny lights inside.  It moved bout, reminiscent of a jelly fish or an amoeba.  A woman sitting next to us said it had been there the night before too and stayed for about 2 hours then went down behind the trees and disappeared. We continued to observe this object until it was out of view.  It became apparent to us just at sunset and stayed visible until around 11 pm. It was orb-shaped, brilliant, and large and were amazed to see it moving, undulating, turning upside down, right, left.  It was yellowish-white and seemed to change color. On close inspection, it looked like an amoeba or jellyfish with electrical impulses firing off inside.  We saw geometric designs inside lit up like a chandelier.  This thing was incredibly beautiful and graceful, like it was alive.  We were in awe.  We put a video of it up on YouTube.com under ""Mysterious Skies"" if you would like to see it. Before it went down behind the tree, it looked like 'stuff' coming out of it -- lights. There were two other very small bright objects near it - one at 3 o'clock and another at 11 o'clock.  We noticed that they looked exactly like the big one, only much smaller.  We also have stills of this object. There was what looked to be an opening in the center which moved around almost like an eyeball, however, the center opening appeared to be square on the outside but round on the inside.  It almost looked like it was looking at us!  Both my business partner and I are Metaphysical Ministers.  We work privately in the paranormal field.  Neither of us has ever seen anything like this before. Later that morning, around 3 or 4 am, we were visited in our motor home by a brilliant, tiny white light.  A flash woke me up.  I thought someone had a camera outside the window and took my picture.  I looked out the window and didn't see or hear anybody, although I did notice that lights were going off on the mountain like crazy.  When I laid back down, I saw a brilliant white light on the ceiling.  It moved three times before I tried to wake up  my partner.  When I called her to wake her up, it disappeared.  The light did not give off any negativity, I did not feel fear or afraid of it.  I believe It was a light being, as curious as we are and it came to visit.   First contact.  Awesome.

I am a registered nurse on cape cod. I had just completed a 3-11 shift in Chatham and headed due west on the backroads back to my home in Dennis. As I left work at 11;15, I spotted an unusual object upon turning westward and kept my eye on it all the way back to Dennis and never lost sight of it. I stopped to pick up my son at his girlfriends house at about 11:30 and drove to a nearby parking lot with him to show him the oddity in the sky. It was the new moon and the sky was very clear with bright stars everywhere. I pointed to the object I had been witnessing for about twenty minutes. My son looked up and his mouth feel open! He said ""Holy **** mom, what IS that?"" I told him his guess was as good as mine. We decided to drive to a local historic tourist attraction located on one of the geographically highest topographies in the area. As luck would have it, the vantage point at this tower is due west and many locals and tourists alike enjoy watching the sunset from there. There, right in front of us, was the object we had seen. Within minutes we saw two similar objects were present as well. They formed a triangle. The one closest to us,which I estimated to be between ten and twelve miles away but may have been closer, was also in the closest proximity to the Earths surface. The one to the right, about twice that distance away as it was also further from the Earths surface, seemed to be more 'orb' shaped and frequently glowed in a fiery white to gold to orange. The furthest away was located at the apex of the triangle and appeared to be lit brightly on the top, but there were no clouds in the sky to reflect this off of, this object appeared to be about two to four miles in the air, but that was difficult for me to gage. All three of them just hovered although sometimes the lower two seemed to move up and down slightly and all three of them maintained their basic vicinity, they also did small concentric circles perpendicular to the surface of the Earth. All three of the objects flashed lights along their perimeters. Sometimes they flashed synchronicitously, sometimes seperately, with colors flashing white, yellow, red and green. At this point, I called a friend of mine in Arizona to deatil tthe phenomena I was witnessing and we spoke through approximately forty five minutes of it. At one point my son and I noted the closest object with its changing colored lights move closer to us and we held our breath not knowing what would occur next! My son called a friend of his who showed up with some friends. They also witnessed what we were watching. I called my ex spouse to see if he would come up with his video camera but he couldn't. He attempted to see it from his house but could not. He said the stars were very bright but that his vision was hampered by a wooded area to the west. Small flashes seemed to emit from the lower two sporadically. The flashes shot from the bottoms of the objects, but not directly from the center. They were lit trails that disappeared from view after a second or two. After about two hours, the objects departed, one by one. The first to leave was the closest to us. it headed westward silently with its lights changing colors and all remaining lit. It moved quickly and i watched it disappear over the horizon.

My husband had stepped outside of our home at 9:44 pm on the evening of April 4, 2006.   It was a clear evening, no clouds or breeze and a cresent moon.  I was inside and heard what appeared to be a very loud engine noise.  My husband came in the house and told me to come outside.   A short distance off, in the southern sky, was a very large disc shaped figure with red, randomly blinking, lights.  It was enormous.  We watched as the object continued to fade in the distance.   A few moments later, it came streaking, at a very high speed, back in our direction.  This time the object was very high up.  It was very loud although it was traveling faster than sound.  The object passed overhead about 9 seconds prior to our hearing it.   There were huge intermittant bursts of flare-like (yellow-orange) releases in the sky both coming from the craft and sometimes in the sky where there didn't appear to be a craft.  When the sky lit up from these blasts, there was an aurora around the light.  Random ""sparks"" from the blasts reached the vacinity of our house.  It was similar to seeing the sparks from a professional fireworks display showering down, although it came from a very high altitude.   At one point in the eastern sky we witnessed two crafts, again, traveling at a very high speed.  Our teenage son had joined us outside and observed these events also.  The clear sky quickly became cloudy with a light cover although the ""clouds"" weren't moving and there were no winds present at ground level.   We'll keep the video camera charged in the future.

It is a captivating sight with the snow fall. After about a minute, the whole cluster of stars tilts upwards, and I can clearly see it is a circle, because I can see the outline of what appears to be something reflective, maybe metal? encircling the entire cluster of stars. It is definitely a ship, circular, dark black on the bottom with lights that when angled correctly, looks like a regular group of stars. The titled object remains in this position for several seconds before going over our roof silently towards the east. The object started high, flew lower, aprox. 25ft above the pine trees, from that distance it appeared to be the size of a two car garage, that’s my best technical description.

Here's as best a description I can give:It appeared in the southern sky. the lights looked like twinkling stars almost or like plane lights but they would get bright for just a second and then disappear completely (normal planes do not do that you can still see the plane). There would be like 4 or 5 of them going off but not in any sort of order. The area they covered was pretty big, like the area of 5 or 6 planes but there wasn't a distinguishable shape like a circle etc. Really you could not see anything behind the lights it was the lights themselves that let you know something was there.It could not have been different planes either because of the way the lights were moving the plane would have to have the ability to zig up and down and back and forward at a rate of nano seconds. The whole thing was moving west at a pretty rapid clip. I called my husband out, who was annoyed I took him away from a show but as soon as he saw it he also commented, ""What the hell is that?"" I was speaking to a friend on the phone who lives a few blocks away. I asked her to go outside and look at the sky. She and her son went outside,her son said it looked like asteroid dust. He is 13. We had to run out to the parking lot to see past the building in front of us but by the time we got to the parking lot it was gone.

Indialantic, Florida I am reporting a sighting from 2001 in the town of Indialantic Florida.  Late one evening, I was outside on the patio of the home in which I was living with roommates. I was startled by the sound of jets flying very low overhead, coming from East to West from the Atlantic Ocean.  Like anyone would, I looked up instantly to see two military jets, with a spherical object between and slightly behind the (2) aircraft. My first impression was that the object was attached and was being towed by the jets. At this point I called a roommate and his mother outside to witness this as well. One of the jets turned South, and the other turned North. The object moved further behind the northbound aircraft and followed it out of site(toward Patrick airforce base). Seconds later a third military jet flew over and continued west, until out of site.  Here is a description of the object. It was about twice the height of the tail fins on the aircraft. The object was perfectly spherical, transparent, and emanating a blue light. We were clearly able to see what I could best describe as blue plasma, or thick blue and white smoke roiling inside a transparent sphere. It was like looking at a flying crystal ball.  I make no assumption as to what it was, however I know beyond doubt what we saw, and that the military is aware of it. Regardless of its origin, it was very much out of place.  I would love to talk to someone who has had a similar experience; it really is almost impossible to believe unless you experience it for yourself.

Her nephew had run to her saying they saw something and it looked like an asteroid entered into the atmosphere and exploded.  I ran outside for a look and immediately ran in for my family. I called my niece and had her on the phone. When I looked up it looked like a bright yellow tinted haze at first. We continued to watch because the haze began to change a little, it expanded and got brighter. As we were watching we saw something fly quickly up beside it on the right. The object went up and over the top of the haze and disappeared. Then another appeared on the right side it was flying slow at first and then it shot off across the sky, we never took our eyes off of it. It went across our horizon and then it stopped and went back in the other direction. As it approached the haze another bright object flew up and disappeared below the haze, then the 2nd object just disappeared. Next the bottom left corner of the haze looked as if it was funneling, just the corner of it. It was like nothing I’ve ever seen. We were in awe and yelling at each other “do you see that”. Then through the center if the funnel shot out a bright round object. It flew directly out then around to the right side, flew up and then disappeared. The skies were clear and beautiful, not a cloud in site.  I’m not sure exactly what that haze was but there is no denying the 4 objects we saw.  To me, they didn’t appear to be in our atmosphere but above it although I’m not sure. The whole experience lasted about 25 minutes.  The haze didn’t completely fade for another 10 minutes then it was completely gone. The witnesses were myself 32, my husband 31, my sister 28, her husband 30, my 2 daughters 7 & 11, and my niece 16 who lives 3 miles away.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,33.7105,-84.9112

I was sitting on my couch talking to my boyfriend and petting my cat when the hair on the back of my neck stood up and my cat suddenly flipped out. Then something suddenly told me to look up and out the window. I looked and I saw a large triangle shaped object with red lights on it.  I saw it for what seemed like only a few seconds and then it disappeared right in front of my eyes as if it had disappeared into another dimension.   The red lights around the object where bright but the big red light in the center was as bright as a star. It was unlike anything I have ever seen and I know that it was not of this world.  I told my boyfriend who is a big UFO believer what had happened and what I had felt.  He knew that I did not know anything about UFO sightings and he said I described exactly what others had felt.  I am now a believer and I am convinced that what I saw was a UFO.  I some how felt that they wanted me to see them because they knew I was such a skeptic.

They were moving south-west across the sky. The altitude was very high. I intially thought the lights were a single satillite. I have seen numerous satillites over the years and these lights looked nothing like any satillite I have ever seen. The altitude seemed right but the speed seemed faster than a satillite.

I was watching television last night around 9pm.  The weather had cooled of enough, that I shut off the air con. and opened up the house.  I was watching Fox News and was sitting on the couch.  The front of our house faces south, into open farm fields.  About 1/2 mile is a tower for cell phones. I have all the lights on in the living room, and that makes it hard to see anything outside. I see a bright light light up in the sky on the east side of the tower, then it fades within a few seconds. The first thing I think is some kind of missel flash, it is 9/11 and this is on everyones mind.  I go to the front door to get a better look, and I see 3 very bright lights light up, not realy in a row, just randam. These also fade to nothing within 5 to 6 sec. I witness this for the next 15 min. not in any pattern, or time frame. I can also see regular air craft flying normal off in the distance. These lights were not aircraft. At this point I think I must be nuts. I go outside and stand in our driveway. Again I see the 3 bright lights for about 6 sec. and they fade. I call my husband who is at work in Circleville and explane to him what I am seeing. As I am on the phone I see it at least once. I go back into the house to get my camera to take a picture if I could. I go back to the driveway and see the 3 lights again, the do not at any time light up together, but light up like counting one, two, three and then fade. The last time I saw the lights, was on the west side of the tower, and one became very bright, and in a very straight line five or six others appeaired, one right after the other, and then faded in the same way as the rest. I was a little scared at that point, I guess the unknown. I am not a nut case. I own a boarding and grooming kennel, I have raised 3 sons, two of them are Police Officers. I have never seen anything like this. I do not think they were flairs. We have also have a home at Lake Erie and I have seen flairs over the lake.

I love the peace & quiet and wanted to go into his field to look at the massive array for stars out that night. Approx 10PM, In the SSW sky I spotted to what I had assumed to be a star, but quickly deduced that it must be a plane because all of the starlight was a 'white-blue' when this was an 'yellow-white' and was MUCH lower than any star. As a guess I'd say it's altitude was 5 miles and distance (from me) approx the same.  I then realized that it couldn't be landing gear or lights on the front of a craft because it was moving away from me in a constant SSW direction.  Overhead, a plane passed, coming from the NW--towards the 'light' to the SSW. As the plane got to what I would say about a 1-2 mile range, the light went out, then came back on as the airplane vectored to the SSE.  I ran to get binoculars and continued to watch.  This light did not twinkle as were all of the stars that night (it was crystal-clear), rather it was constant.  I will note that another airplane was headed towards it and the light disappeared again, only to come back on another 90 seconds or so later like the first time.  After about 15 minutes, the light then was completely gone as it continued heading SSW. Any ideas?  This was I believe about a week after one could look straight up and see the space station..is that what I saw? Perhaps a satellite? I thought the light going on & off with appraoching aircraft was odd.

I noticed a star flickering as they often do on clear nights, and then out of the corner of my eye I noticed a blinking white and red light heading north.  I wrote it off as a plane, but kept my eye on it.  It was moving exceptionally fast considering how far away it was.  I was born and raised in an area where jetliners and helicopters frequently pass over heading to the Scranton/Wilkes Barre airport, so it's safe to say I have a good idea of how fast a plane that far away should have been moving.  While I watched the craft move off to the north I noticed another identical set of blinking white and red lights coming from the south west heading in the same direction.  Then, before that one was out of sight, another flew by, then another, they all came from different areas of the sky heading towards the same point.  There were times that I could see three or four of them in the sky at once, which struck me as odd because I always considered airplanes to keep more of a distance from each other than the distance these things were maintaining.  At one point I watched a couple of them pass behind a cloud, and the most incredible part was when I saw one coming from the north heading straight towards another coming from the south west, they moved very quickly and passed very close by one another.  I had a friend and some of his family come over, and they arrived just in time to see one dissappear north into the distance.  Within fifteen minutes another came from the north heading south.  After that we didn't see any more of them.  Throughout this sighting I only heard the sound of an airplane once, when one of them passed nearby, however several other crafts followed the same path and were silent.  I cannot shake the idea that they were most likely airplanes because the blinking lights are so typical of the safety lights airplanes use.  My reason for reporting this is that there were so many, I counted at least nineteen and god knows how long they were doing this before I noticed.  Also, they passed by each other so closely and traveled far distances very quickly for the most part without a sound.  Anyways thats it.  I plan to call the airport just to see if maybe there was an issue that prevented jetliners from landing, forcing them to circle the skies for a while.  I'll keep it posted.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,41.1767,-76.0792

It was as though a helicopter was searching for something yet the light was not constant in a straight beam.  It was a very bright light and easy to spot.  The light would slither around like a snake through the trees, across the ground, coming in and out of view.  Or the light would make a circle—not a perfect circle but a disorganized shape, illuminating trees, buildings, bodies of water.  When on water the light would spread out a lot, as one would expect.  The size of the lit area would be about like the size of a football field or smaller.  At times the light seemed low, like it went through the trees and not on top of them.  It would disappear for a few seconds then reappear a few miles later (over and over-I’d see it for 5 seconds, disappear 5 seconds, reappear.) It was going at approximately the same speed as our jet because I was able to watch it for 30 minutes.   It was not on the same course as our jet, for its location changed in relation to our jet’s path.  But both our jet and the light were traveling generally north.  I never saw a helicopter or any aircraft or any source of this spotlight.  I could NOT see a beam coming from the sky but just the light hitting the earth.  The light had nothing to do with our jet.  Once we turned west in our approach for landing, we headed in a different direction as this light source.

Then we saw a “V” shaped object with a smooth rounded bottom the same color as the clouds traveling south at a pretty high rate of speed.

I first observed the light on my way home from my girlfriend’s house early Monday morning.  It was around 4:45 am and I was going home to get into my work clothes and go to work.  I noticed it because it was so unbelievably bright I’m talking if you were on the road that night or morning you seen this darn light if looking into the sky.  I also started to notice that it sort of changed colors a bit maybe wrote it off as a satellite or planet until I noticed that it didn’t move at all just kind of hovering in one spot.  Other people observed this event as well, my friend/coworker called me today (Tuesday) and was telling me he had caught this strange light in the sky Sunday night on video.  He is going to school for film and graphics design I think, so he really knows what he’s doing when it comes to filming.  As I was sitting in my car waiting for my boss to arrive to work (I work at a local retail store) I kept watching the light.  It appeared to me that it was sparkling or possibly blinking the main color was white but it was entirely too bright and large to be a star.  I also heard another opinion from the same coworker that documented the experience, that it looked as if it held some form of being he described it as an “angel”.  I wouldn’t go as far as to report this if I thought it was a star/planet/gas/or aircraft so I’m asking for a possible explanation as I think this was possibly something from out of this world. Another worthy mention would be that my manager also seen the light and had noticed it on her way to work as well and we sat there outside of work to stare at it for a moment it was quite odd. It didn’t move at all almost as if it was just hovering or watching over us.  The best way I can describe it is a large obviously strange bright object sitting out of place in the sky and it sometimes changed colors even said to look as if it was housing or transporting a being or extraterrestrial being if you will. I got the feeling I was being watched quite an interesting unexpl! ainable experience. That’s all I can really say, thanks for anyone who takes interest in this true, even documented event.

At approximately 8:30 AM on Monday, October 29, 2007 I witnessed a black, oval object in the sky just east of Sioux Falls, SD.  It was quite high and still quite large considering how high in altitude it was. At first glance I thought it was an enormous bird based upon how it seemed to be gliding through the air. However upon further inspection I noticed that it was actually shiny and highly reflective. It moved at a fairly consistent pace, and it moved fairly quickly although slow enough that I was able to run into another room (to get a better view out of our sliding glass door) and it was still there. Again, it seemed to be gliding, but definitely not decending or falling. It went behind the large number trees in our neighborhood, and I was unable to see what happened to it from there.  Right before it went behind the trees there was a helicopter in the air which passed near it (although the helicopter was quite a bit lower in the air, it passed in the same vicinity...almost right under the object). I didn't get a good look at the helicopter so I don't have a description other than it was definitely dark in color. I was mostly transfixed on the other object. We do get a lot of hospital trauma helicopters flying over our house from time to time as we live on the edge of town, so the helicopter didn't strike me as unusual at the time.  I am a 30 year old woman and I have never seen anything like this object before in my life.  I have seen large weather balloons gliding high in the sky and I can tell you this looked nothing like a weather balloon. It was jet black with a highly reflective surface. It appeared oval in shape and moved at a medium, consistent speed. I heard no noise from it...although the approaching helicopter could have drowned out any sounds. It was a crystal clear sky, with little to no clouds and no haze or fog. And I no, I had not been drinking. :)",2007-11-28T00:00:00,43.54381423001949,-96.72227173489279

I looked off to the northeast – towards Scott County – and saw a round shape with bright lights of Red, Blue, and white. The lights went all around the object and sometimes seemed to be steady and at other times seemed to strobe or even rotate around the object. The object also had at least four straight extensions coming off of it and running underneath the main object. The extensions were also lighted. The object sat perfectly still. I got my daughter to come look at it. She thought it was a Police Helicopter, mainly because of the red and blue lights. The object was way too high to be a Helicopter and the area it was hovering over would have been very rural. My daughter went back inside. I continued to watch. We do not have binoculars, so I went inside to get my daughter’s Digital Camera that has Zoom capabilities and thought that might help. When I returned to the balcony, the object was still there but then there was a second object much closer and much larger. It was more of a perfectly shaped orange ball and almost appeared to be “sitting” on a house off in the distance. I called for my daughter again and she thought it was a full moon. I did not think that was the case because it was too orange and I don’t recall ever seeing a full moon in that spot before. This morning I looked at the Naval Observatory’s Web Site and according to it there was no full moon last night, it should have been a “Last Quarter” moon.  My daughter told me that I had watched one too many X-Files and that she was sure it was a Police Helicopter and a Full Moon.  While I do not know what either object was, I do not believe they were those things, and my daughter who was so sure of herself was too “scared” by what she saw to sleep in her room downstairs last night.

Two of the women -- both retired newspaper reporters -- were talking at the gas pump with the woman who runs the store, when she suddenly pointed into the sky and all observed what they said were (at least) two cigar -- or tube-shaped wingless, exhaustless, noiseless aircraft crossing the sky overhead.  I am severly crippled so by the time I got out of the car to look, the things had passed over and were hidden by trees.  It was not clear how many there were, as one of the women saw only one.  The store owner said that two days before, on a Sunday, she had seen five such objects go over, in formation, and two army-type helicopters seemed to be either accompanying them or trying to intercept them.  But they were fast and soon disappeared over the mountains.  One of the women, an experienced news photographer, tried to photograph them but the extreme brightness of the sky and their high altitude made it impossible.

Airport, Memorial Day 06, approach. Object was witnessed by airline passenger, port side, facing Easterly.  On final approach to MIA, at about 3:55 PM, while plane was making final 180 degree turn, at approximately 4 to 3000 feet altitude, a glowing red-white ball crossed our path.  This crossing was below us, at approximatly 2000 feet, and at the general center point of the radius for which our airplane was turning around.  This fire-ball appeared to be traveling northbound, paralleling the SR-997 to the East.  If we were traveling at 222 mph, I estimate the ball was traveling 120 mph.  No change in vector was observed of the ball.  If I were able to have streched out my arm, and pinched my fingers together and opened them a bit, the gap would have been 1/4 to 3/8 inch.  If that ball was 1500 feet away from my eye, it might have been 10 to 15 foot in diameter.  The lumens given off pulsated strongly from red to white to read, with no observed briliance disipation.  Wether conditions were overcast, no direct sun.  Thunder clouds were starting to form at that time, and sky darkened by the 5 oclock hour.  No rain fell at airport, and no thunder or lightening was abserved by me durring the 2 hours I remained at the airport, awaiting a connection.  85F, cloudy, still air.  I made special effort to disprove what I was seeing.  I do have 20/20 vision, and I am not color blind.  I was not drinking or druging at the time.  I witnessed this ball for more than half the duration of the 180 degree turn the aircraft made, aproximately for 45 seconds.  The angle of the object, with respect to the floor of the aircraft, was just below the parallel of the floor, and drifting rearward.  The object left my view when we continued across its path and onward to the airport.  Below where the ball was seen are active surface mines, with associated lakes of varying shades of green to grey.  These may be cement or sand or shell bed mines, I am not sure.  It was labor day, and 4 of the 10 mines there showed activity with dump trucks and conveyors.  The mine imediately below the object did not appear to be active.  The plane was full, and I was in seat 32A.  I was interested in speaking with the pilot, but the cabin was still shut when I exited the plane.  At the time, I did not feel the need to wait for the pilot, for I needed to catch the next plane, in a different terminal.  I also thought he'd think I was insane.  I did not feel alarm while observing this ball, but I did feel like this may be a ufo probe mapping the planet running concentric passes, around and around.  No powerlines were visable to me in the area.  I have e-mailed a MapPoint sketch of the area where it was.  As I write this I have thought of possible glide path markers that would indicate were pilots need to turn for approach at night.  This is a good piece of doubt to ponder.

Three disk shapes connected in the center, with a sort of bulged center area. At this point the craft starts to rotate up on its side, so that the bottom of the craft is facing towards me. I see a blinking red light in the center of the craft and each clover has a large white circular light on it taking up most of the area of the bottom of these three disks. It’s very hard to explain the features of the craft in words.  So at this point it’s been maybe 30-40 seconds that I’ve been watching this thing, and it’s now hovering at a 90 degree angle to me just a few hundred feet out my window on the thirteenth floor.  I start to get the feeling this thing knows I see it and it can see me, as it suddenly displays a light sequence of blue, green, white, and red in an extremely fast flickering pattern. I don’t know how else to describe this light array other than hypnotic in nature, it lasted only a few seconds and when the light show was over, the craft rotated back down from the right angle it was at, and floated off in a south easterly direction (basically directly over Comerica Park) until I lost sight of it.  This is absolutely 100% the truth, and the strangest experience I’ve ever had in my life. I’m not the type of person who looks for these kinds of things or believes every conspiracy theory out there, more than anything else I hope maybe someone else reported the same thing and I can help confirm there story.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,42.368854674403615,-83.11026847195357

Specifically, the lights were seen hovering in the trees near a brand new condominium complex located several hundred yards East of Route 1. A swampy, marshy wetlands area lies southeast and adjacent to the condo complex where this event was spotted. The lights were seen in the trees near a vacant/unoccupied building of the new condo complex. Upon walking my dog, the lights were spotted and they remained still and bright for several moments amongst the trees. Shortly after being spotted, the lights lifted and moved out of the trees in a uniform form pattern, moving upwards and to the southwest slightly  -- all this movement taking place while the lights were still bright. But, as the ""craft"" or object moved away, the uniform pattern of lights slowly faded away as ""it"" moved from the area. There was no noise of an engine. The entire neighborhood was extremely quiet. The lights were not of a conventional airliner, as no jet noise was heard and no lights twinkled as with a conventioanl jetliner. In addition, the lights did not appear in an area of sky where jetliners normally traverse; the lights hovered amongst the trees in the dewy, swampy and wooded area. The lights were brighter and more uniform in pattern (circular or oval shape) and the lights moved and faded away uniformly, which made this event so remarkable to the observer. It was an unforgettable moment for the observer and the observer is at a loss to explain or rationalize the origin of the lights and how the lights moved together uniformly and faded away so uniformly against the uninhabited and heavily wooded wetlands adjacent to a vacant building in a newly constructed condo com! plex. Th is event was not reported until now (posting date of Jan. 16, 2007). This posting was prompted by reportings of others from the state of Texas seen on news broadcasts, and the observer contemplated the nature of the sighting in Florida and decided to report it.

This was large enough that we pulled over along the Freeway to watch it.  At the same time, we were watching this we saw a smaller, cigar shaped object come up from what appeared to be the ground, somewhere.  It directed toward the larger object   and appeared to pass (or miss) the larger mass by crossing the tail.  This object continued up and arced to the northeast until it was out of sight.

I looked up in the sky above our building and to the west and I saw an object in the sky just sitting there. As I was staring at it all of a sudden to the left appeared another one and it was moving from west to east.  It passed right in front of the 1st object. They could have almost collided. It was moving at a steady pace. It was not moving too fast. It was not that high in the sky. I guess if I had to compare it to my building. My building is about 18 to 20 feet high. I was looking at an angle and it was probably 2 ½ to 3 times my building in height in the sky and 100 to 150 yards away maybe. I got a good look at it. It was oval shaped, it looked to be silver. I watched it go about several hundred yards and then fade out. It disappeared. I looked back to see the other one, but it was gone. It was really cool to see. I couldn’t believe it. This is not my first sighting of a UFO, but it was definitely the most awesome to see. I started to laugh because it happened right in my plain view of sight. I didn’t have to squint or guess at what I was seeing.  I immediately called my wife and then my father after. I see planes fly over all day going to Austin Bergstrom. 737’s, 747’s, cargo plane’s, jet’s, Cesena’s and helicopter’s every once in awhile. These objects were silver looking, oval and had no wings.

( It is always to my Westerly direction), anyway it just hung there for a good solid 30 minutes with its colored lights flashing but on this night I noticed that to the North of my house there was also another star like object that had colored flashing lights too just like the other one. There was also lots of plane and jet activity in the area and these lights were NOT one of those. ******************************************* So this West light after hanging there slowing moved away toward the West North direction. As it moved away it still appeared the same. It had the same lights flashing. Either it was rotating or it was backing up. And as I have said before. This can NOT be a helicopter because it does not make any noise and it has been about a 1000 feet away from the house. Now the other light to the North of the house just dissapeared. You can hear a helicopter coming a mile away especially where I live. I live in a farm area with few houses around. So this is why I know that these lights are NOT helicopters. ********************************************* Then on Monday around 01:00 I saw this yellow light coming at an extremly fast pace from the West and it just stopped like on a dime at the same location at the end of the field as it has been doing. This time it was tree level and it briefly hung there and did that power up thing like it did before because the light goes brighter for a moment, maybe it was taking a scan or something, and then it took off to the North so fast that you would have thought that it was being chased by something. Then it was behind the trees so I couldn't see it anymore. *********************************************** Also on one of my previous sightings, I didn't mention that I also had seen a strange star constellation.........or so I thought. Now that I have thought it over,and I have tried to find that same star constellation, I think that it might have been something else. *********************************************** It sort of looked like a paddle of very large bright stars then it had a huge mass of other stars around it and there were small shooting stars that kept going through this mass of stars. It was HUGE. Maybe it was just that, a constellation but I just thought that I would mention it in case someone else has seen some strange star thing too. ****************************************** Well that is about it for now.

Phoenix and Scottsdale police and Rural/Metro Fire Department dispatchers received calls from residents reporting a plane going down in ""a ball of fire."" Another caller reported seeing a meteor.  ""It was a large ball of flame,"" Rural/Metro Fire Department spokeswoman Alison Cooper said. ""It was very large. It was seen as far as Washington state."" advertisement  Kip and Valerie Wachter saw the fireball pass over their heads about 10:15 Sunday evening as they walked north of Pinetop.  ""The colors were a bright green, red, white. The size was about three times wider than its length. It seemed to emanate a low, soft swishing sound as it passed overhead,"" the Wachters wrote in an e-mail to The Republic.  Steve Kates, a Chandler resident and science journalist known as ""Dr. Sky,"" said that description, particularly the noise, was consistent with meteoric activity.  Most meteors visible on earth occur high in the atmosphere and these ""shooting stars"" are about the size of a grain of dust, said Jeffrey Hall, associate director at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff.  ""The great majority are these tiny particles moving through the atmosphere at a high rate of speed,"" Hall said. ""Larger ones tend to be moving more slowly and produce a much larger trail through the sky.""  Between 10 and 50 meteor events occur over the Earth each day, according to the American Meteor Society, with the vast majority happening over oceans and out of eyesight. Meteors lose mass and decelerate as they enter the atmosphere, with only the largest slamming into the Earth and forming a crater. Scientists think the Barringer Crater, near Winslow, was formed by an iron meteor about 50,000 years ago.  Kates said a meteorite the size of a human fist could have created the light show West Coast residents witnessed Sunday night.  Rural/Metro responded to the north side of Saguaro Lake but found no sign of damage or destruction from a plane crash, Cooper said. Witnesses reported seeing the meteor travel from southwest to northeast.  Hall said the meteor likely never made it to the ground.  ""This is not like a mountain coming into the atmosphere. It's more like the size of a softball,"" Hall said. ""Even something this bright probably burned up completely in the atmosphere.""

P.D.T.).  Object: Possibly a Meteor coming down to Earth, teardrop shaped (round with short pointed tail).  Coloration: very bright yellow (with duller yellow blotches).  Size: nearly the size of the Moon (which was in the Southern sky), possibly 3/4 to the size of a full Moon.  Azimuth: Using North as zero (0°), to South (180°), and therefore East (90°), the object was at first spotted at nearly 100° and by the time it disappeared over the horizon, it was perhaps 95° azimuth (Left to Right, it was just slightly more to our Right from straight ahead).  Angle of Elevation: closer to 35° than 30 when first spotted, and dropping to about 25° or 20° behind the horizon.  Duration: It was a couple of seconds before I discounted it as not being a reflected glare, and then close to 12 seconds of active watching (while driving, as there was no place to pull over and it was easy to watch while driving as it was so low now and just right of straight ahead). The distance was impossible to tell, but it had the illusion of dropping out toward North Bend or Lake Sammamish.  After: As it disappeared from sight, I called a friend who lives on the West shore of Lake Sammamish to see if they were ok, and to see if they had seen it.  They had there back to the east deck window and had seen it get very bright and then turned to see it glowing over the East horizon.  As they went outside, they heard neighbors talking on their docks asking each other, ""What the heck was that?""  Reporting: I called information for ideas of who to report this to ... I left a message at a Meteor organization in Kent, and then called and left a message at the University of Washington Astronomy Department in Seattle, and then called and spoke with Jennifer at KIRO Radio (710AM) in Seattle, who suggested I also report the event to the folks here at UFOCenter.com (and thank you for your kind call!) even if it was a meteor or such, as it had not yet been identified as such.  POV: My point of view was driving Easterly on the Evergreen Bridge (Hwy 520) from Seattle, Washington toward Lake Sammamish just East of the center of the bridge when I noticed one very large yellow circular shape appearing to drop from the sky slightly to the East-Southeast side of the bridge, but still almost as high as the moon which was in the Southern sky.  I moved my head around a bit to be sure it was not simply a glare on the windshield, but it kept its path in spite of my dramatic movements. My passenger was also astonished at what we were seeing; as it was so large and not shooting ""across"" the sky as stars sometimes do (my passenger is an adult female, about my age).  Personal Info:  My name is Tim Oldfield, I'm 51 years of age ... back in college to work toward my Masters Degree ... just got my eyes checked at the optometrist 3 weeks ago and they are fine and unchanged (and I have fresh contacts on).

The sighting was also observed by my 26 year old son.  We were standing in a downtown parking lot (near Shea's Theater) when I spotted the bright star Arcturus in the eastern sky. As I looked at the star I noted a small (smaller than the star) object emitting dim, non-blinking orange light moving toward and somewhat above Arcturus from the south (my right) heading north.  At first I thought it must be a very distant aircraft, but its later behavior negated that assumption. 	As this first object moved past the star, I noticed a second, identical object following behind the first, and moving just below Arcturus.  Once past the star, the top object (first one sighted) seemed to slow while the second object caught up with it.  They moved close to one another – and then completely reversed course, now moving south (toward my right).  As they did so, the bottom object engaged in a rapid up-down zig-zag pattern, which removed all doubt that these things were ordinary aircraft. 	The two objects then flew off together, maintaining a constant separation, and appeared to circle around the city to the south, west, and then north.  We were passengers in a car with other people so finally had to quit our observations before the objects disappeared.  Again, these were tiny (compared to most visible stars), dim reddish or orange lights.  We could not make out any shapes beyond that. 	I am a PhD professor, geologist and planetary scientist.

I am a trained weather spotter of 20 years and was atop on of the higher hills in the area watching a front moving through to the south and east of my location. At the moment of this incident there was about 50% cloud cover and a significant storm in progress to the south and east. While looking to the west and south I noticed a bright light which I assumed to be collision lights. After about 2 minutes the light had gained speed and lowered its altitude. Assuming I correctly identified landmarks it flew past it was possibly 4 miles out. The object moved to an alitude of tree level no more than 60 feet off the ground following the contours of the pasture directly west of my position. At this point I gauged the approximate diameter of this object at 50 yards. The object had a fixed but irregular shape, resembling in my mind a fried egg. There was a semblance of a dome atop the object. This object was luminescent; best described as mother of pearl. The object made no noise, neitther in motion or stationary. The object stopped about 100 or so yards short of SW 100th Street. There appeared to be a small unlit object in the creekbed below the object. There was movement, but I could only see movement with the occasional lighting from the southeast. If I had to guess it appeared to be something that looked like a jack in the box toy. A square object with a long curving appendage and what looked like a ice cream scoop atop the appendage. Although the lighting was poor I could discern it  moving about the area, but it was difficult to see if the object was on the ground, on wheels, or otherwise. This event happened in about 5 minutes time. The object then rose up to approx. 200 feet (?) There was a shrill sound from the pasture (sounded like nails on chalkboard) and was an uncomfortble sensation. The object moved away slowly at first and seemed to gain speed as it moved off to the north and then back west again. I was ! admitedl y frightened and left the area immediately. Even crossing washed out roads in flood waters, so as to not turn back towards the area of the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Ever since I was a little kid, I have watched the skies.  I love to star gaze, even if it makes my neck sore.  I have lived 5 minutes from O’Hare Airport for 32 years.   I know full well what a helicopter or plane look and sound like.   I have seen just about every aircraft the military displays at over 20 air shows in my lifetime.  I have seen tons of meteors when I lived Arizona for 8 years. On Saturday, June 07, 2008 at 9:22 p.m., I saw a huge white orb brighter than the moon head directly over my house in a southeastern direction.   The orb was silent, it moved slowly and smoothly.  It was at a pretty high altitude, so the size of this thing was astonishing.  I reported the sighting to MUFON and the National UFO Reporting Center.  Ever since that night, I watched the same areas of the sky…hoping I would see it again. I did see it again tonight, June 17, 2008 at 10:15 p.m.  I saw what I thought was a star just light up so bright, and move slowly downward, it hovered for a couple of seconds, and I could see the shape of the craft this time.  It was definitely triangular.  The light that came off light up the sky all around it like an electrical charge, and the color of the light was a very bright bluish-white.  After it hovered, it turned and took off an absolutely incredible rate of speed, and followed a commercial flight that was heading due north.  It easily caught up to the flight, and passed it up as if it were standing still. I have seen some weird things up in the sky, but this was by far the most unexplainable thing I have ever seen.    Only the Joint Strike Fighter Lightening II, a helicopter, or a Harrier Jet can hover like that.  All I know is…both times I have seen this thing it was silent.  It is my theory the only HUMAN thing I know of that could fly like that is…the Air Force/NASA experimental TR3-A or TR3-B “Night-Walker”, which is part of the Aurora program.  Or it is an alien craft from another world.  A shooting star or meteor does NOT hover like that, and when I see them…they flash across the sky quickly.  I have never seen a meteor turn either.  I will be out there with a video camera from this night on.  I am located in Park Ridge, IL, but perhaps worldwide…if you want to see what I am seeing, check the skies at night…find the big dipper star formation.  I have seen other orbs fly either due north through the big dipper, or just east of the big dipper. You may dismiss it as a plane at a high altitude…until it stops up there.   They might deny it, but the O’Hare radar has to be picking these things up…unless they are cloaked or stealth.  I am located about 3 miles northeast of O’Hare. Check it out…experimental or alien…it sure is fun to wonder.  Once you see it…you will believe. ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from the same source.

I first saw the object from a distance of about 3 ½ miles. At first I presumed it was a helicopter as there is a helicopter club within 12 miles of the area. It was a very bright white/pale blue light and stood out as there are no homes or other light sources for another 5 miles further down the road. When I got within 1 ½ miles of the object, I began to doubt if it was a helicopter as the entire body of the object seemed to be illuminated. Travelling at a constant speed of 45 mph towards the object, I slowed to 25 mph when I got within ½ mile of the object. The object was about 200 ft to the right of the road. I passed the object slowly at about 10 mph just to observe it. It stood completely still, and was completely covered in a bright pale blue light. My view of the object was obscured slightly by a 6 foot tall hedge, but I could still see it clearly. The object was a tube shape or ‘cigar’ shape and I would estimate it was almost 90 foot long and 10 foot high and wide. Although I am not absolutely positive about this, I recall it making a faint sizzling sound, but can’t be sure as at the time I was not concentrating on the sound. With my passengers side window open by two inches, the temperature in my trucks cabin increased by about 50 degrees, and I believe that this heat was produced by the object. It was a quiet night and for the entire 20 mile journey I took, I saw nobody on the road, nobody driving or anybody walking. I presume that the object was in the field before I left Maryville and it was still visible in my wing-mirror for another 2 miles after I passed it. I’ve known this stretch of road for more than 25 years and use it as many as 8 times a week and have never seen anything like this before.  On the 19th I used the road again and stopped at the side of the field where the object was on the 18th.

The craft flew in our direction for about 7 or 8 seconds growing larger and then banked sharply to its right, bearing South.  As it turned, it gained altitude and speed.  Best guess of altitude was between 2,000 to 5,000 feet.  Speed at the turn was between 400 and 600 knots.  Speed as the craft rose out of the turn and disappeared increased to well over 1,500 knots and kept increasing as the craft disappeared. We live in Ventura next to the Oxnard airport (very small, local airport) and are also in the flight path of LAX for large jets going to Europe.  We see many passenger planes at night at about 20,000 feet.  Being an avid sky-watcher and novice astronomer I am very well aware of altitude and speed of objects in the sky.  I feel VERY confident of my estimate of altitude and speed.  I have never seen anything in my life move this fast and accellerate so rapidly.  Utterly astonishing! The craft made absolutely no sound and was very low and very close.  It was bright orange with no blinking lights, only a very bright glow.  As it grew closer, before it turned it seemd to be a diamond shape.  Upon turning, the craft left a small aura behind it that dissipated almost instantly.  It was not a lingering contrail like an airplane would leave.  Instead, it looked like vapor coming off the object from such an immediate change in direction and speed (air compression leading to vapor).",2008-07-05T00:00:00,34.29657455830389,-119.23991625441697

I got off of work around 11:30 PM on Wednesday, June 18th, 2008.  I went home and everything seemed normal until i went outside for a cigarette around 12:30 AM Thursday, June 19th.  I noticed out of the corner of my eye a quick flash of light. When I looked up, I saw an EXTREMELY faint light moving in very erratic patterns at an unbelievably fast speed.  Basically, it was zig-zagging in all different directions at a brightness and speed that made it hardly even noticeable. I went to go wake up my little brother and show him. He said he saw it too, but didn't give it much thought and went back to bed. I sat out there and watched for a bit longer until I noticed that the zooming, zig-zagging lights were EVERYWHERE. They weren't birds, nor shooting stars or airplanes or jets.  This is unlike anything I have ever seen before.  I went upstairs to film this happening on an old video camera that we have had since the 90's.  The camera did a very poor job picking up anything too strange because of how dark it was outside, the age of the camera, and the faintness of the lights. To make sure I wasn't going crazy, I called one of my friends to come over and watch the sky with me and he agreed. I got in my car to go pick him up. We got back to my house about ten minutes later, and this is when the weird stuff started happening.  Instantly, I noticed that there were more stars out than there were before I left.  I looked up and I saw one of them hovering, moving in very small circles.  This was not some star obscured by clouds as skeptics may say.  This thing was moving.  THEN we noticed that the moving light began shooting out other lights.  When they would shoot out, a very small trail of vapour was seen behind them but only for a second.  After a while, we noticed some patterns.  The lights really only moved when they shot out other lights (except of course those faint ""zooming zig-zaggers"" which went on all night). Also, we noticed just how many lights formed triangle shapes in the sky.  Most noticeably were three very bright lights which seemed to be directly above my house which formed an almost perfect triangle.  We continued to watch this amazing display until about 2:30 AM until my friend wanted me to give him a ride home. I dropped him off and came back ten minutes later.  Well, I ended up staying awake and watching the sky until about 5:30 AM because i was so mesmerized and frankly, a little scared.  The same things happened until I went to bed. As a sidenote, I should aslo mention that police ad ambulance sirens could be hear literally ALL NIGHT LONG.  there were non-stop sirens going on for at least 4 hours straight. I don't know if this has to do with anything, though. I woke up very tired and sore in the neck (probably from staring up all night) around 7:00 AM because I had class to go to at 8 AM.  As I was driving to school, I couldn't help but notice that the ""zoomers"" were still there!  Well I went on through the rest of the day until I had to go to work at 2:00 PM.  I had told only one specific co-worker about the whole situation last night because everyone else would just laugh at me.  We waited until it was dark (probably around 10 PM) when I dragged him out of the warehouse that we work at to come outside and see for himself. I pointed out to him one of the clearly moving lights, but he just denied it.  He said it didn't look like it was moving at all. I got kind of upset, but he told me to just go home that night and film the sky because the camera wont play tricks on you like your eyes might.  So I did again, around 11:30 PM when I got off work.  I had a half an hours worth of tape but I only filmed maybe ten minutes of footage. The triangular star formations were still there, and I saw a very fast vapor streak in the sky which seemed to come down straight to Earth about 20 miles away.  After about five minutes (which seemed like an eternity) I started getting really nervous, paranoid, and itchy.  I felt like I was being watched. I couldn't do it any more. I was feeling so weird, I just ran inside and reluctantly went to bed. I woke up today (Friday, June 20th) feeling just fine.  I haven't even bothered to look up at the sky yet.  My friend is coming back in town from his school out in Dekalb, Illinois (NIU).  I plan on showing him tonight and telling him what I saw. We may or may not see something, and depending on how I'm feeling, I may not even care. I have been worrying myself sick these past couple days and these strange lights have given me an unhealthy obsession with the sky. All I really want to know is if anybody else from my area reported similar stories. Thanks for reading.",2008-07-05T00:00:00,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089

The sky was still dark with a clear view of the stars. While viewing the stars, we noticed a very large bright light, slightly larger then a satellite, and its altitude was much higher then that of a plane. This ""light"" began to move from its position in the sky downwards, at about a 45 degree angle, with a significant speed. This object made abrupt quick movements as though it was shaking.   It would occasionally speed up, then slow down. It continued this pattern until it was almost directly above us, and we noted that it was not a plane. It was silent, and every so often a very small tail (ray, or spark) would be visible upon it. The ""light"" seemed to have a reddish glow emitting off of it every so often. After passing over us, it switched direction and began to hover downwards, slower than before. After watching it for a while longer, it then vanished.

(This is a little more than hour from the time of this writing, so the memory is still fresh and vivid). I was on my bicycle riding east on the Colonial Parkway (James City County) when I spotted an object over the James River, moving from east to west at a very slow speed. At first I thought it may have been a kite because it was a very windy day (the winds were gusting out of the SW at 20-30mph) and people do come out and fly their kites from the beaches when the winds are good. But when I came to an open spot in the road unobstructed by trees I stopped to get a better look and decided it was much too large to be a kite. It is a about a mile across the channel to the Surry Station and what I saw appeared to be very near the station’s twin domes and it must have been at least as large as they are, and perhaps larger. Besides that the object was moving very slowly against the wind, left to right from my vantage point, and its upper surface caught the sunlight and reflected like a sheet of aluminum foil. Its underside was dark. Then I thought that it might be an advertising balloon or dirigible, but the shape did not seem right. This was definitely a flattened disk. And, because it was so windy it did not seem like a good day to take a blimp up. (And, with security so high these days it does not seem logical that anyone would be permitted to get that close to power station. I have seen military helicopters on training missions over the river, but even they keep a wide berth from the power plant.)  I have eliminated the possibility of helicopters and small aircraft because, as I say, this object was hovering/drifting and appeared to be making a very leisurely circuit of the power plant. I walked down to water’s edge to see if I could get a better look, but without binoculars I couldn’t make out any other useful details. I watched it like this for a good 15-20 minutes. In that time it completely circled the station, moving against the wind. It appeared to correct its angle at times, very slowly rocking up and down. I then decided to hurry home, grab my binoculars and camera and see if I might get a better look. It took me about ten minutes to bike home from there and another fifteen to get back on the Parkway by car. But, by the time I returned to my original position the object was gone. I drove a few miles down the Parkway hoping that it might have drifted elsewhere, but the sky was empty except for a few white clouds. Now, I wish I had stayed until it left. It would have been interesting to see which way it went. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF THIS REPORT)) Response To So-Called Explanations Of Previous Sighting I am responding to Mr. ((name deleted)) ""explanation"" of what I saw on the 19th of May 2008. His statement that there is a blimp factory on the NC/VA border is patently false. There is a company with an office in Durham, NC, called Flairships that leases out aerial advertising blimps to various companies, but they did not have any blimps in the air over SE Virginia on the day in question. I contacted other companies that utilize airships (including Goodyear and MetLife), and none of them had a blimp within 200 miles of the James River on that day.  Having seen advertising blimps on various occasions over the years, I can assure you that this was not a blimp. I had a close-up view of it under ideal conditions. What I saw had no writing of any kind on its sides.  Nor did it have a crew cabin on its belly, a tail assembly, or motors or any other protuberances from its surface. The craft I saw was perfectly smooth and silent.  It was also in the range of 300-400 feet long. Even the largest advertising blimps in use today are only about 200 feet long. And they, like the Goodyear blimp, have the company logo prominently displayed on their hull.  Otherwise, what’s the use of having an advertising blimp?   The idea that a blimp might have been blown from north to south by a southwest wind is laughable.  If anything, it would have been blown towards Williamsburg, not away from it. As I said before, the craft I saw moved strongly INTO the wind and was not at its mercy.  And, with all of the empty real estate it could possibly encounter along the river, it chose to stop just opposite a nuclear power station?  That, in itself, is telling. I called the Jamestown airport (which is less than a mile from my house) two hours after my sighting, and the fellow in charge assured me that there was nothing even remotely like a blimp in the air that day. Unfortunately, the local airport does not use radar, so he couldn’t tell me just what may have been flying over the river at noon that day. The “very highly restricted military intelligence community/base” he refers to must be Camp Peary, aka “The Swamp.” This is the well-known CIA training base on the York River. It lies on the other side of Williamsburg about 5 miles from where I made my sighting. Having lived here for the past 15 years, I too have heard tales of remotely piloted vehicles like the Predator drone flying over the base and the nearby York River. But they are never seen over the historic areas or the James River. I know what a Predator looks like, and with its sleek body, long wings and bulbous nose, it was the complete opposite of what I saw. I suspect you could pack twenty Predators inside of what I saw. Having seen this alien craft up close (at first from less than half a mile away) and then at a distance of about three miles, I am absolutely certain that it was not a helicopter, “military item” (whatever that means), or small airplane. I spent 6 years in the Navy and believe my eyesight is still good enough to distinguish helicopters, Ospreys, and fixed winged aircraft from the absolutely unique craft I witnessed. And the idea that I’d mistake an ultralight for a 300 feet long craft leaves me speechless. I have seen ultralights fly over directly my house while out doing yard work, and I’d know their shape anywhere. Besides, they make as much noise as a flying lawnmower. What I saw was silent. In summation, I’d like to add that I’ve attempted to get in contact with Mr. Ebersole, as he so obligingly left his phone number, bur he has so far refused to return my calls. All I know of him is that he lives in Virginia Beach, about 60 miles from the sighting area, which, by the way, is home to Oceana NAS. Just up the peninsula a few miles is Langley AFB, a first response base which is tasked to defend US airspace in the event of hostile activity (such as 9/11). This part of Virginia is home to at least a half dozen very sensitive military bases. I am speculating here, but I suspect that the idea that an alien craft could literally “stroll” past these bases, at midday, right over the heads of millions of people, and not be detected, much less confronted, and then loiter next to a nuclear power station, is something that no one in the armed forces or the intelligence community is willing to admit to. There also appears to be a coordinated effort to discredit valid sightings. ((e-address deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",2008-06-12T00:00:00,,

I fly gliders in Surry and surrounding counties and am familiar with aircraft in the area.  The Coast Guard (not Ft Eustis - Army) provide security with helicopters for the nuclear plant.  Just after 9/11 they would land at night, with permission, at our glider field that is only a few miles from the plant.  They could respond within moments of any threat to the plant yet not be detected before hand.  One of our glider club members is one of their pilots.  There is also a blimp factory on the Virginia / North Carolina border that often fly blimps in the area. (The Blackwater private mercenary intelligence company along with many other military black ops are in this region too) The blimps prefer calmer days and usually stay further south, but it isn't a requirement and could account for the hovering effect by flying into the wind to get back to their field upwind.  They normally don't fly that close to the eastern part of the area, along the James River, because it is a longer flight back. A strong s/w wind could blow them over there and their small engines would work hard to get them back to N. Carolina.  If they were there they may have been sightseeing over the James River.  Jamestown, Colonial Williamsburg, and the small Williamsburg airport are on the east side of James River and the airport could be used for an emergency landing if the blimp were in trouble. On the Jamestown, James City County side of the river where the witness was standing also is home to a very highly restricted military inteligence community / base, where they are known to test experimental spy craft.  Local pilots have witnessed small unmanned recon aircraft being flown over the base.  Pilot in the air away from the restricted airspace but close enough to see it.  I strongly suspect the witness saw one of the above explanations.  It could have been a very planned flight by the plant security, but I suspect it was a blimp, helicopter, possibly an off course military item, or maybe even a small airplane waiting to come in at the Williamsburg field.  There are very strict rules against flying near the nuclear plants.  Pilots are not supposed to ""loiter"" over them in an airplane.  Whatever that means.  If a blimp were blown over the plant by the wind it would be an embarrassment to the plant to admit nothing was done.  There is also some ultra light activity in the area.  It may have been unidentifiable to a distant viewer but to someone near it may have not been an unusual object to be seen in those skies.   Hope this helps.

It lies on the other side of Williamsburg about 5 miles from where I made my sighting. Having lived here for the past 15 years, I too have heard tales of remotely piloted vehicles like the Predator drone flying over the base and the nearby York River. But they are never seen over the historic areas or the James River. I know what a Predator looks like, and with its sleek body, long wings and bulbous nose, it was the complete opposite of what I saw. I suspect you could pack twenty Predators inside of what I saw. Having seen this alien craft up close (at first from less than half a mile away) and then at a distance of about three miles, I am absolutely certain that it was not a helicopter, “military item” (whatever that means), or small airplane. I spent 6 years in the Navy and believe my eyesight is still good enough to distinguish helicopters, Ospreys, and fixed winged aircraft from the absolutely unique craft I witnessed. And the idea that I’d mistake an ultralight for a 300 feet long craft leaves me speechless. I have seen ultralights fly over directly my house while out doing yard work, and I’d know their shape anywhere. Besides, they make as much noise as a flying lawnmower. What I saw was silent. In summation, I’d like to add that I’ve attempted to get in contact with Mr. Ebersole, as he so obligingly left his phone number, bur he has so far refused to return my calls. All I know of him is that he lives in Virginia Beach, about 60 miles from the sighting area, which, by the way, is home to Oceana NAS. Just up the peninsula a few miles is Langley AFB, a first response base which is tasked to defend US airspace in the event of hostile activity (such as 9/11). This part of Virginia is home to at least a half dozen very sensitive military bases. I am speculating here, but I suspect that the idea that an alien craft could literally “stroll” past these bases, at midday, right over the heads of millions of people, and not be detected, much less confronted, and then loiter next to a nuclear power station, is something that no one in the armed forces or the intelligence community is willing to admit to. There also appears to be a coordinated effort to discredit valid sightings. ((e-address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides little contact information.

After reaching the highest part of the road before 165 (a bit before Jelly Belly factory) I saw a silver or very shiny object in the sky directly over the road.

I slowed down to a complete stop at the yield and observed the object continue to sit stationary over the road.

I was in my dorm room on the third floor which faces Parking Lot 5, when I heard the same sound that I had heard a week and a half prior coming from the UFO. Again it sounded similar to that of a toy plane, but I think it’s buzz is a little bit higher pitched than a toy plane. I looked out of my window and there it was, the UFO outlined with blue lights, flying closer to my housing community. I ran outside, this time determined to get a video of it, but when I went outside, I realized that I wasn’t wearing my glasses so it just looked like a small thin line of blurry blue lights. So I ran back up to my room, grabbed my glasses, and ran back outside. I could see it clearly now, flying overhead like last time, in what seemed like the direction of the 405 freeway. I ran towards the parking lot so that I could get a better video of it, but unfortunately, all that my video camera was able to pick up was a spot of blue light. There were other students in the parking lot also. There were a couple of guys by their car, one of them I heard saying to his friend, “It’s a UFO, it has to be.” After all, it was in plain sight, flying fairly low to the ground, probably no higher than one of those privately owned propeller planes that I see a lot of flying around Irvine. I’ve read other UFO reports from people who have seen them near the UC Irvine campus and it seems like there are two common sightings: one has blue lights and the other has white lights. From my dorm room, as well as when I saw it without my glasses, it looked like it had blue lights. But when I got a closer look in the parking lot, it seemed to have white lights. Maybe the lights look different depending on how close you are. But the lights themselves looked slightly different this time; t! hey didn ’t necessarily look like clean rectangles that outlined the sides like last time, instead they seemed to have an edge, sort of like a cross between circles and triangles, that outlined the edge. And there seemed to be some sort of a flickering light underneath, within its circular shape that flickered every now and then. It stayed flying in the same place for about ten minutes, flying at different angles as well as hovering in place for a few seconds at one point. I also saw a helicopter that seemed to be flying towards its direction. After a few minutes, I ran to another spot near the parking lot to hopefully get a better quality video of it but a few seconds after I got there, it slowly started flying away behind the trees and apartments and disappeared from my sight. There were another couple of guys in the parking lot who obviously saw it. One of them was waiting in the parking lot while his friend ran across the street when there were no cars coming and tried to run up the hill where the apartments are located to see where it was going. I doubt he was able to locate where it had gone because he came back a couple minutes later looking a little disappointed; so was I that I couldn’t get a better video of it.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,33.68653500837521,-117.79240477386935

We were playing basketball in the driveway of their house for about an hour, and people began to leave. We were about to go inside when I noticed an object moving through the sky. It looked like a large satellite, and it was moving at a constant speed. Being a pretty big ufo enthusiast myself, I pointed it out and we all started watching it. It soon started to make wobbles and turns that no satellite or aircraft could have made (it was way too high up to be a plane). I was wondering if it was my eyes playing tricks on me when it completely stopped in the middle of the sky. It hovered in one spot for about 40 seconds, and in that time it grew extremely bright. At that point we all knew it was no satellite we were looking at.  The object started moving again and flew into the distance. There were 5 of us watching it by now, and we called another person who lived down the block to come outside and see what was going on. We soon saw another object in the sky, and very faint, smaller dots appeared around it. The dots shot off in different directions, some moving extremely fast and some slower. One big dot stayed stationary. As we watched these dots (especially the big one) they began to change colors and it almost looked like they would split into 2 dots and then reassemble. One of the people I was with saw a red object leave the biggest dot and shoot towards the ground. All of us saw very faint shooting star-like objects flying by the area of the biggest dot. A HUGE orange object soon flew through a small area of the sky in a very shooting star-like motion, and we all saw it. At this point there were six of us and we decided to get in the car and drive about a half mile away to a place where there was less light and more open space to watch.  We relocated to a parking lot with a field next to it, and we watched the objects that were still in the air. We saw some movement but not as much as before. We noticed that in the far corners of the sky there were flashing dots. Pretty much every direction you turned you were able to see something in the sky. Then, the big one. My friend went around to the other side of the building we were parked by to pee. He saw something in the sky and called all of us over. It was an object hovering in the air with extremely unusual lights. This one was much, much closer than any of the other things we had seen, and was actually only about a hundred feet from the ground from what it looked like. We ran over and watched it as it started moving one way, completely changed directions, and then completely turned around again. It flashed extremely brightly at least 3 times and then began to display very different patterns of lights. It almost could have been mistaken for a plane's lights at one point, but the lights kept changing and the object was moving very strangely. It disappeared over the treeline.  After this object we saw 3-4 plane-like objects move overhead, about 5 minutes apart from each other. They all came from the same direction, all were silent, and all of them headed in the same direction towards the first object we saw. They had blinking white and red lights on them but the amount of lights and the speed they were traveling was unusual. Me and a friend saw one final object, WITH blinking red and white lights, fly in the same direction. We thought it could be a plane but I watched it carefully just in case. When it passed where we were standing it began to move up and down as it was flying, making weird movements that planes do not make. Overall the entire experience lasted about 2-2 1/2 hours. These were definite UFOs, we all saw them. It was like absolutely nothing I have ever seen before, and the same goes for the 5 credible witnesses I was with. I'm sure other people saw these also, as some of these objects were not subtle at all. Again, these objects moved in ways planes cannot, in erratic, jerky movements. However, they were definitely under some kind of intelligent control, as some seemed to interact with each other. Each of the 5 people I was with will tell the exact same story if asked, and we all saw what we saw.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,44.8205,-92.9256

What I found particularly strange about this object was not only the direction in which it was travelling (from south to north) but the speed in which it was travelling.  You can normally watch a commercial aircraft (at high altitude) flying from east to west, wast to east, horizon to horizon for several minutes as it passes over. We viewed this object for only few seconds through the skylight and as it passed our view and as I exited the house through the back door, was only able to observe it for few more short seconds before it passed from my line of sight. In addition, the vapor trail left behind by the object dissapated very quickly whereas the normal trails left by high flying commercial craft seem to linger long after the aircraft are out of sight (really don't know if that is significant or not). As I stated previously, I don't know if this was an actual UFO sighting, but it was a very strange event. My daughter sees planes flying overhead regularly, but she was excited enough about watching this object as it sped over us that she brought it to my attention. If there is any info about any commercial flights on this paticular tragectory, I would be interested in hearing about it as it would set my mind at ease about the whole event. I should add that I am an amateur ! UFO enth usiast (I have never seen fit to report a UFO sighting) and would not want to waste anyones time chasing a false or easily explainable sighting.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,,

The event happened on January 1st, 2007.  It was an exceptionally dark night; usually there is some minimal light pollution out in all directions from my house, but it seemed much lesser that night in retrospect.  I was doing work as I generally do at that time of night with my window blinds up, as I like to see the sky.  It happened to be a very nice, clear night out without any clouds.  While working away, I noticed out of the corner of my right eye, to the south, something with lights in the sky.  I glanced at it and realized that it wasn't either an airplane or helicopter.  As it was so dark that night, I was unable to make out any shape of the object.  It was emitting absolutely no sound, which is the first thing that struck me as strange.  The object was very low to the ground, far too low for a fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft; by my best estimation, somewhere between 100-150 feet from the ground.  The object had four lights that I could see; two in the front and the other two swept out to the sides and back a bit.  All four of the lights seemed to be emitting a light that looked color-wise to a warm flourescent light, but emitted light as strong and as clear as an industrial bulb would.  I would also like to note that these lights did not seem to shine any light down onto the ground, even from the low altitude.  The object was moving at a quite slow, steady pace, estimated at about 20-30 MPH.  It moved from south to north without stopping, changing course or speed as far as I watched.  Had I been in my senses, I would have jumped up and ran to the front door; I was, however, stunned at what I had just witnessed, wondering if it could have been something ordinary.  I believe it was not, however, due to the facts that a) I saw no landing lights or blinking lights on the craft, and b) There is no landing strip and/or airport north of my house; the nearest one is about three miles south-east.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,44.9412471106758,-123.00423516160626

The night was black, no stars, with light, intermittent rain falling.  As I drove down H-1, there were numerous other cars present when the incident occurred.   I observed in the sky an unusual aircraft flying overhead from the mountains towards the Pacific Ocean with two extremely bright lights (a small white light, and an extremely bright pink light) far too bright to be normal anti-collision lights.  My estimation is that the distance of the object from myself was probably less than five miles.  The object appeared to be operating at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet above ground level and maintained steady altitude as it headed towards the ocean, flying above what appeared to be the Kalihi area.  During that time, green fireworks were being fired over the city at that time, but the object I observed was by no means the explosion of a firework or a signal flare because it did not suddenly ascend or slowly descend as one might expect of a parachute-retarded flare; rather, the object moved slowly on a level flight path from the mountains to the ocean.   I could not see any distinguishing features on the object, because its lights were so bright.  As I drove down the road, I continued to visually track the object for a period of approximately two minutes, when suddenly the object disappeared completely.  I must emphasize strongly that the object did not ""fade away"" or fly behind a building or mountain causing it to be obscured from view, but rather completely vanished as if one minute it was there, the next minute it was gone. That evening I was completely alert, not fatigued in any way, and I had not consumed any alcoholic beverages.  I am not currently taking any form of medication and I am in good health.

The night before my sighting, my sister told me of a peculiar event of her own. About a week before she had seen strange aircrafts about a half hour apart. She described each of the craft as a perfect circle of light that looked like an over-sized star or planet, which was moving strangely around the night sky. When she paid very close attention to it, trying to figure out what it was, the circle of light disappeared, and was replaced by three smaller, dimmer lights, which formed an equilateral  triangle, as if it were trying to look less bright. The three lights then got dimmer and dimmer, until they disappeared altogether. I was a little skeptical. I believed she saw something, but I thought she must have been mistaken, and that it was really just a helicopter. However, early the next morning, I went outside to go to the bus stop, and in the sky were two circles of light slowly moving in random directions. They were definitely not helicopters, or any other kind of aircraft that I've ever seen. One of the crafts disappeared while I had my eye on the second one. I stood staring at it for about a minute, and then I remembered that my sister had said that it seemed to retreat only when she really tried to figure out what it was. So I focused all my attention on it. Then, The craft spun to show a different side, which had three dim lights that formed and equilateral triangle. I was so in awe, that i didn't think to get out my camera, and all I could do was stare at it. The bus arrived, and so my sighting came to an end. I felt like I had been ""visited,"" as crazy as it may sound, and I felt like it was because my sister tld me about her sighting. It was eerie.

Sighting  December 21,2007 17:20hrs. Cloud like object.  I am a  60 year old business owner in WPB,FL. I was a Sgt. in USMC Air Corp.and know aircraft/atmospheric/astronomical events.I've seen aircraft on fire in the air, flare drops, rockets launch,blimps,meteors,comets, space debris ect.both day and night. My wife and I were driving home heading due west when I saw at our 12 oclock what appeared to be a small ,flattened oval shape, bright cloud about 50 degrees above the western horizon ,the sky was otherwise totally cloudless and blue, visibility unlimited. My second assessment was an aircraft and contrail at high altitude,  yet the shape just wasn't right.It was larger, brighter and more rounded at the front trailing to the rear but overall very short and unchanging in length or appearance. We were about 3 miles due west of Palm Beach International and a 737 which was climbing out on take off was of equal size .Meaning the cloud/object size was visually equal to the wingspan of the low flying 737, perhaps 3 inchs at arms length. The object was moving S and after 5 minutes was at our 8 oclock and dropping to 20 degrees above the horizon as we drove due west. I then watched the object move to the west of it trajectory as we were stopped at a long traffic light. I say move instead of turn because the object changed course to the west 20 degrees of view within 30 seconds but did not change shape, no curve to contrail,no change of aspect, just change of direction and location .It then dropped slowly below the horizon.to the SW. I judged its westerly turn as its view was briefly obscured by several concrete light poles at the intersection . We were stopped , watching through the drivers side window, the object began traversing from our left to right. First visible to the left of the poles then crossing behind and visable on their rightside. If it had not changed direction it would have simply settled below the horizon maintaining it movement to our left. Also the cloud appearance never changed, like a still photo of it moving accross the sky.Very strange event.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,26.70504529494382,-80.13514009831461

The objects looked bright (orange to red like) balls or masses and were producing no sound. They seemed to travel at exactly the same speed to exactly the same point of the sky, were all quite high up and each one faded and vanished after hovering for at least 2 minutes in the same track. We witnessed at least 4 in an hourly amount of time. After the first hour, to our amazement, we then witnessed 4 objects side by side following exactly the same path, behaviour and speed as the first sightings.  We managed to capture strong evidence on digital camera, and when the images were downloaded to our personal pc, by zooming in you can clearly make out a red UFO like object in all images with what appears to be windows or lights in a Cigar shape. The object is surrounded by what appears to be red mist.  Whilst we appreciate that it is november the 5th (british firework / bonfire night) -we have studied these images clearly - and it clearly shows these are no fireworks. We suspect a major UFO sighting if no feasible answer / reason is met.  We also managed to capture at least (rough estimate 4-5 minutes) live video on camcorder of these objects which clearly show bright masses moving across the sky.

I noticed the moon was very bright you can see little puffs of clouds in the sky here and there. I went inside grabbed my dog went outside so she can do her business. Looking north towards plainsboro/princeton a big bright fast moving light shot from south to north at an incredible speed I was so scared I thought something crashed in the corn field off old trenton rd I ran upstairs told my girlfriend and told her I would be right back I walked down the street thinking it was a small plane or something that crashed but there is nothing there. I was scared confused as I began walking back I just glanced over my shoulder to the side of me every now and then because I could not explain what I seen. Something caught my eye half way home to the north west of me I would say 5 miles or more in that direction I watched a big diamond shaped thing made up of lots of flashing lights but these lights seemed like they would fade colors similar to the effect you see from fiber optic tree light. It moved side to side slowly like it did not know which direction to go then the thing shot up to an altitude of about 2000ft just below cloud cover then made a sharp turn heading south so fast it penetrated the cloud then went straight up to the clear sky where all you can see is this amazing fast tiny light move around like a star then disapeared. Please I dont want anyone to think I am a nut or anything but to me this makes no sense I am beating my head trying to explain this I have one question what are you supposed to do when you experience something like this? the cops wont believe you if they do come out they will think you are a wack job. is not like I have a contact phone number for air traffic controller. I know someone else had to see this because they are always planes in the air flying above to philly and newark airports as well as mcguiress air force base so I would think if you where a pilot you had to see this not to mention people driving on old trenton road,2007-02-01T00:00:00,,

Incase you thought this was a hoax, I will explain the occurence of which happened within the estimated time period we described.  The first object we saw travelled from west to east, or south-west to east, it was bright orange to red in colour, travelling at a fairly low speed, it then stopped altitude estimate: 1 1/2 miles, before gradually fading and dissapearing over a time spand of approx 2 minutes. This was then followed on a regular interval on the same track and stopping at exactly the same position in the skyline. Then approx an hour after this started, we then sighted four of the same objects grouped together and converging in the same area before dissapearing.  We took the photo(s) on a digital camera - we still have the original images on that camera, and the images I will email to you remain unedited. After we downloaded them onto hard drive, we zoomed in to discover that they appear to be a bank of lights surrounded in an orange haze - also some were diamond formation. We also have video footage captured on camcorder (but sadly the viewing quality is not brilliant due to night-time filming - keeps going out of focus).  Being bonfire night we appreciate and are open to possible explanations or sceptism, but we certainly have not seen anything like this before - and the images clearly show that the object was not a firework.  According to a relative - their neighbours also sighted this event.  Hope you find this interesting and can work out a feasible explanation.  Kind Regards  Pete",2006-12-07T00:00:00,,

The objects appeared to be travelling int a straight line, one after the other, around 1000 metres from me and were about 3 or 4 hundred metres apart. I would estimate their speed to have been around 150mph and their size around 7-10 metres across. I initially thought they may be fighter craft flying a sortie locally as we have quite a lot of that sort of thing here but there was no engine sound and they were far too slow. I would have had them down as flames from hot air balloons but a) it was dark and b) they were too fast. I stopped the car when I saw the second light and lowered the window & switched off the engine. The third light then flew across my field of vision. As I already stated, there was no engine noise, just the sound of fireworks in the distance, which was strange. Their flight path seemed odd too. They were travelling in a straight line, in single file, yet once they were over the town they elevated by some distance, i would guess perhaps 50 metres and then continued their path north by north east towards the river Humber.

However what I experienced (if this is the right term) is beyond my imagination.  Tonight is Vov 4th (in this country the start f the Fireworks night to commemerate ""Guy Fawkes"" - what I saw tonight was not a firework.  I glanced out of my window at approx 8pm and initial thought the stars were very bright. On closer look there were 3 large red/orange lights in a triangualar formation. The two lights at the back being closer together than than front (I would suggest that ths spacing looked very close to a Star destroyer congiguration that would be seen in star wars (that probable puts pay to any credibility you may think I had).  I cam e down the stars and called to my mother to come out into the garden wereby she also confimd what I was seeing.  The three lights stayed perfectly aligned and travelled for approc 30 secs very slowly across the sky. At this time I ran back upsatiars to get a further view but the lights had disappeared. In the mean time my mother had come back into the house to call my father to take a look, when she looked out of the window again she too confirmed that the lights had gone.  What makes me think this was very odd:  1. We are on the flight path for planes from Heathrow to USA so are used to seeing lights in the sky and am used to determining sizes.  2. We are very close to FAIRFORD Airbase which over this last few weeks has been staging some sort of Nato Exercise. Local paepr stated that we would be seeing many different sorts of planes (we have, this was no plane).  3. Whaen I observed the ""Craft"" the lights were unusual in that they were reddish/orange slightlt diffused but large. All aircraft that I am familiar with have white strobes and I am used to the sizes.  4. When glancing up at this object although the only visible signs were the 3 orange/red lights the ""body"" of the craft blanked out all of the cloud making a very black shape against the night sky.  5. When the craft had disappeared the cloud could be seen again, thereby indicating to me that what had been between the 3 lights had infact been a solid object.  6. The configuaration of the lights would suggest to me that this was not 3 helicopters moving slowly in formation (it could not have been an aircraft to be flying so slowly).  What more can I say - I am not crazy, I do not believe in UFO's- Unless the military operating out of FAIRFORD airbase have got a secret vehicle the size of a star destroyer from the star wars films I have to belive that this is an encounter with something from space.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,,

The sun was bright, the air was somewhat hazy, and while it had been foggy earlier that morning, the sky was fairly clear. My son and I were just getting ready to start working on his book report when I received a phone call.  When the call was finished, my son, who has excellent eye site and is well-known in the family for his ability to spot birds and other wildlife, asked me to identify the flying object that he could see from our outdoor third story balcony which faces southwest towards Belvedere Island. It took me about twenty seconds to see what he was pointing at and, when I did, I could see a black speck that, at first, reminded me of a parachute.  But as I watched the object I noticed that, while it was moving slightly in the sky, it was not losing altitude the way a parachutist naturally would.  We own some fairly high power binoculars so I quickly retrieved them and attempted to fix my gaze on the object in question.  At first it was difficult to see the object because my arms were shaking slightly and the object was moving around in my view.  I then kneeled down on my knees, placed my elbows on the balcony railing so as to provide a stable platform, and then focused the binoculars.  At this point, I could see the object clearly.  It was a perfectly round dark colored disk (flat, no bulges) and it was in constant motion doing gentle and slow “figure eights” tilting and banking and turning slowly.  There were no markings on the exterior, no exhaust ports, no lines or markings of any type. The flying disc stayed in the same small area of the sky, it was in constant motion slowly turning and banking, thus it was not hovering horizontally over a fixed point. We live near the Golden Gate Bridge and I just checked online and the main tower of the bridge is about 750 feet high.  I estimate that this object was flying about three to four times higher than the main tower of the Golden Gate Bridge, or about 2,250 to 3,000 feet above sea level.  The disc was flying just south of Belvedere Island (I estimate four miles away), and the object appeared to be about 30 to 50 feet wide.  As mentioned, the flying disc was in constant motion and as it turned and banked slowly in the sky, the sun intermittently reflected off its surface with a very bright slightly golden colored reflection. From this, I guess that the object had a metallic exterior surface.  My son and I took turns looking through the binoculars and when I watched the object with my naked eye, it was difficult to see the small dark speck in the distance; however, as it turned and the sun reflected off its surface, the bright flash was quite noticeable to the naked eye. There is a fairy high amount of commercial aviation flights in our area and there is also a sightseeing seaplane that operates out of Sausalito and when these planes fly by, we can hear the noise.  The flying disk made no noise whatsoever that we could hear.  After about five to ten minutes of viewing, I went inside to get my camera, but when I returned, I could no longer see the object. I called my girlfriend to report what we had seen and then my son and I started to work on his book report.  After about 20 minutes or so, we heard the very loud and unmistakable sound of military jets flying in our area.  About three weeks earlier we had viewed the Blue Angles (F-18s) during Fleet Week and the sound was much the same, much louder than commercial planes.  We went out to the balcony and observed two military jets circling the area.  This was just after noon or about 12:15 to 12:30 pm.  We presumed that the jets were investigating what we had just seen but, subsequently, I heard that there was a military fly over for the 49er football game at Candlestick Point, so now I am not so sure. There is no question in my mind that we say a flying disc.  My son and I could both see it clearly.  About twenty years ago I worked for a commuter airline at the Sacramento (SMF) Airport and I believe that I am experienced at identifying airplanes in the air.  What we observed was definitely not an airplane, jet, blimp, ultralight, etc.   Given the time of day, the good visibility, and the location over San Francisco Bay, we figure that somebody else must have seen it as well, although I must admit, if not for excellent eye site of my son, I never would have noticed it myself.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,37.8914,-122.47280000000002

I am 44 years old. I was asked to give my credentials and experience with a couple of projects at NASA and Lockheed Martin. I have been a graphics designer for over 20 years and have done several special projects for NASA. One being the Consolidated Space Operations project, CSOC, in the early 90’s.  Also, I designed and edited the White Sands Missile Range Project proposal, the first full color proposal ever presented to NASA by Lockheed Martin.   I was educated on space operations, satellites, etc, etc. I was exposed to and had access to many reports about ongoing UFO projects and experiments involving NASA.  I know that I am not an expert but I believe that I know more than the average observer and have a bit more of an open mind to the possibilities.  Also, my father is a retired commercial airline pilot and has taught me a lot about space, meteorology and what is and is not ‘possible’.  We have watched many planes in the sky. I consider myself a liberal thinker and am not ignorant nor naive to the possibilities beyond my comprehension. I spend a lot of time outside at night observing the sky and know the difference between airplanes, satellites, stars and ‘flocks of geese’! I was certainly not expecting or looking for what I saw, but I can assure you that it was none of the before mentioned!!  I have never seen what I am about to do my best to explain to you or anything remotely similar and am very interested to know if there were any other reports of the same.  My eighteen year old daughter and I were outside at about 12:30 am that night. The sky was clear, the moon appeared to be full with a large, hazy circle around it and was directly above us, a bit northwest. There were a few clouds and scattered stars. We were looking southeast in the sky and noticed a bright light moving rapidly. It appeared to be at least 40 thousand feet up, perhaps higher. It was moving at a high rate of speed. In less than 5 minutes it had gone from just above the tree line, our horizon line, to directly above us.  To describe it best is to say that the ones that were closest to us were shaped much like an ant’s body, two parts connected. We first saw one and thought it to be a satellite. I know the basic movements in conjunction with Earth and placement of the satellites and these were much too close in placement to be satellites. I considered the fact that it was much too fast and much too high to be an airplane. As we were looking I noticed another one a little further south, then another further east. There were 4 or 5 all together at about the same height and were spread out across the sky and moving at the same rate of speed.  As I was watching and trying to somehow justify and explain them I noticed just beyond these were another ‘layer’ several thousand feet above them (smaller and dimmer) moving at the same rate of speed and the same direction. As we were watching I noticed another 3 or 4 come out from the tree line into view. They seemed to be following the others…again, at the same rate of speed and closer, as the first 4 or 5. In total there were at least 20, perhaps more in the distance. All moving the same direction, in a wide-spread, horizontal formation and all going the same rate of speed. Within 5 minutes they were all directly above us.  My daughter became frightened when I was not able to ‘explain’ them to her and went into the house. I watched them for just another minute or so and went in to report them. It was then that I found your website. I made the call the next morning and was called back on Monday, November 6th and asked to give this report.  I apologize for taking an extra few days to get you my account. I am, however, very interested to know of anyone else that saw them that night or any other night.  I am encouraging my daughter to put together her own account of what we saw that evening. It has opened her eyes to the possibilities beyond explanation. We have spoken a lot about what we witnessed and are positive it was something worth doing our best to report. Thank you for the work that you are doing.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,30.083900000000003,-95.63833333333334

I live in the west valley of Phoenix Arizona and at 9:05 PM my dog wanted to go outside in the back yard to relieve himself.  Since nights are nice this time of year I went out with him. I was looking to the west checking out Orion with my naked eyes (no telescope) when I noticed what I thought was a star to the south/southeast of Orion that shouldn’t be there. I like looking at the stars because it relaxes me, so I know which stars should be where even if I don’t know there names.  That star started out to be dull but you could still see it. Then I noticed it moving.  I could tell it was high up in what I thought was the atmosphere. It was moving down towards Earth at about an (if you figure a 180 degree angle is straight up and down) the thing was moving from a westerly position to an slight easterly position at about an angle of 150 degrees. Picture it moving almost straight down but with a slight angle as you look up at it. I seen the thing actually hit the Earths atmosphere and it became a bright white object for about a second, still moving in the exact same direction and angle. Then there was a big really bright burst of white light.  Picture being in a dark room and someone using there flash on a camera and that’s how bright the light was. This flash lasted for around two seconds. It was like this thing exploded. Instantly I thought it was a meteor and that was that. But, I saw an object come out of the light in that two seconds and I saw this object make a very sharp turn and headed off to the north. This thing wasn’t loosing in height. That’s a right angle turn from where it was originally heading.  The object I saw had to be a hugh object for me to be able to see it so far up in the atmosphere. This thing had no lights and no means of propulsion that I could see. But I could see it because it was glowing red hot. If you turn on an electric stove burner to high, wait until it gets real hot and! then tu rn off the lights, then turn off the burner, that’s how it was glowing. And just like the burner you could see it cooling down. There wasn’t any fire, or fire trail like a meteor, just the glow.  It wasn’t burning.  I was able to watch this thing for about five seconds after it made that turn. I could see it passing in front of stars and blacking them out.  It was moving really fast. After about five seconds it cooled down so much that I lost it.  This thing wasn’t falling like a meteor should be doing.  It was flying due north like it was under some sort of power. From observing the glow I could tell the thing was (and I hesitate to use this term) cigar shaped except the rear end was more pronounced then the front end so I suspect it was larger in the back then the front.  I haven’t heard of anyone else seeing this thing and I haven’t even told my family about it yet but I have no reason to make this up.  Something came into earths atmosphere list night that I believe wasn’t from Earth and it wasn’t a meteor. What do you think?  Has anyone else brought this to your attention?

In the sky next to the moon was a small silver glowing round object that caught my eye.  As i stood there and watched, a neighbor saw me and said they have been there for a few hours.  She told me there was a ""fireball"" type of thing in the sky that lasted a few minutes and everyone in the area by the pool had witnessed.  Then it disappeared and these Little glowing balls appeared.  i looked for a few minutes and went into the house. The next day i got a call that ""they"" were in the sky again.  it was about 1 pm.  So i went outside and next to the moon was the same glowing object.  By now I'm getting interested!!  So i started watching and tracking these things.  They seem to have a distinct pattern in the sky.  Usually appearing near the image of the moon, moving west, then moving north to particular point in the sky then disappearing.  This went on for several days. I went to a friends house about 1/2 mile away and told them about the silver objects.  they came out and we waited and they would literally just appear out of nowhere.  So we watched for a few minutes, and some of their neighbors came out and we were all watching.  Then out of nowhere there was this ""giant luminescent green round thing"" floating by.  It was round but flat as if you cut it out of paper and held it up in the sky.  it wasn't round like a ball, but just circular.  It was larger then the moon in the sky, but not next to it.  it appeared to be above up. it was really hard to tell how far away it was.  Once this Green thing appeared, 3 small silver ones appeared.  it was the most silver ones i had seen at one time in the sky. Before it disappeared one silver ball appeared next to the green one at about 1 o'clock position, and moved around it to about the 5'oclock position before it faded.  Then as quickly as it appeared it vanished, (it lasted about 15 seconds) and only the silver one remained.  We watched for a few more minutes hoping the Giant green thing would come back but i never saw it again. A few months later i did see one small silver object, i tracked it for a few minutes till it disappeared and went in.  i haven't seen anything else in a few months.  A side note, the silver objects moved very slow, appeared very high in the sky and seemed to wiggle slightly.  i never saw anything after dark and they did seem to glow and not reflect light. i never got the feeling while watching one that i was actually moving, but it was covering sky.  i do have a few minutes of video of the silver objects, but i don't know how to load it from the video camera to the computer.  Unfortunately, i didn't get the green object on film.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,34.090605907173,-117.88727341772152

Last year coming back from Oregon my buddy and I observed a large light in the distance that somewhat appeared to be lightning, but only a whole lot bigger.  This light in my estimation was about 10-12 miles long.   The whole thing was very strange really as we both are familiar with lights in the distance considering our travels, but this is unlike anything I've ever seen before.  I doubt it was a ""ufo,"" but I sure would be interested if anyone else that saw it called it in at the time or might have some sort of explanation.  I've traveled through there at night many times and have never seen it before or after that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was either 3/17/07 or 4/14/07 according to last years schedule.

I can tell you we are both well traveled and have never seen anything like this.  ((name deleted)) and I discussed it the other day as I told him I wrote you....he just shook his head...""that was wierd.""  At the time I thought perhaps we'd hear something about it on the news or something, but nothing came of it.   A few weeks ago I heard a guy by the name of Ralph Meaney ((local Seattle UFO investigator)) speak about UFO's and spoke with him briefly prior to the speech.  Something he showed me persuaded me to report this incident.  I can tell you that both ((name deleted)) and I are normal everyday guys that simply saw something weird and would like to know if perhaps somebody else reported this....surely somebody else saw it, and what it was.  We're both well traveled and haven't ever seen anything like this before.  You know what's really amazing about this is that we've went to Oregon many times in our lives and never seen this before?

It was a perfectly clear evening. My husband, his 2 brothers and myself were enjoying a quiet night recalling memories around the campfire and watching for shooting stars. I was gazing off to the South West side of the lake and noticed in the sky an orange glowing sphere moving steadily towards the North East. I didn't know what to think at first. I quickley spoke up and pointed the object out to the others and asked if anyone thought it was an airplane, even though I knew it couldn't be because there was no sound and no flashing lights at all. We got up from our chairs and followed it as it continued on it's swift and steady path. At each angle as it passed, the object did not change shape or color. The color resembled the same orange glow of the embers in our camp fire with the exception that the objects color was a steady and non wavering glow. It's size was considerably larger than any of the many stars that filled the sky and the only sound that we could hear was that of traffic passing on a far off road. After the object disappeared out of sight behind the trees, we returned to the campfire to discuss what we had just witnessed. As we did, 2 airplanes passed over head. We could clearly see the outlines of the wings marked by the multi colored flashing lights and followed by the familiar sound of the airplane's engine. It was obvious to see that the object that had previously passed by did not match in any way or form what we were now seeing. Our evaluations of the event however, remain split. My husband and his older brother were positive that it must have been some type of military stealth jet aircraft of unknown origin flying high in the atmosphere. My second brother-in-law and I, based on what we had seen, thought that it was too unusual to be any kind of jet. In addition, I have witnessed a stealth jet fly over when they retired the Blackbird SR-71 in 1990. It flew over where I used to work in Valencia, California near Lockheed Aircraft, where it was built. The sound of the stealth jet was not evident as it approached, but after it passed the sound was an unmistakable jet engine's roar which could be heard even as it flew straight up and out of sight. What I witnessed last evening was in no way a match to that experience. If this was indeed a military aircraft I am totally impressed.

While working at a construction site I happened to look up (towards the north) and observed what appeared to be 2 white roundish objects at an extreme altitude. At first I thought they might be a pair of sea gulls but they didn't move - they stayed in the exact same spot. We had some high altitude cloud whisps  in the general area but they were not clouds - they were too white and very distinctly formed. I watched the objects for approx 30 seconds and then moved to a different position to get a better look and when I returned to that part of the sky they were gone. While the objects were visible I mentioned to another construction worker but he didn't bother to look. Approximately 5 to 10 minutes later I happend to look up again out of curiosity and spotted a single white round object moving slowly from west to east. I first spotted the object to the west - what I would estimate to be over the hills that seperate Castro Valley (in the west) and Dublin - this object appeared to be in a high altitude as well, but not as high as the first 2 objects. This time I was able to get the construction worker to look up and he thought it was a balloon - which was my thought as well as it was moving very slowly but in a staight line. As it passed over head I moved to adjust my view again and when I looked back up it was gone. This happened 2 more times over the next approx half hour. The third object was almost in the same exact spot when I spotted the second and it moved just as slow and in a straight line from west to east only this time it was red. Again as it passed over head I adjusted my view and again it was gone.  The third and last time this happened the object was again white, it moved in the exact same path that the previous white and red object had moved, at approx the same speed, but this time I kept my eyes on it (thinking that it maybe a balloon again) but after it passed overhead, it proceeded a ways - to what I would estimate to be the Altamont Pass hills area east of Livermore - and! then it stopped!  I continued looking and I used my hardhat brim to try to see if it was still moving, I kept my head absolutely motionless and used the Satilite Antenna on a distant hill as a reference point to make sure I wasn't moving my hardhat at all. The object was still in the same spot that it had stopped in but it was becoming dimmer and that's when it came to me that it must be moving up. This is when I realized that it was also becoming smaller - I watched this object for about 3 to 4 minutes total till it disappeared from view.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,37.7186,-121.91640000000001

I witnessed for the first time the most unbelievable thing that proves something I didn't believe in before I witnessed it occur. The United States Government scrambled jets to intercept groups of alien craft all day long as I sat and watched it from my living room window. I am in such disbelief, because like I said I was not a firm believer in life outside of our own planetary system. It is the truth, the craft I saw moved so quick, made no noise, but our craft being F-15 fighters I believe or something similar in nature, we able to use their weapons systems, perhaps modified systems, and shot them down...catching flame and landing in the mountain range of the Rocky Mountains. The craft, all 9 of them, fell from the sky when our weapons hit them, which indicated to me that in fact they were destroyed. Right now I am certain that because it did not make the news, that there is a top secret cover up, naturally the government wanting to keep this under wraps and I can understand the reasoning. The craft kept appearing, making me believe that we were not being successful in hitting them with our weapons systems. I saw trails, indicating something was fired from our craft towards theirs. Then I saw two craft together, indicating to me that in fact we were destroying their craft afterall, since they struck both craft together and they fell to the ground at a fast pace. The total number of planes of our aircraft varied throughout the day as they scrambled to attack them, but they arrived quickly and to my surprise given that our craft appear to be such lower in technology than theirs...but to my surprise again, simple systems of weaponry brought down what must have been intruders in our airspace and caught or detected by Space Command or Norad, or some other top secret detection facility...I'm convinced that we must have such things now that I am convinced that we've had bad visitors from outerspace. Their craft were triangular in shape, could move in any direction in an instant, but for some ! reason t hey weren't able to duck and weave whatever weapon it was that the United States Air Force was firing upon them, which was something unconventional you could tell by their streams that they left in the air...very different looking, almost as if to trace the location of the missiles from start to finish. I believe, knowing weapons systems very well from the Reagan era that are in use today, despite treaties, that satellites lit up the craft from the sky up high, and the missiles were guided directly to their targets without fail. I did see one alien craft seem to disappear in an instant, or it traveled from its location in an instant. All 9 craft that I saw were hit and fell to the ground behind some mountains. All scrambling jets ceased to fly once they were shot down, but it's not reported in the media and I haven't heard of anyone else seeing what I saw. So I do know it's being covered up in large scale. This is not the first sighting I've had with triangular craft. A group of about 7 or so flew directly over my condo one night, had zero noise in propulsion, flew very slow, and were lit up from beneath for all to witness, didn't seem to be afraid of showing themselves off.

It was about the same magnitude of an ordinary star, and sometimes you’ll see a satellite in the morning or at night when the sun from over the horizon hits them just right.  For reference it was moving slightly faster than the satellites I’ve seen in the past. That would mean it was either moving faster than a satellite, or at a similar speed, but lower altitude.  It was moving on an almost perfect easterly heading, if anything a little east to northeast. It did not appear to maneuver or change directions.  As I watched it arc across the sky all of a sudden it was surrounded by a brilliant flash.  That’s when I knew it wasn’t an ordinary satellite I was seeing it was something else.  The flash was not like a strobe light of an airplane, but more like a cloud of plasma that enveloped the light.  Relative to the size of the light I saw moving, the flash appeared to be about 10 times its size.  Then it flashed again about every 5 to 7 seconds.  I watched it until it was out of sight, but then I saw another flash even though I couldn’t see the light itself.  Whatever it was, it just kept on going.  While technically a UFO, I’m beginning to think I might have seen a high altitude spy aircraft, or black aircraft.  The flash could have been a pulse detonation type of propulsion system, or atmospheric skip vehicle.  If it was emitting a pulse, or skipping the atmosphere at the altitude I think it was, its exhaust, or the interaction with the atmosphere might have created the flash / plasma effect I was seeing.  The color of the light / vehicle, and the flash were identical, both appearing a brilliant white, similar to a white LED light in color temperature.  There were no other colors or lights that one might normally associate with an aircraft.  Other than the light / flash I could not distinguish the planform of an aircraft or any structure. Again, it was dark, moving fairly fast and at high altitude.  Here comes the strange part.  As I watched the light arc across the sky, all of a sudden I see a shooting star or something cross its path immediately behind it.  Whatever that was, it was a very very quick streak of light, but in an amber color.  The streak was moving on a line I would estimate to be north to northwest in direction. So I’m thinking did something just shoot at this thing? Or was this a total coincidence.  Very odd, hopefully someone else saw this too.  (I was a trained aircraft observer for the Western Michigan University flight team in the early 1990’s.  During the flight competitions we had an aircraft recognition tests so I was trained to visually identify a wide variety of commercial and military aircraft.)

The night was remarkably clear and I could see all the stars pretty clearly.  There were a number of airplanes flying on the normal approach paths.  Sirius and Orion were prominent in the Southern sky.  The planes approaching SFO and other Bay Area airports routinely stack up in both a southeast and easterly approach corridor.  My eye caught a very bright orange colored light that was roughly aligned to the southeast approach, but definitely the wrong color for airplane landing lights (of which I see many).  The light of this object was very bright, a bright rust red/orange, at least 2 to 3 time the brightness of Sirius but the color of Mars through a telescope (I am a life-long amateur astronomer).  I’d watched it for 10 seconds or so and was wondering why it didn’t have any navigation lights because up this point, I was assuming it was a commercial aircraft.  I’m quite familiar with aviation.  I finally mentioned it to my youngest daughter, that I think that object is a UFO, but really half jokingly, expecting any second to see the red/green navigation lights, a strobe or some indication of normal aircraft appearance.  It was certainly Unidentified and Flying (or Orbiting) and it was definitely an Object of some kind.  The speed across the sky suggested an aircraft or satellite and it moved silently as far as I could surmise above the noise of the other people.  I’m not sure any else noticed and I admit I was too shy to point, and say, ""Hey, look a UFO!""   My youngest daughter had dashed off in a different direction to seek my other daughter (about 15 seconds into the observation) because there was still nothing unusual other than the bright steady color.  I continued to watch for another 20-30 seconds or so.  About this time I looked down to unbuckle my digital camera to try for a picture, although with the glare of the parking lot and lack of any tripod, I didn’t really hope for much, even at full zoom.  However, by this time it faded suddenly as it crossed Orion’s belt over the span of 3-5 seconds.  Strangely, satellites usually brighten as they head out of the shadow of the Earth and go into sunlight.  This object had the opposite behavior, approaching from deep shadow brightly becoming dim as it moved toward the west. My daughter rejoined me and I told her that our object just vanished before my eyes.  I came home and wrote up and drew what I had just seen.  The most remarkable part of the event was that Sirius, the brightest stellar object in the sky, was clearly much more point-like and dimmer than the object, which passed within a few degrees of the star on its way toward Orion, and therefore provided an excellent comparison object.  The object seemed initially to have almost a planetary disk appearance, which was not twinkling or point like but more like a circular smudge.  As it faded, it became much more point like and finally vanished.  I’ve seen satellites ""flares,"" and the color tends to be very white.  This object was clearly a different color than any satellites I’ve seen.  If I was to speculate it could have been a spacecraft or very slow moving orbital object skipping off the atmosphere.  At no time did it move in a way that suggested intelligent control so I can’t say for certain it was anything but ""a highly unusual sighting.""",2007-04-27T00:00:00,37.61887877906977,-121.62196104651161

My girlfriend and i were driving home when both of us noticed three ""planes"" within a mile of each other directly north of our location. We both have an interest for all thing abnormal and interesting so we kept our eyes on them hoping. One of the objects did turn out to be a plane and veered off from the location while the other two orange lights remained, hovering in the air. We stopped on a very slow overpass to watch further because they had been hovering in the same place for well over a minute. We watched as one of the lights began to get brighter and brighter and slowly drifted around in mostly the same place, it just sort of floated. The second object began to slowly fade out until it was no longer visible. Just as we were fixing to start the car and leave (she had to be home by 22:30) the one still hovering seemed to have a new seperate ship drop from its side. The first ship then began to lower until it was no longer visible over the city lights and trees. After it was gone the new ship began to glow brighter and brighter just as the first did. We watched this ship hover in place for around 2 minutes until it finally began to lower and dissapeared just as the first had. All three ships were orange/yellow in color similiar to the color of a street light. They were circular and generally had very little movement probably only travelling back and forth within a miles radius. They did have some horizontal movement but like i said they always stayed within a mile of where we first sighted them. The sighting occured in Oklahoma city, OK. I have contacted the news to see if anyone else noticed them last nite. The only thing that i can possibly think of to debunk what i saw is that the location i saw them is about 45 miles west of tinker air force base which has been known to test new planes, but even still i highly doubt they would of been testing anything like what we saw.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,35.47186177914111,-97.52630349693251

The object appeared as if it had large yellowy, orange flood lights shinning from every side of it and the lights looked like they were in a fog (a hazy, glow around the object). I looked everywhere else in the sky and the sky was very clear. The object was large. My sons thought it was a helicopter and they heard a sound from it. It moved slowly across the sky at a 45 degree angle between us and due south of us. As it got approximately due south of us, the orangey lights went off and a small single white light was on it (not shining out from it, just on it). The object was not hazy anymore. The sound stopped and it changed direction immediately (not a smooth turn, but instantly). It moved towards the southeast sky from our location. After it changed direction, the object moved extremely fast and was gone in approximately 3 to 4 seconds. The object then looked as if it was extremely high in the sky and went higher as it moved away. It did not go out of sight towards the horizon, but went out of sight moving up and away.

I will have to return to see what the cross street was, but I had passed 60th St. It was about 4PM, perhaps a little after. Looking through my windshield, on the right side of the street, I could see the neighborhood buildings and beyond them, the hills South of Pasadena dotted with houses, across the LA River, not very far away at all.  In between, I spotted a rectangular object in the air. It was a flat gray. I could tell that it was slowly moving southward, perhaps above the river, which winds with the 110 freeway but more likely, above the hills.  I’ll state right now that I know it wasn’t a billboard, although it was positioned in a manner a billboard would be (long side down) and was at least the size of a billboard. The difference being this object was floating and moving through mid air.  I’ll also state that it wasn’t a blimp and I had already seen the Goodyear blimp earlier in the day, around the Pasadena area, since tomorrow is the Rose Bowl Parade. That was my first thought, that this was a promo for the Bowl and a plane was towing it, even though a plane at that low an altitude in that area would be a freak flight plan.  My “mission” then became to see this thing and the plane that might be towing it together, but I’d have to see it in enough open space as I was getting my view blocked by buildings and trees as I drove. The next chance revealed the rectangle still moving with no plane to be seen anywhere. Now I thought it might be a balloon and I tried to get a good look at it, replacing my sunglasses with my glasses.  There seemed to be a texture to it like a chain-link fence pattern. Also there seemed to be 3 segments to it with 2 vertical lines from top to bottom. So it looked like left side, middle, right side, all about equal width. There may have been a circular shape in the middle one. No sound from it that I could hear. No lights or glows.  It still continued to move behind things that blocked my view so I tried again to get a better view and was frustrated by slow moving traffic. I’ll state it was moving unlike a loose balloon might. It was heading in an edge-first, sideways manner, as if the bottom edge was on a track. I could also tell by the edge it was not very “thick”, that is I wasn’t looking at one end of a house-like frame. It was much more flattened like a billboard.  It occurred to me to get to a spot where I could try to photograph it with my cell phone. I took out my phone and prepared it, still trying to keep the shape in sight. I approached an intersection and saw it again. This time it seemed to be picking up speed as if going around a curve and I stuck my arm out the window of my car and tried to snap a picture above the roof of my car.  At the intersection I realized I could go down the street toward the freeway and at that point, my view would be unblocked. I made the turn and raced down passed the cross streets, hopefully on an intercept course, as that was the very direction it was headed. It took anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds to get there without seeing the rectangle (blocked by neighborhood houses).  When I reached the end of the street with its open view of everywhere around, hoping to see a larger version of the rectangle or maybe even some explanation, it was totally gone from view. I looked in every direction. Nothing but everything as it usually is in broad daylight.  Possibly, I thought, it could have turned and descended on the other side of the hill ridge (it seemed to be low enough). Or, if it had simply dropped straight down, the trees would immediately block it from sight.  I stopped my car and then inched it along each block. Finally, I gave up and looked at the camera photo. The shot doesn’t show it as it may have been pointed away slightly and I tried a vertical shot (done again I’d have held it sideways or even chosen video capture and turned it to get the best coverage). The shot is oddly over exposed but it may have been the time of day.  I also immediately turned down the way I had come up Figueroa and retraced the road from the last 5 minutes, looking for any billboards I could have mistaken for it, etc. I saw nothing like it.  If I hear of any explanation of it, fine. I just would like to know what it was. I won’t believe it if someone says it was pulled by something…there wasn’t anything in front or above. Also, anything loose that size near a highway and homes is hazardous.  I'll try to send along some illustrations.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

After about one or two minutes it slowly started flying east.  I would have stuck around to see what else would have happened, but I need to get inside since it was cold out.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,,

Sound was much lower than typical aircraft that pass over, and not as loud as jets or c-5 aircraft that I am familiar with hearing.  The morning sky was crystal clear as was evident when a shooting star passed directly under the object I saw and was very bright, and there were many stars out.  An object was approaching from the west and moving toward south east.  The object above looked to be approximately the width of five C-5 aircraft and was moving very slowly.  I saw one large central light, that appeared to have more than one color and on either side of the center light there were 4 smaller lights, spaced out at regular intervals of perhaps 200 ft  between and 1 light off the right side set back and apart from the rest.  All moved at the same uniform speed while approaching me and moving over me.  The lights were dim, as if behind a cloud, although there appeared to be no clouds in the area.  I assumed it was very high in the sky.  I cannot estimate height, but from where I stood it appeared to be the width above mentioned.  I was unable to see a distinct form of airplane(s), only the light formations.  I initially though that perhaps this was a large aircraft with jets flying on the sides in formation, however, the object remained in the same configuration while it passed over me, and after passing directly over the 8 lights on either side of the main central light started to change configuration in that they circled around each other, but remained at the same speed as the object.   I then thought that there were no way these were jets flying in formation because the lights could not have circled around each other.  They continued to do this until they were too far off in the horizon for me to see.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,42.109787704918034,-72.55383770491802
Frequent lights in the sky sightings in Miami Florida,Miami,FL,2008-01-08T07:30:00,flash,5 minutes,"Occurred : 1/8/2008 07:30  (Entered as : 1/8/08 07:30) Reported: 1/28/2008 7:34:43 PM 19:34 Posted: 2/14/2008 Location: Miami, FL Shape: Flash Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61269.html,"Frequent lights in the sky sightings in Miami Florida To whom it may concern at NUFORC  I would like to report sightings in the Miami FL. Area from the last week of December 2007 through just recently as yesterday January 27, 2008. This the first time I actually had the guts to talk to someone besides my family about it. The first time me and my friend saw a bright steady light in the night sky we kind of freaked out sense we first thought it was a plain flying higher than usual but then it disappeared right in front of our eyes, we had our doubts, and a bit skeptical but intrigued at what we saw! On the first two weeks between the 6 and 8  of January 2008, we saw the many flashing lights not in a formation like military jets, besides the speed, the way they flashed, and making no noise what so ever. It didn’t look like it was one object because after the first sighting of lights, later on that same day, we saw two more similar flashing lights on the same flight pattern. The lights were headed northeast on the right side of the constellation. Then after we saw those sets of flashing lights. My wife starring at Orion’s belt for some reason, she noticed a reddish round shaped dimming light at a very high altitude moving slowly between Orion’s belt and the a yellow bright star or planet in the night sky. I felt amazed and something made me keep a closer watch sense then. On the 23 of January, my brother and I were talking about the lights and I was hoping that he might have the chance to see something and at about 7:30 PM, he and his wife saw two pairs of flashing lights Identical to what me and my wife saw before. He pointed out that what was very weird was the way the lights flashed, he said they didn’t look like anything he had seen before in his life! And just recently as the 27 of January, my family and I saw a bright light that appeared from no where and traveled right in front of us a very high altitude but close enough for us to see that it was no commercial plain nor did it make a sound! After 10- 15 minutes it just faded into the night and vanished. We were hoping to see it light up ! again, b ut it never did! So now after all these lights in the sky you can say, “I definitely got me wondering why have there been so many sightings all of the sudden, in Arizona and Mexico recently and now Miami? It is difficult to  believe it and say, “Ah forget it it’s a military plain or something man made! I got so many questions, such as if and when I see un-identifying lights again in the night sky”! What to do? 	Do I take a pictures, or film it? 	Do I call the Airport and ask if they know what it is? “Will they tell me if it ain’t a plain? I don’t think so”! 	Do I call the news stations? And without a picture or footage, will they take me seriously, and will they report my call?  Listen I know I’m not crazy, cause I wasn’t the only one that saw them and couldn’t identify what they were, so… I have an XL2 Cannon Digital Camera and believe me, it is fully charged and ready to get footage of these lights in the sky as soon as they come way!!! Thank You…",2008-02-14T00:00:00,25.7741427135084,-80.28951850011829

These balls would come out of the craft horizontally then disappear altogether. This happened a total of four times then no more came out.  I called a friend to confirm what I was seeing, and she saw another one to the south of Springfield. Oval in shape but turned upright. With the same colored strobes as the one above. No balls of light came from the second craft.  To ensure it was not moving I placed a couple of pieces of tape on the glass surrounding the object and watched from the same location.

This morning on 9/12/07 at approximately 4:10 AM CST in Lawrence, KS I went out onto my second story deck where I have an unobstructed view of the eastern sky to have a cigarette. Upon stepping out with my dog, motion caught my eye and I glanced up. Despite my classes in astronomy, merit badges, and 25+ years of amateur sky watching I have no name for what I saw other than UFO. I'm college educated, a respected member of my community, and former Army Reservist that held a Secret Security Cleareance. This is my first sighting, and I have debated about whether to even say anything to anyone, for fear it may harm my professional reputation. I was certainly a skeptic until last night.  What I saw when I looked up was at a very high altitude, its initial position in the sky was just north of the constellation Orion and about 75 degrees above the horizon. I believe it may have been initially traveling either due west or descending because it did not seem to be traveling fast. Then almost immediately it turned sharply to the south and crossed the sky at a speed I can only compare to a meteor. Much faster than any satellites or planes I have witnessed. The object was illuminated at first, perhaps from entry; it then faded in intensity as it crossed the sky to the south. The object did not streak, or trail however. It also did not seem to be producing the light itself. It had a white-blue glow and seemed large. The glow disappeared when it was about three quarters of the way across the sky, and I could no longer track the object. All of this took place in about before I was able to light my cigarette, I think maybe about 5 seconds or so.  I kept my eye on the sky for some 2 to 3 minutes trying to see if it would reappear, I had about convinced myself that it was just a meteor, when out of the north a fast moving triangle of 2 red and 1 blue (non-blinking) lights flew across the sky at a increasing altitude, on what appeared to be an intercept course. I assume the lights were a single craft, but may have been a formation of three crafts at a much higher altitude. This one also moved much faster than anything I am familiar with and I have lived in this area for 31 years. I counted 6-mississippi as this craft crossed the sky, but it remained in my field of vision longer, and its lights did not extinguish.  In both cases there was no noise. I pondered what I had seen and watched for additional movement in the night sky. I did spot a plane flying northeast possibly towards Chicago or further north, it was too high to be flying to KC. I could hear it, and it took several minutes to cross out of my field of vision. I called a friend of mine at 4:18AM according to my cell phone, after finishing my cigarette.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,39.0001002739726,-95.25458794520547

There are two stars in the east-southeast sky, at about 45 degrees above the horizon, that I find myself always looking at, and happened to be checking them out, when I noticed a third ""star"" next to them, on the south side. Looking more closely, I saw that it wasn't round, but oval in shape...more like a longer oval, but not cigar-shaped. And the quality of the light from it was different, being more of a glow as opposed to reflected light or ""light bulb"" type light. It was very white, with a blue tinge. It also slightly pulsed.  And that ""star"" just stayed there, not moving...and NOT like the way the headlights of a plane can seem to not move when coming directly towards you...it simply DID NOT move.  After a couple of minutes, it began to move very slowly towards the southeast, in what appeared to be a straight path. Suddenly, as I watched it, it went from being at a 45 degree angle in the sky, to about a 55-60 degree angle...and when it did this, the position of the craft did not change...no pointing upward or aiming...it was just suddenly ""up"". From that angle, it continued southeast for a minute or so, then, as suddenly as it was ""up"", it was back down at the 45 degree level, moving at the same steady rate of speed. I watched it until it was out of sight.  During its movement, the pulsing and color tone never changed, nor did the flight angle of the craft. Its size was approximately that of a BB pellet held at arm's length, slightly larger than the two stars I regularly see at that point in the sky.  I will send you a sketch of this event later today.

At approximately 06:55, My son's bus was on Beck Road at the Joy Road intersection, in Canton, Michigan. He looked out the bus window to the west and he saw 3 dim white lights at about 40 degrees above the horizon.  The lights then started to brighten and became very bright white. The object then began to move slowly upward and to the north. It went a short distance then stopped, changed direction, going upward and to the south for a short distance. The object stopped again, then began moving slowly north and upward. It stopped again, then flew south and upward again for the last time.  It stopped, tipped vertically revealing a distinct saucer-shaped craft with 3 bright white lights in a triangular formation.  Remaining in that sideway's position, it slowly ascended, then instantly disappeared.  My son was too shocked to think to point it out to anyone else on the bus. He said no one else took notice that he was aware of.  That evening, I told my wife that our son saw what he thought was a UFO while riding to school and I didn't describe anything to her about what our son said to me.  She immediately said that she saw something very strange that morning also, while driving to work. She said, whatever it was, it had 3 impossibly bright white lights and was hovering in the field north of the road, just above the trees, as she drove past it on Ford Road, going west, near the Ridge Road intersection. She said it was huge. She said it was about the size of a small ranch home. She said she wanted to stop, but there was too much traffic and she couldn't pull over safely. She saw this very similiar looking craft approximately 10 to 15 minutes earlier than my son at around 06:40.  Her location was approximately 2.5 miles away from my son's location when he saw the saucer.  This was amazing since I didn't give my wife details of what our son saw and to have her tell me the same number of lights as our son along with seeing it 10 minutes apart in the same area.

On Tuesday, Oct. 30, somewhere around 10:30 and 11 a.m., I was one of three people who saw several strange aircraft flying over Hwy 11 in Pickens County, South Carolina. We were in the parking lot of the Table Rock General Store, just a few miles from Table Rock Mountain itself.  Two of us were visiting a friend who lives nearby and had stopped to check out of the motel beside the store.  The woman who works in the store was outside, pointing her camera phone at the sky. She kept saying, “They have no wings and no jet stream (contrail).”  I looked in the direction she was pointing and saw a metal aircraft of some type making steady progress, headed in a southwesterly direction. I could not see any sign of wings or any suggestion of a tail. The shape was long, as large as a commercial jetliner or even a C-130, rather cigar shaped, but somewhat wider at the front end and tapering toward the back.  At first I wondered if it could be a blimp, but it was not blimp-shaped. It also moved steadily forward at what easily could have been several hundred miles an hour.  The body was metal, looking like aluminum glinting in the sun. As we stood there, another of the same aircraft came into view, moving in the same flight pattern as the first and at what looked like the same speed. We watched for probably 15 minutes, during which time the first craft moved beyond our view.  It was easy to see because the sky was deep blue and totally cloudless. It was hard to estimate how big they were, but from that distance, they looked about 3/8” long if I’d held up my fingers to measure one from front to back at arm’s length.  The woman at the store said she had seen five of them the day before, flying in formation. I believe she said they appeared to be escorted by helicopters, but I may be mistaken.  Our curiosity was piqued, to say the least, but we thought a simple call to Air Traffic Control at the Greenville, SC, airport would reveal what they were. Due to their direction in which they were traveling, they surely would have shown up on the radar there.  But the friend we were visiting said she called, but the airport radar had picked up nothing that sounded like what we’d seen. She was referred to several other agencies, including the FAA, and finally to this site.  I and the friend who were visiting are both retired newspaper reporters, with more than 30 years of experience each. The friend we were visiting is also a longtime journalist. We all had worked together at the same large (and very reputable) newspaper in North Carolina. But our friend is somewhat handicapped and by the time she got out of the car to take a look, the aircraft had moved out of view.  The third witness is the woman who works in the store. I don't know her background but she seemed to be a very no-nonsense kind of person.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,34.8835,-82.7074

John Wayne Airport isn't too far away, so we see alot of air traffic. Well, as I was observing the jet, another object moved into view. What caught my eye was the sun reflecting off it's surface. At first I thought it was a weather balloon, as it was translucent in nature. It was a solid shape at first, like an aspirin. Then it lost it's shape and became unstable and undulated along. It did this for a moment, and then became a sphere, then going back to undulating. I watched it sharply and then it just disappeared. I'm not sure if my eyes were playing tricks on me, but I know what I saw. Also, I should mention a few other details such as it's size. While at first appearing small, the jet passed right underneath it. The jet was pretty high up there, so this thing must have been about 1/6 the size of the aircraft. Even though it was translucent, I did notice that whenever the sunlight reflected off it's surface, the material briefly became dark and metallic.

It's peak brightness was comparable to an orange streetlight, it had to have been greater than -5 magnitude. It's movement appeared natural and not machine or human like.

I was traveling about 35-40 mph at this time and got closer to it quickly.  Within a few seconds, I realized that the lights all belonged to the same object, and were then slowly moving above Academy, only about 50 feet in the air. It came at an angle towards me (or perhaps I was just moving towards it faster than I thought), and for about five seconds, it was close enough for me to see the details of it. It was the classic saucer shape, with maybe 6-8 white lights around the circular base of it, and one white light at the top.

It was dark, but I'm fairly certain that the UFO was black or dark grey, and probably the equivalent of 2 or 3 cars in total mass. After about five seconds of it floating only about 50 feet away from me, it banked and did a u-turn, flying away at a much higher speed than it had been before (although it was impossible to estimate the speed at night in those conditions, its accelaration was definately much more than a helicopter could have managed). I saw the lights of it for a few seconds more, then lost it within the glow of the city. I would guess that there were many more witnesses (it was a busy city street, after all) and there should be more reports on the same saucer. Yes, this did happen on halloween night, and I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it so clearly (it may as well have landed and let me walk up and touch it), but it was very frightening because of what I might have just witnessed. Technology like that that we don't know about scares me and makes me wonder what else the government has in terms of power. I still don't believe it was extraterrestrial, because the statistical chances of that are improbable almost to the point of impossibility, but the fact that it exists at all is fairly horrifying.

The only reason the craft was so visible was the reflection it gave off but the reflection did not show the exact outline.  However the reflection(s) allowed use to visually follow the craft while my friend and I kept asking each other, ""Have you ever seen an aircraft do that?"", over and over.  Al was over Saturday evening and I saw my first UFO.  Craziest thing I've ever seen.  I still don't believe it was an Alien thing but it wasn't any typical aircraft.  The speed and its maneuvering looked impossible.  It chased two planes over the airport going two different directions, dodged another and then dove close to the ground and proceeded south all in 10-12 seconds.  It was at dusk so the sun was going down but shinning on the vehicle.  It was white and no lights of any kind.  It had to be a pearl white or like that reflective 3M white tape or sign material.  It was not shiny metallic but definitely white but a halogen white.  It did not have a vertical stab, rudder and it was a little hazy so there was no way to make out any detail.  There has been a lot of activity at the Ft. Carson and Peterson since this weekend.  My guess is that it is some sort of new flight vehicle and they were testing it.  It was likely also very stealthy so I assume it was likely not picked up on radar, especially considering what it did and the speed involved.  It was directly east when I saw it and farther out than an approach for the airport.  It came around and come up behind the first plane and veered off coming around to approaching the second plane coming in at a right angle to the first plane.  That was an 'S' shape that covered more than 12 miles.  Then it went south and dodged a plane on approach while in a steep dive.  After it came close to the ground it leveled off and proceeded south.  It did this all within 8 seconds, no longer.  It did not seem to lean into turns as an aircraft would and looked like it stayed level.  Neither Al or I could make out its shape except it did not have a rudder.  The only plane that I know that could do this would be an F-22 but there was no sound.  Something maneuvering that fast should have made some pretty noticeable throttling jet engine sounds.  If the F-22 has noise suppression maybe, flying an experimental pattern and painted pearl or reflective white.  My guess and feel after just watching the Thunderbirds at graduation is it was traveling just under mach one.  Also it did not change speed either in the hard maneuvers or when it dove.  It just looked really odd.  Neither Al or I took our eyes off of it until we could not see it any longer and just started laughing.  He's retired Army advanced radar and communications technician.  The F-22 has vector thrust but it makes a lot of noise and it still looses speed in hard maneuvers.  One thing this was not was winged aircraft, even an F-22 with vectored thrust.  It made maneuvers that only a helicopter could make but at a speed that had to be just below mach one at 7000 to 10000 ft. elevations.  The two sincere giveaways that this was a special craft was first it flew over an municipal airport and Air Force Base with no lights and in two flight paths of other aircraft and came very close to the rear of those two plane with no clearance lights or landing lights… all very illegal for either military or civilian aircraft.  The second giveaway was either drastic changes in direction or elevation did not change the velocity of the craft in the slightest.  I am not a believer in extraterrestrials, an engineer and would have to see either an extraterrestrial or their craft closely before I could possibly believe.  Someone owns and operates on incredible aircraft for sure.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,38.861478298238076,-104.78039776536313

I noticed that the speed at which the object was approaching was very slow and I proceeded to ask my two other coworkers their opinion of what the object was.  The responses they gave me (a hawk, a baloon, a kite, a blimp) were slowly being eliminated as the object moved closer to our location in Harlingen, Tx.  The best description that I can give about the object is as follows.  It was black in color and had a triangular shape.  At one point in my observation, it seemed as if it was a convetional private jet airplane that was out of control because it had a faint sound of a jet engine and was rotating as it made its approach.  As it moved closer, I began to notice a disturbance that encompassed the object; a light orange colored aura.  It also left a trail of disturbed air also tinted in orange which demonstrated its movement.

On this Saturday afternoon, I was running some errands with my 4 year old son, driving east on Old Hwy 94, when I looked to the north and saw a vertical white cylinder cruising from west to east.  It appeared to be about 3/4 of a mile away and at about 2000-2500 feet above ground.  Its proportions were about 1 to 5, so I guess it was about 6' wide by 30' tall. It was moving steadily at a speed equal to or greater than that of a twin engine propeller-driven airplane, so I would guess 150-200 mph.  I worked my way through an intersection and then pulled to a stop in a parking lot for a better look.  This thing cruised and then quickly slowed to a complete stop, where it hovered for maybe 10 seconds, then traveled straight up at about half it's previous speed for about 1000 feet, then stopped and hovered for maybe 30 seconds, then began accelerating to the east again at 150-200 mph.  I watched its departure until it went out of sight.  It remained very bright white the whole time, and as it moved, it never looked thinner or flashed brightly as if it had edges, so I think it was a cylinder.  The sky was sunny with a broken ceiling of alto-cumulus clouds, with moderate winds out of the west.  The object remained below the clouds.  The object was traveling with the wind, but maneuvering unlike a balloon or anything else.  I continued with my errands, constantly looking up to the sky as I drove around town.  After a few minutes, I stopped at a Sonic drive-in for lunch and parked so that I could look to the north-west.  I began eating my lunch while looking up through the windshield, and was rewarded almost immediately (this was 20 minutes later)when I saw a dark round object flying from west to east.  I got out of the car for a better look and saw as it was approaching and then passing almost directly above, that it was round when viewed from below and a flattened oval when viewed from the side.  It was shaped just like a glass piece from the game ""Pente"".  This object was bronze-colored (a dark blend of green, brown and gold).  As it made distance, I could see that the top was highly refective of the sun.  I wanted to rule it out as a toy balloon, but it wasn't.  As it traveled, I gained a sense of its approximate height and distance and surmised it was not small and low to the ground, but higher, larger and faster.  It wobbled as it flew; listing 20-30 degrees but never flipping end over end.  I would guess it was at about 1000' above ground and maybe 8'-12' in diameter.  I later called the St. Louis FAA Fight Service Station which offers detailed weather conditions for pilots.  The briefer told me that at that time the cloud ceiling was at or above 5000' above ground, the winds aloft at 3000' were at 18 knots (approx. 20 mph) from the west.  This told me that although both objects were traveling with the wind, they were cruising on their own power 8 to 10 times faster than the wind could push them.  I feel lucky to have seen these things, but returned to the family reunion not saying a damn word about it.  I'll tell my son about it when he's older and will look up to the skies a lot more often.

The time was around 10:30 p.m. and the sky was crystal clear and full of stars.  A few miles south of Forsyth, I noticed a light over the interstate approximately a mile or two ahead of me.  Because it was brighter than the stars “behind” it, I fixed my gaze on it as I made my way south.  I immediately noticed that it wasn’t moving in ANY direction like an airplane would with its blinking lights.  So, I thought it might be a helicopter with a bright front light.  It’s not unusual to see one hovering overhead day or night.  However…as I approached this hovering light, I noticed that it wasn’t one light…there were actually two lights.  They were large, round, white, and spaced apart like headlights of a car.  (In fact, that was the image I described later to my co-workers that night—-like a car hovering 500 to 600 ft. over I-75.)  My heart started racing when I realized this hovering object didn’t have any blinking lights of normal aircraft, the two lights were oddly spaced far apart (maybe 20-30ft ???), and it wasn’t moving at all.  It just seemed to hang there over the interstate facing north.  I couldn’t make out a specific body shape or identify any specific dimensions.  I wondered, “Do any of these other cars see this thing, or is it just me?”  Other drivers MUST have seen it because it was so close to the ground and the lights were so prominent.  As I drove under the object, I tried to take a picture of it with my camera phone…b/c that’s all I had with me, other than a stethoscope.  Unfortunately, all that captured was a dark screen (night sky) with one of the “lights” in the very bottom corner of the screen.  Apparently I am unable to photograph UFOs and drive at the same time. :)  I’ll end this by noting that I am a very conservative, analytical and typically skeptical person by nature.  However, what I saw was so unusual that I am now a believer of UFOs…even though my co-workers and my family all rolled their eyes at my story.

I am reporting a possible UFO inadvertently caught on a digital camera during sunny conditions, near noon-time, facing southwest on December 8th, 2007. The photo was intended to be a shot of the surf and cliff of Isla Caja de Muertos (aka Coffin Island). The island is located about five miles southeast of Ponce, Puerto Rico. The lat/long of the island is: 17º 53.48 North, 066º 31.13 West. 	When the photos were downloaded from the camera to the computer, an unidentified flying object was found in the upper right portion of this picture, adjacent to the left side of the tall hill, Cerro Morillo, which is 170 feet tall, according to NOAA nautical chart #25685. I have included a link to an online version of this chart:  http://www.oceangrafix.com/o.g/Charts/PR_VI/NOAA-Nautical-Chart-Punta-Petrona-to-lsla-Caja-de-Muertos.html 	The UFO appears to be at about a 40-45 degree angle when compared to the horizon. It's also a different color from the rocks and if you zoom in on it, it appears to be reflecting sunlight along the ""top"" edge. It is impossible for me to gauge the object's size, but Cerro Morillo is roughly 400 feet away from the camera. It appears that the obect may be beyond the hill and since no one saw it ""in person"" we don't know if it is ascending or descending. Another option is that the UFO is not descending or ascending but rather, banking in flight. As it appears in the picture the UFO seems to be at an angle. If you use the nautical chart as a reference and if you align a ruler from the flat ""bottom"" of the UFO to the water in the picture, the angle suggests it may be oriented toward the deeper water offshore. 	At any rate, this object was not consciously observed by anyone present that day. Incidentally, it is only 32 miles, as the crow flies, from Coffin Island to Lares, Puerto Rico, a UFO sighting hotspot and location of a proposed UFO runway to be built by the locals!",2008-01-21T00:00:00,,

And at least a couple miles away but close enough so that I saw a jet trail on the top one.  I only saw them for about three seconds but I remember every detail about them.  They were moving at the same speed.  One was above the other about a quarter inch apart.  The one on top had a white light like most planes do and I remember noticing it had a trail just like a jet has.  The bottom one however was many times bigger, had no trail and was glowing bright orange.  It looked like a perfect circle and about the size of a BB while the one on top looked like a star.  They were moving almost horizontal, but most shooting stars come down at an angle. Almost as soon as I saw them the bottom one steadily grew from dim orange to burning, bright, orange without changing shape at all.  Right as it passed over and behind a peninsula to our left it became so bright and right when it was out of view it lit up the sky around the area it was in and we saw what seemed like a bright flash or explosion above the trees, but not a quick flash just a steady flash.  As soon as it was gone we said, ""((deleted)), what was that?""  We debated for a while about what it was and we concluded that they could not have been both shooting stars because the one on top had a trail and the bottom one didn’t.

He said they were flying horizontally and as fast as planes far away, not as fast as shooting stars   It was like nothing we had ever seen before and it was so big for the distance it was at if it was a meteor it would have caused a tsunami or something.

I was sitting on the sofa with a friend, saw the object at first out of the corner of my eye, and ran immediately to the deck on the west side to try to see more of it.  I live in the mountains in the Santa Fe Nat'l Forest and so what I saw on the deck was through several trees.  The object was moving north, into the forest, and by the time I reached my deck it was no longer a pale round object but was something bright, elongated (rectangular like a train with segmented/lighted windows), and it seemed quite close.  My friend also saw this (though she did not see the round object through the window because she was sitting with her back to it).  I want to add that I am one of the most rational people on the planet, have never given much creedence to UFO stories or sightings (though I contingently acknowledge that given the size of the universe, there cannot but be intelligent life somewhere other than here--that's if you take the current situation on this planet as created by ""intelligent"" life--so I tried to explain the light I saw from my deck: a plane (flying that close and headed directly into a forest? not likely)? a helicoptor (there was absolutely no sound)?  So I was and am left totally mytified by what this was.  I was so curious, in fact, that I convinced my friend to come with me and drive out into the forest in the direction it was headed.  We drove for probably ten miles or so on the forest road but saw nothing at all.  The next morning I saw on the morning news that other people had reported seeing something which the Los Alamos Lab said was probably a meteor, though it had not registered on their radar (the person interviewed! said th at this might be due to the fact that there was not enough light radiating for the radar to pick up the object--this couldn't possibly be the cause since this oject was quite large for a meteor).  No one reported seeing anything elongated, such as the object I saw from my deck.  I've been watching for more reports about this but have seen nothing else.  I'm very curious about any other sightings on that night.  Just a note, re. the Colorado sightings on Oct 1--I did not see numerous colored lights.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,35.7538,-105.7483

B's report  At about 11:15 PM on Sunday, October 1st, 2006, my wife saw unusual lights crossing the night sky outside our home. She called me to quickly come out on the deck to see them. I did so. (Our home sits on a hill facing to the southeast, overlooking the South Park region of the central Colorado Rockies.)  There were six yellowish orange (light orange) lights visible at roughly equal intervals, positioned fairly closely together in a 'follow-the-leader' fashion, moving from South to North, at an estimated distance of roughly one mile away from our observation point, low in the sky- (likely less than half a mile above the ground) They were moving at a constant speed and altitude, and no sound was able to be heard. The single light on each object appeared to be emitted form the front of each, relative to the direction of their travel; as they passed and were moving away, the lights began to be blocked progressively by the bulk of each object, so that they were obstructed progeessively until they were no longer visible when they were past us by 45 to 50 degrees. The lights were visible for less than 30 seconds.  The following morning, my brother-in-law, who was visiting & staying in their RV on our property, reported that he was also outside at the same time, and also saw these lights pass by from south to north.  M's added report: When I saw the lights I knew instantly they were like nothing I had ever seen before. They had a strange color- sort of an orange glow where a cockpit would be, however, the glow did not come out in a beam. Though we could hear other night sounds and traffic noises three miles away, the lights were utterly silent. I had an impression that the craft( If that is what they were) had an elongated shape, but I cannot be sure. The moon was in the south and they were flying away from it so we were not catching reflections from it. They had no wing or tail lights of any kind and were only visable for about 30 seconds. There were 6 of them in a straight line maybe a half mile away. They did not appear to be abnormaly large (but bgigger than the stars). The night was lit with moon light and a few light wispy clouds were out. There was no wind.

I knew that it was too late (11:15pm MDT) for Venus to be above the horizon.  I started watching the white light because it got larger and brighter; it seemed to be traveling from SW to NE across the sky.  I could not judge the speed because I could not judge the height from the ground but it was not close to the ground.  As it got closer the bright, round light in the center appeared much larger than any planet but smaller than the moon.  At that point it had a halo or aura around it, the width of one side of the halo approximately the width of the bright light at the center.  I also noticed at this point what looked like white ""fireworks"" shooting up (?) from the circular object.  Then as the object got closer it appeared to evolve into 5 or 6 bright lights, more or less in a straight line, which continued on the SW to NE path through the sky.  I was still driving and lost sight of the lights as they appeared to go overhead.  The entire sighting lasted about two minutes.  I should also note that, just to be sure that I was not seeing some strange reflection in my side car window, I rolled the window completely down as I was driving, and still saw the lights.  -------------  NOTES RECORDED LATER FROM MEMORY, ON OCTOBER 16, 2006:  When I drove that stretch of Hwy 50 again on Oct 14th, I decided that the timeframe was more likely one and one-quarter minutes to one and one-half minutes, not two minutes.  Also, the physical description of the phenomenon is best related as five distinct appearances during the one and one-half minutes I saw it:  (1) Bright light on the horizon, just above the foothills to the southwest, when I first saw it; larger and brighter than a planet;  (2) Bright light with aura or halo around it;  (3) Bright light with aura, plus white streaks appearing to shoot out the top of it;  (4) As object continued to get closer, the white streaks (trails of light) in the sky then appeared in SW to NE lines rather than appearing to “shoot out the top of it;”  (5)  When the phenomenon was nearly overhead, it appeared as 4, 5 or 6 distinct, bright white lights, continuing on the SW to NE pathway.

My friend also saw the lights after they reappeared and we watched until they disappeared over the Rampart Range.  We did disagree about 2 things when we compared remembered details.  I thought the lights were in a sort of chevron pattern with 4 lights making up one leg and 1 light down from the point making up the other, he thought it was a straight line.  I remember joking at the time that maybe ""our"" geese had headlights cause I didn't know what we really did see.  The other detail we differed on was that I thought the lights were yellowish to white and steady, while he thought they were more yellowish red also steady.  We commented on the total silence during the entire event, and both noticed there were no other planes visable until approximately 10 minutes after the lights were out of our view.  We were in a valley where any type of jet or plane can be heard long before it is visable.  We also agreed that there was no visable craft, we merely saw lights, far below the normal jet space and moving far too rapidly to be small planes or helicopters-that we know of.  I'm fairly sure it's an unrelated coincidence, but approximately 40 seconds after we lost sight of the lights, we heard 2 rather muffled rumbles, maybe 2 seconds apart.  It was probably thunder, but if so it was the only thunder we heard.  That, too, is not terribly unusual in that area.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,39.3061,-105.1069

Watching a Meteor Enter the Earth’s Atmosphere While Drinking Coffee at Bernice’s Bakery  While sipping coffee outside my favorite coffee shop in Missoula, Montana, my friend said, “Look!  What is that?”  My eyes followed his pointed finger reaching east above the Hellgate Canyon.  In a joking manner he then asked, “Is that a black hole?  What could that be?”  I saw white lines cutting through the atmosphere in a parabolic shape.  The trail only lasted a few seconds before it completely vanished from the top down.   The trail was about two-thirds longer than the bottom portion and was most interesting to watch as it faded into nothing.  This thing appeared to be a very large object burning up while entering earth’s atmosphere.  We watched it with a few other onlookers until it disappeared behind Mt. Sentinel.   Comments were made in jest about a meteor.  It was too large to be an aircraft, but a meteor would have explained what we all witnessed.  The whole scene could have been extracted from a sci-fi movie with the exception that it was a warm morning and I could feel the sun warm my blood.  Remembering that I intentionally left my camera at a friend’s house the night before, I telephoned her immediately to see if she had seen the object too.  She didn’t answer.  My other friends and I parted ways noting how odd it was to have seen that occurrence in the sky.  Later in the afternoon, I heard a report about an earthquake measuring 4.8 on the Richter scale just east of Dillon, Montana.  Dillon is east and a bit south east of Missoula right above where the 'meteor' was entering the atmosphere.  http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2007ccay.php  Excited and amazed, I immediately called my fellow observer who directed my attention towards the thing in the sky to learn that he had already heard the report and hesitated to call me for fear of sounding ridiculous.  We both concluded that the Tuesday morning’s earthquake was caused by whatever object we saw falling into our atmosphere and crashing into the earth.

I could see the sun sunning on the surface of the silver metal.  It had a darker area at one end that was a little larger then the rest of the lines of the craft.

It went below the tree level but I still could see it on and off as it passed throw the trees.  This is one gage as to how far away the object was.

This sighting happened at 2:30 in the afternoon in a brilliant blue sky.  I was walking along Queens blvd.  and noticed a man walking towards me and staring directly upward toward the sky.  This seemed odd to me because the man was transfixed on what he was looking at.  Ofcourse this peeked my interest, so I looked at what he was staring at too.  At first I did not see what he was looking at, but then the object caught my eye.  There was not a cloud in the sky. Im not sure if it was supposed to be a full moon that night, but the moon , atleast 80% full was out at 2:30 in the afternoon.  I just so happened to be wearing sunglasses.  If I hadn't had them on I wouldn't have been able to see this oval shaped ufo.  It was a brilliant white ""orb"" about as high in the sky as a visible planet or north star. Both of which I thought this to be.  Just as I was about to continue my walk and right this off as a star, it moved.  It moved left to right a very short distance.  I couldn't have been a plane.  It couldn't have been a helicoper. It couldn't have been a balloon.  I stood there and tried to convince myself that this was something that I could explain easily.  And then from the Northwest came from nowhere, three more.  Directly north of the first object came two more.  In total there were six.  All the same size color, shape and brightness.  Now I was freaked.  What the hell was I looking at?  It was such a bright, sunny day that I could't get anyone else to stop and witness what I was looking at.   The man that originally was the reason I stopped in the first place had gone.  The objects that came from the northwest moved slowly towards the first object almost forming a triangle formation.  The two from the north were just slowly downward almost as if they were on strings.  Almost as quickly as they appeared, five of them vanished upward as if pulled straight up on strings.  The original orb never left the sky.  I stood there for about 45 mins and then headed home.  When all six orbs were in ! the sky at the same time, they reminded me of what skydivers falling together to make a formation might look like.  The only problem is that these objects never fell to earth as skydivers must eventually do.   So there you have it, my first ufo sighting.  Its official.  I am the most skeptical person I know.

While we lay in the grass waiting for the next aircraft, we were looking at the clouds, and watching for birds. I raised the binoculars, and within a second or two saw an object much higher than both the previous plane, and the planes I usually see. 	The object appeared to be a silver ball and was either stationary or moving very slowly in a small area of the sky. I strained to see it without the aid of the binoc’s. It was completely unobservable. I put the lenses back up, and it was still there. 	At this point, I went next door to my mother’s house, and she came out to see. She could not see it, even with the binoculars. (She is blind in one eye, and has difficulty with lenses) Again, I tried to find it in the sky, and it was STILL there! But it was no longer spherical in appearance; it had changed to a rocket shape. It had what appeared to be tail fins, and was pointing upward. (Still not moving much if at all) I lowered the binoc’s again, for discussion, and when I raised them again a few seconds later the object was gone.

It had an extremely brigght strobing light and it appeared to be silver against the night sky. The strange thing i noticed was that the object had no sound. We stopped for a moment when i noyiced what appeared to be an airforce jet below it. The jet was obviously examining the object. As we pulled into the driveway, I ran to the front of the house just in time to see the object shoot up into the clouds with a streak of red and green light as if in a sci-fi movie and the airforce jet attempt to follow it.

There was extensive cloud cover on the horizon above the tree line, and enough overcast to create a haze over the ret of the objects in the sky, however this peticular object remained extremely vibrant. I then proceeded to go to my computer and check my online star charts on Worldwide Telescope for the current time and date while my mother stayed outside and observed its odd behavior. Nothing celestial even matched the intensity or positioning of this object. Note: I am an avid astronomer of over 8 years, fluent with many of the night sky's celestial content. Towards the end of the sighting I called the mufon hotline and reported the object as both my mother and I observed it... it later faded out, either disappearing, or moving behind cloud cover... and seemed to independently illuminate the clouds as it left from view. More importantly, this is the second time I viewed this object, and woke my mom to validate the first sighting I witnessed, but did not report nearly a week ago...",2008-06-12T00:00:00,43.1231,-71.0114

(""western star"" must be a term he's picked up from tv or a story book). I looked up into the cloudless blue sky (unusually low humidity today for this area) and directly ahead of us, up high, northwest of the sun, I saw a very bright and round object that appeared to be much larger than a star and smaller than a full moon. It appeared to be white or silver or to be illuminating very bright light from within (very bright, not the way any secret object would appear). We stopped, I took off my sunglasses and shielded my eyes from the sun with my hand. (The object was sitting stationary for the first four to five minutes we watched) At that time a jet with an exhaust trail crossed between us and the object. The object for a moment disappeared on the other side of the jet's trail of smoky exhaust. After the exhaust trail drifted away, we saw that the round and bright stationary object was still there and remained still. We sat down on the trail at that point to watch closely, to take in every detail. I looked around at the many people playing at the park just ahead of us up the trail to see if they were looking at it, but none were. I stopped a joger who passed us at that time. He didn't even look up, but dismissivly said planes can look all kinds of ways in the sky, and kept on jogging. Then, (and this is about four or five minutes after the initial sighting) the object started moving toward the east. I lost sight of it as it crossed nearly directly between the the sun and us. As it got further east we once again could see it. I called someone on my cell phone in an attempt to document the sighting. The person I called lives near by and could have video tapped it, but they were not home. It continued moving eastward and growing smaller in size as it was leaving. At that time another joger past whom I stopped and asked if he wanted to see something weird in the sky. He said he did so I pointed it out to him. He did see it before it disappeared, but it was much smaller by then, but still very bright. I told him it was almost gone. He commented that he could see it and that it was weird because it was so small and far away but was still bright, he thought it was unusual. But he didn't even see the the weird stuff I saw. It left our sight about six to eight minutes after the first view of it. I looked down at the little unusually intelligent three and half year old child who watched it with me and asked what he thought it was. He answered, ""Well, maybe a big magic white bowling ball?"" I do not know what it was and make no claims as to what it might have been. This is what happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Nothing out of the ordinary but then I noticed a white object zig zagging back and forth behind the jet, moving in and out of the contrail. If I had to guess at the distance behind the jet, it would have been about a few thousand feet to as little as a few hundred. The object would suddenly increase in speed and catch up to the jet almost then back off, all the while zig zagging. It would move as far away as several thousand feet out of the contrail on either side of it as well. Then the object appeared to enter the contrail and move straight toward the jet. You could see the clouds/contrail actually be distorted by the object. This went on until I could no longer see the jet or the object and could only barely make out the contrail. It's  a bright sunny day (not a single cloud in the sky) so it made it hard to see as it got further away. I was to the point of being concerned that the object was going to catch and run into the jet.  I'm in a location that sees countless jets fly over during the day as they move out from atlanta to the northeast. I frequently can look up in the sky and see 8 or 10 of them at any given time but I have never seen anything like this.  One of the strangest things I've ever seen.

You couldn’t see any space in between the lights at all.  It didn’t garner my attention initially since the final approach corridor for San Jose International Airport is over that general area.  But then I started to realize that it was much brighter than aircraft lights and didn’t have anti-collision lights, something that I can normally see on planes all the way to San Jose.  As I grew more curious, I realized it was not moving and seemed to be pretty low in the sky.  Ok, a helicopter, I thought.  However, there is a municipal airport about 3 miles away from me and I am familiar with all sorts of helicopters as that is where they normally stage aircraft for fighting the big wildfires up in the hills from me.  Ok, so what is it?  I’m officially very curious at this point and do a line-of-sight to see if it is just moving very slowly.  Nope.  Not moving.  The lights were what had my attention, as I’m watching I’m seeing white lights, a large red one in the center, and occasionally the flickering green or blue.  They were twinkling like starlight, but they were much larger than stars, lower in the sky than stars (fog was coming in over the hills) and so much brighter!  So now I’m thinking they must be having some sort of light show on El Toro Mountain, the large cone-shaped hill that most people think Morgan Hill got its name.  But that explanation didn’t sit well with me, it was truly very, very bright lights.  Then, as I’m watching, the series of lights cut in half, like someone had put up a card in my viewing and cut off the lower half of the object.  So now I’m telling myself, yes, it is a show on El Toro and they’re making their way to the other side of the hill, where I can no longer see them.  However, at that point, the lights dimmed greatly and it zipped off at a high rate of speed to the north.  Being familiar with the landing approaches of! aircraf t to San Jose, it was not on the flight path and the lights now were far dimmer than normal aircraft and there was still no anti-collision lights.  It was also much faster than any aircraft I’ve seen go down the corridor.  I’ve been pouring over the internet and newspapers this morning to see if anyone else reported something odd in the sky, because I am certainly curious to know what it was.  I couldn’t have been the only person admiring the night sky last night, and the object seemed to be over Morgan Hill and within sight of the 101 highway.  Thank you for the opportunity to report this (can’t wait to see what my IT guy thinks when he sees “UFO reporting form” in my internet search queries).",2008-03-04T00:00:00,37.1027,-121.6001

At first we thought nothing of it we just assumed it was a commercial jet on its way to Columbus airport which is close by.  However as we got closer to the object it became apparent that the object was close and was not moving.   I slowed my car down and tried to get a good look at it; I saw that the object was hovering about 100-150 ft. above a nearby house and not moving.   The craft was triangle shaped and had a white light on each corner and a red light somewhere near the middle.  It was a full moon so I was easily able to see the shape of the craft against the sky, the craft was not white like a commercial jet, it was either gray or black, the only way I was easily able to distinguish its shape was by observing it against the moonlight sky.   It was difficult to tell how ""tall"" the craft was because I was observing it mostly from the bottom so the craft could have been pyramidal.   I slowly passed the house the craft was hovering over and immediately turned around once I realized what I was looking at.  When I was about half way back to the house the craft started slowly flying away to the south-east.   As I was drawing nearer to the craft it tilted to the right and gained speed and headed off towards Columbus (to the south-east).    As I mentioned earlier it was a full moon out and there were a few clouds in the sky that were white because they were being illuminated by the moon, I believe this is the only reason I was able to distinguish the craft's shape.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,40.0097,-82.6718

Wheeling IL, nortwest suburb of Chicago. Craft going northwest while gaining altitude.  This is just a little sighting, and I'm not sure what it was...but maybe their were other witnesses that had a better view.  I was driving home (my house is in Wheeling), and was very close...only a few blocks away, when i looked up and saw litle lights in the sky. They caught my attention because they were pretty bright, they may have been orange (it happend over a week ago...so I'm not 100% on this), but I absolutely remember they were NOT blinking. Most airplanes I've seen have blinking lights. I could not see a real shape to the craft, it was very dark and the craft was pretty far away - but the lights were in a straight line.  I assumed that the lights being in a straight line mean that the craft was like a cylindar or cigar shape...with the lights being placed along the side of the ship, atleast one in the front and one in the back.  Based on this assumption I noticed something strange: The craft was flying northwest while going higher in the sky. But the light on the front part of the craft was much lower, almost at a 45% angle to the light at the very the back of the craft. Opposite of what you would assume of an airplane, where the ""nose"" would be higher than the tail. It moved fairly quickly and i was able to watch it fly pretty far away...but the lights NEVER changed angles.  (I also thought that was wierd, and it made me think it those lights were probably not on the wings if it were an airplane).  I was driving and only saw it for a minute or 2. i pulled over for a minute, and drove quickly home (i was only a block away at this point) and ran into the house to get a witness, but ofcourse when i came out it was gone.  It really did seem to be pretty close. Around here we have Ohare airport, and a smaller airport for personal and corporate planes called Palwaukee Airport. I often see planes flying near our house, that are pretty low from taking off from either of those locations. This did look like it could have taken off from one of those airports, because it was low to the ground and I see planes flying in that route. But it was absolutely quiet...no sound at all and i did have everything in my car turned off and stopped driving for a minute (like i said). ALso, as i mentioned before, the angle it seemed to be flying was very differnt.  Being so close to airports, there were ofcourse airplanes flying...but it looked like they were either flying higher or were farther away. Still there were at least 2-3 other airplanes in the same area of the sky that i saw while watchin this object. The object did not look likeit was following them or in anyway flying differently because of those airplanes.  So I have no clue what it was. I didn't submit it earlier because I had only seen it for a minute or two...and was unable to discuss any EXTRODINARY details. But after i heard the coast to coast show last night and mentioned my little experiance with a coast 2 coast chat channel i visit, a friend suggested I submit my story to you guys. Maybe I wasn't the only one to see it? Who knows.  Good luck.  ps - i'm sorry i cannot give you my true address. i do live in wheeling il, 60090, but in the witness contact information form i gave you US Cellular Field's information. However, the e-mail address is correct, so if you want to get in touch with me please use my email. I check it very often.  thanks.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,42.1286,-87.9237

I work for a major airline at OHare, I am a taxi mechanic. I have the job responsibilty of moving aircraft under there own power from gate to gate or the hangar complex for maintenance. We also accomplish the engine run-up testing needed. So I hope that does something for establishing a little of credibility for my report. I am still in absolute wonder and amazement at what I saw that afternoon.  Around 1630 a pilot made a comment on the radio about a circle or disc shapped object hovering over gate C-17 at the C concourse in Chicago. At frist we laughed to each other and then the same pilot said again on the radio that is was about 700feet agl (above ground level). The day was overcast with the ceiling being reported at 1600 feet if I remember correctly. I was taxing a Boeing 777 from the Intl Terminal to the Company Hanger on the North side of the Airport. As we passed the C Terminal on the Alpha taxiway we observed a dark gray hazy round object hovering over OHare Intl Airport. Is was definately over the C Terminal. It was holding very steady and appeared to be trying to stay close to the cloud cover. The radio irrupted with chatter about the object and the ATC controler that was handling ground traffic made a few smart comments about the alleged UFO siting above the C terminal.  We had to contiune moving the aircraft to the hangar. After parking I noticed the craft of no longer there but there was an almost perfect circle in the cloud layer were the craft had been. The hole disappeared a few minutes later.  For the rest of the night there were jokes made on the radio about the siting.

I'm a management employee for a major airline and was sitting in my office at around 1630 on Nov. 7th when an employee made a radio call to our station operations center concerning an object hovering over gate C17 at O'hare International Airport.  I ran out of my office and saw a relatively small object hovering in place over C17.  The METAR was reporting OVC 1900 and I initially estimated the object hovering at about 1000 feet.  After about a minute, I saw the aircraft zip to the east and disappeared.  I immediately called our operations center to confirm the sighting and the FAA was contacted while I drove to the other concourse to talk with the witnesses.  I spoke with an employee working that gate who said he was compelled to look straight up for some reason and was startled to see the craft hovering silently.  He then made the radio call and notified the pilots at that gate who opened the front windows and witnessed the object for themselves.  The employee stated the object was 500-1000 feet above the ground, rotating, and metallic in nature with no lights.  He said it looked like a frisbe and was directly above.  The FAA reported no radar blips and I believe the TSA was notified.  Our shift manager was notified and the incident was immediately reported to our WHQ Operations Center. All employees are very familiar with aircraft around the world's busiest airport - this was nothing we are familiar with.  As a side note as it is probably unrelated, the next aircraft into that gate was experiencing electrical problems.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,,

If anyone has information which pertains to this case, we would encourage them to contact Mr. Marchant at the telephone number and e-address for him, shown above.  PD)) This investigation was conducted with the cooperation and permission of Mr. Peter Davenport, director of the National UFO Reporting Center in Davenport, Washington who took the original report of the witness through his NUFORC reporting system. The original report is as follows minus witness personal  information:   Date: 01/20/08  Time:05:58 am  Duration: 7 minutes  Sighting City: East Dublin  Sighting State: Georgia  Sighting County: Laurens  # of witnesses: 2  Shape: Oval  # of craft: 1  Description: Landing of a 3 lighted, fairly large craft with pulsing red to amber lights. No sound at all. Description by witness narrative:  I  wasn’t going to report this until I saw that someone else from this exact same city experienced something similar just two months ago. So, I decided to also write a report since there must obviously be something going on here that is unexplained and I would like answers. Earlier this morning (Sunday Jan. 20th, 2008) at approximately 5:58 AM I decided to look out my front door to see if the ground was covered with ice (we had a lot of rain last evening and freezing temperatures overnight), and as I was looking out the front door I noticed something completely strange to my left.  It was floating above the tree line across from a field approximately ½ mile from my front door. The lights were pulsating from red to orange (similar to flames from a forest fire) as this thing or craft was slowly receding behind the tree line behind the open field” “It seemed to have three large lights from the side I was seeing. And judging from the neighbor’s house down the road and the distance this craft was from their home and ours, it had to be at least the size of 4 or 5 homes combined, possibly even larger. A truly amazing sight and a camera was the last thing on my mind”. “Anyway, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, so I went to wake my wife up to verify what I was seeing. She quickly awoke when I told her that she had to see something that was going to blow her mind. I was hoping this thing wouldn’t be gone before we made it back to the front door. When we both got to the front door it was still there and was now half way down behind the tree line. My wife said “oh my God, what is that?” We both looked at it in awe as it descended behind the trees and seemed to have landed”. ‘The area it seemed to have landed in is near a creek in a swampy area.  In a place people wouldn’t  normally go or have good access to. All I could think is why would someone or something be landing there”. “ My wife and I stared in the direction for nearly an hour to see if it was going to fly away. She described it as being similar to the sun going down behind the trees due to the brightness it displayed and the red and orange colors, but this definitely wasn’t the sun, it was only 5:58 AM and was in the north west during the dark of night. She was only able to see the top half of the object and the lights as it was already landing as I awoke her. We both couldn’t believe what we had just seen. This definitely was like nothing I had ever seen, especially this close to our own home.. I must mention that I am prior military (US. Army Veteran) and I am very observant and have an IQ of 138. This definitely didn’t seem like any modern day aircraft that our military would have and even if it were, why would they land in the middle of the swampy creek area at 5:58 AM on a Sunday morning”? “As far as the shape of the craft, it seemed to be an oval shape and had no sound at all as we stepped out the front door to listen as it was landing. Another thing that was real odd was that this is in a suburban neighborhood with lots of yard animals and none of the dogs were barking at all and the air was dead silent”. “As big as the object was and as bright as the lights were, we were expecting to at least hear the neighborhood dogs barking, but none were”. “After waiting on the front porch of our home for close to an hour with blankets to keep warm, we finally decided to go back into the house. We were hoping this craft would come back up from the wooded area and would show itself once again while leaving, but it never did. And no, I don’t plan on going in that area of the woods and swamp to see it close up either. I will be keeping a guarded eye on that area for the next few nights and even months to see if anything else happens there”. “All I can say about this is that we’re definitely not alone and these things are making themselves known. I’m just wondering why they aren’t trying to communicate more clearly if they are superior life forces. It\ almost feels as though we are like the ants living in the ant farm and they just observe us when they want to. A little food for thought there.”. “Anyway, thanks for allowing me to vent about this here, because I surely can’t tell me friends(sic) about this. I’m not sure how they would take it”. END OF ORIGINAL REPORT!  Upon receiving the permission of Mr. Peter Davenport to investigate this sighting report he sent this Field Investigator for MUFON the witness contact information. I contacted the witness by phone and set up an appointment at his home for January 31st, 2008 at 3PM. The primary witness is  married with two children, a boy  and a girl . He owns his own business. His wife  works at a local business. Their residence was very clean and modern.  East Dublin, Ga. is a very clean and prosperous appearing town located in Laurens County, Ga. long: w 82.9 and lat: n 32.5. This FI arrived at the witness’ address at 1PM on 1/31/08  and spent the next hour scouting the area of the sighting and getting the lay-out of the community/neighborhood surrounding the residence.  Moving North passed the residence on the road they live , on the right side of the road at approximately 100 feet distance from witness” driveway is a high-end subdivision  made up of approximately 1 acre parcels with large,modern homes which are located in an open, spacious property with a view across its expanse of approximately ½ mile in most directions. The road upon which the witness lives dead ends 1.10 miles into another road that runs in a West to East direction.  100 yards to the East on this road is a Georgia Power Company grid line of tall electrical towers. On the North side of this road the grid can be seen running at the foot of a long ridge (hill) approximately 250 to 300 feet high in a West to Easterly direction. This power line grid crosses over this road in a South Eastern direction where a creek crosses under the roadway at a bridge and the creek and the grid together runs into and through a swampy, mixed forest area of several 100’s of acres. The creek has created a boggy, wet-land area and there are no roads, paths, or other entrances into this location, which is the direction of the witness’ sighting from his residence of 1.10 miles south of the creek.  Heading back South on the witness’ road I went to the junction with another Georgia highway and headed East for 3 ½ miles. This road lead me to a power substation in 2 miles from the resident’s road. I also noticed the other side of the ridge and swampy wet-land with several tree farms and cotton fields for the 3 ½ miles. Back at the residence, directly in front of it is a tree farm . This appeared to have a road that runs around the South border of the subdivision that may give access to the power-grid approximately 1 mile away that crosses both of the other roads in the area. However this land is posted with a locked gate with no contact information given on signs. Witness does not know who owns this property.  Leaving the neighborhood I drove back into East Dublin business district and decided to have lunch at a very small, one room restaurant . I enquired of the owner if he had heard of any UFO sightings. He had not.  I arrived at the witness’ residence at 3PM. He was warm and friendly but was still plenty excited about what he and his wife had witnessed the morning of 1/20/08 and began immediately showing me the area and recapping the event. Inside the home I conducted an interview and at first brought up the issue of the time of the sighting at 05:58 AM mentioned several times in the original report, inquiring  as to what he was doing up at that time of morning after a cold, rainy, stormy night, on a day most would “sleep in”. The witness stated he arose to check for “snow” as the local weather provider had said it was a possibility that night and he wanted to show it to the family.  This FI having checked the weather report, etc. before my interview, indicating according to the U.S. Naval Observatory Astronomical Department as follows: For the East Dublin area 1/20/08 @ 04:21 AM EST- winds had been out of the NW with gusts up to 20 MPH. There had been rain over the area for several hours: humidity averaged 81 % .  A severe weather system had moved across Georgia the evening of 1/19/08 and on into 1/20/08. Temperature averaged around 47* F. No snow recorded in the area. Sunrise 1/20/08 was @ 7:32AM EST. The Moon was waxing  Gibeous with a (95% disk surface showing/ illuminated and was 2 days before full which set at the “exact” time of 05:58 AM that morning 1/20/08(Thanks to MUFON ASD GA. MARK AUSMUS for exact moon charts) Charts on file. Witness said the sky was clear at the time of the sighting.  Please note that the lack of animal activity (barking of dogs) that the witness originally reported does not seem to this FI to be in anyway connected to the sighting as most critters, especially family yard dogs would be bedded down after such a weather system that lasted around 12 hours  and 2 hours before sunrise.  Nothing appears unusual of this time frame(at this time) and the witness remembers seeing the exact time of 05:58 AM on the DVD player near the front door from which the sighting took place, which he showed me. The witness had viewed the object as he looked out of the decorative glass, front door panel, noticed the lights and opened the door.  Recapping( again) the sighting as recorded in the original report, I had the witness go over the statement about the size estimate . I discovered that what he actually saw were 3 large, bright red/orange lights encapsulated inside a half “dome” shape, rounded part to the top, and the 3 lights were inside, tapered back from the bottom to the top as if they were  3 panels of light. The panels of light appeared “fire like” the sun, rather than pulsating. Estimating the size of the object was based on a neighbors house approximately ¼ mile North on his road. I had him do a measure at arms length exercise and we determined the object to be 1 ½ inches to 2 inches at arms length, making the object 100 to 175 feet in length along its bottom at 1 mile distance. The entire period of the actual event was 7 to 8 minutes.  Next the witness took me outside to show the exact location ( again) where he saw the object and where his wife joined him on the porch. The direction was North, North East, not NNW as originally reported. It was NNE across the open area over the subdivision at approximately 3/4/ to 1 mile distance according to my compass readings and previous drive through observations. If the object had been floating down behind the ridge line off the other road north of the location, it would not have lit up the trees, like the witness stated to this FI, and it did light up trees located closer to a small pond located on the North East side of the subdivision. It appeared to come down behind the silhouette of one specific, large pine tree near the pond about ¼ mile away but the distance was probably closer to a ½  to 1 mile away in the swamp land. The witness stated that the object maneuvered “blimp like”, moving very slowly and drifting down from about an 80 degree angle above the large pine tree and there was sky line well below the object estimated at about 100 to 150 feet above the large pine tree. Again, I wish to emphasize, as this FI viewed the exact angle of the objects dissent, it would have had to go down in front of the ridge line located on  the  other road to the north , not behind it. Again, this ridge is 1.10 miles from the residence and an astronomical object would have went down behind the ridge. That would put the object going down into the swamp off the northern border road.  I next spoke to the second witness, the wife, by phone at her place of business and her description was as the original report, but reiterated that “it looked like the Sun going down at Sunset”. I asked if she had noticed anything unusual sense the sighting. She stated that their house lights had been surging up and down over that day and a few days following. At this phone interview (on speaker phone) her husband recalled with her that the automatic, dawn to dusk, mercury vapor light in the driveway had gone out as well during that time and had not come back on. This driveway light has sense been repaired and both bulb and sensor had to be replaced. The witness also remembered at this time that he had been having all the rechargeable batteries in their cell phones, remote keyboard to his business computer and the children’s electronic toys in his home office being drained of their charges. He would charge them up and next day they would be uncharged. This FI after returning to Savannah discovered that my brand new camera’s batteries were completely drained and I had put new ones in that morning before leaving for East Dublin. Coincidence? Maybe! Witness had also noticed an intermiten humming sensation/noise  in his and his wife’s ears for 3 weeks after the sighting. I had the witness file a formal complaint with the Georgia Power Company and at first the customer service representative said that they are not able to look up previous  power problems. Instead they did a new report on the fact that witness was experiencing humming noise and “possible power surges sense the 19th-20th through the end of January 08. No mention was made of the battery drainage to Georgia Power company. A Ga. Power technician was dispatched to the residence that day. The witness inquired if they could explain the humming sensations and the power fluctuations, or any other problems for that time period.  The Technician’s log book indicated that 2 power sub-stations went out between January 20th and 21st, in the area. He unlocked the house’s power meter and did a few tests inside the meter ands stated it was working fine. The humming noise was not detected and the technician could only say that what had been happening must have been caused by the 2 downed sub-stations . The Technician could give no explaination for the substations failures. At this writing the only problem electrically , seems to be the continual drain of freshly charged batteries in the home. This FI nor the witness can figure this out at this time.  This FI first speculated that the witnesses may have seen the “Moon set” as it did in fact set at exactly the same moment the object seemed to land in the swamp. However, the Moon set in a wooded area directly” behind” the residence and was about 120 degrees in the opposite direction in the West North Westerly location at the time of the sighting. The witness stated that the object never rose up after 1 hour . After approximately 30 minutes of waiting for the object to rise , a meteor, which the witness described as normal except that it was very short in duration with only a very short trajectory of about 1 to 2 inches at arms length appearing. They speculated that they felt it was connected in some way with the object. This FI does not.  As the witness’ children arrived from school on the day of the interview/investigation, he introduced me to them and I interviewed them briefly. They had not seen anything, but knew all about the details. The  daughter had had a “nightmare” about seeing the lights similar to what her parent’s had described and had drawn a picture (on file) of the object. She slept with her parent’s that night. This FI does not believe this was a “recall” experience by the child but simply that this incident has impacted this family in a stressful and negative way.  The witness claims to have a high IQ and so does his  son. The witness has been troubled over the fact that he cannot reconcile what he saw with what he knows to be normal and logical, He has stated to this FI that it affected him as he has become protective and concerned for the families safety more than usual. This FI believes  the daughter has seen and heard her parent’s attempts to explain the incident and became fearful.  I told the witness to consider playing down the incident to help his daughter overcome her initial fears. He agreed.  This FI has 35 years experience as a professional clinical counselor and 27 years as a Christian Pastor and I can say with some certain knowledge that the witnesses (husband & wife) have experienced something that has disturbed their normal life in a dramatic way and this disturbance has spilled over to their children. I have checked back once per week with the witness as of this writing and they are still trying to figure out what they saw.  UFO TOOLS website gives this case with the evidence available at a 57.5% reliability, strangeness 14.29%, info quality 10%, certainty 00.82% Valle classification is FB1 possibly FB2 considering the electrical circumstantial evidence. The probability of the object being a plasma ball over  the power grid would be highly likely except for the fact that it was first seen moving 100 to 150 feet above the tree line that hides the grid line from line of sight from the witness’ front porch. Along with the appearance of being a “dome” or half a circle/sphere with lighted panels ,this probability is slim . FYI/ The witness mentioned the reason he made the report was because of another sighting in East Dublin 2 months prior. This incident also was reported to NUFORC on 11/26/2007. The report is similar at first examination and I can see why this witness of 1/20/08 was prompted to file his report. It was unfortunate that this FI was unable to gain access to the swampy area where the object went down to check for traces of its presence. However, due to the overall evidence of the circumstances and the insistence of the witness to remain anonymous, and the consistency of the testimonies and the adverse affect it had on the them and their children, I conclude at this time that this case should be classified “unknown”. However, this case will remain open for this FI and contact with these witnesses will continue until I am personally satisfied they have some closure.  David I.

It was a clear night and i usally will see maybe two or 3 in the sky at a time but this was diffrent.  There were alot of aircraft in the sky flying in clusters of 3 and fours heading north north east. It was very odd. When my wife got home about 15 minutes later i was telling her how odd it was to see so many aircraft in the sky at one time, at that point I went back outside to see a cluster of 3 aircraft flying in the same direction at which point i called my wife outside to show her.

Clear Lake was celebrating the forth of July with fireworks on July 7th, 2007 at about 9:50pm. The fireworks lasted until around 10:30 pm. My family, including my son-in-law and his wife and kids, were standing on our pier just as the fireworks ended. It was a crystal clear evening and you could easily see the left-over smoke from the fireworks against the darkening starlit night. The left-over firework smoke was drifting about 2-300 feet high and 500 yards out from me moving left to right as we stood on the pier looking to the north.  My 36 year old son-in-Law pointed out this moving object to our left above the firework smoke moving left to right seemingly glowing like a flame. It was circular and it appeared to look like the fire and glow of the tail pipe of a fighter jet without noise or sound. The object was the size of a medium aircraft but perfectly round. The object was moving much faster then the firework smoke still drifting across the northern sky. I look even further back to my left and it looked like several of these fiery objects were line up in single file like you would see at an airport with airplanes lined up to land. The fiery objects past over head right in front of us in single file and moved rapidly east and upwards until they when out of sight. I counted eight of them which flu west to east almost horizon to horizon.  As a 15 year veteran NBC affiliate director/producer in television, I frequently carry a video camera for chasing storms and news stories and decided to run to grab my video camera in our cottage during the sighting. It only took me seconds to grab my video gear but before I could get it started recording I was only able to video tape one single object flying left to right climbing out of sight like the other seven objects. Then two more of the objects with the same look, flying perfectly parallel to each other flu to the center of the lake and follow the exact same course until the two glow flame objects perfectly turn together in unison and instead of following the rest of the glow-flame objects to the east, they headed directly straight to the north where I facing during the time I was video taping. The other eight objects all flew to the east and climbed out of sight, but the last two that flew side-by-side did not climb like the others but kept the same altitude of about one thousand feet until they drop from sight in the northern horizon. The whole event lasted about 20-30 minutes with the objects seemingly spaced evenly apart.  The firework smoke was still slowly drifting east about 5 miles and hour after the incendent. These objects maneuvered about and were traveling much faster then the firework smoke. I stood there on the pier looking at one last glowing light that did not move in the west and I was not sure that it was another glow-flame object. I gave it about 5 minutes and wrote it off to being a water tower beacon off in the distance.  I went inside the cottage for a bit and returned in about 20 minutes later to find that the object I waiting on, that I thought was a water tower beacon we not in the west  and in fact, there were no lights at all. So then I assume it was one of the objects I had been witnessing and did not stick around long enough to see where that UFO headed.    There were many people on the lake that night and witnessed these objects. I work with a man who was at the yacht club on the lake that night with approximately 100 guests for a graduation party who all witnessed the fireworks and the same objects.  I called 911 and to my surprise no one had reported what I had seen. There have not been any reports in newspapers or media since then. I have talked to a few people who live at the lake who claim they either saw the objects that night or heard about it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone for an extended amount of time.  He is a serior executive for a major company, and we deem him to be an excellent witness.  We would welcome other reports from the many other individuals who, we understand, were witness to the same event.  PD))",2007-08-07T00:00:00,41.7096,-84.9479

It was very high up in the sky, so I assumed it was a comet or something of that sort. I pointed it out and told my five friends to look at it. As they looked up at it, the single vertical line split into 2 vertical lines and started descending down to the earth. It still appeared very high in the sky at this point. About 15-25 seconds after the single line diverged into 2 lines, it had diverged again into 4 vertical lines. At this point it was very close to ground level. I'm guessing it was 2-3 miles away from where we were looking at it. It was very dark so it is hard to judge the distance it actually was but it was not far away at all. When it had finally appeared at ground level, there were 2 horizontal rows of lights with 4 lights in each row. The light wasn't nearly as intense now as it was when I had first mistaken it for a comet in the sky, but the light formation clearly made the shape of a saucer and at this point we had no doubt it was a UFO. About 10 seconds after it had fully descended and the 2 rows of lights had appeared, the outermost two vertical rows of lights faded away and immediately following after the center two vertical row of lights faded away. We were silent the whole time we watched this thing descend down onto the earth but after the lights had completely faded, we all confirmed that it was a UFO we had all just witnessed. The grandson of the owner of the property soon told us that his grandparents had witnessed UFOs before on the property (I think he said they saw one about 50 years ago) and that his grandfather had actually coined the city of Earlville's motto as ""The Center of the Universe"".",2007-08-07T00:00:00,41.6006,-88.9385

I stepped out on the balcony to smoke a cigarette. I looked up at the sky and saw several stars and noticed one that was particularly bright. As I watched it, I noticed that it was moving in very distinct and changing patterns. Thinking that I must be moving, I steadied myself against the railing and the object was still moving. Thinking I must still be moving, I backed up against the building and placed my back and head against the wall...still moving. I looked at the surrounding celestial objects (stars etc) and they were all standing still. As I watched, the object moved back and forth at breakneck speeds. It wouldn't curve when it changed course but, instead it would reverse direction in a straight line. Occasionally the object would stop and just hover in place, then it started moving in patterns, sometimes in a circle, sometimes in a figure eight, sometimes in a triangle pattern, always stopping and hovering before changing patterns. This went on and on, after twenty minutes, I went and got the two ladies working in the laundry and they confirmed that they saw the same thing. They also noticed that the object was changing colors, always white but sometimes bluish whate and other times a greenish/yellowish white. During the incident, a helicopter flew over, I could hear the helicopter but the object made no noise whatsoever. Still trying to disprove what I was seeing, I thought perhaps that a thermal was rising in front of the object making it appear to move but, just before dawn a heavy fog rolled in and eveything in the sky disappeared except for this object which was still faintly visible. Around 7am, two other female employees came in and I showed them and they saw the exact same thing. It was the weirdest thing I ever saw, I am going to try to take a video camera to work in case the object returns.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,35.78020909090909,-83.56898181818183

The first was the moon and the 2nd was a BRIGHT white light below it located in the NW sky. The object caught my eye because of the size and location; it was much closer to the earth’s surface than any other stars I have ever seen. It wasn’t the North Star that’s for sure. Also the brightness of this object was amazing. As I looked at this bright white light I notice every 10 to 15 seconds that it would put of a reddish pulse around the stationary white light kind of a glow. This object resembled a star. It was not moving in any direction .It looked like it was in orbit kind of but slowly descending from below the moon. I know this wasn’t a star or airplane or satellite or anything I had ever seen before it was to close and to bright and the red pulse made it even stranger. At this point I was looking at it with my naked eye. I went in the house to grab my video camera the object didn’t appear to be going anywhere. I set my camera up on a tripod what I would see next as I zoomed in on the object was truly amazing and unreal. At this point my wife and two next door neighbors were looking at this thing with binoculars. As I zoomed in and focused on the light the object took shape and color it was oval looking and would kind of tear drop on the top and bottom. The light it was putting off was bright white and energetic looking and you could see small black circles around the entire object almost like heat vapors and then it would pulse a reddish glow. It looked like jet burst from behind the object. The bursts were not consistent and would last about 2 seconds, but the object didn’t appear to move. I now this sounds crazy but I got 45 minutes of this on video. I am trying to get it on my computer so I can send it in as well. The object would disappear into the fog layer that moved in.

We ran to the edge of the forest to see what was happening, and from somewhere in the middle, a large round disk, about 300 yards away rose up and sped off in the opposite direction (south). The bottom of it was mezmerizing, like a light show. A large blue light in the center of it moved around in a spiral toward the outer edges; and the object was outlined in a flashing changing color light. The next day, we followed one of our trails to where the object had been. What we founfd was unbelivable. A 40ft by 40ft area of the forest, in the shape of a circle, had no leaves at all. None were on the ground, and there were no plants. And all around the area lush greens leaves were everywhere. The trees were untouched, no branch was out of place. The end. P.S.

Small white light with halo effect observed near Dubhe, (the lower star at the outside edge of the Big Dipper’s inverted cup.) It was a cold night and the sky was perfectly clear, with the Moon setting low on the western horizon. I was outside looking at the sky in the area of the Big Dipper’s cup when a round, white light suddenly ""turned on"" just to the left (west) of Dubhe in a horizontal line with the star. (I was facing North.) The light was visible for about one-half second and had a distinct halo around it. Other stars in the sky exhibited no halo effect, including the setting Moon. The light remained in the exact same position during the entire time it was visible. For comparison, the light was roughly the size of a nickel held at arm’s length. When viewed with the naked eye, the light appeared to be about twice as large as the star Dubhe and roughly twice as bright. Its duration was brief, but the light was steady in appearance while it lasted. It did not flash or fade in and out--it simply turned on, showed a halo effect, and turned off.  After the light disappeared, I held my hand against the sky to estimate its distance from the star Dubhe. It was about three fingers distance from Dubhe in a horizontal line to the left of the star. I couldn’t estimate the altitude of the light with any accuracy. It seemed to be at a great distance from me and gave me the impression that it might be beyond the earth’s atmosphere in space, but it was clearly visible.  I retrieved my binoculars from inside and swept the whole sky in every direction to see if I could detect another light like it, but I saw nothing unusual for over an hour. I served in the military and am familiar with all sorts of military and commercial aircraft and their navigational lights and I recognize satellites when I see them. The light I saw was not like those objects. Most commercial aircraft uses a flight pattern well to the East of my town and we do not see military aircraft here on a regular basis.

At this point my mouth went dry and i started to shake i guess due to the adrenilne as it got closer i stood on a chair so i was right out my window a looked right up at this thing. its hard to say how high up it was in the sky i would guess at about half the hieght an airliners would be at.

I woke up suddenly and it appeared to be daylight. I looked at my clock which said 12:05 which startled me because I thought it was noon and was supposed to have met my daughter in town at 7:45 a.m. A closer look at clock made me realize it was midnight, not noon, since the display did not say ""p.m."". I ran around house and looked out windows. It was so light that I could see distant neighbors houses. I live on top of a mountain near a river in a very rural area and there are no street lights. Usually, night time is pitch black unless there's a full moon.  But even full moons don't light up the night like this ""light"" was. I looked up in sky and could see the moon which didn't even appear to be a quarter of a moon. The sky appeared cloudy. I knew light wasn't coming from moon but was too scared to go outside to try to determine what was lighting up the sky so brightly.  There were no flashes or bright objects that I could see by looking out all the windows. The light had a strange cast to it, not quite like normal daylight but just as bright as day time. The trees and plants were sparkling. I was very scared and locked myself in bedroom with my dog who acted strangely also. Since it was midnight I didn't call anyone but just layed in bed as the strange light came in windows.  I felt strange and subdued and frozen to my bed. I felt like I was sedated and the time seemed to be passing by faster than normal. These sensations could have been caused by my extreme fright though, and not be an outside force. It crossed my mind that the lit-up night was due to a huge craft hoovering over the house. I heard no sounds. I never slept but finally the real sunlight came with dawn and the strange light was gone. I have a friend who works nights as a security guard. I called her up later in the morning and asked her if she had noticed anything strange the night before without telling her about my experience. She said that she was driving home some time after 11:00 p.m. on 4/6/06 and as she approached Nevada City that the night sky seemed to be like day time. She said she had the feeling of a huge space craft hoovering above her car as she drove but she never saw one. I then told her what I had experienced just an hour after she had seen it. It had scared her also but she had tried to tell herself that it must have just been a strange weather phenomenon. I live on top of the mountain.

I was just about to enter the building where I work and I happened to look West and I noticed what appeared to be an airplane (very slow moving). The craft was only visible as a orangeish reddish light about the size of two large stars. I watched it for about ten seconds or so and looked down for about 5 seconds. When I glanced back up the craft had covered a pretty good amount of distance, became twice as bright, three times as large, and appeared to be shining a broad flood light just south of my location, which I found very odd. As I continued to watch I noticed low hanging, wispy clouds which accounted for the distinct appearance of the ""beam"" of light, but now the light spread was facing the rear of the craft. The object now looked like a comet without the long tail.  At this point it now had my complete undivided attention, which is good because the next event made me cast all doubts as to weather or not this was a publicly known craft. In a odd way the craft had now either exploded or accelerated in  a completley different direction, the best I can describe is NNW (45* difference in original path) and about 10* higher. When it did this, a very distinct shockwave caused the surrounding clouds to curl on themselves, similar to a plane breaking the sound barrier but in a much larger fashion (no noise at all for the entire duration of sighting). When this happened, the appearance of the craft slowly faded out. From the time I looked back up at the craft to the time it was no longer visible was about 50 seconds or so.  I have seen many many meteors, 1 meteorite and a couple of balzacks (the term I believe is given to a meteor exploding in the atmosphere, occasionaly audible) and as far as my experience has taught me, this was niether a rock nor known plane. Perhaps it was a satillite re-entering but I was under the impression that those are brighter and not nearly as slow moving. This craft did not at any time leave a debris trail as such other objects tend to do.  In summary, it looked like a very slow moving plane at first with no blinking lights, then it looked like a police helecopter with a searchlight (but MUCH broader) and then a comet without its charachteristic long tail and finally, *pow*, gone.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,38.6839,-121.0526

The lights would light up in the sky and would linger there for like 2-3 minutes and then slowly spin to the right and the spinning got faster because they shot off pretty fast. I know there is a road in the mountain you have to pass and those lights were on the side of the city  but off into the distance more south. I was litteraly on the phone with my mom the rest of the way to phoenix. I just want to write this in case someone else might have seen this or something similar happen, in the same area.

When one of them came back inside, a woman working out near me asked him what they were looking at. He said “that UFO that’s just hanging up there!” She and I both immediately went outside to look.  We saw, about 30 degrees from the horizon, a spherical object hovering motionless over SSE Santa Fe. It had the transparent appearance of a soap bubble, and was about 1/8  the size of my thumbnail held at arm’s length.  The woman who walked out with me instantly cried “that’s a weather balloon!”, and went back inside, cursing the staff person for a fool.

I carry a pair of inexpensive 2x8 opera glasses with me in my truck for observing wildlife.

It was a calm day, but one would think there would be some breeze at the apparent height of the object, which seemed to be about 500 to 1000 feet.

It was bright white and appeared to be on fire. The moving flames were white hot, however, not orange, yellow, or red. I felt no thud of impact, heard no sounds, nor saw flames of an explosion.  I ran to my car and drove east along our road to check the neighbors’ homes for flames or evidence of a crash site where a small plane may have crashed. I was basically looking for flames. Finding nothing, I hurried home and called 911 to report what I’d seen to the Crow Wing County Sheriff’s office. After discussing it with the dispatcher, I jumped on a snowmobile and looked for signs of an aircraft crash out on the lake ice, finding nothing.  A short time later I received a call from the investigator from the sheriff’s office who had just checked Northgate Lane, further to the east. He, too, found nothing, and we concluded that we were looking for a needle in a haystack, and that I might have seen a meteorite.

As I had this realization, the smaller light dimmed and disappeared, within about 5 seconds, without changing position relative to the horizon.  I continued to watch the brighter object, and marked it’s position relative to the horizon using some tree branches that were off to one side that allowed me to sort of triangulate the light’s position.  Several airplane contrails were visible nearby, illuminated by the sunset. These came and went while the object remained still.  Over the course of the next 35 minutes, the light did not move relative to the horizon in the slightest. However it also, though much more slowly, dimmed in brightness and turned more and more red, until, once twilight had ended and it was completely dark, it was orange instead of blue-white and perhaps magnitude 6 or 7. A few minutes later it became completely non-visible. Up to the point it was no longer visible, it did not move. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Jupiter??

This was at 21:55 O'clock.  There were no clouds at the time of the sighting. The craft was moving from North to South.  It caught my attention because of how fast it was moving, which at first was in a straight line, but kept my attention because it started making very sharp, random turns.  All of the turns were very immediate, with no time spent changing directions.  Although the overall movement of the craft stayed north to South, its zigzags were alternating east and west.  It also appeared to be moving at a constant velocity during these turns, until I lost sight of it a few seconds later.  The speed was faster than a commercial jet that was also in the sky and was constant. The parts of the craft that were visible to me were the three faint white lights.  These lights did not change intensity, color, or position relative to me during its flight.  As the craft made its zigzags, the three lights stayed in the same orientation, but the craft was translated east and west.  The outer border of the craft was at times visible, but I'm not sure if it was a circle or a triangle.  The lights however were arranged in a perfect equilateral triangle. Its size appeared to be smaller than an airplane, but I could not be sure of its altitude.  The only other information that I have is that as I lost sight of it, the lights got dimmer.  I'm not sure if it was gaining altitude or not because the lights were already close together and dim, so to me they just got dimmer.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,41.8732,-88.0002

On the Thursday afternoon of November 1, 2007, I had met with a friend for lunch in Waldport, Oregon. Having originally planned on having the whole afternoon together, our lunch visit had to be cut short due to an unexpected appointment involving my friend.  Because I live in Toledo, Oregon, I decided to take advantage of the unseasonable sunny weather that afternoon by stopping along the way home to take some scenic pictures. Being semi-retired and living on the scenic Central Oregon Coast, I have enjoyed taking pictures as one of my favorite pastimes. I stopped at the Seal Rock area around 2:00 pm.  Having a digital camera, I am able to take many pictures and then sort through them at home on my PC to choose my best shots. It wasn’t until after I downloaded my pictures onto my PC that I discovered that one of my pictures had an “odd” object in the picture. When first trying to zoom in on the object in the image, I thought that the “odd object” was possibly two seagulls that were casting an unusual or “odd” appearance.  However, as I zoomed in on the objects in the image, I felt that the unusual object was not simply seagulls as I had first thought. I instead felt that I had unknowingly taken a picture of some object. I also realized that I had not seen nor heard anything unusual at the time that I was taking the pictures. Of course, being right down on the beach, it was the sounds of the pounding wave action that was heard most.  Although I have been somewhat hesitant about submitting this report and my photo image to the National UFO Reporting Center, I have decided that I must try to find out just what the object really is.  Along with this report submittal, I am also emailing the image to the National UFO Reporting Center. I am hoping that the UFO Reporting Center might be able to determine the most likely explanation for the object that appears in that one picture.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,44.5034,-123.9951

It looked exactly what you might see on TV or in the movies, a flying saucer.  It was very big, I’d say about the size of a full moon. It had colorful (blue and red to be sure) lights blinking from the bottom. Then we stopped the car on the side of the road, I was scared and shocked, I wanted someone else (besides us) to see it so, I ran out of the car and asked a man walking if he’d seen it. He said no so I had him follow me to a place it where it was very clear to see and asked him “Do you see that thing? It is a flying saucer” and he replied “Yes, I see it” he didn’t seem as shocked as I was. It appeared to be hovering back and fourth, but not really moving too much. Then I got scared and told my fiancé to drive but while we were driving I kept my eyes on it until it was hidden behind a mountain. Then about 40 seconds later when we passed the mountain and it was in sight again, I saw it was (had turned into) a blimp. The weird thing is that it looked nothing like what I’d just seen. When I got a better look at the blimp it read “FOR THE ‘IF’ IN LIFE”. I have never seen anything like that before but-I really do believe that the thing I saw was not normal.

My view is to the north and west with a 22-mile horizon view, broken by the ABA (former Quaker) building to the west.  I looked absentmindedly to the northwest sky and noticed a small, silent, disk-shaped object flying steadily on a southwestern trajectory about a quarter of a mile away and about 600 feet above the ground (it was higher than my balcony and close, but moved behind the 600-foot tall ABA building while I watched it, giving me the opportunity to judge its height).  The top and sides of the disk were completely dark, but the bottom surface was illuminated completely with a brilliant white light, as if a spotlight were shining on it from below.  The disk proceeded steadily in speed, but wobbled as it went, something like a top spinning slightly off its axis, so that every couple of seconds the illuminated underside rotated or leaned into view and then rotated away, but without the craft losing any forward momentum.  (The wobble in the disk looked a lot like the wobble you see in the various news videos of the disks from the daytime mass-event in Mexico a few years ago, which is what I immediately thought of as soon as I saw the object).  After about 20 seconds the object moved behind the ABA building and I waited for about 30 seconds for it to reappear, which it did, much further away due to its southwest trajectory and still moving at the same speed and height.  After another ten seconds it disappeared from view completely behind Marina City's west tower.  I was speechless throughout the incident, prompting my friend on the phone to ask what was wrong.  I explained everything I saw and spent several hours watching the skies from my apartment that night, but the object or another like it did not reappear.  From my apartment, I see hundreds of planes flying to and from O'Hare and flying along the flight path to Midway, as well as helicopters (traffic, police, etc.) all the time, every day and night.

Around 11:45 PM on June 5th, 2006 I was sitting in my truck in the K-Mart parking lot in Vancouver WA waiting for my mom to buy something. I then noticed two thin but very distinct tornado-like ""tendrils"" extending from the cumulus clouds in the north. (skies were partly cloudy with puffy white clouds but sunny). These formations were not dark though like regular tornadoes but as white as the clouds themselves were. So, as I watched with facination these ""cloud ropes"" form and twist and then dissipate all in a matter of about 3 or 4 minutes, I said in my mind, ""If you are really out there somewhere (meaning the aliens or just ""the Other"") then please let me see some evidence of your existence. I will help you in any way I can if I only knew you existed."" I was really sincere in this ""telepathic SOS"" and continued watching the area where the cloud tendrils formed. To my utter surprise, no less than I'd say 20 or 30 seconds after I thought this, a bright starlike object came from over those clouds. At first I figured it must be a jet or something, yet it was very bright yellowish and heading in a south easterly direction towards me. But the light of it did not dim as it traveled and over the entire time I saw it it never flickered or flashed like it was reflecting the sunlight. It was just like a very bright star only during the daytime!       So after about 4 minutes it reached a position to the right of overhead me in the blue sky (about 2 o'clock) and then slowed down and stopped! That instantly ruled out jet or airplane or satellite for me! Then it started traveling to the west towards the 12 o'clock position directly above me. As it did so I watched huge patches of white mist underneath the cumulus clouds start moving rapidly together to the area of the sky underneath this object. Then the object went behind a big cloud directly overhead of me and I watched as parts of even this big cloud swirled in distinctly circular patterns at the edge. After a few more moments of watching I couldn't find it anymore and my mom then arrived and we left.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,45.65808015267176,-122.58490839694656

It was stationary for at least five minutes.  My wife also so it; we watched it together.  I can say that it was stationary, unmoving, because at that point I saw it through the leafless upper branches of an oak tree, and with those twigs as a still screen between us and the now-stationary and still as bright as ever object, the tree wasn't moving (windless night) and the object remained at the same location when seen through those twigs.

I am very able to observe and report in extreme detail an accurate account of my observeration(s). I currently am still blessed with 20/20 vision in both eyes, but do need a 1.25 diopter lens set to read clearly.  When I observed this UFO, I was not under the influence of any vision altering drug, as I am sure Zegerid does not alter my vision and have not observed any problem whatsoever with my 'distant' vision. It was moderately snowing, and I was actually in Escadillia Bonita Acres, (spelling) in New Mexico, USA which is just East of the Arizona/New Mexico border and is located in New Mexico. It was dark, and getting colder when I went out to my truck to get my coffee mug. As I turned to return to the trailer where we were staying at night during our elk hunt, I glanced towards where we had Dad's elk hanging in a tree nearby. As I did, a light in the sky caught my eye. As I looked directly at it, I thought it to be nothing more than a clearing in the coulds, where a star was ""shining"" through. I thought that this was strange, due to the steady snowfall, but no ""big deal"". As I started to turn away, a movement in this ""star"" made me look again. I was amazed to see this ""star"" begin to move erratically at a rapid pace, looking very much like someone moving a laser pen light around on a darkened wall, except it was not red, it was white, much like a star. This light was due East towards Springerville, Arizona, USA, and at an approximate 40 degree rise from the surface of the earth. The thought immediately occured to me that I must be ""wobbling"" and I quickly leaned against the truck to stabilize my body and head and noted that there was another ""star"" just to the left of the one that was moving erratically, only this ""star"" was completely immobile. As soon as I realized that this observation was totally out of the ordinary, I yelled quite loudly ""Dad, get out here, there is a UFO out here!"" He came out immediately, and looked at it as I pointed at it. It was stationary from that point on, and slowly faded away as if the clouds obscured it. The other ""star"" remained visable, and we watched for a few minutes as it too faded from view, which I attribute to the clouds and snow. In our observation, I was the only one to! see the quick and erratic motion of this light/star like object in the sky.

I can tell you myself I am a skeptic but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to report this. As I watched the object for about 10 minutes it never moved from that spot but continually every minute or so would dime very slowly to almost nothing and then begin to brighten to the exact size once again. I admit to you that I got scared so I decided to stop watching what I was seeing  out of disbelief of the situation. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I have a 1 minute video footage of part of this event, that occurred on a clear evening in the South East London area. I am very willing to send you the footage....I have put this on youtube, here is the link- http://youtube.com/watch?v=Fi6zqCIsam0  REPORT. Time 7.10pm Date: december 15th, 2007 Location SE22, London Witnesses 6 Duration of sighting: 7-9 minutes Conditions: Extremely clear night  We were at work. I am the head chef and the other key witness is a kitchen assistant.At 7pm, he went outside to smoke a cigarrette.I was inside the kitchen and I was very busy. I could hear a helicopter at an uncomfortably low altitude (sounded like it was going to land outside!!)My colleague came into the kitchen shouting ""OVNI!OVNI!"" (Which apparently means 'UFO' in Latin.)  I went outside and saw a black military helicopter (possibly a Chinook) flying very low and erratically over the neighbouring houses.  On closer inspection,it appeared to be chasing several small darting lights in the sky. We watched for 5-10 minutes as the helicopter investigated. There was also a ""static"" ufo that was there for about 5 minutes (you can see this in the video, it is the white orb to the right of the street light...this later just vanished, sort of de-materialized. During the sighting, 2 other smaller white orbs appeared to ""dock"" with the stationary UFO.  There were also several other smaller lights darting around it. One was flashing at orange and bright blue colour in 3 second intervals. The other smaller objects (there may have been a total of 20 during the 5-10 minute sighting, kept appearing and disappearing!! Weird. This video was taken using a Samsung mobile phone- This video does not do justice to what we saw. The bright light in the middle is obviously a street light. You can't see the helicopter on here because it had no lights on at all! But you can clearly hear it. The one to the right is the stationary white orb.  The interseting thing is , that there were a spate of sightings in the same area in the same week (the sighting you have on your site in Brixton (Dec 12th) is approx 2 miles away from where I was)  What we saw was amazing.The video footage doesn't really do justice to what we witnessed. There is absolutely no way that these were baloons, military craft,civilian craft, anomolous lights etc...why was a military helicopter chasing them? And why did the military helicopter have no lights on? I find this very surprising as in this area of SE London, we are on several flight paths for 3 major airports.It seems that the helicopter may have been scrambled to investigate the lights.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,,

What captured  her attention was the fact that  the flying machine was following an  unconventional flight route that deviated from the normal east/west ATC regulated  traffic patterns class D airspace  routing support for both DIA and our Buckley AFB  flight patterns. She observed white lights illuminate near the outer section of both delta wing tip leading edges and possessed no power-plant thrust production smoke or vapors trailing it as it few at a low altitude. She does not remember the exact day but it was seen early last week around the 2ed of October. One final note in relation to this strange sighting its interesting to note that the sighting was made just before the North Korea nuclear boom test firing event schedule which place America’s spying activities on full alert. My sister know her airplane and I believe what she saw was something new. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Knowing it was dark out I stepped out on the starboard side deck just to see what I could (often seeing lights of other ships in the distance in these conditions.)  I presume the sky was hazy or partly cloudy as I could see only a few brighter stars.  The moon was not visible from my vantage point (I do not know its phase or position on the date.)  The horizon was very faintly visible as a just marginally brighter line above the sea.  There were no visible lights on the horizon.  I don’t know the heading of the ship but according to the passenger update log it would probably be somewhere between 110 Degrees and 70 Degrees.  The ship had sailed toward the southeast and then turned towards the north.  The sighting occurred at about the point where the turn was (to be) made.  No land lights were visible.  Three stars/lights did slightly stand out as they formed a triangle with two of the lights in a roughly horizontal line with the third lower and to the right.  The separation of the top two lights was roughly 1 degree.  The third light was roughly 2 degrees to the lower right.  I am estimating these distances by mental reference to the size of a full moon – one half subtended degree.  The center of this triangle was about 10-15 degrees above the horizon and about 45 degrees to the rear of the direction of travel of the ship.  As I looked at these three lights for about 10 seconds, I perceived that the upper left and lower right lights were faintly orange in color while the upper right one was white.  The white one was a clear point, as would be expected when viewing a star, and as other stars visible at the time appeared.  The two orange lights appeared slightly fuzzy.  Focusing my attention to these orange lights I noticed that they actually appeared brighter in the center with areas to the sides that appeared to “flutter” and very rapidly change intensity from dim to almost as bright as the center.  This total width of light was no more than one quarter degree.  This same “fluttering” effect was not visible above or below the center of the light.  My first notion was that they appeared to be helicopters, in that you can see a center mass and perceive the rotor as a “fluttering” change in intensity to the sides.  This is a description of the appearance only; there was no sound and there were no navigation or marker lights, and helicopters probably wouldn’t be glowing orange.  After seeing the three lights in position for no more than 10 seconds total, the two orange lights began moving to the left, relative to the white point star which did not move.  The few other white point stars visible did not move either (the ship was not turning.)  Over a total period of around 30 seconds that these orange lights moved, the top one moved roughly horizontally to a position roughly 45 degrees to the front of the ship.  During that movement it did dip slightly in apparent altitude when it was about 90 degrees off the side of the ship.  The other light also moved at the same time as the first but its movement was independent of the first.  It first moved slightly down and to the left, then rose slightly and then continued horizontally to the left.  When it was almost 90 degrees to the side of the ship it dipped slightly and then rose to the same height as the first light.  It “followed” the first light for a second of two and then dropped slightly, all the while moving to the left.  When these lights both reached the position approximately 45 degrees to the front of the ship they both faded out and I lost further sight of them.  To reiterate, I could not tell the exact atmospheric conditions during this sighting but there were maybe 25 visible stars in my field of vision.  These were white sharp points of light that did not move relative to the ship or to each other during the time I saw the orange lights, which did move both relative to the visible stars and to each other.  Although they did move together and at the same time, the movement of the orange lights varied in speed and in altitude relative to each other, the other visible stars and to the horizon.  They were stationary for about 10 seconds and moved for about 30 seconds before disappearing.  The lower of the two lights moved a greater distance than the top one and therefore moved faster as they both started moving at the same time and disappeared from view at the same time with about the same distance separation.  Age: 67, no health problems Vision acuity: 20/20 corrected with glasses, no colorblindness or astigmatism Physical condition at time of sighting: tired but relaxed Mental condition at time of sighting: no conflicts; finished one drink ½ hour prior.

The object was almost stationary.  I watched it for a total of 45 minutes and in that time it moved extremely slowly from SW to NE and descended at an angle.  The object passed behind a tree and as it was emerging from behind the tree the lights went out and I did not see it again.

The object moved in an almost identical flight path as the night before but this time the lights did not go out and after an hour it disappeared below the tree line on the horizon.  The light never changed in intensity or position the whole time they were visible.  They did appear to be coming toward to some degree.  There was never any sound or apparent turns.  It moved in a straight line path from high left at sighting down at about a 30-45 degree angle until it went below the horizon at lower right.

I was driving home across the back road between Rotorua and Tauranga, up over the mainly bush clad hills near the summit. This thing dropped down (rapidly) from above (my left-hand side, approx 20 degrees to west of north) and stopped completely still about 1km up (judging from the angle with the ground, I'm still not entirely sure about its distance away from me) . It sat there stopped for about 30 seconds ( it was not getting any closer or moving directly towards or away from me, it just sat there with constant size) then started to move very slowly towards the east (my right hand side) it moved far too slowly to be any aircraft. I stopped the car and turned the lights/radio and everything off, I just did not want to get any closer to it. It was directly in front of me. I thought of reversing but didn't want to make a sound or any movement to attract attention. It blotted out the stars behind it as it moved (approx 10-20 degrees of my field of vision). It moved in a snake trail path for about a minute and appeared to alter altitude slightly upwards then back down again. It had external red and blue lights and it turned away (swiveled/rotated anticlockwise) to face away from me before moving away.  I am still not sure of its shape as it had red and blue lights/glowing on the bottom and some light around the edge/upper section, the lights on the bottom trailing edge partially disappeared as the upper ones appeared, but the top part blotted out the stars behind as though it had a very large and tall bulge on top, so I am assuming it had a far greater profile width wise than height (ratio wise) as it turned/leaned/sloped slightly in the movement  . When it finally left it flew off very rapidly towards the northeast/north-north east, and appeared to drop down closer to the ground in a hurry.  It made absolutely no sound at all at any time.  There were no clouds, the air was still and cold, town is 30-35 km away, down hill and more to the right of this thing so its not a reflection on warm/cold air as the angles are all wrong. And reflections don't blot out the stars behind, and then swivel to hide lights underneath and display others up top, while blotting out stars with body structure.  I have observed many 747's taking off/landing from Auckland airport , and coming in for landing over the suburbs when I go up there to see my sister, I have seen them by both day and night and this thing was definitely MUCH bigger than a 747.  When it left I got the heck out of there. On the way further down the road approx 4-5 minutes later an airplane ( turbo prop, passenger carrier, size approx 20-30, seater,  all lights on and blinking away flew overhead, approx 2 km away and  on my right hand side. Going in to land at Tauranga airport) The plane is tiny even as close as it is, compared to the thing   I have just gotten home and think it is actually appropriate for me to now send this to you folk... normally I would never say anything about something like this as I am a complete skeptic, this thing has rattled me. I will supply a contact through a third party that I know I can trust and whom through I can be reached but I wish to remain anonymous.

At about 9:30 PM today, my mother, brother, and myself went outside to admire Venus, which is quite brilliant tonight. We then saw something far more remarkable toward the south, about midway up in the sky from the horizon. It was much smaller and not at all as bright, but it was distinctly flashing. At first, we took it to be a plane, but we quickly realized that it was completely stationary. What on Earth could do that? 	We looked at it through binoculars, and still could not figure it out. The lights were flashing very rapidly, with a blue one on one side and a red one on the other that alternated. Both were backed by a white light that did not seem to flash. Since it was so far away, we could not make out any real shape to it, though it seemed to me to be a bit narrow, like a grain of rice. 	I attempted to photograph it, but my camera is not good enough to pick up stars at all, let alone odd flashing things. At 10:20 PM, it was still out there in the exact same place. At 11:00, we checked again, and saw that it had moved far above and west of its previous position. Its lights were now flashing on a diagonal instead of being horizontally oriented toward the ground. The surrounding stars had not moved as much. It was hard to tell, but it seemed to be moving very gradually continuing in the same direction in which it had moved before. It is probably still out there. 	It is highly uncharacteristic for any of us to go staring at the sky here (light pollution makes stargazing unfeasible), and we only did so because Venus was so irresistably bright. My brother in particular is a very pragmatic person and normally scoffs at anything fantastical, yet he stood out there watching this object longest of all. This is absolutely the first time any of us has ever seen anything inexplicable in the night sky, and we are not particularly interested in UFOs. I have never even heard the others mention them.

Me and a friend were outside star gazing for astronomy class and observed a long, shiny grey cylindrical object flying at approximately 900-1000 MPH. My friend is in the Air Force and estimated this speed based on his flight background. The object swooped down over us and seemed to almost touch the ground and then was gone in an instant. The object has 3 green/yellow lights up front and one red light in the back. It made no sound, they probably were in some kind of stealth mode. It was quick but we both saw it and couldn't believe our eyes. ((NUFORC Note:  Report from student.  PD))",2007-06-12T00:00:00,35.2046,-88.1499

There were 20 plus blinkers, all seeming far away, except for one that hung very low in the sky and did not blink, but when a picture was taken with a digital camera, it seemed to be moving in an erratic pattern.  To the naked eye, it just looked like a huge white star, just above the treeline.  It's brightness made it suspect, so that is when we got out the camera. The blinkers flashed blue and white and there were some that flashed with a bit of red.  We noticed several other aircraft (small planes and helicopters) constantly intercepting their path.  The blinkers did not move when confronted.  The blinkers did move somewhat, but almost like they were in their own little orbit.  Several zoomed in pictures of the blinkers appeared to be a circular craft with 6 lights and one in the center. Each consecutive picture of one blinker showed a different light on the craft lit up, as if rotating lights.  I am interested to see what happens next, over the past month, there have been more and more blinkers present, and last night was really unbelievable. ((NUFORC Note:  Stars??

I had only driven a few hundred yards when I noticed a very bright white light off in the horizon, north east of my car.  At first I didn't think anything of it, assuming it was  some kind of airplane tower or something of that sort. After a few moments I started to notice that whatever this thing was had not one bright light but three lights and was starting to move in my direction. It took a second for me to realize that it wasn't anything I had ever seen before! The only thing that I could think of was to get some kind of footage of this object. I pulled my car to the shoulder of the road and as I did so I noticed two other cars  on the opposite side of the highway do the same thing. One of the persons got out of their car while the other remained inside theirs.  I sat in complete astonishment that this was actually happening as the object glided toward the ground at my car. It traveled the distance from the horizon to above my car so fast I didn't even have time to blink! I watched as this now quite visible equilateral triangle (with a semi-circle cut out in the back) flew a matter of 10 to 15 feet above my car.  The object must have been about twice as long and twice as wide as my car and emitted no sound but had three lights on the bottom,  one in each corner of the triangle. The lights seemed to be streaming down like strobe lights until it banked onto its side. When it did this, I got a clear view of the bottom and noticed that the lights were about the size of a dinner plate. That's when I got out of my car and grabbed my cell phone to try to shoot some footage of it.  Just as I found the video recorder on my phone and started recording, the object moved  over the trees and shot out of view in a south western direction. By  the time I gave up filming and looked around, one of the cars had already gone and the other was in the process of leaving. I have never experienced something like this in person before it was for a lack of a better term... bewildering!! I just wish I could have captured an image of it in time or been able to talk to the other witnesses.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,41.8146,-86.0126

Then the object came toward us, closer, becoming larger the closer it got. When it seemed to be over LA Ave, it suddenly turned West and picked up speed. It did not pulse, it did not change color but it did become what looked like two round lights.
