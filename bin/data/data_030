At arm's lenth, it was approximately the size of a nickle or just a little larger. The object had no lights but appeared to be reflecting the burnt orange light from the sodium vapor lamps. From the brief sighting it seemed that it was not a solid craft like a plane, but rather a frame because the light reflected off of points that closely resembled a cross pattern, like a jet, but no sold body. I would guess that it traveled at the same altitude a cessna would but it moved much, much faster. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

Better late than never.  I remember this incident well because it was the evening of our 21st wedding anniversary.  My wife and I arrived home after dinner and we were walking around inside our house checking on our two children when we heard a rumbling noise in the sky near our house.  We live in one of the highest locations in the city and the evening was quiet.  The rumbling - similar to a jet engine - would last for about 10 seconds or so and then abruptly stop.  The noise got progressively louder so that it got my attention, and I walked outside but could see nothing.  The area around the house is wooded and our view of the sky to the north and east is obscured.  By the time I walked outside, the noise was continuing at regular intervals but was fading into the distance.  The ""jet"" noise sounded similar to the blast of the propane engines that are used to heat hot air balloons.  The city does have a hot air balloon festival that takes place in late August.  However, no balloonist in his right mind would fly at night, and there were many sightings of something strange, to go along with the many people who, like us, heard but did not see anything.  There was a story in the local newspaper the next day but we've heard or seen nothing unusual since that night.

I always thought aliens, Loch Ness monster, and all that crap was just a bunch of lies used for us to explain the unexplainable. Well, my thoughts changed a little more than a year ago. I was in my father's home in Baltimore, about 11 o'clock at night. I was looking out the window as I always do at the street life, waiting for Saturday Night Live to come on at 11:30. I was the only one home at the time. As I was looking around, I saw a helicopter take off, very silent. It seemed much more silent than a normal helicopter...but, oh well. Anyway, as I tracked its movement I saw out in the dark of night two lights slowly making their way across the sky. I thought it was other helicopters, or planes, or anything like that. But then, the lights vanished. I looked again, and they were gone. The helicopter I saw before was making its way towards the area where the lights were, and it had turned it's search light on. Then, about...say...300 feet from where they appeared, the two lights came on again, but there was this haze around them, and they were heading away from the helicopter. But, they were going straight up in the sky. Then they went down, left, and finally went out again. I thought it was just some sort of light on the ground making this, but the helicopter was now flying as fast as it could towards the lights. I saw another helicopter off in the distance heading towards the lights, it was coming from the opposite direction of the first one. It also had its lights on. The two hazy lights returned quickly right near the second helicopter, then went away. Finally, I didn't see anything for a few minutes, but then as the helicopters were about to meet, two hazy lights that seemed to come from the ground shot up into the sky, and vanished. They looked like the two lights I had been watching.  I went to the police station the next day to ask what the helicopters were going after, but they said that no helicopters took off last night. I believe firmly to this day that what I witnessed was something, and something that someone didn't want to tell me about.  I also did receive about 5 calls within the next week, and when I picked up, the person on the other line hung up. On about the third call I heard someone talking to someone else when I picked up, but when I said ""Hello?"", they hung up again.  Feel free to contact me through my email address.

One was directly above the other and then they started weaving in and out of each others path.  I knew then this was no shooting star as I knew this was no aircraft.  There was no noise coming from the lights and they were too fast and could manouver unlike anything I have ever seen before.  The lights were slightly yellow in colour and would have been about 5km away at less than 1km off the ground.  I heard a caller on the radio a few days later describe seeing the exact same lights around the same time fly over in a town about 200km away heading in my direction.  A friend of mine has told me he has seen the same lights a number of times over our region.  He also told me that one time he and some friends were travelling from a nearby city at about 5:30am and stopped in a remote area when one of the passengers saw a light moving in the sky.  They all got out of the car and saw hundreds of lights, like stars, in the night sky moving like they were alive.

No trail Location: Dun sur Meuse, app. 20 miles north of Verdun, France. Just before midnight (8th-9th aug.)I saw two objects, looking like regular stars or satelites, moving rapidly towards the southwest. They came in from the northeast and moved in a straight line, at an angle of about 40 degrees upward. They appeared to be regular stars or satelites: small white lights that would never have caught my eyes had they not been moving at such a strange speed. There where moving much too fast for satelites (besides, I've never heard of satelites traveling in unison) and way too slow for meteorites, which I've seen many times. I most certainly saw no trail of bright glowing material behind these two travelers. They where also moving way too fast for a couple of airplaines in the night. I saw no red of green navigationlights on portside or starboard, nore any blinking lights. Had it been two plaines (fighterjets in formation?) then I would have heard the noise, considering the speed and therefore low altitude. I have seen thousands of airplaines in the night, so I know what they look and sound like. Airplaines at cruising speed move about five times slower then the two objects I saw. Otherwise they must have been about 1500 feet up in the air. What a roar that would haven given! It's almost impossible to estimate the distance between these two 'stars' since I don't know their actual size and altitude. If I where to draw out the night sky on a big piece of paper and hold it at an arms lenght in front of my eyes, I would pinpoint these two 'stars' about an inch apart. Another thing puzzles me too. The first few seconds I noticed that one 'star' was a little behind the other. During the entire passage (about seven seconds) they never changed places. Normaly they should moved right next to each other, because of the change of perspective. Like two racing cars that come in from the left, one a little behind the other, but seemingly driving neck-to-neck when getting out of sight on the right. However, this is only the case with two moving objects at fairly close range. Big objects very far away - like real stars - would not look differently to an observer on eaerth if there where to be on the move. At least not within seven seconds. At this particulair night I was not drunk or tired. I'm a freelance copywriter in the Netherlands. At the time I was having a vacation in France with my wife and 2,5 year old son. This is the first time I report an unidentified flying object, knowing I may look stupid to all of my friends. ((NUFORC Note:  Report was, in fact, submitted from The Netherlands.  Some satellites are reported to orbit in formation, e.g. the U. S. Navy ""NOSS"" satellites, but we agree with the witness that an object that moves across most of the sky in six-seconds almost certainly is not a man-made satellite.  PD))",2003-09-17T00:00:00,,

Asked him what the black object that was not moving was and he said he did not know.  Had no binochulars to look at it with so we continued west on I-10.  Observed for another 10 miles or so when it became to dark to see it any longer, since I was looking over my shoulder to the east.  Object seemed large, around 500-1000 feet across and up & down.  Had no shape to it, just looked like a blob.  I would estimate altitude between 5000-10000 feet.  It was probobly about 5-20 miles south of interstate.  It did go behind a mountain as was driving west but reimerged once I got past mountain, object never moved.  Object size and altitude are just guesses since there was nothing to compare it to.

It was clear directly above and nearby my neighborhood. I could see the stars very clearly, and I happened to look west out over the ocean, which is approx 15 miles to the shoreline from where I live. I noticed an unusual bright light, that was different in appearance to the other stars in the sky. From the naked eye you could see a flickering to it around the center of the light source, which was very bright. I took the dogs in, and got my spotting telescope to get a better look at it. What I could see was a center mass, round, illuminated, very bright, white light. Around the center mass which appeared to be considerable in size, there was a radiating, almost slight flickering of reddish-orange light source going all the way around the center mass. I watched it for about 5 mins., then decided to call my wife out to take a look, and maybe give her opinion of what she thought it might be. I asked her to give her honest opinion, and she said she never seen anything like it. We watched it for awhile, and had to follow it just slightly with the telescope, as it had lateral movement to it. But basically it just hovered out over the ocean, above a fog bank. Now what was interesting was a plane (possibly private) was heading in it's direction only at an angle, like it was on its own flight path, with nothing to do with this light source. It seemed to be just heading out over the ocean, and didn't appear to be heading to this object. My wife noticed the object retreat further back over the ocean as if to avoid this plane. As the plane continued on it's way, the light source came back to it's original location and 5 minutes later just dissapeared. Gone in an instant. We discussed it about a half hour later, and both of us noticed, that when this plane was heading in the objects direction, only at an angle, the object retreated in such a manner, as to not bring attention to i! tself. It was very quick, very smooth and fluid (maybe 5-10 miles)in a blink of an eye. It was so smooth, almost like it was blending in with the sky, at the same time it dimmed it's lights ever so slight, that if you were'nt paying attention, it wouldn't have even been noticed. Now I did witness this object two nights ago, however about 7 p.m in the eve. Same basic location, although a bit closer to shore. I went to my neighbors house and had him look at the object through the telescope, and asked him what he thought. He also was perplexed, and has never seen anything like it. All three of us went through all the logical explanations of what it could be, and all three of us came up with the same answer, this object was totally unique, and we could not explain what it might be. Now being a logical person, I called three news station to see if there we're any reports, and they did not receive any calls. I called Camp Pendelton Marine base which is just North of this sighting, they did not have any aircraft, or manuvers out on the ocean. I called Miramar Marine Corp airbase, located about 25 miles south and to the east of this sighting, they also had no aircraft, or manuvers going on in this area. Typically, this would'nt have me reporting this to your agency, however This object was unlike anything I have seen in my life, I also have two other witnesses that feel the same way. Now, it very well could be explained away, as an aircraft, a star, a helicopter, or balloon by those who chosing to do so. All I know is this object was capable of very, very quick movement with angular flight paths. It also was unlike any light source I have ever seen, it was incredibly bright, and the radiating reddish-orange light that surrounded the object almost appeared to be on fire. Anyway, I saw what I saw, and if it appears to be something explainable that would be fine by me. I am concerned tho' with Camp Pendelton to the north, and just north of that is San Onofre Nuclear power plant. I suppose this would be just coincid! ental, but it just seems odd. One last thing, Miramar said if something we're out there, they would've picked it up on radar, however it was out there and they didn't catch it on radar. Thank You for your time, if you have any questions, I left my cell no. on your recording. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The object seemed to have take off from a standstill hover and jet down as if propelled; not a falling or orbiting object of any kind.  I should also point out that we later saw a low flying plane and saw regular commercial planes for comparison later which solidified my belief ( or disbelief!) that what I saw was neither a plane nor a helicpoter. After seeing the bright red light, I looked into the sky and saw an alarming number of oddly placed lights in the sky. It was early dusk and there were not stars out yet. Also, I am familiar with the area in which this occured and have never seen these lights. Other people in this area have been seeing things lately and everyone here is talking about low flying planes.

I also telephoned the witness to find out a little more about the sighting. I had a nice conversation with him, and he went on to explain exactly what he saw. On December 5, 2003 (in the video clip the witness tells that the sighting took place on December 6, 2003. The sighting actually took place on December 5, 2003, a simple mix mistake) he saw a pair of unknown objects at 5:43 p.m. while out Barbecuing. When he noticed the two objects, his first thought was a couple of satellites were flying side by side. But he starting thinking this was really strange looking because one of the objects would quickly move past the other, then the object which then followed behind, would make the same moment and fly up a head of the other. The witness said it looked as if they were racing across the sky as each one tried to pass the other. He mentioned that the speed of these two unknowns was incredible as both moved so very quickly. The two objects eventually went into a cloud bank and disappeared. They were a very bright orange in color. An example he gave for the color and size of the two objects were that of the brightness and size of the planet Mars when it was at it's closet to earth.  The fellows son, at a different location from where his Dad was saw a single unknown object traveling south at a low rate of speed,  it quickly sped up and was gone. The reported time for the son's sighting was between 5:50 - 5:55 p.m.  Thank you to the Dad and son for their reports.

This encounter was one of two that I have had in my liftime, I am not a UFO watcher but have been convinced of something unusual happening around us. On the night of my sighting I was helping out with farm chores for a neighboring dairy farmer, this is a remote farming community where we frequently pitch in to help a neighbor. The farm owner and I had finished bringing the cattle into the barn to feed them prior to milking, as was customary we went to the house for a coffee and somthing to eat before we began milking. We went to a sitting room which has a bay window that looks out over a 30 acre hay field, beyond the field is a large tract of timberland encompassing several hundred acres, this timberland is uninhabited and has no roads. We had been sitting in the room just chatting when my friend asked if I could see the lights approaching over the tree tops, I had not but caught site of them immediatly. We mused that they must be a helicopter. The VT and NY National Guard would often run training missions in our area out of Burlington VT or Plattsburgh NY so that is what we assumed this was. We continued to watch the lights approach from over the timberland and as they came closer we could see that the light were very different from an approaching helicopter. The elivation was no more than 1500' which initially led us to beleive we were seeing a chopper, with the lights just a few hundred feet away and moving slowly but steadily toward the hay field we went outside to get a better look. As we walked out the front door the first thing we noticed was that there was a loud hum and definite electrical poping coming from the electric line on the poles that ran along the roadway, I need to comment that this noise was alarmingly loud and was definitely coming from the utility lines, had I not been able to see the lines I would had guessed the insulators were arcing and bursting, but as we walked under the lines toward the hay field and the approaching lights we observed that the lines were mot! ionless and there was no arcing. We ended up standing side by side about 50 to 75' into the field. The lights were at this time just above the tree tops and I would estimate 800' feet to the South West. We could now hear what I would say was a droaning hum coming from the object, the noise would vary in pitch from low to high but in low tones. As the object approached the edge of the field it turned slightly to the right on a North Easterly course, we thought it would pass us on that course but as we stood there it entered the area of the field and then when it was 300 or 400' feet away it turned again and came toward us. I did not mention that this was a clear night with stars visible, and that as this object got closer we were aware that it blocked out the sky in a large area, we guessed the the object was 200' wide by 500' or 600' feet in length. This may sound odd but we had the impressionm that the object turned to observe us. It approached us to within 100' and remained at what we agreed was about 1500 feet in elivation. What happened next was what convinsed us that this was a very unusual event, the object began to power down and became completly stationary, the engine noise was also completely gone. It did not move in any dirction whatsoever, however the lights remained on. We were both scared to the point of wanting to run but curiosity kept us in the field. The only noise was the crackling of the utility lines now behind us and out next to the road. The object was lighted. We were now looking nearly straight up at the object and as I recall we could see several lights on what to us was the front of the object, the lights were yellow, green, white, orange and blue. We could see the front and along the bottom of both sides of the object the light were arranged at intervals of several feet apart along what we observed as the edges of the object. We just stood and stared at this thing for 5 to 8 minutes, I remember us being really astonished by the fact that this thing was completly motionless and ! made absolutliy not audible noise. When it was ready to go it powered up and began to move on the same course that it had been on when we first observed it, no cars passed in the time that we were watching it. We had a clear view to the Northeast into Canada from where we stood and the object was headed slowly in that direction. My friend asked if we should call someone, I suggested that we call the Plattsburgh, NY Airforce Base and make a report. He went back to the house to make the call while I stayed outside to watch it move away. The utility lines continued to crackle and pop even when the object had moved to 8 or 10 miles away (the electricity and phone was not effected) I went back to the house after 10 minutes and found my friend on the phone, he said that he was speaking to a Lt Colonel from Plattburgh air base. He was on the phone for at least 30 minutes making a detailed report of the event, this colonel took the report seriously and was very patient asking many questions. I was asked to go out and look for the object 3 or 4 times as they were speaking. I did observe two jet aircraft fly over the farm but they were heading Easterly about 90 degrees to the object, the object was at least 30 miles to the north by this time but should have been visible to the pilots or picked up on radar. The base did disclose that the planes we observed were from the base and that they reported no unusual activity. When the phone call ended I asked my friend if he thought he had been taken seriously or just led on, he said that the colonel was sincerly interested in what was said and appeared to be writing word for word the conversation. It would be an understatement to say that this was a very unsettling experience. This fellow and I have never spoken to any one but our wives in regard to what we saw. I now live just 4 miles from the farm where this happened. I stopped to visit with this man last year, we had not spoken to each other of the event in 20 years! As we talked the conversation went back to that nigh! t, he admitted that this has had a lasting effect that to this day haunts him, he said that several times over the years he has heard the same noise at night we heard from the craft but does not go out to look. I was made curious by what happened and have used my curiosity as motivation to read all that I can on the subject. At the time of this occurance I was employed as a State Deputy Fish and Wildlife Officer, my friend was and is to this day a dairy farmer on this same farm. I know it likely seems odd to not report this for 21 years, but to be honest I felt that it was not going to be taken seriously and my friend will not to this day speak to anyone in regard to what happened. He does accept that I have chosen to make the report and may be willing at some point to weigh in with his account. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-09-09T00:00:00,44.7449,-72.1616

In a very desolate area above the tree tops was a Triangular shaped object that blocked out the stars but had 3 lights at each apices with a very intense red light approximately in the center of the craft.  I slowed down to approximately 5 mph to observe this craft, then pulled over to observe.  I noticed on the next hill ahead of me someone else was looking at it as well.  I rolled down my window and listened over the din of the idle of my truck as the craft slowly at a turtles pace glided in an approximately westerly direction.  There was a very low pitched hum which appeared to erratically cycle and coincided occasionally with the pulsing of the lights.  I turned on my radio to KVRE 92.9 FM, the Hot Springs Village Radio Station and there appeared to be no interference.  I then switched over to an AM station and got static and a weird cycling signal in the background.  I found another AM station and again the same wird signal was heard.

Last night while I was waiting for my girlfriend to get home from work I became bored with computer work so I went outside to look at the success of my attempt at burning leaves. I live out in the country and the only light was from my porch light and a large streetlight that’s on the side of the house. After attempting to see if anything was burned and realizing it was too dark I took a deep break and looked up to see if I could see any stars. (Before I was heavily into computers I was very interested in astronomy so sometimes I just look to see what is out there). It was quite cloudy so I really couldn’t see any so I turned opposite of the house to look see if I could see any peaking between clouds. When I turned I noticed an object that looked green with a glow. As a very skeptical person at first I thought to my self that it was some airplane. Then I realized after further observation that it was not an aircraft and it was like something I remember seeing when I was about 10 years old at my grandparents’ house in Ozark, Alabama. I watched it closely and tried not to blink. After what seemed to be a very long time because I was so full of excitement, but was realistically around 3 to 5 minutes the craft flashed an orange-red color and then disappeared.  What I think is the most odd part and a part that actually gets me nervous for some reason, is the fact that I didn’t mention it to my girlfriend when she came home, nor did I even think about it the rest of the night. It wasn’t until this morning when I went to survey the progress my fire had made in the daylight I then remember what had happened. I ran inside and realized my girlfriend had already left for work and I had no one to tell. I then got on the Internet and searched for any information I could find about other sightings in my area and found a few, but none were like what I saw. I eventually found the National UFO Reporting Center’s website and reported my sighting.  As a person who was previously into astronomy and who used to wonder about life on other planets, but thought they were too far away to visit here and figured that most cases were hoaxes, I am now a true believer.",2003-10-31T00:00:00,38.6019,-89.9138

Of course i wasn't, but the physical feeling of a struggle to raise up off the couch was definitely present. As i could only sit  i couldnt stand still have no clue as to why. i noticed the woods behind my house was completely illuminated as if there were flood lights on or a landing light on a helicopter as if it was searching. I know for a fact it wasn't any rotory aircraft.  I also recall as if i was very cold  and started to develop goosebumps in a big way.  Eventually i was able to force myself to stand up.  Only took me about 5 or 6 minutes to push myself up  and walk over to the double french doors which lead to our sun patio.  as i stood by the window the light  faded with a slight flicker then was gone.  Now im not quite sure how much time has past since this first incident to the 2nd but, it wasnt too long after.  I had made myself  go to sleep in my beedroom. I was awaken by the same erie noise as before except this time its directly out front and above my room windows.  I have 3 windows in my room  2 large windows in the front and one smaller window on the side over top of my garage.  Whatever this light was, shining thru my windows as if to see  or whatever.  I just knew somehow  or for somereason this wasnt right.  I knew enough to stay outa the lights.  i do remember a chilly, cold like heat coming from outside, kinda like a vapor rub type wind. i know it sounds strange but thats the best way to explain it. almost menthol like. i wasnt able to yell  but i was able to move and walk better this time.  So being the wimp that i am  i hid in my closet like a freak and never told anyone about it til now. I woke up in the morning in my closet to a beautiful day.

At about 4 am we were awakened because we had lost electricity and it was very hot inside the hotel room. We opened the balcony door and sat there a while.  Soon my daughter noticed that the valley overlooking the balcony was lit up by a pale white light. It was like a dull white floroscent glow. Soon it faded out and we were confused.  Then we noticed that a 'star' was moving overhead. It was fast but not as fast as a shootng star. At first we thought it was an aircraft but then realized that aircrafts have blinking/strobe lights. This was a star moving at high speed.  Then we noticed another big star moving left to right slowly. Again this was hard to believe but then we noticed that as compared to other starts in that area this was the only one moving. Soon this bright star lost its light and faded away.  After a lot of thought, discussion and debates I am convinced that this was a sighting of two UFOs.

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS  The light was various, like a diamond, although random, in patterns. The way this thing changed colors is like a horizontal hold on a TV, and when the horizontal line passed down horizontally, it would change colors. This vehicle, from arms length, looked like a dull pencil tip. At the time I saw this event, I noticed a deer, in my side yard, go into a full sprint AFTER I saw the intense white light. After this, I tried to forget about what had happend, but I could not forget, so I closed my eyes. The instant I closed my eyes, my right sholder blade muscle starting twiching rapidly. I thought the rapid twiching would just go away, but it did not. This went on for approximately 10 seconds. I became worried for some reason, so I widely opened my eyes, and the instant I did, the rapid twiching just stopped, as quickly as it had started; it just stopped!  FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS  At the time I saw the first sight of the vehicle, I was laying on my bed, facing the west, looking up diagnally, when my eyes locked on to this vehicle I noticed the first change in colors and at the same time it was hovering. The sky was clear, windy, and at night 4:30 AM. I noticed this vehicle decending in an S like pattern; continuing to decend in the S-like patteren until it just disappeared over the canyon's horizen.  Let me explain this intense white light. This additional event took place at 5:45 AM after i saw the vehicle do its thing in the sky. I could not sleep knowing what I had just experienced. I mean you try and go to sleep after you see this outragious thing in the sky, but sleep was not possible at the time. So I just lay there hoping to be abducted, just so I would know what it would be like. Just for the experience, and then this is what happend. Lying there in hope I would see more then just this unidentifiable flying object in the sky,  with my eyes half-open, because I was a little sleepy given the time. This ultra-white, intense bright light, covered my side yard and totaly brightened the yard.

I cant be the only person to have seen it My email  tardo03@hotmail.com  I was walking out to my truck to head to work. I work the night shift and its located very close to my home so that allows me to leave about 5-10 min. before 11pm to make it there on time. Just as a habit I looked up to the night sky to gaze at the stars. Off in the distance toward the west and moving east/north east I spoted what I thought was a very low flying plane. As I continued to watch the object some things began to occur to me. On the out skirts of my home town there is a TXU Nuclear Power Plant about 5 miles out. We dont often see low flying anything because of it. As the object came closer I noticed 3 very dim lights on it. On the left was a green light and on the right was a red light. In the middle, slightly higher was another red light but it was noticably smaller than the two on either side of it. I know that all planes have lights that display these colors but these lights weren't blinking that were on constantly and did not flash once. I was still thinking that this might be a plane but there was no sound and with how low it was flying anything moving or flying through the air would have some sort of engine nosie but this thing was perfectly silent and steadly moving ahead.  Not until the object passed over head did I see the true shape of it and it was a perfect triangle and looked mostly black or a dark grey. I jumped in my truck and tried to follow the flying triangle but lost sight of it behind nearby houses and trees as I made my way to the road. By the time I reached the road it was hardly visable and disappered into the night sky. I estimate the size to be about that of a private jet or small comerical carrier and the speed at about 50 mph and the height that it was flying between 120-130 feet. I don't know or assume the object had anything to do with the nuclear power plant but I think they may have some sort of radar that could have possibly detected the object. Please email me back if you or anyone else might have any info on this event or let me know if there were any other re! ported sightings in the area.

Upon pulling into the parking lot of the Peppermill casino in Wendover, Nevada I happened to be looking out the window of my truck, drivers side.  Hovering directly above the Wendover airport was a gorgeous gold light.  I could not tell the shape due to the brightness.  It reminded me of a golden firework...I said to my girlfriend in the passenger seat, ""Look at that""!!, but by the time she looked it had disappeared.  The light seemed to vanish from the bottom to the top.  The Wendover airport is tiny, so I don't know if anyone there saw it.  After leaving Wendover the following evening (December 17) lo and behold, at the 33 Milepost marker, 33 miles east of Wendover, at 1833 hours, I was talking to my girlfriend about how beautiful the gold light had been the night before.  At that exact second, she screamed, ""Look!!  Look""!!  And, out of the passenger window, just south of I-80, were three beautiful gold lights!!  I mean, what are the chances of that happening?  They appeared to be quite low in the sky, and they seemed to be in formation, with the closest one being the lowest (maybe 500 feet high?) and the next farthest one a little higher, and the farthest a little higher still.  They were the exact same color of lights that the one over the Wendover airport was.  Bright gold, with a little orange tint.  Then, while we were viewing those, they went out one by one.  In both cases, none of the lights were moving, they were stationary.  They were a gorgeous sight, especially the one over the airport, which was the closest to us I think.  The Wendover airport is located directly on the Utah/Nevada state line, although it just barely be in Utah.  I have a graduate degree in management.

Out of the southwest we became aware of a large orange light a small an hour or so above the horizon.  Our first thought was why was Mars so big and so orange.  Then the light faded slightly as a second light appeared on the left of the first, then in the same manner four additional lights appeared each fading to black after the first, then it was gone.  We notice 2 or 3 airplane lights in the same region.  We continued driving and approximately 6 minutes went by and we say one orange light again.  Again we observed what appeared to be aircraft lights.  As we approached our home, once again we saw the orange light - only 2 actually because we were then engulfed in trees.  Then one mile further, which was the driveway to our home, we saw the light entirely surrouded by a large amount of blinking lights which one would assume were planes.  But they came on suddenly at the same time and were twinkling lights, not like your usual planes.  There were at least 20 at the same time and I think many more because of the twinkling effect.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Triangle carft observed by TXU Nuclear Power Plant.,Glen Rose,TX,2003-12-16T22:50:00,triangle,,"Occurred : 12/16/2003 22:50  (Entered as : 12/16/2003 22:50) Reported: 12/17/2003 9:01:19 PM 21:01 Posted: 12/19/2003 Location: Glen Rose, TX Shape: Triangle Duration:",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33890.html,"Triangle carft observed by TXU Nuclear Power Plant. I was walking out to my truck to head to work. I work the night shift and its located very close to my home so that allows me to leave about 5-10 min. before 11:00 p.m. to make it there on time. Just as a habit I looked up to the night sky to gaze at the stars. Off in the distance toward the west and moving east/north east I spotted what I thought was a very low flying plane. As I continued to watch the object some things began to occur to me. On the out skirts of my home town there is a TXU Nuclear Power Plant about 5 miles out.  We don't often see low flying anything because of it. As the object came closer I noticed 3 very dim lights on it. On the left was a green light and on the right was a red light. In the middle, slightly higher was another red light but it was noticeably smaller than the two on either side of it. I know that all planes have lights that display these colors but these lights weren't blinking that were on constantly and did not flash once. I was still thinking that this might be a plane but there was no sound and with how low it was flying anything moving or flying through the air would have some sort of engine noise but this thing was perfectly silent and steadily moving ahead.  Not until the object passed over head did I see the true shape of it and it was a perfect triangle and looked mostly black or a dark grey. I jumped in my truck and tried to follow the flying triangle but lost sight of it behind nearby houses and trees as I made my way to the road. By the time I reached the road it was hardly visible and disappeared into the night sky. I estimate the size to be about that of a private jet or small commercial carrier and the speed at about 50 mph and the height that it was flying between 120-130 feet. I don't know or assume the object had anything to do with the nuclear power plant but I think they may have some sort of radar that could have possibly detected the object.

It was above us for about 40 seconds with no sound and seemed to hover/glide on the spot. We clearly saw design characteristics.Metallic highly shiny body, no visible linkage between metallic components, about 100 feet in diameter, portholes in the middle of what appeared to be an upper level or dome and bottom the porthole were all around the craft except for the front (on direction of forward movement.) There was a window that was angled inwards about 45 degrees in the front (forward direction). The window appeared to be in the under side of the craft. We could see orange/bluish light coming from the inside but did not see any occupants. The window was about 4-5 feet in height and probably about 10-12 feet in length. The craft had small ski like devices on either side (lower) of the frontal window but they seemed to be like docking devices like the shape of an S but the top of the S facing forward. Underneath craft were rectangular (2) long shapes that covered the diameter of the craft and in the middle section of the bottom side. The rectangular shapes were part of the body but protruded in rectangular shape. No insignias, just solid metallic body. I kept saying what a beautiful craft and my wife kept saying oh my god the whole time.The craft made no noise whatsoever. It seemed to levitate but with that slight side to side movement.At the time of sighting, I was cleaning my swimming pool a round 10:00 PM. The is a residential area (Santa Clarita Valley) where 10:00 PM is like 3:00 AM. I spotted the craft coming towards the house in a southwest direction and instantly knew that was not a normal shaped craft. I ran some 12 steps to the family room and called my family but only my wife ran out. As she did, the craft was right on top of us, motionless except for the slight gliding from side to side. It stood there about 40 seconds. It faced downwards and that is when I saw the window. I also could determine that swimming pool lights were not causing reflection on top side and that in effect it was highly reflective. After that it kept moving in the same direction at 40-50 MPH and began to disappear between homes. I jumped on top of a block wall and saw it continue (between homes) for at least 4-5 miles and then I could not see it.I told my wife not to discuss it but to draw what she saw as I did. I had more details but we agreed that we saw the same things.While we were seeing it, I made sure there was no helicopter suspending this craft.We called the local sheriff's office and they said they had no reports. The craft had to cross the Interstate 5 freeway to head towards my home and at the altitude which means someone had to see it on the freeway.There was a sighting filmed in Mexico City near some high rise buildings. What we saw resembled that very much. Please keep me posted. Since the experience I have read everything there is to read on the subject. I am confident the government knows more. This object was a solid craft and definitely not powered by anything man-made. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates no date for the sighting.

They would change positions fly for a second,change positions fly for a second or 2 and change again.They would stay very close together the whole time and the formation was not perfect like geese fly.

It appeared to be flying as fast as a normal plane and was fairly high in the sky as it dissapeared over the clouds.  I thought I could hear the drone of a distant engine although my friend said it was silent. We watched it until it went out of view, it was heading out of Southampton and across the English Channel.  I am completely sane and have not seen anything like this before, nor do I believe in UFO's.  Did anyone else seen this over the UK?  Could it be some kind of special military plane?",2003-08-28T00:00:00,,

When I first observed the UFO it was directly overhead heading towards the northeast. It was a triangle shape with red lights on each point of the triangle. They were not flashing or very bright, just a constant red glow that defined the very distinct black triangle shape. The was no noise whatsoever. The speed would be compared to a shooting star. I was only able to view the object for a few seconds because of the extreme speed it cross the sky. The only thing I am not clear about is if it rotated slightly, not spinning but a slight rotation. My impression is controled flight. I do not know the size because I have no reference, but I felt I was at a very high altitude.  I am not a professional observer, however I know what a plane and helicopter look like, I have seen satelites many times. I have even seen the space shuttle when it was docking with the space station. I thought possibly it might be a military fighter but because of the speed, shape and absence of any noise leads me to believe otherwise.",2003-08-28T00:00:00,38.76717395833333,-121.3107662202381

The craft that I saw was like nothing I'd ever seen before.  It was a perfect equalateral triangle, and was very large...  the size of a commercial airplane in length.  I've grown accustomed to seeing various aircraft in my area, as I live about 2-3 miles from an airport, so most air traffic crosses over my house, but it usually comes from the East when flying low, as that is the direction the airport is from me.  This craft came from the South...  It was flying very low, just above my roof and the treetops nearby, traveling at a reasonably fast pace, but just slow enough over me to where I could stand in awe wondering what it was and memorize its every detail in passing.  Each corner of the triangle had a very bright light that was like a spotlight shining down on the ground, and each light was equal in brightness.  It wasn't completely quiet, yet it wasnt' very loud either.  The noise it made was sort of soft humming sound.  I first noticed it when I saw the bright lights coming over my roof as I was laying in the hammock in my backyard looking up to the sky towards Mars.  The lights were really bright and at first in the distance I thought it was a Police Helicopter spotlighting for a criminal or something, but it wasn't loud enough to be a helicopter so I thought it odd.  It came quickly over my roof, covering about a mile in a few seconds.  When it was over my back yard area, it slowed down quite a bit.  The 3 lights shined down into my backyard and then after it passed by it sped up again and took off so fast I couldn't see it anymore in a matter of seconds, due North.  After seeing it, I thought it must be some hi-tech jet of some sort, but after looking for about an hour online thru various pictures of jets and planes, I saw nothing close to it.  Then I did a search on U.F.O.  and found a site that had drawings of a craft that looked EXACTLY like what I saw!  Then I came to this site today and decided to report what I saw last night.  I am still amazed by what I saw... I don't know if this was something top secret, millitary, or something not of this world, but whatever the case, it was a phenomenal sight.  I have a drawing I made of the craft available if you are interested in seeing it.",2003-08-28T00:00:00,36.109455879967555,-95.93524541768045

I telephoned the witness in Quesnel, British Columbia today to take a report from the lady as she saw something which baffled her. On Friday, October 3, 2002 at 6:45 p.m. she was standing at her kitchen sink washing some dishes looking outside and admiring a beautiful blue sky. She said all of a sudden something dropped down from out of no where. She described it as being oblong in shape and traveling at an angle of approx: 30 degrees. She told me the front of it was kind of blunt, with a ""tiny"" tail behind it which went to a sharp point. She described the color as being white with a glow around it being an off white color. The sighting lasted for 8 minutes in length as she did check the clock on the wall. It traveled from the northwest heading northeast. The witness did open her window in case she might hear something from it, but no sound was heard at all. From her location, and ""guessing the approx: size, she said it would have been roughly the length of her outstretched arm. The witness did contact the local radio station to see if anyone else might have reported it, but no one had.  HBCC UFO Note: One never knows what some of the objects seen in the areas, so I telephoned CKCQ Radio Quesnel to ask if any reports had come in over unusual sightings in the area. The lady I talked with told me yes. Also the newsroom will be getting back to me tomorrow and doing a short interview as I am requesting folks throughout the listening area to make a report if they have seen anything strange over the last while.

I started to yell into the phone. I told my friend to 3-way my Mother and get her outside. While she wasn't answering the phone. I looked back up. Just in time to see the saucer take off. I ran over to my Mom's house and told her to get her butt outside. She said she was so jealous, because I always catch this kinda stuff. I told her to hang around and see what happens. About 2 mins later about 40 planes filled the sky. They all met over the Cerbat mountians and then seperated. My Mom was like whats going on? Yes we do live by an airport, but I promise you I have never seen more then 5 planes in the sky on any given night. I watch the sky every night for atleast an hour to 5. After the planes left a huge bolt of green light flew out of the sky and landed in the little mountians by my house. At this time my Dad came running out. Then all of a sudden here comes 40 planes again. Then another huge Gold glowing light was hanging over by the Kingman Airport. We looked at it in the telescope and it looked like 2 gold cat eyes. My Parents and I were both blown away! Then here comes all these planes again. Within 5 mintues all the planes were gone. The intense vibe was gone and it was like everything was returned to normal.

This light/star tracked perfectly with the background stars also and rotated out of view after about 9:00 P.M. I would agree that this could have been a weather balloon had it not tracked with the background stars and faded to a very dim star.",2003-09-24T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

The light had a slight reddish tinge and looked like a faint star or satellite.  As it slowly moved downward towards the tree line, it would would jog slightly to the left or to the right and then jog back to approximately the original downward line it was following.  These left and right shifts were irregular in terms of distance and frequency.  The greatest sideways displacement was approximately 1/8 degree.  The downward speed was not completely constant.  After a few minutes it started to fade and then completely disappeared a few degrees from the treeline.

Before I go on, let me say that for about a month before I am reporting this I have been reading older reports on this site. I always watch the X-Files and UFO documentarys. So I know how to look at odd objects in the sky. So I was watching TV and then all of a suden I heard a very odd noise. This was so odd, I got off my bed and looked out the window and saw a Traingle shaped craft with a light at each point. The lights were a whitish-yellowish color. I could also see a wierdish blue haze around this craft. I could cleary notice it has no wings. It seemed to have equal sides on each side of this triange and if anything, it looked metallic. Then it flew over my house so I left my room and went into the hallway to see out the other side of the house. Then I saw 2 triangle crafts with the 3 lights. One infront of the other. These cratfs were flying over a road called the black horse pike. This is also near a small airport called the Cross Keys airport. Theres always planes, very small ones. These were no planes and from what I could see, if I would of seen these Traingle shaped UFO's upclose they would of been VERY big. They continued flying away out of my view, and the nieghbors trees were now in my way. So then after they left I came right to my computer and reported this.

I work nights & was outdoors with my dogs for a few minutes before leaving for work & was admiring the stars when I saw something unusual as I'll describe in the following paragraphs  I looked at the clock as I let the dogs out, it was 11:46 pm EST. When I re-entered the house it was 11:50.  As I mentioned, I was standing on my back deck looking at the night sky, being generally thankful for a clear night for my newspaper route & enjoying a last cup of coffee.  I live near a naval air station, directly under the flight pattern between 2 rivers they tend to follow when getting practice air time as well as typical approaches & landings. The base is a Nato base, so I'm accustomed to seeing all types of aircraft & have worked on several military bases, including this one, while employed by a general construction contractor.  I also am accustomed to seeing civilian aircraft over my home at a high altitude (much higher since Bosnia).  What I saw last evening was entirely different from typical civilian & military aircraft. It did, however seem to be following the path of the civilian craft that go over my area. It was travelling from a South-South West direction, inland direction. Brunswick, Maine is very near the coast; I am personally about a 5 minute drive from the ocean, a couple minutes from any of 3 rivers.  The description:  I have heard on coasttocoast.com when you spoke descriptions of ferris wheel type sitings. This almost represented that, but I couldn't be sure if it was round or if it was just the rotation of light sequence that I was seeing. It may have been a different shape or even, of course, a civilian aircraft. The lights appeared to number several or many, some red, some green & some white. The white ones lit up the bottom which gave a little definition as to its shape & confused me some. With the rotation light sequence it appeared to be round, but the white lights made it appear more typical aircraft shaped. What made me feel very deeply that it wasn't a typical aircraft was the speed it travelled at. My line of vision between where I first saw it, & where I lost sight of it behind pine trees was slight. I've jsut measured it outdoors holding my hands up & I would say there was, with arms extended only about 2 feet between them.  It covered a relatively large piece of sky in a very short period, I would guess I only saw it maybe even less than 15 seconds & it was out of view. In this area, the military aircraft are generally very low & in view quite a while & civilian aircraft generally show 1 flashing red light on the bottom that I've noticed & are visible for a longer period. This was just all of a sudden & view & then gone. There was nothing unusual about the noise it made for an aircraft at that altitude. Just a general rumbling noise & I had to actually make sure it wasn't another noise in the neighborhood, but it was definitely aircraft generated.  Perhaps those that flew overhead, last weekend, I believe (that I unfortunately missed seeing, but heard of on coast to coast)were making a return trip?...  I have just scrolled down to the contact info area & have decided I will also call your hot line number. I'll be on a cell phone (with free nights & weekends) & hope this is satisfactory.

The UFO seemed to be suspended in the sky in the vicinity of the Mexican city of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, across the Rio Grande river from Laredo, Texas. The UFO was the shape of a circle and gave off a bright white glow, though not shiny or glaring. Several witnesses intitially confused it with an airplane on approach to Laredo International airport. However, the UFO´s glow suddenly intensified, with a slight light blue tinge, and it appeared to expand its diameter (this may have been the visual effect of the glow). The object then moved at an incredible rate of speed, at approximately a 45 degree angle upward and in a southwesterly direction into Mexico.

At approximately 1927hrs,  two aircraft flying in formation, coming from the northeast (possibly Kingsville Naval Air Station) and at a very high altitude followed the direction of the UFO´s flight path.

I would estimate the alititude at 1500 to 2000 feet. The sun was low in the sky. The object was reflecting sunlight from western edge, and appeared to be a silver disc shape with a brown or dark colored center. I would estimate the diameter of the object to be about 20 to 30 feet. I could not hear any sound from it. I ran in the house and got my binoculars, which took about 30 seconds. When I returned the object was gone. If it had been some sort of balloon it would have still been in sight. There was a small private airplane approaching the area where I had last seen the object. Duration of the sighting was about 2 to 3 minutes. ((BEGIN FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, I just filed a report on an object that I saw here in Portland late this afternoon. I had been watching the object for 2 or 3 minutes, and decided that it was probably not a mylar balloon or something like that. It was moving Northward towards me, and appeared to be moving against the wind. I ran to get the binocs, and it had flat vanished, which surprised me. I didn't get a feel for the size distance or altitude of the object until I had returned with the binoculars. There was a small private plane moving into the vicinity of where I had last seen the object. I don't know if the pilot had seen it or not. The plane seemed to be a bit lower than the object. Which would have meant the object was much larger than I had susupected. If the object had been something floating on the wind it could not have disappeared in the 30 seconds, or so, that it took me to get my binoculars. That is why I was surprised that it was gone from sight when I returned, back outside. I had the distinct feeling, at that point, that this had been an intelligently controlled craft, it had seen the small plane flying in it's direction, and had vacated the vicinity.  By the way, when I had finished filing the report I went in and looked at the reports from Oregon and read the ones from 11/6/03. I live about 1 1/2 miles Southwest of the control tower at PDX, and about 20 blocks South of Lombard. Not too far from where those 2 sightings happened. I watch the air traffic all the time, day and night. Today's sighting was about the 4th one I've had at this location, in a little over three years, since we have lived here.  It's good to hear your reports again on Coast to Coast AM! Keep up the the good work and the good fight! Oh, I'll try and stay off the computer for awhile, in case you want to call me.

As these ships would rotate they appeared to change shape from disk shaped to almost like that of a eagle. There was flashing lights on these objects and what appeared to be beams of light being shot down from them. Where we live being that we are near 3 major airports there is generally tons of commercial air traffic at all times of the day directly overhead, however the commercial air traffic was obviously being rerouted to accomidate these visitors. The ultimate confirmation though was that there were military planes circling the area we saw at least 4. Our friend that was over visiting was really tripping because it was his first time seeing a ufo. This was just the most recent sighting at this location for my husband and I. Prior to living at our current residence I had never seen a ufo, but our 1st night here 5/20/01 I was awakened to the reality that we are not alone. We have seen ufo's many times since that night here,it appears to be a hotbed. Really it makes perfect sense since here in the extremely populated Bay Area there is so much light distortion and air activity they could conduct whatever business they have without hardly ever being noticed by the general public.

We were all busy talking when we all got quiet cause we were all looking at the stars when shan who was driving told me ""what star is that?"" and I said ""what star?"" and he pointed it out to me and it was really bright we talked for a minute thinking it was the north star but he said it was in the wrong place and WAY to bright I shrugged and went to pick up the trash in the car when Alannah (my niece) got really excited ""its gone! Arnell look its gone!"" and sure enough me and shan looked at where it was and it was gone like nothing was ever there we were in a blank field so we could see the stars really good. I kinda got freaked and so did Shan so I told everyone to look around cause maybe it would reappear again and it did reappear on the way right of the car but this time we could see little lights on it like it was blinking Red, Blue, Orange we all got scared saying it was a plane but it stayed in the same place just blinking different colors for the next minute. Then it disappeared again but it appeared again RIGHT ahead of us (we were on a straight road) but lower to the ground about 500 feet and a mile ahead on top of a hill, by this time we were all getting scared even alannah jumped in front with us cause it was ahead of us but it kept moving forward blinking different lights and getting lower to the ground when we reached the hill it was gone. So we all looked around again and it appeared about a mile ahead of us the red and blue lights brighter than before all of us got really excited and we kept our eye on it till we got into town we then turned onto Heart Butte road and stopped to look, it looked to have landed on the hill by East Glacier road we could still see the lights flashing on it. By this time shan ! got excited and wanted to follow it me and Alannah didn't want to but he ended up going to the East Glacier Road and stopping by the bridge. We all got out of the car and proceeded to look at it cause it was to the right of the road facing north we could still see the red and blue lights but this is the strange part we were all looking at the one that followed us from Cutbank. When we started to look at the sky all around us we saw a the same light but Brighter on the left of the roadfacing south the one that followed us was facing North. We stayed there watching them both amazed at the colors of them they were no stars or planes they were changing colors to fast and to close to the ground. We left about 20 minutes later and went home (in Browning MT) we told my mom who went outside with us you could still see the south UFO flashing different colors but not as bright it moved back farther and to the right more she believed us and proceeded to call the Police station who then called the Cutbank Police to ask them about the strange light they replied in saying it was a Satellite. I don't think a Satellite can follow someone for 30 miles in a car blinking red and blue close to the ground. we all went back to the East Glacier Bridge and stopped to look at the South UFO it was still blinking colors but it had moved farther back and more to the left we stayed there about half an hour watching it get smaller and the lights getting dimmer. we took my mom home and went to go return movies at the local video store still able to see the light in town, we then stopped at my sister Belinda's house she was standing outside with her binoculars the light was still there in the same spot changing blue, red and orange in formation moving to the right like around a sphere about an hour later when we were home the light in the sky changing colors was gone. To describe the Lights it was like they were moving in formation in a circle flashing blue, red and orange when we saw it the closest it was definitely moving in a circle.",2004-01-22T00:00:00,48.5966,-113.2766

I just recently moved to AZ from NH about 3 months ago and am fascinated by the stars I can see here unlike the big city that I came from, the sky at night here is breath taking.  On this particular evening I noticed an extremely bright star.  From all the nights I've been gazing, I've never seen this particular one before.  I was a little stunned at how BIG it was. Big and very very bright! It didn't twinkle, like some of the other stars did and for a brief moment got really spooked.  I ran inside and did an Instant Message to my mother (who is in Nantucket, MA) and told her what I was seeing. She asked if I could take a digital picture of it.  So I attempted to.  I took a picture of the regular stars directly above me, of the little dipper and Orion's belt, but couldn't actually see it through the view finder. I took the picture anyway. I then faced that bright star and actually saw it through my view finder.  That's gotta tell you right there how bright it was. I downloaded it to my computer and it showed up, blurred, as I couldn't keep a steady hand.  I proceeded to try and take several steadier pictures but couldn't.  I concluded that maybe it's the planet Venus but I'm not Astronomically inclined and don't know it's position. I figure I'll check back after an hour or so and see if it moves with the rest of the constellations.  My friend showed up to watch a movie with me but before we did, I pointed it out to him and he was just as baffled.  He said he thought it was too low to be a star. Then thought it was a plane.  But I said it's been stationery like that for the past 1/2 hour or so, it can't be a plane.  We watched the movie and about an hour later (9:30 pm), I stepped back outside to check on it.  It had faded to a smaller redder shape and much lower to the horizon.  Next thing I knew I was holloring for my friend to come see it.  It got extremely bright again, I mean BRIGHT then would fade out then bright again, then fade etc... I asked him if there was a lighthouse around here and he said no.  Then the faded light slowly moved to the right and lit up bright again.  ... It's gone now..... I don't see it anymore.  For a brief description of my point of view.... From my back patio, I see the western sky. I am in the higher part of Lake Havasu City and can see the lake and the Indian Resort Casino in Havasu City, Ca.  I can see the lights of the Casino. These are small pin points of lights and the one I saw had to be about 10 times brighter than the casino lights.  Not being able to estimate miles, All I can do is guess that the bright light I saw was about 5 or 6 miles East of the casino lights which is probably desert.  I am really baffled by this and really want to know what I saw. In the meantime, I'm gonna research Venus's location.  :)",2004-01-22T00:00:00,34.506735795454546,-114.29056420454545

He was looking off into the woods to our right so I stopped in shock to try and see what he was so worked up over. I had to stare almost 2 minutes before I saw it. It was a black teardrop shaped thing weaving out from behind a tree and it seemed like it would look at us and go back behind the tree. I was scared as hell but very curious and being that I had my dog with me for protection I decided to move towards it. My dog wanted to pursue it by this point also so we began stepping off the trail and walking towards it. We had walked maybe 15 feet and it flew out from behind the tree and began moving away from us at a slow speed. I tried to keep up with it but even running it moved just a little bit faster than us. I saw no marks on it, no other parts just a black teardrop shape. Finaly it rose up between some pines after chasing it for about 3 minutes and from what I could see through the tree branches, it took off in a vertical climb faster than Ive ever seen anything move in my life. I just went straight up till I couldnt see it anymore. I was scared and decided to get the hell out of there after seeing it do that. I dont know what I saw today, but believe me when I tell you it frightened me. I never heard a noise either and come to think of it, it never seemed to hit a tree branch or bush or anything. It definetly knew how to fly well whatever it was. My best description of what it was made out of would be like describing the black glass that you see over a security camera in a casino or something. Very black and reflective. Other than that, I saw nothing else and didnt get close enough for any other details. It was about the size Id say of maybe two basketballs together.",2004-01-22T00:00:00,,

On 1/20/04 I witnessed two ufo sightings. I witnessed the same looking ufo that I saw on 1/7/04 and another ufo that was also circular except it had many colors. I went out to dinner and when I got home we were pulling in our driveway and I was telling my mom about how I saw this big buck near the woods on our property and all of a sudden this object off in the night sky instantly grabbed my attention. My mom noticed how suddenly I went quite and she responded by saying ""What is it""? I quickly said ""mom I think its a ufo"". Once inside, I went up into my room and grabbed my binoculars as fast as I possibly could. I ran back outside with my binoculars in hand and I looked through my binoculars at the object. The object was positioned to the southeast, high in the night sky. At this time it was just me and my stepbrother and we where both trying to see whether this was an actual ufo or not. Without a doubt, through the binoculars, we both saw the multiple colors and the circular shape. The colors of the ufo were the colors of the rainbow and were pulsating at a rapid speed through the binoculars. The object stayed to the east and cycled up and down constantly, at a slow rate. Without looking through the binoculars you could still make out a pulsating object with many colors. Though through the binoculars you could make out every color in the rainbow which could easily be seen. While I was in disbelief, that I was witnessing another ufo in the same month, my stepbrother was looking at a bright white object in the northern night sky. He asked me whether or not I thought that it could be another ufo and I really kind of ignored him. I easily passed it by as a star without giving it a chance even through the binoculars. While still very intrigued by the bright, colorful ufo that was slowly moving in the high, southeastern sky, my stepbrother seemed to not be able to keep his eyes off the bright white ob! ject to the north. He told me that he thought he saw it move and he also said that it was odd how it was pulsating.I gave a quick look at it once again and I thought to myself once again know thats just an extremely bright white star. Though at that exact time, it did look like it had moved and I think thats what made me give it a chance to prove it wasnt a star. I guess I really thought it was impossible to see two ufos let alone one in the same night. I really didn't start paying any attention to it until I slowed down my excitement of the first ufo I saw and then I really tryed to concentrate on the bright white object to the north. At this point, I realized that without looking through the binoculars the object was in almost the identical spot to the north with the same bright whiteness as the one I saw in the begginning of January. I looked through the binoculars and I instantly noticed that it was a circular shape and that it was pulsating bright white light. Though the only differences with the object were was the shape it changed to and its movement. It moved slowly up and down but still stayed to the northern night sky. The bright white ufo changed shape but not into a triangle but into a shape without any distinct qualitys. The bright white ufo started up in the sky and then ended up looking as if it was in my woods. We both watched each ufo equaly and we stayed outside for about an hour and twenty minutes. The bright, white, circular ufo was much brighter than the circular colorful one in the southeastern sky. Though both moved very similar and at the same speed. They both also made absolutely no sound. All I know is that I've now witnessed three ufos in the same month.",2004-01-22T00:00:00,41.753,-83.6319

We saw what appeared to be a star traveling from south to north. There were no flashing lights that would indicate that it was an aircraft. As it flew across the sky slowly and parallel to some stars we noticed that it then moved in a ""snake like"" manner, swinging left and right.  I asked my brother if he had a camcorder to see if he could zoom in on it. He ran inside, I kept my eye on the object as it travelled north. He came out with his binoculars and we both took turns looking at the object. We did not see any flashing lights when viewed through the binoculars. This object looked like a star.

As I continued west down the farm road, I noticed the lights starting to flicker, as if trees were getting between me and the light source.

Myself and my friend of twenty years took our time coming down off the mountain. We stopped at a privately owned piece of property towards the bottom to bugle (call) elk that are frequently in the area just for fun. It was dark by this time. My friend bugled a couple of times out of the passenger seat and something caught my eye. I don't know how to explain why , it just didn't move right it seemed to zig-zag in a way that was so smooth and precise that you wouldn't notice easily. The objects view was blocked by a tree for a couple of seconds when I told my friend to check it out when it appeared again and let me know if it was zig-zagging. He confirmed it and we both grabbed binoculars and exited the vehicle. The object was a light-blue panel of light emitted in a almost fog like way but the panel itself was clearly defined. We were not able to see any shadows or parts of the object that you would assume would have to be above the panel. It zig-zagged from the west to the east for about a 45 degree amount of sky and I can't tell you if it stopped but I noticed a twinkle off to the side and what appeared to be below the object. The object then went up and it did it QUICKLY! There was never a sound or a streak trailer or anything. We are positive that the light didn't just go out, it went away from earth at a speed that just does not make sense. We stood in awe talking about it for 5-10 minutes when the first of 6 or seven jets or planes showed up. They had red bue strobes and seemed to be patroling the same airspace the light was in only minutes before. We do not have any airforce for a few hundred miles but they seemed to come from both the southeast and northwest. We did not notice the speed of the light until we saw how slowly the jets/planes movement across the sky was in comparison. Altitude looked relatively the same. We are not sure but the jets/planes seemed to slowly gain altitude and take up positions surroundi! ng the area very high up. This was all seen in a matter of 1-1 1/2 hours.

I Just wanted to drop a few thoughts on the subject after honestly having faced the fact that there are no rules or limits. I have spent a great deal of time ""looking up"" over the past year and will continue to ""sleep under the stars"" every once in a while but I refuse to let what I have seen absorb so much of my life. I have since had a cowardly object ""look my way"" on two seperate occassions. My opinion is that these objects move in a friction-less pathway(vacuum?)that is somehow created in an open environment. I can't help but feel like however and whatever is going on up there gives me a feeling of ""trouble on the horizon"" and short of grabbing a .50cal or whatever I can get my hands on and trying my best to ""get some"" or have ""my effect"" on their lives. I have decided to have faith and ""keep on keepin on"". You really do get what you look for.-((initials deleted))",2003-10-07T00:00:00,44.8141,-117.7453

It had a short round tear drop shape with five distinct trails.  The longest trail was the center, and immediately following the center trail was, what I thought to be a moon.

We felt warmth and dry night better than hotter in daytime. We're holding together and walked as looking around the light from the top of Pyramid which were so powerful search light that beam upward very high in the sky as it was very impressive to look at the light beam. As we walked toward the Luxor suddenly she patted on my shoulder to look up the light beam.  Suddenly, we saw four UFO oval shaped (absolutely there were no birds around) danced into the light beam. They’re so luminous brighter and were so quietier and no sounds than airplane or helicoper. That's her first UFO sighting and I've seen UFO several times before. Yes, they’re from another world not like as ours. We smiled and standing each other to keep observe for about 30 minutes to 45 minutes. Those UFOs were swinging & dancing around into the light beam. One was zoom off from the beam of light at the incredible speed than the bird's speed and then came back into the light beam was incredible speed as they appear & disappear of their curiously surrounding the sky. Other UFO ships acted like played up and down and swayed. I told my new wife that wasn’t an airplane, helicopter, satellite, balloon or other things what we have them on this earth.

But that is no way to be trust with the officers of U.S. Government’s military. I am allowed to cover-up against them as fair what have they done. She said that is right. I was going to make report to have the information paper from Roswell UFO museum and making some copies for our authorized friend. We were standing to watch those UFO almost longer as a lifetime. I saw one lady walked down pass by us before she enter the Luxor hotel as she turn to look up those UFOs there but her eyes blinks flashed and nearly rush to the door of the Luxor hotel. I giggled myself quietly.  Next morning, we woke up from our bed to dress up. Set the tv on and checked the tv news, finally the news got report about the UFO at the same night time exactly many people saw. More people called to make reports on the news.

We have looked at the graphics, provided by the witness, and our suspicion is that the two witnesses probably were looking at insectivore birds, perhaps nighthawks, pursuing insects, drawn to the bright lights.

I do not remember the exact date, but it was an unusually clear and moonless night. We live in the foothills east of Seattle in an area sheltered from city light. I went out in the yard and was laying on a blanket watching for meteorites during a period of expected meteor showers. It was quiet except for the sounds of owls in the woods. After about half an hour I noticed something approaching very fast, very low and blocking out the stars to the east in my peripheral vision. As I looked upward, a large boom-a rang shaped object passed overhead at an altitude I would estimate as 500 to 1000 feet. It had no lights, absolutely no sound and seemed to be traveling at a supersonic speed without any accompanying sonic boom. I remember saying out loud ""What the..."" at which time a cargo bay or some opening on the bottom center of the object lit up with a blueish white light. I could see visible framework in the rounded front, rectangular opening. Just as quickly, the light went out. It had lit up for perhaps three seconds. Within two more seconds the object disappeared over the foothills to the west. It had passed from horizon to horizon in perhaps six seconds. Again it was extremely low, had no navagation lights and absolutely no sound. We have jet aircraft pass over our home in the day. NOTHING travels as fast as what I saw that night. My own wife scoffs at my story and says it must have been a meteor. It wasn't.

MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  West Central Missouri UFO Flap In Early Autumn 2003,West Central Missouri,MO,2003-10-01T00:00:00,light,,"Occurred : 10/1/2003  Reported: 11/8/2003 7:31:48 PM 19:31 Posted: 11/11/2003 Location: West Central Missouri, MO Shape: Light Duration:",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32947.html,"West Central Missouri UFO Flap In Early Autumn 2003 Submitted by Brian Adams of the Missouri Investigators Group investigated the National UFO Reporting Center’s online sighting reports as permitted by Peter Davenport, Director of NUFORC.  A mysterious long UFO seen as a row six very bright amber lights has appeared over the west central Missouri region over several nights in September and October in 2003.   The UFO was reported by farmers, factory workers and commuters that consisted of either seeing the object hovering over the pastures off the side of the road or moving over the trees in dense woods.  So far there hasn’t been any report of unusual animal deaths or close encounters associated with the UFO sightings.  However, there has been a recently reported corn field crop formation that was reported on October 4th where this UFO did appear over is currently under investigation.  It began on the evening of September 6th with a couple of Pleasant Hill, MO area residents driving up over a small hill on a rural road then stopped to watch a strange row of bright lights hovering over a field between Harrisonville and Pleasant Hill.  I called Amber C. the girlfriend who witnessed this UFO.  Amber told me the UFO was lit up with six very bright amber lights that made it hard to determine any real shape of the craft. But after observing it for only a few moments the UFO lights suddenly went out and no object was seen at all in the dark sky.  Amber said they didn’t hear any sounds by the UFO at any time.  The weather was clear and warm.  On the evening of September 9th Rick D. was driving back home to Independence from his farm in Shawnee Mound on Highway 13 in northern Henry County near the Johnson County line.  Rick noticed some bright amber lights in the direction he was traveling believing that there was an accident ahead on the highway.  Coming around a curve expecting to see emergency vehicles Rick instead saw something quite strange instead.  Cars were parked on both sides of the highway so he slowed down to see why.  Through the windshield Rick saw hovering over the east side of the road two parallel sets of six bright lights that each arched slightly over the trees near an abandoned gas station.  No sounds were heard coming from the UFO outside by Rick at any time.  Rick realized that the other drivers had stopped just to watch these lights in the sky.  A small gap between the sets of lights was noticed but Rick said he couldn’t see any structure at all because of the bright lights.   Rick then attempted to take a photo of the UFO through the passenger side window as he got closer.  (The film was developed a day later and it only showed a faint ball of one of the UFO lights through the window. Rick’s camera’s flash was unfortunately on and it obscured most of the UFO lights outside revealing mostly the interior of his vehicle.)  Suddenly the UFO lights blinked out and nothing else was seen in the except for the full moon rising up in the clear sky.  Rick wanted to stop and find out what the other drivers thought about the UFO but they all began to drive away in both directions. Rick said at least twenty cars had pulled over but he thought it was strange that nobody stayed after the UFO was gone.  So he drove on home while listening to a nearby Warrensburg radio station’s talk show hoping somebody would mention the UFO sighting.  But nobody called and no news about it was reported.  The next evening on September 10th in Clinton, MO at 10 pm Edwin S. reported that he observed a strange ball of yellow light the size of a dime at arms length that was very low to the northeast at 10 pm while letting his dog outside. The UFO moved to the north before getting lost in the trees.  Edwin called the Clinton Police Department but there were no other reports of this object.  In Windsor, MO in northeast Henry County is where a factory worker named Logan M. was out on a break on the factory parking lot just after midnight on September 11th. While in his truck with a buddy the two noticed a very bright light moving very low above the trees to the south.  Assuming it was a plane or helicopter coming in their direction it was apparent that it wasn’t a normal aircraft approaching.  I spoke to Logan and he told me that the light began to move slowly towards them in a northerly direction but it didn’t make any sound at all.  The silent UFO really impressed them Logan said and as they watched it flew virtually overhead. Underneath the UFO it had two yellow lights at each apex with a much larger yellow light in the middle that Logan called a dome. (see attached drawing of the UFO by Logan).  The UFO continued over Windsor but turned in a SW direction soon disappearing behind trees.  Later that night at the factory Logan said that his buddy told him while he was outside taking trash out to the dumpster in the rear parking lot he saw the same UFO lights appear again. The next day Logan met another factory worker who said his girlfriend mentioned that she saw the UFO. The girlfriend called to see if the Henry County Sheriff’s office had any sightings reported.  The Sheriff’s office in Windsor did say that they got dozens of other calls that evening.  They reported   seeing a strange lighted aircraft flying over the town but the Sheriff’s office told them that everything was okay.  In our interview Logan said that this was not a B-2 Stealth Bomber or a military helicopter at all.  Living just ten miles south of the home base B-2 called the 509th bomber squadron Logan said that everybody has seen and heard the B-2’s flying by in their takeoff and landing patterns numerous times.  “The B-2’s are loud and they have normal flashing and landing lights.  This (UFO) thing didn’t at all.  It was very strange.  Obviously, the other witnesses felt the same way as I did after seeing this thing.”  Then on September 23rd in central Missouri two strange but separate sightings about a half hour apart were reported by the witnesses seeing a similar looking UFO near their homes.  Around 9:00 pm a semi-retired cattle farmer named Jerry C. was driving home on a rural road in western Iron County near Boss, MO.  While going up a hill Jerry suddenly saw six very bright amber lights in a straight row appear just above the woods on the north side of the road.  The lights were hovering and not blinking at all but were the size of soccer balls.  To get a better view Jerry said that he stopped and as he began to back up the lights immediately went out.  At 65 years old Jerry said that he never has seen anything like this before.  His stock dog was riding in the bed of the pickup truck.  Jerry said that the dog seemed to be very nervous and scared.  Jerry emailed me a couple of days later saying that he was out cutting some firewood on a ridge and when he was finished noticed his dog had disappeared.  “The dog is always at my side and doesn’t chase my cattle. So I looked around and found the dog had been hit by a car.  It was suffering and I had to put a bullet in him.  Funny thing is that this is the exact spot on the road where we saw the UFO.  Weird isn’t it?”  Then at 9:30 pm Daniel K. and his mother were inside their home watching TV on the north side of Cuba, MO or about fifty miles north of Jerry’s farm.  Daniel’s mom then noticed a strange lighted object through a window moving above the trees.  She and Daniel saw five horizontal lights for a few seconds appear to the south of their backyard.  They ran out to the back porch to see what it was but the lights went out.  Suddenly the lights appeared again to the southwest but then the lights turned off again. There was no sound of an aircraft heard at all.  I called Daniel’s home and spoke with his mother about their sighting report.  She estimated that the lights were four and a half miles away because a main road called Highway F is about that far from their home.  She said that they’re surrounded by thick woods so it was difficult to see because the UFO was flying low just above the tree tops.  She said Daniel did call the Cuba Police Department to see if anyone else had reported seeing the strange lights in the sky but there was none.  Another weird report came in from the Pleasant Hill area on October 10th.  James H. said that a week earlier his brother-in-law found a strange crop formation while harvesting a corn field on Saturday morning October 4th.  While up high inside the cab of the combine the brother in-law saw that the corn stalks had been cut down at ground level in a perfectly square area he said was 10 by 10 feet.  He got inside the formation and noticed that the cobs or ears of corn had been removed from the cut stalks and then pressed down into the soil with the cobs standing in a pattern.  It looked like an 8 with a small line or a 1 at the side of the 8.  But unfortunately instead of going around the formation the brother in-law drove the combine through it. The brother in-law told James he even got off of the combine to pick up the cobs stuck in the ground and put them into the combine.  However, the brother in-law did notice that the cobs hadn’t spoiled so whatever did cause the formation happened recently.  Nobody has been into the corn field since to check for any evidence afterwards because of the area in question is several hundred yards from any road plus recent rains has made the ground very soft so it’s inaccessible even by 4 wheel drive.  Hopefully later this fall a visit will be successfully made to the crop formation spot to gather samples.  Now what is interesting to this crop formation and the September 6th Pleasant Hill sighting is that this corn field is exactly where the witnesses observed the UFO hovering over that evening.  The rural road the witnesses were on called Christmas Tree Lane is the south property line of the corn field just east of Highway 7.  They saw their UFO on the north side of the road over the corn field.  It’s still possible that there are other witnesses in the area who may have seen this UFO as well but they have decided to not report their sighting or mention it to anyone.  The Missouri Investigators Group (UFOMIG.com) will continue to pursue additional witnesses and do follow-up investigation on these UFO reports.  Updated: I'm tonight (Nov. 8th) just reading the recent sightings over Missouri the first week of November, 2003.  On Nov. 4th, 2 more UFO reports having a straight row of 3-6 very bright amber lights seen over Elisnore and Greenville and on Nov. 5 a UFO seen over St. Joe similar to the Windsor, MO craft.  I'm also reading about similar sightings of these UFOs reported seen over Pass Christian, MS and Alexandria, VA on Nov. 5th also over Kittery, ME on Nov. 6th.  Besides these reportts there were more similar UFOs seen over Arkansas and Kansas during Sept. 2003.

Stoner, British Columbia  Date:  October 26, 2003 Time:  5:00 p.m.  A gentleman called me from Prince George, British Columbia tonight (November 9, 2003) to report a sighting he and his wife had while coming back from Penticton, B.C. On October 26, 2003 while traveling along highway 97 just south of Stoner, B.C., heading north the couple saw what they first thought was a very large aircraft. The fellow told me it looked like an aircraft that would have been coming in for a landing at an airport with the landing lights on. The light they witnessed was extremely bright and again large in size. The object was to their right and a head of them at this point. Also the object was traveling over top of the trees. They soon figured out that what they were observing was not a normal aircraft at all due to it's size, brightness and how low it was flying. The witness told me they were traveling at approx: 100 kilometers an hour and they were catching up to this thing. He also mentioned, it was unlikely at the speed he was traveling that they would have slowly crept up closer to it if it had of been a plane.  Still thinking the fellow wondered, could it possibly be a helicopter as it did seem to hover for a spit second or two then started moving once again. Being so low, they did lose sight of it briefly due to the trees blocking their view. Once the witnesses got to a crest of the hill and seeing there was a clearing they spotted the object again. At this point it was just underneath the cloud cover. The witnesses estimated the cloud ceiling to be at approx: 8,000 feet or close. The object, still traveling slowly, flying just below the clouds and basically straight across from them when the light just disappeared, then reappeared shortly there after and then finally vanished. The witness mentioned that the highway had a lot of traffic on it and many others driving would have noticed the object. It was hard not to see it due to the intensity of the light.  I will be checking this out Monday morning to see if I can dig anything up on this case.  Thank you to both witnesses for their report.

I looked straight up and saw 3 round lights moving in unison from the West to the East horizon.  The circles of grey light were located at each end of the triangle shape, and I estimate this triangle was about 100 feet across.  I looked away from the lights several times to make sure I was really seeing what I saw.  I was able to locate this moving object over and over again.  It took about 30 seconds for this object to move to the Eastern horizon.  This was no illusion!  I went to bed and dreamed of UFO's darting in and out of the clouds and across the sky.  These UFO's in my dream were both triangle shaped and rod shaped. ((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE/09MR04)) Dear Peter,   Thanks for all you do.  I check your site daily for updates and it's fascinating reading.   I witnessed a ufo November 2, 2003, and reported it to you and it is posted in the database.  Since my sighting I have slowly come to realize that this ufo departed/exited in a very distinctive manner.  At around 9pm I saw three circles of gray light that were much higher than the typical commercial air traffic around Charlotte, NC.  They were in a triangle formation moving west to east.  I strongly believe they were separate from each other as I remember seeing the stars between/behind them as they progressed across the sky.  They were much larger than any star or commercial airline lighting.  Using the thumb measure, each circle was size of a pencil eraser.   When the three circles approached the eastern most horizon the first circle appeared to curl up like it was going through an evelope slot or like it was curling upward around a cylinder or wringer of some sort.  I remember watching it curling and then all three lights went out or disappeared.  I wonder if this could be some sort of portal these crafts use to leave earthly dimension.  Forgive me if this account is of no use but I wanted to report it just in case you feel it truly is distinctive.  I also attached a rudimentary picture of the ufo that I drew on my Dell.

My boyriend and I and our baby were driving North on US1 through Rockledge, and I saw some flashing lights up ahead and to the west.  The area has lots of radio antenae in the area, but what I saw seemed to be an airplane heading North as well.  As I watched (from the backseat), through the front windsheild, I saw two white lights perfectly opposite from each other, and two red lights.  One was to the left of the leftmost white light, and the other was in the middle, a bit more forward (sort of in a triangle formation) than the two white lights, sort of taking the 'point'.  The red lights would alternate between which one was on an off.  I asked my boyfriend what it was, and, knowing that I was a stargazer who often mistook things for UFOs, he said it was an airplane.  I looked again, and saw that it seemed to be descending (like an airplane would).  I asked what it was doing, and he suggested landing.  However, I know that there are no landing areas anywhere near where it was (for those familiar with the area, it was northwest of the Gannette/Florida Today office building).  He suggested Orlando, and I said that it's too low and it wouldn't make it to Orlando before it landed.  Then he suggested Merritt Island, and it was headed in the wrong direction.  Then he suggested Titusville, which was northward of where we were, and I conceded...  However, the low flying plane seems to slow down, because now I could see it through the driver's side window.  I couldn't see any body at this point, but now the white lights were gone, and the red lights were there, still alternating between on and off.  Then, I guess we caught up with it so it was by the rear-driver's side window.  I looked out and saw a very vague black/gray triangularish shape.  I couldn't locate any wings, however, and at that point, the red lights were both on at the same time.  I looked forward and told my boyfriend something, and when I looked back to look at it, we drove past an area that blocked the ""plane"" with lots of trees.  When we broke free, the craft was no longer there.  When the road curved to the northwest a bit, I looked again, and still couldn't find it.  I looked every direction and still couldn't find anything.  I might not know a lot of aircraft, but I was under the impression that that a) had blue lights as well as red, and b) couldn't disappear suddenly.  I like looking for UFOs, and my boyfriend doesn't exactly disapprove of it.. but he does make fun of me for it sometimes.  I think it probably would take something extraordinary for him to believe that what I saw was really a UFO.

I thought it might have been an airplane, but I could not see anything after it faded.

Looking at the moon a bright dot of light caught my eye and I thought I was watching a sattelite. It seemed strange though because it appeared to be veering off a straight line that a sattelite would travel. After watching for a minute I noticed more lights in a grouping and another grouping set apart from it. I thought that they might be spots in my eyes but I noticed that they would disappear behind some high thin strps of clouds. My next thought was that I was viewing commercial aircraft. I stepped under the soffit of my house and used the gutter as a staionary reference point and noticed that the lights moved in random directions and circular patterns. At one point two lights approached a couple of others and ended up reversing directions before they got too close together.I watched one light fly across the visible moon and was able to see it constantly as it passed.After watching for ten or more minutes I saw my neighbor come out of his house and asked him to look. I had to cross the street to do this and was unable to find the clusters I had been watching. We did see one light moving away together.

I've been always looking towards the skies, this was sighting was a bit startling and came at a surprise.  I've always been a skeptic and keep an open mind.  When this experience occurred, I was overwhelmed by feelings of this being something out of the ordinary. I could sense and felt a presence of being monitored perhaps.  The crazy thing about this experience, is that a week prior to this event.  I had sent an email over to the folks in Oregon/Washington area who are making exceptional claims of UFO sightings and contacts.  I can't fully remember the gentleman's name but his first name is ((name deleted)). He runs a ranch in that part of the country. Peter, I think you know, who I 'm referring to. Getting on to the story, I had sent an email to them stating send to send the UFO activity to Northern Illinois area, primarily the Chain-O-Lakes region, which is the town of Fox Lake.  I don't know if this is connected or possibly.  The UFO sighting was quick but basically simple.  My wife and I had finished shopping at the local grocery store when we had jumped in our car and proceeded Northbound on Route 12 into Fox Lake. As I had just passed the intersection of Rt 12 & Rt 134. In front of us above Rt 12. We had noticed a slow moving object with strobing white lights. From our perspective the lights we had noticed we just two white lights, unlike an airplane lights these lights were not constantly on, they were blinking on and off. So from our sight through our windshield, the pattern of the blinking was from left to right, on and off.  I had mentioned to my wife, the lights were odd because they were quite bright. In the area, we have a lot of low flying small aircraft such as single prop planes and so forth, in addition O'hare has a flight path coming in from the Northwest, but our distant from the airport is 40 miles out. So this would be impossible, because we had noticed the air traffic to our Northwest at a much higher altitude.  As we were traveling Northbound on Rt 12, we were headed toward the object. I started to panic because one of the feelings of amazement and the altitude was very low perhaps 1000 ft at best. As we had past underneath the object, I had nearly crashed the car because I was checking the local traffic around me to see if they were viewing the same object. I had rolled down the window and looked up to see that there was no sound, the lights I had saw were three white lights also one green and red in addition.  The white lights were position on each end of a perfect triangle. The red and green were somewhere on the object but can't make out exactly where. The object was flying quite slow, I couldn't make out a body because it was pitch black as far as a craft. The object was flying was as a backwards triangle, meaning the third light was positioned on the back. I wish I could have pulled over, but due to traffic. I could not.  I'm hoping someone else saw this event. It somewhat scared me, something is goi! ng here.  My email is ((e-address deleted))",2003-09-28T00:00:00,42.3959,-88.1749

When it stoped it would produce smaller brighter white lights that would begin circkling the bigger orange light getting bigger as if it were spiraling outward away from the bigger of the two. This happened several tmes alternating back and forth between two of the bigger orange lights each time lasting approximately 10-15 seconds each time.  They would switch back and forth as if toggling a switch with approximately a 10-15 second delay between each display.  The smaller white lights kept on flying whilethe bigger orange lights were doing as described.  After the smaller lights would make approximately 4-5 circles around the larger lights they would begin fly in differant flight paths some went east to west and others remained in the general area flying in erratic patterns.  Some came down closer to the ground appearing to be moving in and out of the trees.

We were looking around to see if we could see any more of the lights we had previously seen when my friend saw what he thought was another one.We then realized at this time what we were looking at was an airplane.But then we noticed that not to far behind the airplane was one of the smaller white lights that appeared to be following the airplane.After a short period of time approximately 5-7 seconds it then made a 90 degree turn from its current path and made a direct line over the top of us straight into one of the larger orange lights that had appeared while we were watching the smaller light follow the airplane.Then another one of the smaller white lights appeared adjacent to the other and did the same thing making a straight line into the bigger orange light.We then turned away to look for more and didnt see any.We then turned back to look at the one that were present and they had vanished leaving us with the sights and sounds of somthing that was and is totally unexplainable and somewhat unbeleavable even though we know it is true because we all three whitnessed and heard the incident with our very own ears and eyes.This is a memory of an incident that will never ever be forgotten for the rest of my life!!!!!!!!

At Ina, I went directly beneath them and I could see the sky between them so they werent attached. I got off the freeway at Cortaro and pulled in to a Chevron but the lights were gone. No one was around me on the freeway..the lights were about 100 ft if that far above me at Ina. I didn't hear any noise and my car didn't do anything weird. There was no object...just pure light as far as I could tell. My uncle said that 2 of the lights went out and that the other two started to move towards the east side and he went inside to get his glasses and when he came out they were gone.",2003-09-17T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

Sometimes stationary, sometimes moving in a horizontal path for a short duration. I am an ex-pilot and know aircraft movements, and aerial flare patterns, these lights were not aircraft related.

It was kind of pulsating and changing its color to white and yellow. It flew toward our direction and when it was finally over us it kinda stopped and started moving in a circular/spiral motion right on top of us as if it was looking down on us until it got covered up by clouds.

At first, I thought it was just a drop of water fallind down my windshield, and that a street light had refected on it, making it look luminous. But I was definitely not.  It fell at a constant speed, very slowly. It moved in a straight path, and just slightly toward the left. We were driving, South/SouthWest-ish.

I live in an oceanfront condo, and was sitting on my balcony overlooking the ocean when a bright orange light appeared approximately 25 degrees off the horizon over the ocean. The light was bright enough to reflect in the water, although how far away it was I could not discern. The light basically blinked on, remained bright for about 3-5 seconds, and then quickly faded out. It did not move. Another light appeared about 5 minutes later at about the same height, but a quarter of the horizon north. Another appeared 10 minutes later, directly in front of me, at the same level, and as soon as it faded out, another one appeared maybe 5 degrees away from the first. The light is large, to my eye approximately 10 times larger than Mars. Focusing binoculars on the light does not provide any discernible object, with no running lights visible after it fades to indicate an aircraft. There was a full moon out, which backlit the sky enough to make any physical object visible through binoculars. The sky was clear. Each time I have seen these orange lights, they are accompanied by a multitude of white strobes, numbering anywhere between 10-30, which move across the sky at various altitudes, but the movement is erratic. I am used to seeing aircraft strobes as planes departing and landing from the Myrtle Beach airport fly across the ocean regularly. These strobes do not track like an aircraft, but erratically bounce around. At times a red strobe can be seen alongside the white strobes. Mostly the strobes can only be seen with binoculars, however it is not uncommon to discern them with the naked eye once you know what to look for. I have always seen these objects between 9pm and 11pm, sometimes they last for two hours, other times for a half hour. Tonight I observed a set of 6 white strobes move inland for the first time. They normally remain offshore. The strobe! s are very small, which makes judging their distance difficult. The strobes and orange lights sometimes appear on one side of the horizon, then the orange light will appear on the opposite side, and the strobes appear to race across the sky to it. A multitude of aircraft with strobes moving as a group may appear they are moving erratically due to the nature of a strobe light. The only explaination I can devise concerning the orange lights is possibly the glow from afterburners, although there is no aircraft visible when it fades, ie no running lights. Two guests have seen these lights on different nights with me.",2003-12-09T00:00:00,33.68315,-78.93953909574468

I was forwarded and email with details of your witness stories from Kelowna regarding the events of July 31st.  I also witnessed a strange event that night.  I was in bed, still awake, looking out my bedroom window which faces West.  I was looking at what I thought was star, but it seemed oddly out of place.  It flashed as bright as a flash of lightening.  The brightness and oddity of this flash made me jump out of bed, awakening my wife and asking her if she had just seen what I had.  She was asleep and did not witness what I did.  I went outside to gain a better look but it was gone.

An eractic object with three bright white lights traveling with traffic over I-5 in the middle of California,Bakersfield,CA,2003-08-16T21:45:00,unknown,3-5 minutes,"Occurred : 8/16/2003 21:45  (Entered as : 08/16/03 21:45) Reported: 9/7/2003 10:24:20 AM 10:24 Posted: 9/9/2003 Location: Bakersfield (80 miles north of), CA Shape: Unknown Duration:3-5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31276.html,"An eractic object with three bright white lights traveling with traffic over I-5 in the middle of California My wife, my parents and I were driving down I-5 towards LA in heavy traffic traveling about 65 miles per hour.  Ahead of us the traffic started slowing down.  All of a sudden three lights popped over the field to the east of us and swooped overhead.  We were all looking at this object (I say an object because the lights seemed fixed to something but we couldn't see any structure - once I thought I saw a long pole-like boom heading to one of the lights, but I can't be sure) as we, it and the rest of the traffic moved south at 45-50 miles per hour.  It bounced up and down, looked like it landed in a field to the west of us, then zoomed back over the interstate.  At first I thought it was a crop duster, although it was very dark to be spraying.  But the object didn't follow any field pattern I know of, nor did I see any cloud of pesticide ejected from the object which I believe would leave a haze that would fog the lights from the farm houses in the distance.  Those lights stayed crystal clear.  Also, the object would speed up ahead of us then return along the interstate.  My wife thought it might be a small plane or ultrlight in distress, but the object didn't have any colored wing lights, just three very intense white beams one of which disappeared every so often (I think the bulk of the object blocked the far light at these times, but I have no special reason to think so).  The object stayed around the highway for a few minutes, then rushed off to the east.  It seemed to have set down in a field about 1/4 mile behind us.  As I was in the backseat, I kept watching it wondering what it might be.  It appear once more well behind our car and moved west over the interstate a minute or so later.  We were well away from it; I could only see the lights as dots.  None of us heard any noise although we could easily hear car engines and crickets (as we discovered later) while moving at speed.  The radio wasn't on.  When I asked what size they thought the object was, three of us felt the craft couldn't have been more than 20 feet long (my wife and mother compared it to the size of a large car).  My father thought it was relatively large.  (As an amateur astronomer, I know that appearent dimensions get funny at night.  So I gave my parents a test to help them visualize the size of the object (my wife already knows this test).  I asked them to compare the object to the full moon.  Then I asked them which coin is roughly the size of the full moon when held at arm's length.  My mom thought the object was much larger than the full moon, say about 8 to ten disks wide, and correctly said a dime is roughly the disk of the moon.  My father didn't give me an estimation, but incorrectly believed a quarter matches the appearent diameter of the moon.)  We figured the object never went very high above us and estimated the closest approach to be about 500 feet to the west and less than 100 feet above from the appearent height of the power lines running along the highway and the height of the crops it disappeared into.  My wife and I are teachers (she's a pre-school teacher and head after-school teacher; I'm a middle school science and math teacher).  My mother just retired from teaching 5th grade for 37 years.  My dad retired from brokering steel.  I noted the time from the clock radio in the car and the inital distance from a mileage sign to Bakersfield.",2003-09-09T00:00:00,35.34399793103448,-119.04089261083743

"A shiny, tumbling disk was seen moving slowly to the southeast.",Lompoc,CA,2003-08-25T14:25:00,disk,5 minutes,"Occurred : 8/25/2003 14:25  (Entered as : 08/25/03 14:25) Reported: 9/7/2003 1:22:57 PM 13:22 Posted: 9/9/2003 Location: Lompoc, CA Shape: Disk Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31281.html,"A shiny, tumbling disk was seen moving slowly to the southeast. I was just heading out of town (Lompoc, CA, USA) on an overnight trip. I was driving S/E on Highway 1, when I noticed a flashing out of the corner of my eye. I looked out the driver's side window on my left, and noticed a strange disk like object that seemed to be tumbling. The flashing seemed to be from the object reflecting sunlight as it tumbled. I immediately pulled my car over to the side of the road, at the point where Jalama Beach road intersects Highway 1. This is about 8 miles S/E of Lompoc. Vandenburg air force base is about 10 miles to the west of this sighting, and extends to the north. The object eventually disappeared behind a mountain ridge, the ridge being about 1 mile S/E from my location, and perhaps 1000 feet above my vantage point. I was able to watch this object for about 5 minutes; which gave me enough time to mentally record some facts, which I'll list here:  Time: 2:25pm, August 25, 2003  Weather: fair and sunny, warm, no clouds. Wind (at ground level) was calm.  Direction: object was N/E of me, moving S/E, parallel to Highway 1.  Motion: object was moving slowly, possibly drifting in an upper level wind (wind was calm at ground level); moving away from Lompoc, in the general direction of Gaviota or Santa Barbara. The object never changed direction, or speed. It crossed perhaps 90 degrees of open sky over the course of 5 minutes.  Size: object seemed about 1/16 inch in diameter, viewed at arm's length.  Distance: object was greater than one mile away(see above).  Description: object was disk shaped, with a shiny, chrome-like upper side, and a dark,  gray or black, non-reflective bottom. The shape was similar to a coin. The flashing I noticed was due to the top side reflecting sunlight as the object ""tumbled."" No features were visible on the disk itself. The object was completely silent.  Tumbling motion: at first glance, this object seemed to be slowly tumbling as it drifted to the S/E. As I looked more carefully, I noticed that the chrome-like top side remained the top side throughout each ""tumble."" Perhaps ""extreme yawing and pitching"" would be a better term than ""tumble,"" with the disk as much as 80 degrees from horizontal at maximum. This ""pitching"" had a very regular periodicity, lasting about 2 or 3 seconds before repeating. This allowed me to see both the top(chrome-like); and bottom(dark); sides of the object, as well as its' thin cross section, when seen from the side. Though the object was too far away to be sure, I strongly suspect that the actual motion of the object was a ""rotational precession."" This is similar to what a spinning coin would do as it slowly comes to rest on the surface of a table. And like a tabletop coin, this would indicate that an upward force was acting on the object.  This object was far enough away to make a positive ID difficult(A pair of binoculars would have been perfect, but I didn't have any). Still, as I watched, I mentally went through a list of what it wasn't. It definitely wasn't: an airplane, a hot-air balloon, a helicopter, a rocket launch (I've seen many from Vandenburg), a piece of mylar scrap, a blimp, or an advertising balloon. It was also flying fairly low over private ranchland, which would make a vehicle of government origin, less likely.  The only rational explanation I could think of was a child's mylar balloon, drifting in an upper level wind. However, a balloon of this type would be far too small for the distance this object was at. They're also too ""fat."" This object was thin, like a coin. When the object was viewed edge on, it practically disappeared, with only a thin line visible. Also, remember the tumbling? A drifting balloon will remain motionless(no tumbling), as it slowly glides over the ground, since it would be in equilibrium with the prevailing air currents. Was the tumbling then caused by thermals? Probably not, since there was no altitude change, and the motion of the tumbling was quite regular(periodic). I decided, while still watching this object, that the balloon scenario was extremely unlikely.  I searched this UFO database and noticed three other similar cases, oddly enough, all from this general area, one in Laguna Niguel(5/11/2003), one in Goleta(also 5/11/2003), and one in Santa Barbara(8/24/03, one day prior to my sighting). Laguna Niguel is about 150 miles S/E of here, Goleta and Santa Barbara are just down the road, S/E about 30 miles.  Also of note: when viewed on a map, the direction this object was heading was exactly parallel to the Pacific coast, albeit 10 miles inland.  About me: I'm male, 39, 20/20 vision. I have a strong science/math background, and currently work as a teaching substitue at the local high school. I have some flight experience, having once trained as a naval aviator. I've also studied UFO cases for many years, though I prefer to stick with cases involving policeman, military, or pilots. I never expected to see one for myself , though.",2003-09-09T00:00:00,34.61353917050691,-120.40598801843318

I alerted my husband to it to see what he thought 'they' were doing. I had thought it was a helicopter possibly looking for a person or a boat in trouble b.c the light was so bright. i went below to get binoculars and gave them to my husband since he is very familiar with the different types of aircraft. The aircraft was alone at that time, and from what i could tell had one bright light. It wasn't far from the ocean like an airplane might be. It flew at the height of what most helicopters fly when they are looking for something.What shocked me was the pattern in which it flew. It wasn't flying staight nor was it flying in a zig zag. it seemed to be flying in a circular pattern...almost as if it were going around another object. I couln't hear any noise except the waves in the ocean. We watched it til it was almost out of sight.

Mysterious white orbs in night sky - moving in a repetitive sequence - within the same circular area - although staying in the same spot in the sky for 45 minutes. My husband called me to take a look at something strange in the night sky. At first I thought that maybe it was just some sort of a light show for some sort of a Halloween event.  The more I think about it - the more I begin to think that this was no ordinary light.  Although I did NOT see any disk shaped metallic object, I DID however see a series of unexplainable lights moving around in a repetetive sequence - within the confines of a circular area.  The circular area where these lights were stayed the same, although the lights that were moving within this circular area moved in a repetitive sequence similar to a kaleidescope - only these were white lights - with NO beam as to show where they were coming from.  They seemed to just be in the same spot - made no noise - were the color of white spot ligts used to light up the sky for airplaines, but as I said before - there was NO BEAM to show them as coming from any where from the ground.  They were just in the sky.  I know that we had Northern Lights in the sky earlier that day (this was yesterday) but they would not be moving in such an arranged repetitive formation.  These lights looked as if there were 2 sets of 4 white lights - all equally spaced apart - 4 on the outside of a circle - and 4 on the inside - and 1 stationary light in the center that never moved. As 1 pair of 4 lights joined eachother at the center, the other set of 4 lights moved apart - eqal distance from eachother - away from the center.  Then they would switch off. Finally ALL 8 lights would shift in a clockwise 45 degree angle and the sequence would start all over again.  1 set of 4 lights moving toward the center as the other set moved away from the center - then the other set would come back to the center as the original set moved back towards the center - then all 8 white orbs about 3 feet in diameter would rotate again about 45 degrees in a clockwise direction. It just kept doing the same sequence for about 45 minutes.  In the same circular area.  It was about as high as 2-3 power lines if stacked one on top of another going straight up.  It was the diameter of about a large family home - and it was about 1 city block away from MY house !!  These lights made no noise.  There was no beam of light showing any origination point - as with sky lights used to guide airplanes or lights that might come from a light house.  Nothing like that.  Just up there on their own.  Repeating a type of kaleidescope sequence of repetitive movements - although the center light was the only one that never moved. The lights looked as if they were coming from the underbelly of some sort of circular shaped craft - although I NEVER saw any actual craft.  Just the lights. But it was very weird - I never saw anything like it before - and then it was gone. My husband and I came home for a moment and when we came back out again - this time they were gone, so we never saw how they disappeared or if they flew away or just disappeared... but they were out there in the same spot - doing the same thing for about 45 minutes.  It MAY have been a natural phenomenon - but why would a natural phenomenon have lights moving in such a repetetive sequence and stay in the exact same spot the entire time for almost an hour.  If it was some sort of a man made light show - then why was there no beam of light showing a source of origin? It was weird.  10 people saw it.  1 witness was a former marine - with lots of medals of honor.  Not a flakey person.  He was the first to admit that it might actually be a UFO, but that we could not see the craft if the craft was dark - camouflaged against the dark sky.  Only the lights below the craft would be visible. The more I think about it - as hard to admit as it is - it's a possible explanation. The only question with this is - why was the craft not moving for over 45 minutes? It was weird.  Has any one else seen anything similar to this??",2003-10-31T00:00:00,41.9734,-88.2065

Both craft were fast moving, much faster than a small prop plane low or a jet plane high, but much slower than a meteor. No prop or jet sound was heard. Both craft were hard to track, because again it appeared that the 'lights' on the craft were more reflective than self-luminous. No Northern Lights were seen all night, probably due to the skyglow from Scappoose, of which we live on the southern end. The first craft was traveling from NW to SE towards Portland. The second craft was seen about 1 minute later traveling from SW to NE. Both were seen as they travelled away from us. The first craft had a 'light' at the front and 4 or 5 on each of the swept sides, but the trailing edge, if it was there, was completely dark. The second craft had only three lights, one at the front, the others at the trailing tips. The sky last week was overcast, the sky this week was completely clear, yet neither time did we actually see a shape to these craft. The shape was determined by the placement of the lights only. They could have been triangular or chevron shaped. We both find it quite odd that with as much time as we spend outdoors at night, we have 3 sightings within a week, yet none for the previous 8 years here.

At about 9:30 tonight my husband and I heard a loud noise which brought us running outside.  Unfortunately, our eyes were not adjusted to the dark so we could not see the body of the object, which seemed to be cigar shaped.  It was just over our house when we got outside and was very low to the ground, maybe 200 feet in the air.  There were two lights (reg. airplane sized) one above the other slightly tilted with the upper light being forward in the direction it was moving.  It turned very slowly so that the lights were eventually horizontal to one another.  It was much too large to be a helicopter.  I would say the size was about that of a large passenger plane.  However, it did not sound like a passenger plane nor could one fly this slowly.  I had enough time to run into the house get the binoculars, turn off all of the lights and still watched it for another 10 minutes.  It seemed to hover over the mountain for about 5 of those minutes.  There was another small white light near it while it was hovering, and I thought it to be a small airplane.

He said ""it was like something passed in front of the sun, like someone or something walked by the window and blocked out the sun, a giant shadow!""

I clearly know the diference between a star, planet, airplane or satelite. Then suddenly I saw many lights approaching from the NNE and moving in straight line to the SSW. I could only see them in the darker part above me because the lower horizons were too polluted by residential lighting. The only thing I saw were lights, I didn't see any shape that connected them. The amount of lights were somewhere between 40 and 70. The majority was shaped in a V-shape. Outside this V-shape there were also a few that formed a straight line. Then there were a few seemingly randomly spreaded around. There was no sound, also not after they had dissappeared for 5 minutes. The lights were white and if not for the moving they seemed just like stars. All the lights (V-shape, straight line and the randomly spreaded) didn't move relatively to each other. It seemed they were flying in formation. At first I thought they were many single objects. The next morning I realized that they could have been the lights of a single object. Because I don't have any clue of how far the lights were I also cannot say anything about the size of the object. If they were all connected the total shape was much larger then an airplane used for intercity flightsthat usually flies at 3 to 4 km height. Although I'm 100% conviced that this is pure coincidence the following is worth mentioning: After the lights dissapeared over the SSW there also entered a local airplane from the NNE which headed in the direction of W where the local airport of Taichung city is. This is quite normal because every 10 or 15 minutes one can spot one. Again the lights and the airplane were not observed at the same time. The airplane showed up after the lights had dissappeared.",2003-08-28T00:00:00,,

It was not, the moving star/object continued to move downward, then the star/object got very bright, a very bright white with a hint of blue, it became brighter then any other star in the sky.

I had to stop and ask myself, what did I just witness.  I started laughing and told myself, no that was the after burner of a military jet, then I looked towards the NE and saw a second very bright star, and the same event happen but this one seemed closer to the horizon and closer towards me.  It became brighter then the first one, again a very bright white, it moved off towards the NE.  I am very sure that what I saw was not a military jet.

We decided to move around the house to the northside where we could just skywatch for awhile longer. From this vantage point, away from the dusk to dawn light, we could see the Milky Way and some of the constellations. In the distance was a bank of clouds and heat lightning. About half the sky was clearly visible to us and the moon had not risen. There was no wind blowing. At the time of this sighting, I had turned my gaze to the west and was looking for meteors, when my family member exclaimed, ""WHAT is THAT?"". When I turned around, she was pointing to a spot just in front of us and high up. At that time, I saw nothing but stars. She went on to say, ""There was a bright flash of  light and then it went out.""  As I kept searching the area she was pointing in, she continued, ""It didn't have any blinking lights.""(referring to navigational lights). Since I didn't have my watch on at that time, I would have to guess that it was approximately 20 seconds from the first time she spotted the light until I saw it. It seemed to blink on again almost in the same location she had been pointing out to me. In a spot where nothing had been visible previously. This time, the light had a definite circular shape and slightly blue. Not the bright white flash she first saw. It was on for a split second and then went out. I ran into the house to get the binoculars and check the time. We searched the sky, but saw nothing else. At one point,  a thin haze of clouds moved over that portion of the sky, so we gave up looking. Neither one of us observed any vapor trails or any indications that it was a meteor. There was no aircraft noise. I checked with the data base tonight of the iridium satellites and found that one was in the area at 21:18. What we saw happened later. I'm a nurse by profession, an amateur skywatcher, and have some knowledge of aircraft, having lived around airports and air force bases in the past. Thanks!

The witness told me what her family member did see was certainly a jet. All of a sudden the witness saw what she thought was a shooting star just to the north of the jet but a lot higher up. She says it started out like a shooting star but then there was a flash of white light and then it happened again approx: 20 seconds later and another flash. They both stood wondering if this may have been another jet as this one was going in a northwesterly direction. But as the witness watched she mentioned that the intervals weren't the same as a jet airliner. (meaning the flashing of the jets lights). It then disappeared and then in another 20 to 30 seconds there was another flash of light.  The witness says this is where it gets a bit odd and figured it wasn't another jet that she was aware of. Thinking maybe it was something the military was flying overhead. She saw a flash in front of the object and it reminded her of a laser light. She also said you could see the light zapping a good distance in front of the object. It again disappeared and in another 50 seconds or so later there was another flash of light.

When we both got out of our trucks, we both immediately looked up to the South West sky and couldn’t believe what we were seeing. We immediately ran towards the open fields out back to get a better look and we saw a bright light, bright as a star, moving west to east across the mountain ridgeline with what looked like two aircraft following it.  The light began to move erratically and then disappeared like in a second’s time. The two aircraft, which I can’t really call them jets, continued East bound and then both turned and went up in elevation and began to head north right over us. As me and w#2 were looking at the aircraft coming towards us, we had the most weirdest feeling that something is going on ....verrry strange.  The two aircraft had lights on them and the one to the right had a more common look to it. The aircraft on the left was larger and had more lights of which many were on and different colors. They seemed to be changing position throughout the pass over. As the aircrafts came directly over us, we noticed that first of all, everything was silent and as we watched them the one on the left seemed to have a reddish glow in front of it and it was hard to stay focused on because it appeared to be changing shapes or something. It, to me, had a mutli shape to it something like the Star Trek Enterprise. w#2 said it looked like a shape of a stingray. Just as the aircraft passed by over us at a very slow pace, we noticed that the aircraft on the right had somehow disappeared and the strange looking one on the left, began to change it’s lights and the back of it had two bright lights that began to move in towards each other and then began moving apart and moved apart enough that the shape of the craft seemed to have changed.  We were amazed that we heard absolutely nothing! Not even noises of vehicles or anything. It was very tranquil as if we were in a dream or something. At this point, 7:41 pm, I made a phone call and w#3 was alerted. Me and w#2 then were saying to each other, “I can’t believe this just happened“. Then a moment later, the bright light appeared almost right over us, much closer this time and we held upon to each other’s shirts and watched this light, that was still for a moment, while saying over and over again, “Oh My God, Oh My God,“ The bright object then began to make a few moves and then it began to travel from West to East and simply disappeared. W#3 immediately looked outside and apparently he witnessed the one aircraft and observed that it did not look like a jet, while moments later, he witnessed the bright light travel fast from West to East. He then came down with an instant severe head ache. Myself and w#2 did not experience any type of headache.  While we were looking to the East basically at Mars and the almost full moon, we were just so numb to as what just happened and then we noticed an enormous amount of air traffic in all directions in the sky. We both said, where did all these come from? Then a moment later, while looking back at the moon, a jet comes from the Northeast heading Southwest and left a fat lingering contrail right in the path of the moon. I immediately said, “Now, with all the strange stuff that just happened, what the heck is the reason for that?”  Then at around 8pm the skies were back to normal with no air traffic. The entire event lasted maybe about 30 minutes of which me and w#2 both left of our doors to the trucks open out in the driveway and they were both dinging the whole time. Even though it lasted almost thirty minutes, the entire time felt like no more than two minutes.  This event prompted me to write about it to the Conway Daily Sun with contact numbers and email and my letter appeared in Friday’s edition. I have since received approximately 12 phone messages, 8 emails, and 3 actual phone conversations.  Apparently, we had a similar event take place the next night, on Thursday, when apparently the aircraft that was tracking this light or fireball, tried to keep up with it, from which possibly they caused two different sonic booms and many people then, thought something is very wrong.  these are just some of the eyewitness’s without knowing my story  One woman called me Friday morning from Effingham and said she was out for a walk and she saw what looked like a fireball or something go screaming by West to East and then moments later two jets heading in the same direction.  I had reports from a man in Woonsocket village in West Ossipee about a sonic boom he heard and then another one shortly after, then as he went outside to look if he could see anything, he didn’t, but he heard jet engines for about two minutes or so.  A women in Edelweiss about a boom that “rocked her house“, she thought “this is it, were going”.  She was told by her association that it was probably a sonic boom that happens occasionally here  She did hear other booms about 20 minutes later but they were off in a distance.  I had another man from Madison tell me that he heard just a massive explosion that shook his well built house and all was quiet with no sirens or any sign of an emergency. He didn’t know what happened..   I then had a women who was walking near the high school and said, “she saw two air craft. One had it’s normal flashing lights, and right above it, there was another something flying, had maybe two or three lights and it was maybe a little ways ahead of the plane, it was pretty strange and I wasn’t sure that I was seeing things myself.”  A man from Bartlett asked me if it was a light moving against all laws of physics?  Another Bartlett man saw the light and looked away for a second or so, and it was gone.  A man from Berlin had a bad dream Wed. night that his house was visited by a UFO and now he is just curious what did happen down in our neck of the woods... He’s never had anything like that happen to him before. He’s not a reporter but he would like to know what went on. He believes that stuff like that can happen .  A women in North Conway saw the event  A women from Chatham saw it, but wouldn’t tell me until I told her.  Another women and four other fellow workers in North Conway who witnessed a silvery strange looking thing over the Moat Mountains.       I don't know if this is what u saw but this is what my friend and I saw from The Vista in Inter vale that night and it was probably a little later then 7:30...closer to 9:30 till maybe 10... My friend and I work in retail and we usually go to the Vista after work and talk and relax...We are there quite a bit and have seen some interesting events should I call them in the skies over Bartlett and surrounding areas.......but Wednesday night was totally different.....There seem to be as we were sitting in my friends vehicle that above the mtns straight ahead of us and above was an object that ""hovered"" for a very long time it flashed colored lights and seemed from the distance that we were seeing it go in a track not in circles but like a square or rectangle. and it would do much like a hover-craft bob up and down but all of a sudden we saw flashes of ground light from behind the mtns or seemed to be anyway. We must have watched that thing for a good 15 min just doing what it was doing and then it began to descend behind the mtns and it dropped quickly and then totally disappeared out range...My friend and I left quite perplexed...because we had never seen anything like that before......not at the Vista anyway...and that leads me to another part of this.....my friend and her brother watched something from her window Thursday night...she said she saw a plane a jet and it seemed to be chasing a ""light"" in the sky far ahead of it...the light would appear and disappear it seemed to be going at a tremendous rate of speed....she said there were two Sonic booms that shook her house and everything in it! And she wanted to know if any one else had reported that BOOM! She lives in Madison,NH........Please email me back I would love to know what u saw...and if she and I witnessed anything like you and yours did? I was so excited to see someone had seen something that I couldn't believe ....... My  daughter told me that you have seen things in the sky before and if you say you did you probably did! I have no doubt in my mind of that!  Have a great day and keep in touch with me please we could compare notes I am sure.........  A fellow believer,  Hi, I saw your letter in the paper regarding strange events in the sky  Wednesday evening. Well, what my daughter and I saw was before sunset  and it  was in the west, northwest sky and not a cloud in the sky except for  this  very strange, almost looked like a crescent shaped cloud, but it was  very  odd looking and both my daughter and I were like, What the heck is  that? It  was driving us nuts. We were on our way to Hannaford's to do some  shopping  and when we came out it was dark and we could not find the object  again.  Although, I think my daughter said she saw it.     Hello,  I am sending this email in response to your letter sent in to the  Conway Daily Sun. Something....odd seemed to happen last night.  It was around 7:45-8:00, when we heard a large crash that shook  the house. It almost seemed the window in the living room was  going to fall out of place. We had no idea what happened, so we  ran to get flashlights and ran outside.  Immediately we heard a plane, but it seemed closer then usual. We  looked up and saw a moving light, we presumed a plane. So we went  around the property, looking for whatever happened. You'd think it  wouldn't be that big of a deal normally. Except the shockwave was  so sudden and intense we both seemed to have a bad feeling about  it.  We didn't find anything, but a few strange occurrences happened.  First of all, we live in Madison, and the most air traffic we get  is 1 plane a week. Last night we heard, at least, 4 air planes in  less then an hour. One of which was like one we had never seen  before. It had 2 very rapid flashing lights that flashed from the  wing and belly.  Also, one of my our friends also heard the same thing. They seemed  to experience the 'Shockwave' that rattled the windows, but  nothing else.  Finally, one of our friends that live in Conway experienced  nothing, so it seems very 'centralized' to where we are.  We don't think it could be an earthquake, as it felt more like an  impact. Not sure if has anything to do with your sighting, but  it's too coincidental to ignore. Perhaps they are connected.  If you think there IS some connection, let us know.  Thanks    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  3 of us saw this light show...it was fun to watch see ya around the town",2003-10-15T00:00:00,,

Just as I was saying that my friends shouted ""LOOK A UFO"" and we both saw a circle shaped flying object just where I was pointing, coming out of nowhere with great speed with first a bright aura white light that later turned red midway in air, the craft then slowed than from it´s incredible speed and then just vanished in the clear sky. We where shocked and started to figure out every possible explanation to what we had just wittnessed, we told eachother that it could have been a metroid (sp?) or a starfall although it was much closer and could both slow down and accelerate. It clearly felt that they where listening to our conversation since they showed up just as we where talking about them. Just to see if if we possibly where right that they could hear us I turned up to the sky and said that ""if you really heard what we said and wanted to show us that you exist, then please I beg you, show yourselves one more time so that we can be sure"". We kept looking at the stars a couple of minutes as another one appeared in the sky above us flying with great speed leaving a yello trail after itself and then dissapearing as well. As soon as it appeared I yelled ""LOOK ANOTHER ONE"" and my friends said ""YES YES I SEE IT, I SEE IT"". The other one was not as close to us as the first was as the first one was flying at cloud level and the other clearly above but still very visible. They appeared in diffrent locations in the sky and diffrent heights. We are 100% certain that they where not airplanes or anything natural, they where flying objects and they seemed to communicate with us just by showin themselves in the sky as we talked about them and with them. Had it only happened once we would probably have tried to find a ""normal!

I just received a report today and I must say this one is a strange one, but interesting. Four witnesses who were near the Driftwood fossil beds just outside of Smithers British Colombia watched a strange looking object for approx: 10 minutes.  The object was described as being very flat (almost looking like a wing of an aircraft), silver in color and very long. It appears the sun was reflecting off it, as it was shinning very brightly. One of the witnesses described the tips of the object as being like a jet's wing tips, slightly bent upwards. The witnesses told me the object stayed stationary in one spot, but from time to time it did move from side to side. The fellows also noted that there was a line of red lights running along the object. The folks watched the lights move from the tips of it into the center of the object then disappear. The red lights continued the same pattern over and over again while it sat stationary.  As the object was leaving the area where it was first located, it grew smaller and smaller due to it moving into the  distance. But before they lost sight of it,  they noticed that it started growing in size, and all the witnesses said it grew some 3 to 4 times larger then just vanished. In other words it just blinked out.

For about a year or so, I have started to notice objects in sky that look like stars, but they don't ""twinkle"" like other stars, and they don't have a steady glow like planets.  These ""stars"" have a very refined, sharp light, not soft like stars. The lights have a very sharp contrast like a strobe light or laser light.  With the naked eye, one can tell that these objects oscillate between red, white, and blue colors.  With binoculars, I noticed that it APPEARS that the blue light is a steady glow in the upper left and upper right ""corners"" of the object.  The red light appears to be a steady glow in the lower right ""corner"" and the white seems to be flashing from the center. (NOTE: it's very difficult get binoculars in a steady enough position to view these things clearly.  I need a telescope) In the past couple of weeks, I have taken a notice to just how many there really are.  I see 4 of these stars in the Northeastern sky, spread pretty far apart, I see 3 in the Northwestern sky in a triangular pattern, and 3 in the Southwestern sky, in a straight line. I don't think these objects are geosynchronous satellites, because they are staionary like other stars.  Thier referenced positions change with the rotation of the Earth.  Because of where they are positioned, they never pass overhead with the planet's rotations, and all of them stay somewhat close to the horizon. If these are satellites, why would they have visible lights on them? I have a friend in Charlotte, who is 30 miles south of me, is able to see these objects.  My wife and my parents have seen them, as well. I would love to know how many other stargazers have noticed this, and if anyone has a good explanation, because right now, I really don't think these are stars.",2003-09-24T00:00:00,35.57407703349283,-80.8602961722488

I'm a little uncomfortable writing this.  I like the idea of aliens and all that, but I tend to be skeptical about the whole thing.  I got out of my car and headed toward my apartment door.  I was looking at the sky, a habit of mine, looking at stars and looking for comets.  At first I noticed nothing at all, then I must've blinked or looked away for a moment, but all of a sudden a star seemed to be particularly bright--and large.  If all the stars around it looked like periods on a paper, this one looked like the lower-case letter ""o"" beside a regular period. (o.)  I didn't know what in the world it was, but then it began to get very large, as if coming closer to me.  It got to the size that I don't think I could've blotted it out with a nickel if I held it out at arms length.  I don't know how to describe the appearance other than a ball of light.  I didn't notice anything that seemed at all metallic or fire-like.  Just a big ball of extremely bright light, I can't emphasize how bright this was.  It was at this large size for only about two seconds it seemed, and I pushed the door open to call for my wife to come see.  Right as I pushed the door, it began to get a little smaller--and then the speed at which the size decreased became incredibly fast.  At last I found myself looking at a small dot, and eventually it vanished.  There was no sound at all that I could hear coming from it.  It did seem as if, if possible, the ojbect's ""brightness"" pulsed once it paused after moving toward my area.  That is, once it flew toward me and paused, there were two very quick pulses of extra brightness and then it flew away.  The thing is, it was so bright before the two short pulses, it's hard to imagine that it could've gotten any brighter.  I have no idea what this was.  It could've been some rare terrestrial phenomena, I don't know.  The only thing I can say is that it was not a plane, jet, helicopter, or balloon.  It wasn't something that we see flying around in the sky.  I don't know what the thing was.  I'd like to know if anyone else around here saw it.  Maybe the light of a burst star reached our planet, whatever it was I'm dying to know.  Speculating is only driving me crazy.  Area of occurance: I live in a small apartment complexe.  As far as I know, I was the only person standing outside.  However, there must've been people all around this area who saw it.  Surely I wasn't the only one standing outside looking at the sky.  There's a busy road not far from where I live, all one would have to have done to see it from a moving car going east is to look out the right side of the car.  Someone else must've seen this thing.",2003-11-26T00:00:00,38.3633,-81.8089

Only much much faster and farther out. I followed it for a moment, and then noticed it split into two. I shook my head and refocused the lense, and saw it again, still two. Now following parallel to each other at a speed I have never seen a satelite fly. Then it did something strange, it would come back into one, then split out into two, heading about a 45 degree angle away from each other, then come back to parallel each other. But sometimes they would jump backwards, as if my vision jumped. Only, they did it a few times. I would keep my eyes off center, and keep a major star in focus and steady to jude the movement of the objects. They were definately jerkish and would shoot out fast then come back a little then join together and head out. I followed them until out of sight, about 3 minutes in all. They made the other sattelite seem slow like an airplane, but I have been watching sattelites long enough to know the difference. Plus I fly. This thing was in my estimation about twice the distance of the sattelite I was watching, very faint, but clear enough to see it's movements. This was no sattelite. Moving at 90 degree angles, 45 degree angles in a split second. It was quite amazing. I truely hope some day, I see them again. It was remarkable.

I live at the elevation of 2400 ft and this was well above that. I was viewing it from a high open unobstrcted ridge. It was not moving and that was the reason I noticed it so much.

The video footage of this event of Jan 21,04 is astounding.  In freeze framing the video by way of milli seconds I have been able to see things which I could not see that night by my naked eyes. The computer enables me to not only freeze a milli second but to blow it up much larger to see just what it is or might be. There is a series of photos that I can only describe as the  fireball spliting up into many smaller balls of light all attached in a long rod like formation of 11 balls of various pastel colors of light and then it goes into a progression of from 11 balls of light to 10 to 8 to 4 to 2 to one the fireball shape. It does this a few times where it goes from a long rod of attached balls of light to a single fireball of light.  This is incredible and it happens so fast it could not be seen until the video was freeze framed.  In other photos is is obvious that the solid white interior of the fireball is moving very fast because it changes it position and angle continually. There is another unexplainable part of this footage that puzzels me. In the bottom of the screen there is a very small dancing ball of light that at first I dismissed because it was so small in comparison to the main fireball . This tiny ball of light moves from side to side and and then at the end of the video the main fireball seems to disappear and reappear at the bottom of the screen very small with the other very small ball of light. It seems to be communicating with that tiny ball of light. We could not see this tiny ball of light with the naked eye that night of the sighting.

We assumed it was a police helicopter because the lights at first were only red and blue flashing lights.  This was around 4:30 AM and the lights started flashing in this order, red, blue, green, and yellow very very quickly.  I told him that I was going to go wake up my girlfriend so that she could prove that we were not seeing things!  He woke his wife and I woke my girlfriend and at first, they thought It was Mars but mars was directly behind us.  As we all starred together we noticed it started moving quickly then slowly then it appeared to get close then far, but it only stood in a certain section of the sky.  At around 5:00 AM it went out like a candle light, but for whatever reason it reappeared.  We were tired so we went to sleep. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a ""twinkling"" star would be the first possibility that would have to be ruled out, before we could accept that the object was a ""bona fide"" UFO.

We were staying on the east/south east side of the island. Sitting on the beach at about 10-10:30 pm we all four noticed what we thought were 2 falling stars traveling downward from north-west to east-south-east at approximately a 50-60 degree angle. We watched these white stars/lights fall for several (5-8)seconds, long enough for everyone to comment how cool it was to see 2 falling stars at the same time traveling parrell to one another. Then, faster than I have ever seen any object in the sky move before, these 2 light-objects simultaneously changed direction and headed upward (south) at approximately a 120+ degree angle, ""bowed-out"" away from each other then joined back parallell to each other, then in what was literally a blink of an eye the lower-left object shot outward (east) at an approximate 95-110 degree angle away from the 2nd object, then both objects were gone. As the four of us were discussing what we'd just witnessed and debating what the objects could have been, a single light came out of the sky from the south heading northward and shot across the sky in a waivering-undulating pattern.

When we were going back to where I am from (that's Elizabeth, New jersey) the bus lights went off so that everyone could sleep (it was 6:40 when we left) My mom and I tryed to sleep but couldn't, at the end my mom fell asleep but I kept looking out the window. Finally I got some sleep and woke up about 8:40 or 8:48 PM. It was night and the sky was dark, wind was blowing from the looks of it (All the windows were closed) and the cars were passing by fast. When I look at the sky, I see the moon and far away from it one star, one lonely star, I told my mom and she looked at it. Indeed it was a star... but then all of a sudden two flashing lights appear above it, way above it. The lights were blinking and I didn't take them for importance because I thought they were planes... but then 3 more appeared to the left of them, below them. I was surprised and started watching closely... Not wanting to tell my mom because she was sleeping. One of the lights that appeared earlier stopped blinking and become very bright, then went upwards into the sky, VERY fast. It was going fast and far away into the clouds. By this time I didn't think it was a plane... They had no sound (but we had the windows closed so we couldn't know.) Then the other 2 that appeared earlier went right, very fast and the others who appeared later stopped blinking and disappeared completely... Anyways... they disappeared and I went back to sleep, then woke up again and was (8:58 PM) ...and the freaking bus still didn't make it to Elizabeth... when I look out the window, there was a blinking light... and it was going down on some bushes/forest. I looked closely and 3 more blinking lights appeared near it and went upwards then to the right and finally disappeared into the clouds... I made my mom look and she was surprised that anything could move like that... There was also two jet-like planes (or maybe the same lights but closer?...) that were chasing those lights.. They were only two and they passed right above the bus... they moved like planes... so I thought they were jet-planes... they disappeared into the clouds in the direction of the ""light"" objects. I just shrugged and went back to sleep. By the time I woke up we were already back. Personally, I have never seen such sighting in my life. I mean... Maybe sometimes I see a ball of light moving then disappearing but I have never seen groups and appearances like that... I was scared! hehe... We got out of the bus, bought something to eat, went home, ate and we slept happily ever after... Then I woke up and came to this site... started writing.

On August 29, 2003 at 10:30 PM I was traveling east to west on SE Division St. in Gresham Oregon, towards Portland. The sky was clear and cloudless At the corner of Hogan and Division I noticed an unusually bright light to the west.  At first I thought it might be an airplane, but it was not traveling on a flight path that would have taken it to or from the Portland International Airport.  Continuing on Division St. I noted that the light had not moved, and what I first took for a plane was actually stationary. I could now see that in addition to the bright white light, a smaller blinking red light was visible parallel to the white light. Was it a helicopter hovering? I live about three miles from where this light was and am familiar with the area, and I knew that there was no antennae tower of any kind on this hill that would account for a stationary light. On August 29, 2003 at 10:30 PM I was traveling east to west on SE Division St. in Gresham Oregon, towards Portland.  At the corner of Hogan and Division I noticed an unusually bright light to the west.  At first I thought it might be an airplane, but it was not traveling on a flight path that would have taken it to or from the Portland International Airport. Continuing on Division St. I noted that the light had not moved, and what I first took for a plane was actually stationary. I could now see that in addition to the bright white light, a smaller blinking red light was visible parallel to the white light. Was it a helicopter hovering? I live about three miles from where this light was and am familiar with the area, and I knew that there was no antennae tower of any kind on this hill that would account for a stationary light. The closer I got to the light I could definitely tell it was not moving at all.  I decided to find the first turn to the left (south) to see how close I could get.  I had my digital camera with me and it was my intention to photograph.  I turned from Division onto NW Angeline St. (southbound)  The street was lined with many tall fir trees and I could still see the light intermittently through the trees. Hoping to hear if what I was seeing was just a hovering helicopter, I turned off the radio and fan, and rolled down all of the car windows. I contiuned south on Angeline until I came to NW 5th where I then turned left (east). Now I had a very clear view of the object.  I could now see that it was triangular in shape with two bright lights on two of the corners and the red light was on the third corner. Luckily I wasn't the only one to see this thing. Two men who were standing on the left side of the street (NW 5th) were looking up at the object.  Further down the street, a car was slowly moving toward the object with the driver looking up towards the triangle.  Two girls, who were running down the street behind the car, were also looking up and pointing. With the windows rolled down, I tried to hear what, if any sound the object was making.  It was absolutely silent.  Over the years I have seen Police, News, and Rescue helicopters flying all over the Portland area.  If this were a helicopter hovering over a quiet residential neighborhood it would have been terrifically loud at its altitude.  The most striking thing besides the silence, was the incredible stability of the object.  It sat so still you would think it was affixed to the top of a tower. Helicopters hovering have a bit of wobble and drift, however slight.  This was rock solid.  I can't stress this point enough. I have seen pictures of the Phoenix lights, the Belgium Triangle, Lubbock lights, etc, and this was very similar.  While it was not possible from my point of view to discern surface details, it appeared to be very large (fifty to one hundred feet or more across) and an equilateral triangle.  Since I was looking up at the object, it was not possible to estimate the height or thickness of the triangle. As I moved further east on NW 5th, the triangle suddenly started to move. It may have been a reaction to so many people all moving towards it at once. But it may have been a coincidence. It pivoted on its center to face to the Northeast.  As is turned it began to accelerate.  Again, it was absolutely silent.   And what was the most striking was the weirdly perfect precision of the turn.  Not like a helicopter that will wobble slightly while turning, then tilt forward to accelerate.  This move reminded me of the too precise way a computer simulation can be. (If done wrong)  In film and television computer animation, an animator will intentionally add small bumps, tilts, or wobbles to make the animation seem more ""real"" or lifelike.  This thing turned and began moving in one smooth perfect motion.  If an animator produced a motion like this, it would be rejected as too smooth and fake looking. I tried to follow it by taking the next available left turn (onto Towle Rd) and continued north.  The street was lined with fir trees and it was rapidly moving to the NE making it difficult to see.  Towle road has numerous speed bumps, so it was not possible to keep up.  As I reached Division St. (the street I was originally travelling on when I first sighted the object) I could see two bright white lights of the back of the triangle.  The red light was no longer visible, so I assumed it was either off, or that it was on the corner pointed away from me.  (Was it the 'front'?)  I turned left on Division St. and was now traveling east to west again.  As there are houses and trees along this part of Division it was difficult to keep track of the triangle.  As I approached the intersection of Birdsdale and Division I could see that it was now what appeared to be two to four miles away moving faster to the NE.  If it continued in that direction it would have come very close to Portland International Airport and the Air National Guard.  Within a few seconds it was gone from sight.  It was now 10:37. I am certain it was not a plane or helicopter.  The complete lack of any sound would rule those out as possibilities. A Harrier Jet might be able to stay relatively still and then accelerate something like this did, but not stay completely motionless.  Plus the Harrier is quite loud hovering. Was it a blimp or some sort of balloon?   Even blimps and balloons hovering make some movement.  This was sitting rock steady in one spot.  And the speed at which it accelerated would have required some sort of jet or prop engine.  This was silent.  Absolutely, completely silent.

A full report has been submitted in writing to P. Davenport and to MUFON.  A second independent witness was located who apparently saw the same object.  This is a probable unconventional or unidentified aerial object (UFO).   Although conventional aircraft were positively in the area, this is near the PDX approach pattern, and also near the Troutdale airport.  Conventional aircraft are in this area all the time, and local residents are accustomed to seeing them.  One witness also observed and clearly identified a commercial airliner that flew over minutes after the sighting of the unknown object.  Both witnesses agree on basic details, essentially that a triangular object with lights near the corners, hovered over a residential area at well under 1,000 feet (the FAA mandated minimum altitude above terrain).  This craft hovered silently for several seconds, then departed rapidly in a northerly or northwesterly direction.  Full report (minus witness identities) available on request.

Lasted about 45 minutes. I went outside, to my backyard, at approximately 12:15 AM. I was sitting on a chair on my deck, facing east, towards Bellmore, when I noticed an elliptical shaped light/object moving at a high rate of speed across the sky, followed by another. It was not a shooting star, as I have seen those before. These were much, much larger! The objects were behind a haze that was in front of the objects. The sky had some cloud cover, but there was also clear patches of sky. The objects had a haze/halo in front of them, even in the portions of the sky that were not cloudy. At first, they passed in a straight line, with a short distance between them. One of them was brighter than the others, at times. They were larger, very much larger, than an aircraft. I called my husband to see them, and after about 2 seconds, he promptly dismissed the lights as the type of lights at a grand opening, and he went to bed. However, there was no beam going up to where the objects were, and the objects were not rounded, as grand opening large beams of light. I have seen grand opening beams, but never like what I witnessed in the sky, on Saturday night. I began to time the lights in the sky, to see if there was any kind of pattern to their movements, but there was no pattern. Another object then joined the other two, and several minutes later, a fourth object joined them. They appeared to be following each other. At this point, I didn’t think much of it, but my curiosity riveted me to the spot, as I have never seen anything like it in my life.  I live on the water, on the wide estuary that separates Merrick from Bellmore, a few hundred feet down from where Newbridge Park meets the water, so I had a clear view, with no tree line to obstruct my vision. The objects then switched from flying in more or less a straight line, to doing what I can only term as insane acrobatic type movements. They were individually zigzagging, diving, and going every which way, in steep ascents and descents. They weren’t following each other, at this point, but each doing *their own thing*. I watched as they came together (all 4 objects seemed to meld into one), for a few seconds, and then they split apart and began diving, climbing, and crossing the sky in a way I have never seen anything fly, dive, climb, in my entire life. This scenario kept being repeated.  I phoned the police, to see if there were any events that might have large lights being beamed into the sky. The police had no knowledge of any events, nor would such events be permitted at such a late hour, due to local ordinances. I went back outside and continued to watch the scenario playing before my eyes, totally fascinated. I did not feel fear, nor did I feel any strange sensations, other than an amazing curiosity. I called the police about 15- 20 minutes later, asking if anyone else had reported seeing what I saw, but no one reported it. (They probably thought I was nuts-I was beginning to think so, myself!) They asked if I wanted a car to come to my home, but I declined, as there was nothing to be done about whatever it was that was in the sky, and they would assume I was a real nut case.. Two airplanes flew over my house during this time, one small plane, and one commercial jetliner. That only served to confirm that what I was seeing was not an airplane.  The lights were as different in size and shape, as night and day, as was the altitude.  I grabbed a regular flashlight, and one of those powerful beam flashlights, to see if I could duplicate what I was seeing, with the idea that perhaps it was kids playing with flashlights, across the water. With both the regular flashlight, and the beam flashlight, I could not shine a beam up without seeing the path of the beam. In another words, I saw a trail of light on the beam going up, as I was shining it, whereas, whatever was up there, had no beam leading up to it.  What ever the heck it was that I saw, seemed to be creating its own light. Furthermore, the light from the flashlight and the beam light would not go even a fraction as high as the light that was coming from these objects.  My next thought was heat lightening, but this was not like any heat lightening I had ever seen. These were individual, specific lights, despite the halos around them. Heat lightening crossed my mind, as a possibility, due to the haze/halo around the objects, but then realized heat lightening was quite different than what I was observing, not being individual lights.  About 12:45 I went upstairs and got into bed. My 6-foot bedroom casement windows faced the area of the sky in which the acrobatics were taking place, so I watched from my bed. At 1:08 A.M, I became so fascinated by what I was observing, that I decided to get my binoculars, so I could try to see more clearly, to try to solve the mystery that was playing out before my eyes. I went downstairs to get my binoculars, but when I came back upstairs, the objects had vanished.  I am a mature adult, a 58-year-old woman, and had no drinks at dinner or after dinner, other than a diet coke. I rarely ever have a drink, and then, only a beer, on occasion. I feel like a fool reporting this, but I know what I saw, and have never seen anything like it in my entire life. I sure wish someone could find a rational explanation for what I observed.. I have not seen the objects again, since Saturday night, but I will tell you that I am very hesitant to go outside again, alone, late at night, after what I witnessed. I wasn’t afraid, then, as my curiosity left no room for fear, that night, but now, I would not be comfortable being alone outside, late at night. I sure as heck hope you will tell me someone had an opening event with weird lights, despite the local ordinances, but I truly do not believe this was the case...",2003-09-04T00:00:00,40.6632,-73.553

I have a large window over the bathtub facing the Northwest and I like to look at the stars. At approximately 10:40 pm., a glowing white ball dropped from the sky. It did not descend at an angle as meteorites tend to do, nor did it have a green cast. It was absolutely white and it came straight down at very high speed with a white tail of light behind it. It appeared to be fairly close by in that I could see that the object was round. Looking at a map the next day, I determined the exact area my window faces.

On the evening of Nov. 8, 2003, during the lunar eclipse, my husband and I were viewing the moon from our front yard with the naked eye. The eclipse was nearly complete with just a sliver left of regular lunar reflection, around 6:40 Mountain Time. We both saw the boomerang shaped object which was backlit by the eclipsed moon. It appeared in the lower right-hand quadrant of the moon, slightly inward on the radius between the 6 and 5 o'clock positions and moving in a slight arch downward and out of the moon's light. It took at least a minute to traverse this space. In size from side to side of its shape, we estimate it to be around 1/6 the moon's diameter. It was impossible to tell where in the viewing space the object could have been located. It could have been anywhere in our upper atmosphere or in the space between the moon and ourselves as we viewed. The outline of the dark object was more fuzzy than starkly defined as well. After at least a full minute of viewing as the object moved extremely slowly, it disappeared into the surrounding blackness of the night sky. Our atmospheric conditions on that night were absolutely crystal clear and we are located at above 7,000 ft. altitude.  Could it have been an owl we saw backlit by the moon? The movement was archlike so it may be a possibility. The lines were so diffuse around the edges of the object, however, and the shape of the object so consistently formed that we doubted an owl could have produced such an image. The curved longest side of the boomerang had an unnatural curvature totally unlike that of an owl's lines in flight and the speed was too slow to account for an owl's closer distance in our viewing field. Could it have been a plane? No, unless our government is working on a new class of secret boomeranged shaped craft. Always a possibility.  I am a former teacher and my husband owns his own business. We were clear of mind and had not imbibed any alcohol or altering substances. We are in our late 40's.",2003-11-11T00:00:00,38.861478298238076,-104.78039776536313

There was a lunar eclipse in NJ tonight, it started at 18:30 and was fully covered at 20:05.  My boyfriend and I were standing out in a field in Bridgewater, NJ.  There was very little ground light and you could see a lot of stars.  The sky was very clear and there was very little cloud action.  The moon was about 80-90% covered and he and I were looking around.  Then he points up and says, ""Do you see that?""  I saw a very faint point of light.  It wasn't emmitting it's own light though, it was as if it was reflecting.  The light was a dark red.  The moon at no point during my watch turned red from where I was.  From what I understand, my cousin was watching from the next county over and said that the moon was an orangey-red. Anyway, the light was traveling away from the moon quite swiftly, I would saw about 40-50 mph from the ground.  Much faster than any plane that flies around here.  It was moving quickly and I lost a couple times, but it was zig-zagging.  When it would move sharply, I would pick it up again.  It was unmistakable.  The movement was very much like a bat, but it was up way too high to be a bat.  Well above cloud level.  The light zig-zagged away from the moon heading south, I believe.  It didn't come any closer towards the earth, it traveled on the same plane, you know.  It was very faint though.  And we both saw it. He said it was a UFO, that he'd seen a lot in Long Valley.  I know it wasn't a shooting or falling star, I'd seen a lot of those in the Caribbean.  He speculated it was a satellite, but I don't think those would be large enough to see from Earth.  I saw this with my naked eye and I've never seen anything like it before.  It was definitely not a plane, and I wonder if it was because of the eclipse, and the decreased amount of light that allowed us to spot it.",2003-11-11T00:00:00,40.5953,-74.6173

I was standing facing due north but staring straight up watching the stars as I waited for the dog. Out of the corner of me eye I noticed an object ""speeding"" (faster than any jet) from the southeast to the northwest in a straight line.  It was oval shaped, about the size of a pea held at arms length.  It was not brightly lit like a star, but had a dim glow, sort of close to what a flourescent light looks like at half strength before it flickers completely on.  The color was brownish red. I almost thought it may have been a balloon, but the speed it was travelling at -against the wind, which was blowing the clouds around quite a bit at that time- and the straight line it travelled in, discounted that theory.    I also thought of the possibility of a goose, but I'm not sure they fly at night and would think if a goose belly would be that visible at night then so would its wings. It looked to be roughly several hundred feet in the air, though I'm not a good judge of altitude. I watched it for about a minute until it disappeared into the swirling clouds to the nw. The entire incident was over with before I could have run inside to get a camera. The dog displayed no odd behavior, and after scanning the sky for a few minutes to see if there were any other objects, I went inside. Loveland CO is nestled just east the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. In town you might need to crane your neck to see the mountains over your neighbors roof or fence, but it's fairly close.

I sliped on my pants and went to check on my dogs. while on my way to the back of the house, I began hearing this noise, like a big airplane or something,so I then thought maybe it was some truckdriver coming by, but anyway, I went outside stood in the back yard and of course looked for the source of the yard, finding nothing. Although the noise was still there, well more like pass over, so I walked around the side of the house to the front yard and still I saw nothing (BUT STARS!!, It was clear as day) I didn't waste no more time.  I wrote it off as alow flying plane and sarted up the steps,Looked back one more time and this time I saw about 6-8 helicopter type things. the noise was still there but it sounded like it stopped,not the noise the noisemaker. the heilcopter things had a blue and red flashing light and if they were indeed helicopters, they where to high to be heard but the flashing lights could be seen good enough to tell it was a light in the front and one in the back. Now back to the big noisemaker that has stopped or landed,well first of all I knew that an airplane couldn't stop in mid air, and also there are no airports around my house. I went into the house to get my girlfriends opinion and we both came back to look.  now about two of the flashing lght things appeared to be going towards the noise and the rest are moving around like helicopters.(just hovering, but still together). then about maybe 30 sec. later and one of the flashing light things came back towards the other flashing things but this time it was moving much faster than at first. Then the group started to break up and it look like two of the flashing things stayed in spot and just flashed.  Now for someone who could give a hoot nanny bout the whole outer space subject, I can say that for last night I spent about 40 minutes of my life trying to fix a good view at Hell,I guess Either nearly dead stars or helicopters and I heard the first airplane that landed in N.W.

I am also a gulf war vet, who has pulled a lot of guard duty outside. Let me repeat I have never seen anything out of the ordinary until now!  The 1st sighting wasn't a vehicle, it was a thing.  It was reddish-brown, had a tail,  moved like a jelly-fish to elevate itself higher & higher in the air. After clearing the building it than went sideways to the right and after something shot out at it, it faded away. The 2nd sighting happened 15 mins. later.  The was a triangular shaped vehicle that a light at each point, this one is commonly seen in magazines.  The ship appeared from nowhere stated to take off in mid-air and disappeared again.  By the way there was no sound with any of these events.  I then went down to the first level to take a break.  When I return on one of the rounds, I saw object number 3.  It appeared from nowhere, floated away from me then disappeared.  At first I thought it was a plane, because of the blinking night,  but there was no sound.  As close as it was, if it were a plane it would have made sound.  Then I thought that it might be a blimp.  But there was no larger upper body.  Also, the direction of the way if floated, a plane or a blimp would not have been able to move that way.  I also thought that it could have been a helicopter, but the lights weren't right and like I said, there! was no sound.  Well that's my report. tj.",2003-09-28T00:00:00,36.13170004240882,-86.7768134860051

I had just dropped my girlfriend off at work in Ann Arbor and was heading back to our apartment in southern Ann Arbor. I was driving East on Packard St, towards Ypsilanti. Just after crossing Carpenter road, I saw a large object in the sky, just above the treeline. At first I thought it was a blimp, but when I took a second look at it, it seemed to have corners along the edges rather than a smooth curving surface of a blimp. Curious about what it was I decided to try to follow it.  Basically, describe its physical appearance, it was dark, but it was far away so I cannot describe it as any more than a silhouette. Its size was about as long as a quarter held at arms lenght, but it was very far away, maybe a mile, but I am not very good at estimating distance. It seemed rounghly rectangular or hexagonally shaped, being maybe four times longer than it was tall. Its first appearence made me think ""Blimp"" but once again, the outline had corners and it seemed a bit too large and skinny.  As I headed south on Packard, the object seemed to be vertically positioned just above the treeline. It was much farther away than the treeline as it would move slightly and sometimes be partially occluded by the trees. It also seemed to move slightly South and East. As I got closer, it seemed to become more occluded by the trees so I decided to turn South on Hewitt Rd. The object  continued to become more and more occluded by the trees. Soon, it dipped below the treeline and I was no longer able to see it and by the time I reached Ellsworth, I had lost it.  I am not sure what it was. It was too slow and too big to be an airplane, and its shape didn't seem right to be a blimp. I rarely see blimps in this area anyway, except during football games, which was not today.  I will email a drawing of the object.",2003-09-28T00:00:00,42.28027533875339,-83.73625456187895

Twinkling stars are very colorful, ((that look)) like a diamond ring, caught in a bright beam of light. Thank you for sharing the information with our Center! Cordially, Peter Davenport ((RESPONSE)) Mr. Davenport: After further observation I believe that the objects are indeed twinkling stars.  Due to light pollution in my area some of the objects I originally noticed are no longer visible, however the brightest one is visible nearly every night.  It is always located at 51 degrees north of my house, and does not move except for the rotation of the Earth.  I also took a look at my ""ufo"" through a telescope using a 5mm  objective lense, and I concluded that the object is most definately a twinkling star.  Thank you for your help in this matter.  If you have any more information on twinkling stars you would like to share, please  send me an e-mail or a hyper-link.

I looked through the flooded trees and saw what I thought was a backporch light, an orange floodlight. I mentioned to my brother the light, it was annoying me and said we should move the canoe. He just stared at the light and was practically speechless. Finally I realized why, when he brought it to me attention that we were in the main body of the resevoir, there couldn't be a house there, the light was over water. After looking at this large orange light that looked to be approximately 100 yards away a most, the light starting rising, it rose directly over our heads in a crystal clear night, never making a noise. Suddenly the orange light became a light that resembled a white floating pencil at about a 500 feet up, it only remained this way for about 10 seconds, the ""pencil"" shrank to a dot, and then it literally blasted into outer space, that's the only way to describe it. It went straight up and went from 500 feet over our heads to a fading dot in space in about 3 seconds. It never made a noise, didn't emit any color or flames after blasting off, but did leave a cloud of smoke that took about 15 minutes to dissipate. I was in a panic and shaking uncontrollably, and we left soon after. Suprisingly my brother was shaken but calm, at least calmer than me, as he claims to have seen an equally remarkable event if not more so to him, including being spotlighted by a craft and a loss of several hours of time while in North Carolina several years earlier.As farfetched as this sounded then and even now, he is very stable,never was one to make up stories, and since I know what I saw with him while fishing was the most incredible event I have ever had, the fact the he relates one sighting with the other means my brother saw something and experienced something he feels was just as remarkable if not more so years earlier. For me this was probably the most remarkable thing I have ever witnessed and am again shaking now 25 years later as I write this. It was something I have tried numerous times to reconcile in my mind over the years, to see something that I thought was a backporch light blast into space, it's something I will never get over or forget.

While that doesn't hardly justify me as a credible witness, I've been around aircraft all my life.  I work at an air station where we see everything from Cessnas to B757s.  It is my opinion that what I have seen is either not man-made or not conventionally identified per FAA regulations and as such should have been forced to land for their altitude was far greater than 500 feet.  So, to the incident...  I was talking to my mother outside while she watered plants in the front yard when I noticed a single orange light.  It didn't dawn on me that it was there until it instantly disappeared.  When I commented on it she turned around and suddenly 3 orange orbs appeared.  I could not gauge the distance except to say that we live 8 miles to the east of I-10 and these were hovering over the valley and north of Evergreen, where I work, which is 3 miles west of I-10.  As we watched they disappeared one by one.  I was tempted to get a camera, tried to get my father to see them but he was unavailable.  They disappeared after only 2 minutes.  I did not see any signs that they were man made aircraft.  They did not have strobe lights.  I heard no sound, but since I'm assuming they were at least 11 miles away I probably would not have heard a helicopter from that distance.  However, I have ruled out helicopters because if the lights had been spots, they did not go out gradually as if turning, and given the distance spots would not be focused 11 miles away, they would be focused downward, and finally why would 3 be focused in my direction.  Given the apparent distance and their apparent separation of 1 to 2 miles from each other, I would surmise that they would have to be purposely focusing on my house.  Not a likely prospect. Hence, they were not spots but simply bright lights.  But as the lights went out, I should have seen the strobes.  Also, the objects seemed to disappear in correlation with known man-made aircraft entering the same airspac! e.  Incidentally, it was a near full moon.  This was the first of two sightings, but I'll file a follow up for the second. ((NUFORC Note:  Date indicated is approximate.  Please see other report.

I was returning home from my son's cub scout meeting in Reston, Virginia.  I departed the meeting at 8 PM and arrived in the Luray/Stanley area around 09:50 PM.  There was a full moon that might and it was cloudy.  I live in Stanley, Va and have to drive through Luray on Route 340 to get to my residence.  After I passed through Luray, I then have about 9 miles to drive to my home which equates to around ten minutes.  When I passed through Luray, the speed limit is posted to increase to 55 miles per hour.  I first noticed the strange lights as I was accelerating, and I thought to myself, ""that is strange, it must be a new residence on top one of the moutains in the area because I never noticed it before.""   So I drove on and I intermittently kept glancing at these lights as they were very bright and large to be a residence.  These light kept getting my attention as I was nearing my home.  I have to turn left at the Hawksbill restaurant on Route 340 in order to get to my home. When I got to within 1.5 miles of my home, I suddenly realized that these lights were too high in the sky to be a residence on a mountaintop.  I slowed my car down to get a real good look at it.  My occupation requires me to pay attention to minute detail so my following decription of this object will be very accurate. This object was in the sky at a height of about 4,500 to 7,000 feet. (this is much higher than the surrounding mountains)  The appearance was rather strange in that I could not visually detect any outline. (no top, sides or bottom) What I did see was a series of rectangular shaped lights, emanating a burnt orange color.  The lights were not moving or spinning, just completely stationary.  The arrangement of these lights is what gave the indication of some type of craft.  The rectaglular shapes were of a very crisp appearance, in other words, the corners were very sharp.  Taking into consideration of their estimated altitude and how big they were, equates to this object being very large.  I am estimati! ng that the opject had to be at least two to three football fields in size. (600 to 900 yards)  The rectangular lights were all uniform in that the top was wider than the bottom, and the sides were the longest length.  This gave the appearance that the lights were either tapering at angle on the craft or thery were flat and were actually trapezoidal.  There were about 7 or 9 lights and the ones in the middle were much larger that the ones on each end.  This then equates to the lights giving the appearamce of being on the surface of craft and due to the sequential difference in the size of lights in the middle to the lights on each end, the craft then had the appearance of being triangular.  When I realized that I was now a witness to something highly unusual I raced home to get my camcorder, but when I came back out to take some video it was gone.  I have since did some backgound investigation on my own.  I checked the locals around the area and a few people did say that there was someting seen that night and it was directly over Elkton, Virginia.  Elkton is about 30 miles from Stanley and the direction of object I observed in relation to where Elkton is, matches up.  I then checked three local newspapers both in reading and phone calls and there was nothing reported.  I called the Elkton local police and the Elkton Sheriffs office and nothing was reported.  I wish to get anyone else whom was a witness to this event on the 10th of Sep at 10 PM over Elkton, Va that could be seen from a circular observable area estimated to have an approximate diameter of 50 miles. (This estimation of the viewing area results from my initial sighting occurring just south of Luray, Virginia.)",2003-09-17T00:00:00,38.5269,-78.4772

The speed alone canceled out the possibility of a jet, not to mention that there was absolutely no sound involved.

My friend and I were night fishing on Prien Lake at around 1:00am.  At 3:00am we moved from one spot to another on the other side of the lake. At about 3:30 my friend asked me to look above us, that he had been watching an object move around for the past 30 minutes and that he thought it was a star at first, but now he was positive that it wasn't.  I looked up to see a yellow light that seemed like it was getting closer.  Within about 5 minutes we started to see that it was changing colors. I had binoculars in my boat so we looked at the object through the binoculars.  The colors it was putting out were red, yellow, green, and a metallic.  The object seemed as though it was spinning.  It looked round at first, but then seemed as though it might be triangular as it got closer.  The whole time we watched the object it was moving in a way that no other craft known to me or my friend had ever moved.  It would shoot sideways(to the right) at a great amount of speed with no accelleration, just from stop to as fast as it could move sideways in 1 second.  Then it would shoot back the other direction(left) just as fast.  It would then shake a little and then shoot upward extremely fast.  After it would shoot upward, it would appear as if was floating back down, almost as if you dropped a feather and it swayed from side to side as it fell.  After watching this ship for about an hour and a half I started seeing a purple cloud around the craft.  I thought I had been starring at the object for to long and then my friend said that he needed to quit looking at the object because he was starting to see a purple ring around the object.  That is when I mentioned that I had been seeing a purple ring around the object for the past 15 minutes.  We started to realize that the object would only create a purple cloud around it when it would try to shoot upward.  After watching the object for about 2 hours we started thinking that it was maybe having a problem leaving the atmosphere.  The sky was clear(no clouds! ) and it was a full moon, so the visibility was excellent.  About 15 minutes after we discussed the possibility of it having problems, we saw another object come up from the West.  This object was smaller than the original object we were looking at and we actually thought it was some type of jet.  It was moving very fast toward the original object, but it was about a thousand feet or more lower than the first object.  This smaller object was flashing red and when it got below the first object we sighted it went from a fast speed, like that of a jet, to an extremely fast speed, faster than anything we had ever seen.  It shot across the sky about 10 miles or so in 1 second and then came to a complete stop.  The craziest thing about all of this is everytime either of the objects would move sideways or up and down, their was never any acceleration.  It was stop to as fast as it could possibly go and the human eye still see it move, with no acceleration.  There was also no sound.  The smaller object stayed in one spot for about 5 minutes, then it shot across the sky very quickly again toward the original object.  After it got below the original object, it shot up towards it and without stopping, headed South until it disappearred.  Then about 5 minutes later, another red flashing object appeared taking the same path as the last one.  Only this object would stop and go franticly as it headed to the first object we sighted. This third object moved stranger than the other two, but seemed to be the same as the second object we sighted.  It finally got underneath the first object we saw and it shot up toward it and then headed South until it disappeared.  Then suddenly both red objects came into view.  Both of them were on each side of the first object sighted, but not right by it, probably a couple of miles away on each side.  By now it was getting daylight and the two red objects were not visible anymore.  However, the first object we had spotted was still in the air.  It appearred to be further away now and kind of looked like a star bouncing around.  It was now about 8:30am and an airplane was coming in for a landing at the Lake Charles airport, which I thought had to have seen this activity on radar all night, but I later found out that they close all departments of the airport after 10:00pm.  This plane was coming in for a landing with its landing gear down and the original object that we had saw after 3:00am was starting to fade off to where we couldn't see it anymore.  Then the plane that was about to pass over us and land started to turn and eventually took off in the direction it was coming from, leaving us only to think that the airport had diverted this plane away.  At around 9:30am, my friend and I left the lake.  We both realize that we will never really know exactly what we saw, but I hope by posting this message, someone else will have some input on the same sighting that we had.  It just lasted too long and the sky was too clear for someone else not to have seen at least some of the activity. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

When I witnessed the event, I could not see the entire sky, merely the 30degrees in front, 90 on one side, and 30 to the right.  JasmineTheDog was in the car's passenger's seat, drowsily chasing rabbits. Interstate Highway 75 was relatively quiet between Gainesville and Valdosta.  The sky was black as pitch, or it seemed that way to my eyes that couldn’t grow accustomed to the dark because of headlights. About 40 miles north of Gainesville, the sky suddenly became a uniform eerie green (slightly bluish) color all over and lasted that way for a full 1.5 seconds. The light was not bright enough to illuminate the terrain.  Jasmine started awake and looked out the window. It seemed to flicker slightly and then, poof! it was back to black. Jasmine looked around a bit, gave me a hurt look that said she thought I had tricked her, and curled up again to sleep.  I don’t know what could have caused it. A meteor fire-ball is almost never that color, that long lasting, or that bright, from what I've seen of meteor-shower watching over the years. I didn’t hear an explosion. I know there’s some sort of mining operation (phosphate?) just off of I-75, but that is many miles away, and I can’t imagine what could generate that much light (unless they dug up a ton of pure phosphorous).  The sudden onset of light and the flicker reminded me of the glare from arc welding. ((NUFORC Note:  Web address deleted here.  Address did not work properly for us.

On our way home I looked over and saw a white light in the sky, just a medium size light that was not moving at all, I thought it was just one of those lights that guides planes, then not even in a blink of an eye it went from a medium size to big to very tiny and started moving very fast. It all happened so quickly that I didn't even have time to tell my sister what I was seeing until it had shrunk. It confused me alot and frightened her. But I didn't really think anything of it at the time so I just went home and didn't continue to watch it. And a day or so later I started hearing other people saying they had been seeing something in the sky that was a stereotypical UFO or something that would light the sky up.  Additional Information:  The sighting only lasted for about two minutes, my home was only about three houses away when I saw the object so I just ran home, went inside, and didn't really think of it till I started to hear more similar stories.  It was still light out, but just starting to get dark they sky was still blue though. It was roughly around pea size to nickel size to pretty much 'pin prick' size  It was completely still when I first noticed it, that's why I thought it was just a 'light' tower. It was a bright white light and what is odd is it stayed white.  It was nothing like I had ever seen before, nothing like a plane, satellite or shooting star.  Hope this helps.

Brian,  My friend (name deleted by HBCC UFO) sent me your message after I told him about something I had seen early Sunday Aug. 31st around 12:30 am.  We have a home on Picnic Island in Honey Harbour, Ontario.  At 12:30 AM my daughter and I were out for a short walk when the entire park lit up with a brilliant bright light.  The light had a slight green glow to it and I thought it was a car coming up the road with strange headlights until I turned around and noticed an orange/green ball of light above our heads.  As soon as we looked at it, it exploded directly above the trees beside us, when it exploded it was like a firework exploding in all directions with orange balls of fire.  I did hear a sound that is hard to explain, I believe what we saw was a bolide.  I spoke to several people around the park who had seen it and everyone saw a ball of light explode and several heard the explosion.  None of us saw any coloured lights on the object.  I hope this helps your investigation.  I would like to thank the witness for their report. Witnesses personal information deleted from this email.

A lady from Kelowna, B.C. called to report that she saw a extremely bright green light sitting along side one of the local mountains in the area. It looked so strange she went back into the families home and got her husband from the den to come out to in hopes he could make some sense of what this green light may be. From their deck they watched it for a period of time. The light disappeared in front of them. Now later that night, or in the wee hours of the morning the lady woke up as she could not sleep, went to the sliding windows which leads onto their deck and looked out. Again a bright green light was witnessed. Not in the same location it was seen earlier that evening. She then woke her husband up and he looked and he thought it may have been a satellite. But the light just sat there, they both went back to bed, so no time was given for how long the event lasted for.

As the red object became brighter, whit light pulsations were seen.  These pulsations may have been the result of its passage through clouds, estimated at some 5,000 ft.   The object was preceeded by a much smaller red object in front of it, maintaining the same degree of separation for the duration.  The objects eventually disappeared behind buildings. The sighting was very similar to that reported by us on 31 August, although in a different quadrant of the sky.

Last night I was just falling back asleep when I heard a few strange noises.  I live near the airport so just assumed them to be airplanes at first.  The noises sounded like airplanes coming in for landing, but there was no sound of engines just that of something moving through the air quickly.  I've lived near the airport most of my life, so I know these were unusual noises.  About five minutes after I first heard the noises a new noise came to me.  At first it was distant, a few blocks away, but soon it was near enough to be over my neighbors across the alley.  It sounded like something hovering.  It grew near till it was extremely loud, paused for 30 seconds to a minute and then slowly went away.  There was another similar hovering noise, but it seemed fairly distant.  Honestly I was too scared to get out of bed, not to mention too cold, so I stayed in bed for nearly 10 more minutes before I woke my fiance and told him what I had heard.  You could still hear the sound of something travelling the sky without a jet engine, but there was no more hovering.  Around 4:30 you could finally hear actual Jet engines either taking off or landing, so no more anomaly like noises for the night. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness heard, but we wonder whether it might have been the vortices in the air, generated off the tips of landing airliners.  They can be quite loud, and they are eerie in nature.  PD))",2003-10-31T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

I was on the phone with my friend when we saw this thing, so along with her siblings there were about 6 of use who saw it. It was facing south and from my direction I didn't need to tilt my head up to the sky, it was near where mars was at this point and about 5 inches to the east.  My dad called me out around 11:50 pm and it ended at 12:35. It was a cloudy night and underneath the clouds was this light that shone through and it kept doing this tiny orbit. It just kept going and going and at first it was the same tiny orbit but as time went on the course would change slightly and it got bigger and bigger and it seemed that towards the end another object joined the course.  It couldn't have been a light from earth because there was no stream of light and where there was no cloud you couldn't see anything, But where there was a thick cloud cover you couldn't see anything either so if there were a light it would show.  Also the past week my dad would see lights going from south to east in a line and then all of a sudden stopping and then shooting straight up and disappearing. These lights  would travel across the sky quickly. They weren't blinking or anything, I guess kind of... like a moving star.  Ok thanks. I hope you can respond to me.

My girlfriend just came home from work and I asked her if she had seen mars (it was a cloudless clear night with Mars as the brightest object in the sky). She didn't pay any attention to it coming home so we went outside on the balcony to look at it. Just as we were looking at Mars a triangular or V-shaped object appeared from the southwest sky and moved towards the northeast. It was a dark gray color, which made it visible in the sky. It wasn't a smooth object but seemed like it had a rough and textured exterior. She asked me if ""I see that,"" and I said, ""Yes."" She asked me ""What it was,"" and ""Is that a bird,"" I stated ""I don't know,"" and we watched it move across the sky. It made no sound and had no movement except across the sky. The entire sighting lasted 10-15 seconds at which point it disappeared out of view behind a building.  Afterwards, we kept asking each other what it was. If it was a plane it would have had lights (it didn't) and made some noise. If it was a bird or a flock of birds such as geese it would have had movement and possibly made noise. It did neither. I thought to myself that it could be a satellite but it was too low. I do not believe in UFO's but my girlfriend does. So my only conclusion is a government test plane. But I can not get over the fact that if it was a test plane, why would they fly it over a populated area when people are sure to be looking up at Mars?

(It should be noted that on several evenings since our first sighting, my wife and I have gone outside to see about a repeat performance with no luck.)  I had been looking at the sky for several minutes when I thought I saw something flash directly above me in the sky.  This was out of my peripheral vision, so I focused on the area above me where I had seen the flash.  I did a mental count to 29 (as in the first sighting), and on the count of 29 was looking directly at the flash as it winked on and winked off.  The flash was white in color, just to the ""top"" of the northern cross (i.e., if the cross were right-side up, the flash was located above the top of the cross), and the brightness was equal to that of nearby Vega, if not brighter. At this point, I dashed inside, grabbed the video camera, and called to my wife, ""It's back.""  I went back outside, grabbed a lawn chair and sat down, and looked up again in the sky.  As my wife came out, we saw it flash once more, very bright.  I started up my video camera and aimed it at the location in the sky and waited in vain.  It did not reappear.  My wife saw the second flash.  From its location against the stars, it appeared to be traveling in a generally east to west direction. At approximately 20:22, we saw another white flash, this time in a different location, further north in the night sky; just behind the back of Cassiopeia's chair.  We focused on that area and began our mental count to 29.  But only a few seconds after this new flash, we saw a second flash, which was also behind Cassiopeia's chair, but a few degrees west of the first flash.  That was all.  We watched the skies for almost an hour more with no luck.  We did see several shooting stars, airplanes and satellites.  They are all quite different from the flashing light we observed.

I saw three bright orange objects in the western sky at what I estimate to be six or seven thousand feet altitude above the desert floor. Two of the objects were at the altitude mentioned, the third was below the other two at about two thousand feet. The objects appeared to be stationary and were approximately 30 to 40 miles distant. I estimated their actual location to be about 20 miles directly south of the city of Phoenix. This area represents the very eastern edge of the Barry Goldwater Test Range.  From my vantage point these lights were extemely bright compared to every other light source in that direction. After I first sighted them, I pulled off the road and watched them through my driver side window for about ten minutes. At the end of that period they quickly faded out and were replaced with two more similar objects at about the same altitude. I knew this location to be near the Goldwater test range and had observed lights there in times past. However, those lights were moving and weren't nearly as bright and bluish white in color. The lights I observed last night were incredibly bright with a bright orange, almost yellow hue. They were also pulsating irregularly. The second set of lights faded out quickly just as the first set had done. I then got back on the road and continued driving west. About ten minutes later I saw another set of lights pop on and decided to head to that location as fast as I could. It took me about 50 minutes to get to that location. En route the lights kept popping on and fading out as they had done before. When I finally approached the area a new set of lights appeared approx. 3 to 4 miles from where I stopped the car. At this point I could make out the diamond shape. Again, they were stationary. Had they been military flares on the test range, they would have been slowly descending and I would have seen smoke and small parachutes. However, that was not the case. At my close proximity I observed that they still had a bright orange color. There was no sound. I saw no other aircraft in the area except for commercial flights heading to Sky Harbor airport from the west. By about 11:00 pm, the activity ceased and I drove back home.  If this was a military exercise using flares, they are the most unusual flares I've ever seen. I would appreciate knowing if anyone else in the area observed them and if indded there was an exercise taking place on the test range. ((NUFORC Note:  Date indicated by witness may be flawed.  We suspect witness intended to indicate August 27, not August 28, and we have amended the date above.   Also, se believe that some type of pyrotechnic device being used over the BMG/Gila Bend Firing Range would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witness observed something unusual.  However, the witness seems to rule out that possibility, and we recognize that flares usually give off a smokey trail, which is visible, and the witness correctly reports.  Please see somewhat similar report from Mesa, AZ, for the same date at 20:45 hrs..  If the events are the same, the data from the two reports could be used to triangulate on the location of the lights.  PD))",2003-08-28T00:00:00,33.055867567567574,-112.05598918918919

I am an avid astronomy buff & had set my Meade Telescope for a view of Mars, as it is so close and a clear night would benefit viewing, along with the altitude.  We noticed a laser shooting into the sky, apparently coming from atop one of the radar towers which we as kids used to call ""big golf balls"" as they used to look like when they were covered with the white circular enclosures.  After a few minuted the laser stopped and about a half mile behind it, (facing the western sky) a fuzzy red kind of smeared oval just dropped out of the sky approx. 1000 feet high, and slowly moved to the east at a five degree angle, horizontally. And then just stopped and faded away.  With my years of sky watching I am sure this was not a meteor, jet, copter or exhaust from a airplane.  This moved with intelligence.  All of us spotted it and found it unusual that this device would be in such a close proximity to the laser signal.

We were walking the dogs tonight (about 8:15 p.m.) out in a baseball field - we live in the San Francisco Bay Area (near San Jose, California) when we stopped to watch what we thought was a satellite.  We watched for about a minute as it kept a straight course.  I looked down to step forward and when I looked back up my eyes focused on a rather bright star - next to where the satellite had just passed.  My partner did not stop looking up.  As my eyes found the satellite, we both saw it turn red and it looked like it shot straight out - towards space, then disappeared.  It happened really fast, like, a second or two.   We watched the sky for another couple of minutes – thinking it would reappear – but it did not.  Planes come by our way frequently as we are almost beneath the flight path for Ames Research/Moffett Field.  Shortly (within about 30 seconds) after the satellite disappeared there was one such flight coming into Moffett.  I don’t know if this came from the Moffett plane, but a contrail floated across the sky – visible to our eyes – roughly in the same path that the satellite had been going (we think it strange but probably not connected).  Perhaps it was the exhaust from the Moffett plane.  Perhaps you will have others reporting about this in the Bay Area and we aren’t the only ones who saw this.

My husband, 15-yr old stepson and I were traveling east on Union Mill Road going to a local high school football game when I spotted the object.    Traffic was backed up and parking was a nightmare so we were driving very slow.      My stepson and I saw the object hovering above a housing development located at Union Mill Road and Sequoia Lea Road - across the street from Centreville High School.  (my husband did not see it   he was concentrating on the road)   The object was hovering very low, around 500 feet and was motionless and silent for the majority of the viewing.    The object was arranged in a 3-spoke type configuration much like a Mercedes Benz symbol and the spokes appeared to be in equal distance from one another.   Each of the three spokes was completely lined with white lights and in the middle of the spokes was a red light.   The lights were constantly on while the object was still.    The object was very large.    It appeared to be much larger than the homes it was hovering over.     We drove past the object, but in our hunt for a parking spot passed back by the sighting spot twice.   After driving past the object was obscured by trees.    After turning around and heading back towards the site the first time, my stepson and I both saw the object rising up and the white lights were cycling off and on in a pattern around the object (like the lights were chasing one another) and the red light was also blinking.     After turning around and heading back towards the site, the object was not visible. ((NUFORC Note:  We have inquired of the witness whether the lights might have been from an advertising display, but we have not heard back from the party.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) No, my incident was not an advertising campaign.    One, there are no businesses anywhere within about 3/4 mile from where the sighting occured.   The sighting was over a rather large subdivision, and I have yet to see someone put sky beams in their yard!   There was definitely something above those houses.

It was as bright as Mars is at first, in fact at first I thought it was Mars, and as it moved it increased in brightness about 4 or 5 times its initial brightness, or magnitude, then turned sharply, roughly 75 degrees from the plane of the horizon, and proceeded up through the constellation Cassiopeia, dimming as it disappeared in the distance. The entire event lasted approximately 12 to 15 seconds. Living as close as we do to Mt. Home AFB, I am quite familiar with aircraft lights and configuration, and this exhibited none that I am familiar with. We are about 8 miles from the airbase as the crow flies, and even at that distance one can discern the noise of the various jet aircraft stationed there while in flight. This object emitted no sound.

About 1 pm the pilot put on the seatbelt sign and told us we were just on the edge of a cold front that was passing through Minneapolis and we may experience a ""few bumps."" I thought I would snap a picture of the clouds we were above just for a future screensaver. I must add that about 30 mins earlier I nudged my wife to see a passing airplane because I'm always in awe of seeing a plane pass in the opposite direction. The sense of speed one gets is amazing. The passing plane also produced a great contrail. Like I stated, I turned my digital camera to the window, and as I was framing the shot I caught a flash of what I thought was a reflection from the wing. I snapped the shot and immediately took the camera down and checked the shot in the camera's screen. The Sony camera (DSC-1) has a very small screen and since I was not wearing my reading glasses, I was only able to view the basic composition and exposure. Satisfied, I put the camera away and enjoyed the rest of the flight. The next day I downloaded all my shots from the trip (70+) with the flight shot being the last one. When it popped up on the screen I was shocked at what I saw. There in the distance was an object forward of the right wing. I describe it as cigar shaped, with 3 areas of brightness along its edge and what appears to be a darker area barely visible at its mid section along the top edge. The object also has a yellowish glow around it. For a fact I know there were no other aircraft (planes) within the area at the time, because after the few seconds it took to check the camera I returned to gazing out the window, I saw nothing. I have the shot. I am reluctant to show it beyond those I've shown it to already. I don't need to be suspect, however I would certainly rest easier if I knew what I captured with my camera.

He stood by the door again but he said he felt a painless, pulsating throb in his head with a sort of hum. I stood by the door but felt nothing. We forgot about the incident and sat down to watch TV. About a half hour later we saw a large flash outside the window it was either blue or green. It was so bright it felt like several cars were in the backyard with their brights on. This light was also accompanied by a loud and low hum that rattled the kitchen window and a painless electric feeling on the couches we were sitting on. This lasted for a solid 5 to 10 seconds. We ran outside thinking lightning struck the house, nothing was burnt not their was any clouds in the sky. We noticed about half a mile away from the house was a white suv that was motionless in the middle of the road and then proceeded slowly on its way as if it had seen something. We went to the front yard for about 15 minutes duting this time a neighbor that said he lived about a quarter mile away asked if we had seen ""it.""

This afternoon my children were playing in the back yard and pulled me out with them to show me a cool airplane they had seen.  I looked up and saw a large silvery-white jet spewing out 4 distinct comtrails.  It did not look like a commercial plane, so I thought it may have come from the Whidbey Island Air Base which is nearby.  I kept watching because the plane seemed unusual and it made absolutely no sound whatsoever, and I was also checking the comtrail to see if it would spread.  It did not, but after about ten seconds two of the plane's engines/comtrails shut off, and then POOF the plane just DISAPPEARED!  It simply VANISHED!  I was actually watching it when one second it was there, and the next, GONE.  Within a few seconds, the entire comtrail which had taken up half the sky also disippated.  I never see weird stuff, and this is the weirdest thing I've ever seen.  Have you had any other similar reports?  I'd love to know if anyone else saw this.  I don't know if it is related, and this seems particularly strange, but a minute later there was a distinct odor of old, rotten fruit in the air and on myself, and a few minutes after that a new cloud quickly formed and disappeared in the clear blue sky where the plane had flown.  My two oldest children, ages 7 and 5, saw everything with me.

I once saw one of these lights at a much closer distance while piloting a single-engine light aircraft between Gila Bend and Yuma. I estimated the distance at 10 miles.

They gave off different flashing colors:mostly blue/white(these were more constant-harder to tell apart but you could notice a difference at times), red, almost orange at times. the red light seemed to appear more in the middle, while white was on the bottom and blue seemed to remain near the top tip.  near 4:00 it seemed to project some weird red light.  It was not a beam, but more like a red dash in the sky.  This light would flash on and off, but only appeared about 7 times.  I almost stopped watching until i saw that different light.  and the sound, it was a dull roar, easy to dismiss, almost the sound of a helicoptor, but the sound was too constant, it just wasn't a helicoptor.  One plane flew by about 5 minutes before i could no longer see it.  It flew over the ship i was watching about 2 minutes after the red beams flashed.  the ufo seemed to almost get nervous and hovered around quicker than before.

It is very difficult to explain the exact shape and size of the crafts as they change.  Two are always together and one is always more distant.  The backround is perfectly blue sky with no clouds.  There is an airport close by but nothing like this has been seen before.  They are very slow moving at time and then complety dissapear so seems to be able to move rapidly. We called the news, they weren't interested.  They are able to change altitude so don't suggest any type of experimental aircraft as they move up and down like a helicopter and side to side without making a sound.  They have been very close to view with the naked eye and very far but seem to be staying in the general area.  Boeing is very close to us as well as a Navy base and Paine field airport.

The weather was clear and sunny. We had walked to Pike Place Market and exited out to Post Alley to go and look at some of the furniture stores. As I waited outside while my wife looked in a shop, I looked up and noticed a shiny, cylindrical object hovering over the city. It appeared to be motionless, but occasionally it would appear to rotate slightly because the quality of the sun's reflection would change on its surface. I assumed that it was a helicopter, but I couldn't see any rotor blades. My wife came out of the store and I pointed the object out to her and we watched it for around 10 minutes. It didn't move during that time. We continued walking, and we went in a few stores over the next 20 minutes and each time we came back out onto the street the object was still in the same location, still rotating slightly causing the sunlight to glint off it. At one point, we stopped to watch an aircraft fly past it and as we did, we noticed a very tiny speck of white light (which I assumed to be a satellite or perhaps the ISS going past) travel past the object and stop. We continued to walk, and when I looked up again, the dot was gone but the cylyndrical object remained.

No movement of leaves; No movement of cloud cover.  Note on Weather:  An article in the OTTAWA CITIZEN newspaper, on August 31 reported that the Hot Air Balloons from the Balloon Festival were forced down in the South End of the city at dusk due to insufficient wind to carry them to better landing sites.  I was walking past the Convention Centre when I noticed a movement and stopped to watch a bright sphere move in a South West direction. When first seen, I was at about 45 degrees above the horizon, or about the height of the National Defence building. It was directly over the Canal and curved down towards the trees between the Canal and the National Arts Centre.  It was moving at a very rapid pace, faster than city traffic, and was only seen briefly, 2;about a minute at most but probably about 15-30 seconds. There were tourists and other passers-by but it did not occur to me to point out the object to them.  The object was a perfect sphere, very bright, probably from reflected light, as I watched it intently and it changed from bright to black. There was an intermediate quarter moon phase, so it was probably dark on one side and highly reflective on the other.  It was probably not one of the hot-air balloons from the Hot Air Festival as it had no basket, was not the usual tear-drop or fanciful shape or colour, and would have distinctly varied in size if it was passing over or coming down near enough to me to be framed by the National Defence Building and the National Arts Centre.  Because it was perfectly spherical, opaque to light, showed no sign of colour and changed from bright to dark, I eliminated the possibility of a toy balloon on the spot.  I made a point of trying to determine if it was one of those round pillow shaped greeting balloons which have a printed sight and a shiny metal side but it did not appear to change shape at all. If it was a balloon of that size (one foot, 30 centimetres diameter)  it was closer to me on the ground than either the National Arts Centre or the National Defence building when I observed it, so a change in shape should have been visible.  At one point, I considered the possibility that it might be a helicopter or a large balloon (in the range,  two to six foot diameter, one to two metres). It was difficult to determine scale as it was against a background of clear sky. The curve in its flight suggests that it was distant enough to appear to move along the curvature of the sky, but in that case it must have been bigger than a house. I don't recall seeing it actually pass behind the trees, so I may have been momentarily distracted at that point.  The next day I revisited the site to attempt to determine where I was standing while I stopped and watched the balloon. I remembered that the canal was directly before me the day before but acquired no new information on my exact position.  I did notice a couple of large advertising balloons attached to the stroller/perambulator of a child in the Rideau Centre Shopping Mall. They were advertising a story called Richards or something like (it definitely started with an ""R."" They were about 1.5 feet or 50 centimetres in diameter, transparent and green. It is unlikely that a metallic, two-coloured balloon was being used as a promotional giveaway as well, but they were within the possible size-range of the object which I saw.  I have to call this object a U.F.O. because the only evidence that it was a balloon was its shape and change of brightness, while the total absence of wind on the ground or at cloud level does not permit me to suppose that it was moving under wind power. Also, its path seemed curved with the curvature of the sky and if it was a wind it was taking a highly anomalous downward curve path.  Do high speed air currents curve to the ground?  I did, however, have the impression that the sphere was not much larger than a small aircraft, or smaller than a very large balloon, also that it may have passed lower than the National Defence Building, although I do not positively recall it passing in front of the building.  Being of a scientific turn of mind, I believe that the most probably explanation would be a balloon, but not a toy or greetings balloon but something larger than those and smaller than a Hot Air Balloon. To conclude this positively, I would have to assume, however, that there was a brisk, but invisible wind at an altitude in excess of the height of the National Arts Centre and the Convention Centre on the opposite side of the Canal (4 to 6 stories), a wind which was curving downward over a short distance, perhaps less than the distance to Confederation Park beyond the National Arts Centre. I noticed not the slightest breeze where I stood, no wind in the branches of the trees by the National Arts Centre (some of which are nearly as tall as the building), and no cloud movement.",2003-09-04T00:00:00,45.3813825,-75.70850071428572

They were not moving much, like you would expect from a formation of planes, from their position, but hovering. Then 2 of the dots started moving in slow broad circles around the others.

I also understand others may have seen the same flashing lights. My name is (deleted by HBCC UFO), I live in Ootischenia, just outside of Castlegar, next to the Castlegar Airport.  It was a clear night, and I was looking to the north sky at the Big Dipper. I caught a glimpse of a flashing red/green and white light moving across the sky towards the west.  I thought it was an jet flying towards Vancouver, but then I returned my glance towards the east, above the Kootenay River valley, where the ""jet"" seemed to appear from, I saw another flashing light.  A called my husband, (name deleted by HBCC UFO), to come and see this, and he saw what I saw...then we saw another appear from the east fly over Mount Sentinel and move towards the west.  My three children joined us in our observations of the unidentified objects in the night sky. These were not jets!  Within a few minutes, there were five of these objects in the sky at one time flying in various directions.  Two in particular seemed to meet up with one another and hovered across from one another for about a minute or two, then one flew directly below it, and hovered there for less than a minute, then flew in a north eastern direction towards the back of Mount Sentinel. It flew out of sight, then in about another minute or so, reappeared from the east, (where they all seemed to come from).  We watched these objects for about 15 minutes, then they all disappeared behind the mountains in the horizons.  Tonight, Oct 3, I have so far seen one of these objects fly across the sky from east towards the west.  I plan to be out watching for these things again tonight.

It moved left to right, up and down, it moved pretty rapidly but it would just go a short distance. It was sort of like dancing. I know that sounds crazy. At this pint, we knew that it was not a plane, helicopter, weather ballon, or any of the other 100 or so things we tried to make it to be. It was beautiful. And then it just disappeared behind a small cloud. Now I was jumping up and down in the seat telling my friend i needed my camera. Got the camera and waited. Another few minutes passed and we kept and eye onthe cloud we last saw it and sure enough it reappeared and there were 2 of the balls of light. Same size and shape.

With-in a few seconds the object dissapeared and we were all left stunned and amazed at the incident. We discussed what it might of been & we just chuckled at the idea and all agreed it might of been some soft paper that just might be lower than what we thought and we couldnt tell because it was just to dark. So we continued to watch the lunar eclpse when again for a second time, I had seen the same object but this time moving from west to east and I was still facing north. A close friend of mine came walking by and I stated look!! look!!! There it is again!!! and he looked up and he too was also amazed to see this strange and weird object. He stated what the f*$@ is that. Now for the second time with-in 5 minutes we seen the same thing and now we had another witness to confirm what we saw. The object only appeared for no more tha! n 60 seconds and I started along with my family saying it was a UFO. After the object disaapeared we just all looked at one another and we looked up again. No more than 3 or 4 minutes later you could hear & see a fighter jet or a some type of jet airplane with what I can recall blue and white lights flashing under the wing tips. It was moving at great speeds and at a higher altitude, also moving in the same west to east direction.",2003-11-11T00:00:00,40.67828461538461,-73.84743846153846

But about 5-10 degrees from Mars toward South, (nearly in line with Mars) was a brighter object that immediately caught my attention.  My first thought was it was a star, but brighter, whiter, and larger than Mars, and so close to Mars, and I wondered what star is that?  It appeared stationary, and then in a second it pulsated, with the white light becoming brighter, more brilliant, then pulsated again, slightly dimming some of the brilliance, then pulsated-enlarging again, to even larger than my original sighting, and then in another second or so, it began to fade and then I was aware of its movement away (southward) and slightly upward, and it faded out to a pin light before disappearing from my view.  My observation from beginning to end was approximately fifteen-twenty seconds.  Except for a few clouds scattered in the eastern sky, the sky was completely clear in that direction, around and above the object.  This object was not within the normal airplane flight pattern, which I often observe evenings as planes go into Sacramento from the North, (I observe those to the North of my position) or other planes that fly over.  I have never observed a plane in that position.

Saw a light moving relativly fast in North-West direction, believing it was an airplane high up in the sky because the light was slightly flickering. But just shortly after I noticed it, it stopped moving, started moving fast in opposite direction and then back the original direction, very slow this time yet noticable. It didn't flicker as much either, it became a steady light. That definitely caught my attention. Two jetliners passed in the sky and they didn't look anything like this object. The jetliners also flew lower than this object, excluding the possibility it was a distant helicopter.  I was staring at this object for a long time, making sure I wasn't looking at a planet, star or a 'roid. It was much brighter than any object, except for the moon and those jetliners. It appeared the light was not generated though, but rather a reflection from a spherical object - maybe caused by the bright moon. The reflection was brightest in the direction of the moon and then faded away sharply around a sphere-like edge - a faint crescent similar to a 1% new moon, with a bright spot like that sometimes seen with a solar eclipse. The color at its brightest spot was an off-white/yellow. The crescent was darker, almost turning into a dark red before it completely faded away.  The crescent, albeit faint, was rather large. About half the size of an actual crescent moon, which kind of dazzled me because this object must have been rather large if it were fully exposed. That really convinced me it couldn't have been a planet or star.  I went inside because it was getting too cold for me, but when I came back outside about 1 1/2 hour later out of curiosity, it was gone.

PD)) Star light objects strobing red then white moving at very fast speeds for the altitude My 7 year old son and I were traveling home from Terra Huate Indiana and left there at 20:00. We traveled South toward Vincennes Indiana on Highway 41. As we were driving my son said he saw a blinking star. I sang the song ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" and said where do you think that song was made from. He said no dad this star blinks. I started looking around in the sky and saw 4 non moving flashing stars. My son stated he saw 2 that I could not see. These stars were flashing either a red and white combination or just a plain white combination. I told him they were stars and continued driving for 10 minuits. He then said that one of these ""stars"" were moving I looked over toward the passenger side window and sure enough this ""star"" object still flashing red and white was moving. I told him it must be an airplane and continued watching it as I drove. The ""star object was visible at all times to me starting from the back window and flew south staying at the same distance out my windows not moving up or down. Within a minuite I watched this object go from the West side to the South side then worked its way to my East. So to make this easier to visualize picture a bug crawl at the top of your windows so you could see it at all times from the back passengers window to the front passengers window then along the top of the front window from passengers side to the drivers side then along the drivers side door window. At all times this star object kept level with the ground. Once it was heading on the drivers side window I noticed that there was another ""star"" object and they stopped moving fairly close together they stopped making their red/white combination flashes and just started flashing white at a slow speed while not moving. The white flashes sincrinized flashing beep   beep   beep at the exact same time. This occered for several minuits still driving 60 mph with these object not moving to us. The objects then moved to appear to form one object and started their wild flashing again. This! happened for another minuite or so and then they moved again toward different directions. They did have a different magnitude of light one a bit softer than the other and I watched the same one fly back to its original spot on the west side of the sky. Again flying the same way I described before but backwards. We watched these dancing stars the whole 1 hour drive and even into out drive way. I told my wife who stuck her head out the window and she saw one not moving then it did to her suprise. I do not think she has the same understanding of these objects as we do since she jsut saw a glimps. We had watched these things from Terra Haute to Bicknell. A one hour drive. There was no trail behind these objects. If the object is far enough in the sky that as I drive 60mph and it appears to be non moving while its stationary. My guess would be that it is very far up there. The distance that an object would have traveled at that altitude would have been emmince and to be able to travel it in less than a minuit would be impossible. If it was an aircraft such as a plane I would call detail to the hovering together and the sincrinizing of the blinking lights. Then why would it travel back to the same spot. The other lights would disapeare and reapear but never saw them move from side to side. The altitude of this object off of the ground as I saw it. Was while sitting in the drivers seat the object was visible at the top of the windows.

My son was on his way to the Marathon station for gas and there is this road that winds its way through a little valley and there is a cherry orchard on one side.  The craft was noted apx 45 feet in the air hovering in the valley next to the cherry orchard.  It then moved closer to the road to the point where my son could see the typical round object on the underneath and the three lights, blue, red and white.  He said it hovered there, made no sound and had a wobbling motion.  A car was coming from the other direction and the craft was so low the car did a U-turn and went in the other direction.  My son was physically shaking from the encounter and expressed to me the intense desire to get distance between him and it due to its proximity to the road.  He said it then moved south and he followed it South on Co Rd. 633 towards Crain Hill road and it then descended below a tree line to the point he could not see it anymore, leaving him questioning whether it landed or not.  This is his second sighting of UFO craft in that 1-mile radius in 2 months.  The earlier one was in June or July, can't remember which, and was a somewhat different shaped craft and was not as low to the ground.  He was on his way again to get gas at the Marathon station.

Although the sighting only lasted for a split second or so, he was still able to observe the light doing some very unusual things. The location for this sighting was at around Kitsilano at 4th Avenue and Maple. The witness was walking west on forth Avenue on the north side of the street when he just happened to looked up and caught sight of what looked like a star, white in color. The fellow did not want to make any assumptions, but he thought it may have been reflected sunlight. The object was rather high up in the sky. The light was traveling from north to the south and the sighting lasted approx: a second. He also mentioned that whatever it was moved incredibly fast, like a shooting star. But the unusual thing about it, the light moved very erratic. In other words the witness said it did not move in a straight line. He also mentioned if the light had of traveled in a straight line, he would not have called me to make the report. Only because it behaved so strange, he thought he would file a report. The man felt that the sighting was so strange, he wanted to know if anyone had reported seeing this.  Also, if one looks at the last report I just posted for around the Vancouver area, there are some similarities and a day a part. Any connection, who knows but I think it is still worth noting. No sound was heard. Again his impression was that the light was very high up. Due to him being around a lot of large buildings in the area, he did not have a good field of view.

It was around 8:45 pm when I went outside to take the garbage out when a bright green light from the sky caught my eye.  I looked up and saw a bright green, almost flourescent in color, fireball descending down from the sky and knew from the size of it it was to large to be a falling star.  It lasted for 10 to 15 seconds before it vanished, not vaporized or breaking apart but just vanished.  The more I sit here and think of the occurence the more I realize that it was not going at an incredible speed such as a falling star shooting into the atmoshphere, but more of a constant speed, then accelerated for 1 or 2 seconds then to only disapear. .  The fire from the rear of it looked as if fire does on the back of a jet thrusting forward or faster, this is the only way I can think of to describe it. Also if it helps I was off of Gulf Beach Hwy near Perdido Key and it looked as if it were descending down towards the intercoastal waterway. It was the size of possibly 2 softballs put together. I plan to try to draw an illustration of the object and send it in if I am able to reproduce the same image on paper. I can only hope that my description helps in any way and to wish that I knew what it was that I saw.  I know it is an experience that I will never forget. Be it a meteorite or an unidentified flying object, I truly believe that we are not alone nor have we ever been.

I was going into surgery the next morning and have not talked to them since but I am sure they would call, I am going to call them and give them the hotline number and her husband was in the military here in Pensacola so he would know more about the latitude and longitude than I would.

This is the second time in the past year that this incident has happened. When it happened last time I reported it to another UFO web page I came across on the WEB. I came across this web page a few weeks after the first occurence last Feb/March or so. Well this is the strangest and most eerie thing that has ever happened to me. A short while ago as I was walking my dogs they started to pace and hide behind me, much like they do when there is a storm w/lightning and thunder. And almost exactly as it happened before, the area above me turned pitch black. I mean it was as if the sky had been painted over. The area was huge from my vantage point.Well put it this way it was either huge and far away or it was closer than I thought it was. I mean there were no stars, no clouds, no light of any kind. I could see a defined edge but the shape changed from oblong to kidney shape and then to a distorted sphere of some kind. There was no noise of any kind, and the black shape moved at a pretty slow pace. It covered very little area in the 5 or so minutes that I could see it. I was determined to get a picture of it and I walked over to my car and grabbed the binocular/digital camera I bought myself a few weeks ago to snap pictures of the birds around my yard. I started snapping like mad and took at least 50 exposures. None of them ended up looking like anything except a shot of BLACK and nothing else. It would be pretty hard to get a good picture of it unless it was a crystal clear night loaded with stars.( unfortunately tonight was a bit mixed with clouds and pockets of stars) I am so excited that I was able to verify to myself that I wasn't going crazy. Last time I was all by myself with the dogs and I had to keep telling myself that I saw what I saw and that it was OK. But tonight I saw it again and this time it hung there in the sky for a goodwhile. The creepy part of the whole thing was that last time I only saw it for a few moments maybe 1/2 a minute but this time not only did I see it on approach to where it stopped but I saw it leave as well. It just picked up speed and within a few seconds it had risen into the night sky and I could see stars taking the place of the object as it rose and then it was gone out of site. It was awesome and I wish I knew what the heck it was and who the heck they were. Well that's it. The whole truth and nothing but the truth.

I know there were others that saw it because several years ago someone I met mentioned that thy knew someone that saw the same thing as I. It was a craft that was heading south over the intercoastal waterway in ft lauderdale. It looked like a bright light, kinda like a headlight on a plane. A friend and I were traveling east over the intercoastal on 17 st .Looking north I saw this thing and said to my friend, What the heck is that  ? I was driving so it was a little tricky for me to keep my eyes on it . Suddenly in a flash it moved to a different locaion which was directly above a resturant called Pier 66. Funny thing about this resturant is that it rotates , or at least it used to and it looks like a round ufo .Pier 66 is like 10 stories high so it looks like a space ship on top of a building. This made us think that whoever was in the ufo might have looked at the building because it really looks like a saucer shaped craft. Anyway when we were going over the bridge the ufo was roughly the same size as the top of the pier 66 round building and it hovered what looked to be something like 50 to 100 ft above it. It was there for just seconds then it traveled across the sky to a distant location (in a split second) to a point that it looked as small as a star. Then in a split second again it traveled to the top of pier 66 and hovered above it again.Let me tell you this all happened so fast that we were still crossing over the bridge when this happened. Once we crossed the bridge we were heading east towards the ocean and then the craft started to move slowly east . It flew at a slow speed so we were able to watch it as we headed towards the beach.I could only glance at it from time to time because I was driving.My friend was watching it all the way .It flew at an angle and had some what I seem to remember red lights at the bottom. ( my friend drew a picture of it that year , he is an excelent artist ). Once we got to the ocean I was trying to pull over into a parking area on the beach so I could stop driving and just concentrate on looking at this thing. I pulled over and the craft was just crossing over the road A1A and heading over the ocean. It got over the water and again it a split second traveled across the sky to the point that it looked like a tiny star in the distance and just as fast came right back to the same spot it was just at. Then it slowly started moving east again over the ocean and then there was a big flash of different colors at it was gone. I wish I could remember the exact date and time but I never wrote it down. I hope someone else has reported this sighting so I can have more eyewitness accounts of it. This sighting made me want to see another one but to this date that was the last time I saw one.

There about 300 feet up was an unmarked bright blue sphere hovering motionless. I know it was 300 feet because it was in the cloud cover which was rather dense but still had enough patches to see the moon. (Almost full or full) From my perspective, it appeared to vanish. From my friends perspective, he saw it take off from the south...which was sometype of aerospace facility, now abandoned but still in place, 2003. Six other persons came racing down to the base of the cul-de-sac and exclaimed ""Did you see that thing fly by the moon?"" They said it had done so in about a half second. Pretty fast. We all sat around in shock for a while and then dispersed. We did not exchange names, I guess it's not the first thing that come to mind in such an 'alien' situation. To be clear, I don't know what it was. It just wasn't of this world. Perhaps a UFO, angel, advanced being. It could have been anything.

The disappointing thing was that the next day, even though people in a sixty mile diameter had seen the sky over San Diego light up, the news claimed "" The strange light in the sky last night was a power station explosion."" I've never trusted the media since that night, and suggest you don't either. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-09-12T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

This person's description is exactly what we saw.  I was driving home with my two daughters and first I noticed what appeared to be two close aircraft flying quite high together and a high speed. My daughter, who was in the front seat, then noticed that after they crossed the sky (coming from east and moving west) all of a sudden turned around (in perfect formation) and came right back what seemed to be toward us. I was curious, and didn't want to continue driving on the highway, so pulled over into a school parking lot just off the highway. The object was just above the tree line and that was when I saw the outer shape of it, we then realized it was one object and those two bright lights were on each end and an amber light in the center front point and the huge size (I went back in the daytime with a friend the next day just to figure out just how big this shape was) and it was the whole length of the parking lot plus almost the length of the school building...so maybe 200'??. There was just enough light to see this shape of a ""long V or triangle shape. My girls were quite upset, one in the back kept saying she didn't want to die and I didn't want to drive ""under it"" as the exit was underneath what seemed to be the front of it. It had the light arrangement similar to the Washington state one and my observed object did stop and hover just above the treeline in front of my car. It too did on/off of lights especially in the center edge closest to us. Those lights were colored like the ""old computer screen green"" and I got the feeling as they were pulsating back and forth that it was taking pictures of us. It then abruptly made a right angle turn and departed south and accelerated up at a very rapid speed with absolutely no sound. About two weeks I went back again and noticed all the trees in the path of its departure were defoliated. To this day, they are dead still. My girls were in denial and didn't want me to go blabbing all around about it...and only a year later on the ""Today"" show was there a sighting in New York that around 400 people saw/called in and an artist drawing of the description was on TV and it looked exactly what we saw. My younger daughter finally after seeing that on TV opened up and we started talking about it again. I have never forgotten this incident (It is my second sighting...other one was back in 1960 in broad daylight and others saw it (people eating at a Sandy's drivein)...but it was a small metallic disk with something rotating and hovered just above the telephone in my back yard. I was out working in a tomato patch and again I had a feeling of ""pictures being taken"" and then it just moved vertically up at an incredible speed and disappeared. (amongst all the gaping people chomping on their hamburgers)...so I continue to search the skies, read other people's sightings and feel some comfort that my ""triangular"" object has been seen by others. Fortunately, we did not have any ""missing time"" or strange marks on us....just my mental imprint that ""other things are out there"". I am a passenger in a Cessna 170 and many times we have flown over the area....at night there is a striking strobe light acorss Lake Winnebago...maybe the triangular craft was honing in on that or ""mapping in picture form of the area??. I just can't imagine it ""singling out our car"" to play ""light games"" with.",2003-09-12T00:00:00,44.01753440860215,-88.55902634408604

At the approximate date and time listed, My significant other and I were sitting in a stationary automobile that was parked facing east/west on a residential street off of Poindexter Avenue.  We were sitting in the vehicle conversing prior to ending our social engagement.  In the middle of a sentence a bright green light illuminated our surroundings.  The source of this light was unidentified, since the roof of the vehicle obstructed our view, however it appeared to be comming from above our location.  I clearly recall feeling like our vehicle was close to the center of this projected light, because I noticed a clearly defined break in the green light line on the background of the white walled residential houses.  The light was so bright that everything inside the vehicle and outside the vehicle seemed visually permiated.  The light remained constant for about three(3) seconds and then discontinued.  We both looked at each other speechless for a few seconds, then slowly asking each other what was that.  Approximately four(4) or five(5) seconds later the light re-illuminated our surroundings once again.  The duration was again, approximately three(3) seconds.  And again, the light was green with clearly defined line boundries on the white background of the near by houses.  This time I immediatly rolled down the window to see if there was some kind of aircraft.  We did not see any evidence of aircraft,any evidence of audio noise, or any remaining physical evidence of the event.  The closest way to describe the event was like a very very bright spot light someplace directly above the vehicle, but the light we saw was extremely bright, all consumming, and uniform in content.  I revisited the location many times after and could find no logical explanation for the events that took place.  I am a professional investigator of 11 years (currently) and am one of two credable witnesses.  I also noticed that on 02/15/03 in Virginia Beach a similar event was recorded.

We observe that his sighting occurred at the approximate time of the annual Leonid meteor shower, but his description does not seem consistent with a typical meteor, unless it had been moving directly toward the witness.  If the event occurred in another year, we believe we may know what it was he observed.  PD))",2003-09-12T00:00:00,36.83548986175115,-76.35074423963133

The Alien overrided my neurological system, which made it difficult for me to move. The only thing that I could do was watch in horror.

I saw 3 other aliens. They had me on a hard bed which was made out of some type of smooth stone. I then watched them inject a needle that had 3 smaller needles around it, inside my right bicep. I didn't feel any pain but I was able to feel the coldness of the needle. After the injection, an alien came over to me, lifted his hand up and a bright flash of light fulfilled my eyes. I was then back in my house, laying on my bed. I got out of bed and went into the kitchen and turned on the light. There, I observed my right arm (bicep muscle) and I saw markings (red dots) where they had injected me with their needles.

I was contemplating life before I went to bed. I heard a noise that sounded like a plain at cruising altitude high in the sky. I turned my head up to the right and saw a light then I looked back down as my first impression was plain in the sky no big deal. After a second or two once my mind re-analyzed the image my head spun around and looked back with my mind already racing. Low and behold there was a saucer shaped craft that was about 30 to 50 feet in diameter and maybe 20 feet high hovering along at about 10 to 15 miles per hour. The altitude was very low maybe 50 to 100 feet. I remember looking at the tree in the yard and thinking it was about double the hight of the tree. The tree was a little higher than the building was a typical two storry aprtment building with a low slopping roof. I think it was about 30 feet hight or so. I just started at it very closely trying to make out the details on the body of it. I remember creases in the exterior where doors could have been. It had lights on top which I think where blue and/or red and it had three white lights on the bottom which formed a triangle. The lights on the bottom where pretty big but I don't remember them being very bright but I could be wrong about this. I was trying to concentrate on the details of the exterior which I could see because I was so close. It entered to the right of my balcony and flew across the back yard of the building and crossed over the top to my left. The building is in an L shape at about 45 degrees. So it passed over the back of the building which is the acute angle side of the building. As soon as it passed from view I ran inside and grabbed my video camera which was sitting on the cough (very cool) I ran outside and downstair out the front of the building and into the parking lot. By this time it was about 200 feet away heading away from me at the same speed, 10 to 15 mph I would estimate maybe slower. I was scrambling to get the video camera on the right setting and powered on and zoomed into the object and at the same time trying to see the object with my other eye so I didn't miss anything. Well by the time I got the video camera working it was to far away. It looked like a street light from a few hundred feet away. I had a really good zoom so I was zooming in way to far. Well you get the idea I didn't manager to get it on tape. The object made a low rumbling noise which was pretty quiet. Like I said it sounded like a jet at very high altitude at first. I did not see any exterial signs of propulsion. There was no smoke or trail of any kind and I did not smell anything either. I definitely had some type of vertical thrust acting on it because it was going so slow and it was saucer shaped. Right after the incident I went inside and spent the next 4 hours researching on the internet. I found pictures of UFO's on the internet that looked very similar to what I saw. I reported this incident that night to http://www.aliens111.com. I got an email back from them a few day later asking to put my report on their web site. I told them that was fine just leave my name off. I just emailed them again to see if they could dig up my report because it could contain details that I have forgotten or maybe identify some inconsitancies with this report I am filing now, which is my current memory of events. Thanks for listening and keep up the great work. I became aware of your web site from Jeff Rense.

Blue-green luninescent objects moving at a high rate of speed, producing no sound and maneuvering at incredible angles to each other. ---------------------------------------------------- I thought it might be worth while to give my take on the report. As stated, I had just scored (the winning shot I might add) and threw my head back, and hands up in victory, when I exclaimed ""What the heck is that?"" I saw 4  fairly dim ""lights"" if you will, bluish-green in color, tracking east to west at a pretty good clip. The speed, east to west was constant. Their speed relative to each other, varied. My first thought was they were those spotlights used for attracting attention to businesses around the area, except there were no clouds to reflect the light, nor were there any ""beams"" emanating from the ground. Lastly, spotlights travel in a set pattern, extending out from a focal point, then returning, these definitely came in from the east, and disappeared on the western horizon. Now, all the while, these four lights were not just moving east to west, but performed maneuvers similar to those of the previously mentioned spotlights. At one point, they all came together, sort of spun around each other, then separated back into a new formation. While almost directly overhead, two of them stayed stationary in the center, while the other two, (one on each side of the two stationary lights) made circles as they flew. A little hard to explain, but if you hold up two fingers on each hand, put the index fingers touching side by side, and start rotating the second fingers in opposite circles (one move clockwise, the other counterclockwise) you can get an idea of the formation as it passed overhead. Of course, the tips of your fingers will represent the lights themselves. Now remember, these varying ""formations"" are still moving at a constant speed east to west. They traveled somewhere between 3/4, and 1/2 of a persons field of view, meaning east horizon, to west horizon in just about 10-15 seconds. The speed seemed fast, yet they almost seemed to be moving in slow motion. They made no sound whatsoever, which was noted immediately, since they did not appear to be that high in the sky. I cannot guess at an altitu! de, because I don't know the actual size of the objects. If they were the size of a car, then I would guess somewhere between between 1000 to 1200 feet. (ONLY a guess)  The two children who also witnessed this are my kids, and while they were enthralled by what they were seeing, once the objects moved out of view, became very scared and ""clingy"" for a lack of a better word. They were obviously shocked by what they had seen. Like my friend said, we live close to the airport (actually 2, LAX, and the smaller Torrance airport), so we know what planes are, and the normal tell-tale signs. (shape, lights, engine noise, flight behaviors, etc.) We had to play it off in order to calm the kids down. Later that evening, after getting them calmed, in bed, and convinced the aliens were not landing tonight, I went back over to my neighbors to discuss what we had witnessed. We both agree that we don't know what we saw, but we don't want to label it, especially without any other evidence besides our own accounts.

I was driving east on Ridgely Ave in Annapolis not 100 yards from the Naval Academy.   Overhead to my left I saw a jet coming in the opposite direction from the area of the Academy.  I supposed it to be a commercial jetliner as there are many which fly in that path on their way to BWI (Baltimore Washington International Airport).   There were two white lights on either wingtip and one blue blinking one in the center as well as lights on the front.   It seemed to be flying rather low and unusually slowly, so I kept my eye on it.   When it slowed almost to a standstill, I knew something was not normal.  I broke my gaze just long enough to pull to the curb.   With the car in park I glanced over my shoulder and saw the craft just hovering in place.   Jets don't stand in one place or they'd drop from the sky, (Harriers excepted), and it was too large for a helicopter.   Besides I had the window open and it was completely silent.   I was able to look more carefully now and saw that the front end was well lit; in fact the nose seemed to be composed entirely of glass panels reminiscent of some WWII bombers.   It was floating about a hundred feet up and was not large, maybe forty to sixty feet across.   I could not make out the exact shape, was it triangular, or fusalage and wings?   I did see that it was painted black.   I was straining to see if I could observe anything through the glass panels when it began to move again.   It floated slowly at first, perhaps ten miles per hour, then picked up a little more speed.   My window was open as I said, and it made no sound.   I started my engine and turned the car around in an effort to pursue the craft.   It was traveling exactly west in a straight line at level altitude.   The speed limit on the road there is 30mph, so it easily pulled away from me and disappeared beyond a stand of trees though it was not moving very fast.   It was out of view for a few seconds by the time my road went over U.S. Interstate 50.   I paused on the bridge and took a look down along Route 50.   There was no sign of it anywhere.   Had it turned north before reaching the highway?   That would mean it was over the Severn River.   I turned around again and went along my original route.   A minute or so later I was on the middle of the Naval Academy bridge which spans the Severn.   Again I looked, but the craft was no where to be seen.   I don't know what I saw, but my intuition tells me it was not extra-terrestrial, but one of ""ours"", albeit using an unconventional form of propulsion.",2003-10-17T00:00:00,38.974446787148594,-76.52259959839357

Driving west at 1:15am on September 13, we observed an enormous lighting up of the sky above Los Angeles. It was a huge flash of a blue/white glow and scared all of us riding in the car. It was so enormous and so sudden and so bright that all of us thought that a nuclear device had gone off. We were situated just a few miles east of downtown on the 10 Freeway looking toward the west so that whatever it was could have originated from the ocean. We called a few local radio stations at the time, but no one knew what we were talking about. Do you know what that was? So as to reinforce my credibility, let me tell you that no one in our party had been drinking and we are all over 50 years old, my husband is a management consultant and I am a lawyer. We were returning from the Los Angeles County Fair in Pomona (east of Los Angeles - the flask we saw was in the west and covered the entire westerly sky). This was very disturbing - what with the current political situation, everyone's first thought was of some kind of terrorism. But, it seems clear that this was not the case and it must have been some kind of natural phenomenon or maybe. . . . Please advise. It's driving us all nuts to know that we witnessed something extraordinary and not to be able to find out what it was.

I looked where she was pointing and I knew right off the bat that this was not man made.  I saw 3 bright objects in a v shaped cluster between some trees in the sky.  They looked like orbs but very metalic bright like sun reflection off of chrome. I ran into the house to get my video camera (2 min. time)and when I came back, the objects were gone.  I asked my wife what happened and she stated that they just blinked out.  I went South 1/2 a block from my house looking West and Southwest in the sky looking for them.  I found them and they had moved several miles from the point of first sighting.  I started taping them with a Sony digital video camera. The objects stayed in a V shape formation with 2 at the top and what looked like several miles below there was 1.  They kept blinking in and out.  I taped the objects for 12 min.  While taping them, I saw what I thought were things falling out of the sky (during replay I had caught other objects flying around the first 3 objects).  At the last min of taping, my battery was going dead on my camera, and the objects came together and formed a tight V shape and rotated counter clockwise to a line.  My battery went dead after that.  I went into my house to get my telescope to see them and the UFO's had gone when I came back.  Around 2 min time had elapsed. I went into my house and dubbed the tape to a VHS tape and I was amazed at what I had recorded.  I caught more then what I was looking at.  I caught objects that I did not see while taping.  What looked like flashes and falling objects were other UFO's that I did not see.  I had to jog the tape frame by frame to see some of these other UFO's doing manuvers that we as a people could not do with the technoligy that we have.

The wife was alerted to it first, then called her husband to come and watch. They told me that lights would be seen running around the outside of the object, but it was hard to make out the actual shape of the craft. More round in shape they guessed. As the object was very close to their location, they said not a sound was heard coming from it. As they observed the object, it did move along the top of the mountain for approx: a kilometer. It stopped and dropped down behind the mountain rather quickly. That was the last time they saw the object that night.  The on September 3, 2003 at approx: 11:45 p.m. the same object showed up over the mountain, but more towards the south. This time the object did not move in any direction and was observed for approx: 6 to 8 seconds before it dropped out of sight. Again no sound was heard, and the object, or light coming from it was extremely bright. Both of the witnessed said they have never witnessed anything like it before, and was really surprised to see this strange object which they have no explanation for.  HBCC UFO Note: This was certainly not a star, or Mars. The second date of the sighting the object was a good height off the top ridge of the mountain, and if a star it would have taken sometime to drop down and out of sight. Also I asked the local helicopter businesses to see if they had any flying in the area at the time of this sighting. There was none flying at that time. Everything was shut down before dark.

One stayed stationary just above the horizon and the other began an upward climb, but it didn't just go straight up. It curved on an arching path up and over the stationary one.

I didn't want to move 'cause I tought I would miss something and we were afraid that if we went inside to go and get a camera or binoculars or anything to see it closer that we would miss something. But it was over before either of us could do anything.. He went back inside and I was facinated by what I had saw. I have never in my life seen anything like this before and neither has he... I heard sirens later and we saw smoke.. So we went to investigate.. It was near I-20 and it was a trailer house that was totally engulfed in flames.  It was right about where we saw the lights go down.. It was around 12:45 am and there was over 5 fire trucks trying to put out the fire.  I drove by it today and it was rubbles.. I figure if it was from the lights, that maybe there would have been an investigation? I know if we saw them someone else had to of seen the lights too.. Anyhow..

I couldn't see it clearly because a big oak tree was blocking my view.   It was moving at a moderate pace, and appeared to be at least 150 feet up in the air.  I was standing about 300 feet.

As we stood there talking in front of my house,for some unexplained reason I looked up into the sky and as I did, there in the southern sky about 60 degrees off the horizon, were 2 very large brilliant stars situated side by side. I got my son-in-laws attention immediately,and asked him if he knew what these 2 stars where. My son-in-law who is a school teacher could not identify them either.It was a twilight sky, and too early for any stars to appear yet. We stood there puzzled not being able to determine what or why these stars were so visible when there were no ohter stars visible yet. One of the stars was more like golden yellow orange color and the other was a brilliant white star. After what seemed less than a minute,I thought the white star accually moved downward from the other star. I asked my son-in-law if he thought the white star had moved and he confirmed that it did. A second or two later the white star began a more progressive movement downward from the other star. I then realized that this was no star and I ran into the house to retrieve my binoculars making my way out to the backyard patio. As I focused in on the descending star, I could see that it was a brilliant object some great distance away. It was now in a constant slow decent. I then rushed back into the house to grab my video camera. By the this time my son-in-law, daughter and wife were outside and they too had sight of this object moving down. As I returned back into the backyard with my camcorder the object was now very low in the horizon and dropping very fast. I could not locate the object in the viewfinder and lost the chance to get any video, before it became obscured by the neighborhood surrounding tree line. The sighting of this star object lasted 1 minute. As for the other orange star object,it now seemed to move further down from its original sighted position (40 degre! es of horizon)and relocated itself in the southeastern horizon.This star object had moved in the time that my son-in-law and I moved to the backyard from the front of the house. However,neither one of us accually saw it move. At this new position, the orange star object stayed in this location for several minutes. We all went into the house after this. I returned to the backyard and by now I could no longer see it,but in its last location, the planet Mars was now becoming visible. Something strange happened during our observation of this orange star and I find words difficult to explain it. Some people may want to interpret our observation of the orange star as being the planet Mars. To them I will say this; The planet Mars does not make its appearence in the southeastern sky, here in southern California, until 18:45 PM, at which time it first appears at a low 30 degrees off the horizon. It is a faint yellow and is not easy to see at this time. It does not begin to take on a orange color until 19:40 PM, when its position is about 70 degrees off horizon. My son-n-law and I are convinced that these were not stars,flares,meteors,aircraft, balloons or any other objects known to us. I'm a retired Air Force veteran with 24 years experience in aircraft operations. I can honestly say that I can't correlate this to anything I've ever seen. I feel that others may have witnessed this event as well. It was too obvious not to have been noticed. I checked with the 3 local newspapers for any reports the next day. Nothing unusual was reported relating to this starnge sighting. I also contacted the community affairs office at nearby Edwards Air Force Base and they had no reports or similar reports to thier office. For now I choose to classify this as a UFO sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be exceptionally credible.  We were satisfied that he would have been able to distinguish the lights from landing lights on aircraft, a possibility he had considered.

It is rather fun to contribute observations and relevant materials and inquiries from time to time.And I will continue to keep my eyes open - and let you all know what I discover every great now and then,as I walk my puppy - or step out for a quick smoke,gazing up at the stars.  WELL - it seems here in ""Wierdsville"" Ohio,I have yet again experienced something very odd,yet ironically and irritably - vaguely explainable as a possible conventional object,even though it exhibited some really funky attributes.  These experiences are almost paradoxical and self contradictory in nature - blending aspects of the familiarly recognizable and mundane,with the totally bizarre.  One night last week - and again,later this evening,or more appropriately yesterday evening since it is now 4:00 AM by my clock(I'm a night owl),I have seen low flying ""Mystery Planes"" Passing over my nieghborhood at a somewhat low altitude...  Now my area is literally SURROUNDED by small,modest,municipal airports - and why not? - It's the birthplace of aviation. These airports service small aircraft mostly,such as small propeller prop personal aircraft,small business jets,etc..  The nearest airport to me is in Middletown Ohio and services a private airline comprised of vintage WW2 C47 / DC3 aircraft,the type of gull winged,dual propeller prop aircraft used to drop paratroopers at the D-DAY and the Normandy invasions.These planes are pretty good sized,I am aware of their shape and lighting configurations.  They are NO WHERE NEAR the size of a large passenger jet liner such as a Boeing 727 or an L10-11,The DC3s are designed to require less of a strip stretch / tarmac length to land on also.  What I saw tonight,and once last week - appeared to me to be a normally flying,albiet oddly quiet,low,and slow moving large passenger jet liner type of airplane - according to it's light configurations and colors.  It was too dark to see these aircrafts shapes or silouettes on both occassions.  Both ""mystery planes"" I have seen had the typical flashing red landing / belly lights,wing tip lights,flood lights,etc..  So what's so wierd about that-and why are bothering us reporting PLANES here instead of little silver balls and flying saucers from mars?-You might be asking?  WELL-THESE planes that I observed slowly passing low over my nieghborhood had several very wierd characteristrics...  #1 - NO SOUND OF A DISERNABLE JET ENGINE,even though they were low enough to where the engine drones SHOULD have been quite obvious. I may have heard a very VERY low ""humming roar"" or drone sound - but not at the proper volume that it should've been logically / normally - I'de probably have to strain myself to hear it clearly over normal background noise coming from barking dogs,vehicles on the highway near me,etc..  #2 - They appeared to be flying so low as to be coming in on a relatively close landing approach,yet the two airports nearest me that are large enough to land a passenger jet of THAT size are in Cincinnati and Dayton - which are quite a ways away from Trenton.Large passenger jets CAN fly somewhat low over my area on final approach to either of these locations - but NOT AS LOW as these ""mystery planes"" I have observed.  There are NO airports that can service that type of plane or accomodate it's landing near my home - even though the one I observed last night WAS heading in the direction of Middletown's field.The strips that are operated by the local municipal fields are simply too small,too tightly taxable,and far too short!Trying to land a large passenger jet on one of them would be catastrophic!  #3 - The plane I observed last night had it's wing tip lights TOO FAR BACK,as if it's fuselage tapered into a ""Delta"" wing configuration such as the shape reminiscent of a British Dehavilland Vampire fighter jet,a french SAB fighter,or the Concord.I know of no passenger planes - even small ones - that fly around here that have wings of that type.

The pure red color drew the eye. I watched it for 20 minutes the first time. Since I was already outside with my telescope looking at Mars (which was in the opposite sky), I looked at this object through my telescope. I could discern no shape, or even source of the light (was not reflecting light they way lights on standard aircraft tend to do.) Therefore all I could see through the telescope was a ""very red star"" surrounded by darkness. When I looked at it an hour later, it had moved or another one had shown up, I only saw the one light. No flashing, blinking, or moving; one moment it was there, and suddenly it was gone. At first I thought it was a helicopter, looking through my telescope I realized it was not (I would have seen the shape.) Sky was clear overhead with some haze/fog along the horizon (well below the strange light.) This red light barely even twinkled, adding to the strangeness. I am baffled. This light didn't do anything at all. I just recognized it as a ""star"" that shouldn't be there, and a ruby red star at that. If I am to guess the altitude, I would say 30,000 feet? This did not seem to be a very high altitude object. I am a longtime amateur astronomer and and able to tell the differences between aircraft, helicopters, dirigibles, migrating birds, etc. If this was one of ours, it must be something new.

It flashed and skipped to a new point in the sky, then in a flash it skipped back to the same spot. This was all happening below the cloud level. It seemed to have no set destination to its path.

It was strobing White-Red-slight blue lights then all of a sudden it slowed way down and then we seen it split into 2 small strobing lights. The more we looked at the strobing lights, the more than seem to just simulate a plane. You could definitely tell the difference after awhile. They were more of a fading light. The 2 lights moved opposite direction and then the 2 split again into 4 strobing lights. Moving opposite of each other again. They almost seem to dance in the night sky. If you were to blink at the wrong time, you would have missed them split, it was that fast. All of a sudden, from the north, came some planes that appeared to be headed to that part of the sky. My girlfriend, seen the lights splitting and she stated she seen them split again. There was a few more planes that came in pretty fast with the activity. I don't know if they seen the activity and wondered what was going on, or they were trying to fly by to cover up the unusual activity. One could only imagine!

I asked if I could call to see if I was able to get anymore details on the sighting.  Everyone agreed and I called.  I talked to her husband, the witness who watched something fly through the sky.  The witness said the object would have been seen both in Washington State and in British Columbia.  Between 8:30 to 9:00 p.m. the fellow took his dog outside so it could do it's business. It was a clear night and he was looking up at the stars.  The fellow saw a strange light fly across the sky, which he first thought might have been a satellite.  The object/light was traveling west to east.  He said it was just a little smaller than the planet Mars, but very bright. The witness mentioned it traveled on a straight line, but the strange thing was, it moved from side to side as it moved across the sky.  His thoughts were of a Jet Ski bouncing up and down over the waves, but in this case the light was moving from side to side. The light was a faint blue/white in color.  No tail was noticed following behind. The man also described the light as being spherical in shape.  Although it was rather high up, the witness did not believe it was as high where one would find a satellite.  No sound was heard, no response from his dog after the light passed overhead.  The light was extremely bright and as it moved towards the east and it just faded out.  The sighting lasted between 30 and 40 seconds. Thank you to the witness for the report.

This is the second time I've seen a bright silver, sphere disappear in the skies but the first time was in August of this year while we were in Dresslerville, Nevada. At that time, my daughter seen it too however it disappeared to me but she swears she still could see it at which time we turned left away from the object - that day was also clear, no clouds and around 90 degrees. I've had many questionable sightings but one amazing sighting in June of 1975 in Bonney Lake, Washington coming down Highway 410 into Sumner. That also was a bright sunny day without any clouds. This craft was silverish and saucer shaped but with a dome on top. At the bottom of the dome was huge bright lights that reminded me of strobe lights, blinking around the bottom of the dome. My stepdad (non-believer) brought it to my attention and as I looked out of driver's side window I was totally astonished to see this. This craft stayed nearly parallel with us as we almost reached the 2nd exit to Sumner. It sped up and was over the Rivergrove apartments when it just vanished. This sighting lasted about 10 minutes and I've been searching the skies ever since. ((NUFORC Note:  One of five reports from same witness.  PD))",2003-09-28T00:00:00,47.17250000000001,-122.1845

At the above noted date and time, my wife and I were attending a concert at the Gorge Amphitheater in George, Washington 98848. The artist, James Taylor, had just returned from intermission and was beginning the first song of the second set when I looked upward to the stars. I noted the location of the North Star to the right of the stage, then looked over my right shoulder and noted the location of Mars. I then lay back in the grass and just watched the sky for several minutes while the artist performed. As I was looking upward, I observed a satellite rising from the Southeast, to the east of Mars location in the sky. According to the NASA Liftoff website, there were three satellites visible to the East from this zip code within this time frame: Cosmos 1340 from 20:32:34 pm to 20:45:16 pm, Lo 19 from 20:37:59 pm to 20:52:37 pm, and Cosmos 1674 from 20:40:32 pm to 20:54:04 pm. I only observed one of the above listed satellites and it rose from the left side, or East side, of Mars: the only satellite listed above that matched the trajectory of the satellite I observed is Lo 19. I am listing this information for the following reasons: I was not wearing a watch and have only an estimate of the actual time of the observation; The second object I observed from this location was on a similar trajectory and was approximately the same observable size.  A few minutes after Lo 19 passed, I observed the second object, approaching from approximately the same area of the sky. It appeared to be approximately the same size as the first object I observed. Although it was red in color, I assumed it was another satellite. As it moved North across the sky, I noted the velocity of the object was considerably greater than the first object and I called my wife&#8217;s attention to it. I pointed out the object to my wife and we both observed as it continued in a straight trajectory for approximately 2-3 seconds then turned right, to the east. It continued on to the east then began to turn randomly to the left and right, finally turning back toward the area where I had first observed it. It moved in a straight line for a few seconds then began turning randomly again, moving farther South East and disappearing on the night horizon.  The object was red in color with a light aura or haze around it that extended out approximately twice the width of the object itself, becoming somewhat brighter at the edge, which created a ""ring"" effect around the object.  The object moved in what appeared to be perfectly straight lines with no observable arch. The turns were rapid and precise, never less than 90 degrees as I recall, and the object neither accelerated nor decelerated before, during or after each turn.",2003-09-28T00:00:00,,

Hi Brian,  I was sitting outside facing west when a huge saucer, 4 times moon size, materialized out of nowhere right in front of me. I was not looking in any way just listening to music and relaxing after a 10 hour day of splitting firewood. This object of intensive white color did have a saucer shape and the outline was in light red. The object must have been only 35-40 meters, or even closer,  away AND it was not sitting still but moving up and down. I got very scared and my heart started pumping like crazy..I am still shaking.. The whole scenario lasted for only 15 seconds before the saucer became invisible.. There was some heat coming from it and it stank like rotten eggs...sulphur like smell but somehow different!!

It was just around dusk and must have been in late summer. We took our break at 7:00 pm and were about three miles from our destination in heavy traffic. We were both used to seeing planes and helicopters in the sky as NYC gets a lot of air traffic and the area where we were looking in lower Manhattan was a popular flight path. But this thing was zig zagging in the sky and then coming to a complete stop. It seemed impossible. My partner is a veteran of the armed forces and he and i had never discussed the subject of ufo's. We kept our eye on the object while speculating as to what kind of plane could be capable of that kind of flight and why it would be doing that in what is a heavy air traffic corridor but could come up with nothing. We continued to drive south, in the direction of the object when we saw it change path. While it had been zig zagging from east to west and back again it suddenly started to head north in our direction. We were stopped at the red light and i cannot tell you how but it must have been moving very fast because it just seemed like all of sudden it went from an indistinguishable bright object to a huge triangle with many, many round lights on the bottom of it and it was directly overhead. My partner and i each had our heads out our respective windows just saying 'what the @#&@!% is that thing!?'. There so many lights. There must have been three rows of lights following the shape of the triangle. The lights were completely round, big and gave no glare. We could make out no landing gear, no windows and it made no sound. It was dark silver or gray-silver in color. No one on the street was looking up but this woman in a jeep who was stopped at the light next to us (we were high up in a van) looked up when she saw our expressions and she got the same look we must have had, laughing and yet dumbfou! nded at the same time. The light changed and the object continued north overhead and we went to work and told our supervisor who didn't really believe us. But i swear this really happened. To this day, if you walk on the streets of NYC you will see that New Yorkers just do not look up. I can't explain why neither my partner or i didn't yell at people to look up, but i think we were just too shocked and trying to make sense of what were seeing and then the light changed and it was gone behind us. I think it was huge because we could see it so clearly when it passed over us, yet we hadn't seen it descend and must have been fairly high up. It's hard for me to speculate on this as i have no clue about how to calculate distance and size in the sky.  My partner and i were doing outreach with the homeless at the time this happened. As i said he is a veteran of the army. I have done social work most of my life. We are both New Yorkers. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My husband and I are stationed in bamberg germany for the time being.  One night, while not able to sleep, I was drawn to the window by the sound of a nearby fire alarm sounding.  While at the window, my attention was caught by a bright light in the sky.  At first I had thought that it was just a plane, but noticed that there were no blinking lights of any sort, and that it was a single white light, much too bright to be an airplane.  I watched the light move slowly across the sky in a slight wavy pattern, and then, just east of the big-dipper, increase speed, and dissapear back into space.  I was a bit confused by it and tried to figure out what this object could be.  My only thought was a low-orbit satellite.  But why would a low orbit satellite move in that pattern?  And would it be as bright as what I saw? The next day I spoke whith a few neighbors about it, and told them about what I had seen.  They all too passed it off as a satellite.  Well, the second night, I was in the window again, hoping maybe to see somthing again.  To my surprise, The same light appeared in the sky.  Same type of pattern, but a bit more north.  The only real difference was that it appeared exactly one hour prior to the time it had the day before.  At this point, noticing the time of the appearances, I thought it must be a satellite.  The next day, I again told my neighbors of it, and we arranged to all meet outside that night so that I could show them what I was seeing.  So when meeting, just as expected, it showed up in the sky, a bit more north and exactly an hour earlier.  After my neighbors had seen it, they all agreed against me that this couldn't in fact be a satellite.  The pattern, the amount of light it projected, none of it reflected a satellite.  Well, the days continued, and it moved a bit north everyday, and was exactly an hour earlier everyday.  Although, the last day it was seen, there was a change.  The first sighting was at 2:30 am, this last sighting was at 8:30 pm, on sunday the 27th of July.  I wasn't the person to see it, but my neighbor said that while she was outside, she noticed it.  This time it was still daylight, and it seemed to appear on the same path, but this time it had moved south. almost as if it was back-tracking.  She also said that directly behind it was a jet.  I still would like to think that this was merely a low-orbit satellite, but my neighbors disagree.  We don't know where to look for answers on the subject.  I was hoping that a web-site such as this one might be able to give us some clues. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS overflight at 03:20 hrs. on this date.  We do not know what the witness observed.

Peter Davenport requested that I re-send my report and have it posted on the 8/16/03 ""Three Dark Objects"" entry from Houston, Texas. Here is my report:  While enjoying a sunny afternoon in our backyard swimming pool in southeast Houston near Pasadena, others and I witnessed up to three unidentified, dark objects for a sustained amount of time.  Our experience started in late afternoon (between 4:00 & 5:00) when our neighbor's 10-year old daughter looked up in a mostly sunny and clear sky to see a dark, round-looking object. My 9-year old son, wife and I also saw the object. It was too far away to determine what it what. At first, I thought it to be a small cluster of balloons set adrift. But I noticed that it was stationary, which would seem unusual for free floating balloons at this altitude. Even after viewing the object with low-powered binoculars, I was unable to determine what it was. With my binoculars, though, I was able to notice that it was not completely round and had a irregular shape to it. Though the object was not moving, it swayed occasionally from side to side to show that portions of its body had a lighter color on it. During our sighting, a small-engined airplane flying at a low altitude of 200-300 feet went across our viewing area of the object. The mysterious object looked like it was far higher than the plane.  After viewing the object being stationary for about ten minutes, it slowly moved across the sky, still unable to determine what it was. Once again, it stopped. Several minutes later, my neighbor's daughter pointed out two other dark objects stationed further away from us. They seemed to show the same characteristics of the first object. The latter two objects appeared to be miles apart from each other and eventually made slow movement toward us and the first object. Into 30 minutes of this usually sighting, the first object once again moved slowly across the sky and stopped. The three objects never got close to each other.  In time, my attention returned to our backyard activities. 45 minutes after seeing the first object I looked up to the skies and could no longer locate the objects.  My wife also has no explanation to what she saw that afternoon with us.",2003-09-12T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

I took a call from a witness who is living in Laval Quebec. He reported on October 13, 2003 that he was with his family driving back home on a very over cast night, with only a few stars shinning though some open patches through the cloud cover. He said it was so strange, he spotted two lights where he could see no stars shinning due to the cloud cover in the direction he was looking. As soon as he saw the two lights, another passenger in the car then noticed almost right away on his left side (drivers side) two more bright lights which appeared out of no where and were a little higher than the first two.  He mentioned that they drive by this same area almost everyday and have never notice seeing any lights before in this area  The witness also told me there is an electrical plant, I believe he meant a power sub station/transmission towers and the lights were sitting low over the power outlet. As they were watching, and making a left turn onto another road one of the passengers in the car said, ""the lights are moving.""  They stopped the vehicle and started to watch. All of a sudden the lights changed, and in the witnesses words, they changed into the shape of a large triangular craft. All the lights which were first noticed were all white in color and one single red light at the bottom of the object in the middle. As mentioned above, he said the object was very low, he told me his best guess would have put the object some where around 200 meters off the ground and right above the power station/transmission towers. They observed the whole event for approx: 3 minutes.  As it started to move away from the area, it first would move slowly then picked up speed very rapidly and went out of their line of sight. The fellow told me this thing moved very easily, like sitting on a cushion of air.  The gentleman said, this was a life changing experience for him.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

This time around it did not appear in the exact same spot the two consecutive nights, rather it appeared in slightly more easterly tonight than it did last night.  Last night there was what sounded like a single engine plane that cut a wide berth around the object, but then went on its towards Louisville.  The thing looks a lot like the North Star times five, though it blinks wildly between white, red, blue, green, and yellow...but mostly looks white.  Having observed it for many nights now, I've almost got myself convinced that it's a particularly bright star.  But this is impossible.

After I verified in my software(The Sky) that there was nothing of that magnitude other than Mars in that area of sky, I went to set my telescope up to try and photograph the object.

I'm 20 years old and I live in a rural area in northwest corner of Covington County Alabama. My home is about 30 minutes west of Ft Rucker which is a military installation that is the top training ground for helicopters in the US.  That information is important because I'm fairly familiar with the racing lights in the sky that often come with living near air force bases that are used heavily for combat training. It's not odd to go out into the night air and see several flashing lights floating around with the stars.  That being said I'll begin my account of the last two nights. I stayed up all last night in effort to cram for a biology midterm(I'm a big fan of science, a believe in natural causality and a doubter of the supernatural, but I'm still interested in it I assure you, but as a man of logic it makes perfect sense that there would be other intelligent life in this universe.) I walked outside 4 or 5 times last night in order to take a break and get some air, I noticed in what I think is the eastern sky near Orion, a light that was flashing red/blue at an alarming speed, it didn't seem to move. I found it curious but I turned my eyes back to the world of Biology and didn't think twice about it.  Tonite I am again up studying calculus and I just made the first of what I'm sure will be multiple trips out into the night, and what I saw moved me to the point that I decided to email you. I looked back to Orion and saw that the light was still there, but to my shock not far above it was another and a ways to the left there was another, much brighter. I then scanned the sky and counted another 9 or 10 scattered in all directions. These lights are in no way familiar to our area. They also were not moving, but all flashing in the same manor.  I called my friend ((name deleted)), who also lives in a secluded area about 10 miles south , and asked him to take a look into the stars. He saw them as well and it startled him just as it had me. He went a step farther and got out a pair of binoculars and found three rows of tiny blinking lights near the big dipper, I followed his lead and found the same thing.

I then jumped from my bed and went to the southern window of my room and was looking east to the alley way and noticed that our alley light was at a low glow.  I assumed that the momentary power outage caused the pud alley light to shut off (or the bright flash trip the optical light sensor).  I then threw on my jeans and went to the front yard (approximately 30 to 45 seconds elapsed from the time of the flash to my being in my front yard).  Standing in my front yard looking up there was no sound, no swooshing noise or low frequency pulsing.  The neighbors dog three houses away was barking.  I returned to my bed room at approx. 1:30.  The next day I enquired of the neighbors if they had heard any unusual noises that morning.  The one neighbor remembered hearing what she thought was sometype of machine and she recalled thinking that she should go and ! check to see what was making the noise but she had her 1 year old grand daughter with her and chose to go back to sleep.

That is surmise on our part.  PD)) Tripod shaped object with red,  blue, and yellow/white flashing lights hovering and or moving over the east valley. While visiting with friends, one stated that he had been observing strangely lighted objects in the sky over the course of the last few weeks (he observed these in Apache Junction aprx. 20 miles East of this sighting). So we went out to take a look and he didnt even need to show me, I saw right away what he was talking about. There were about five with one of them being either larger then the others or just closer. They all eminated from first glance what appeared to be three lighted orbs in a triangular shape and flashing/sometimes sparking off blue red and yellow lights, the red lights seemed to be on the sides(vs. the apex of the structure) It was difficult to make out how many there were because they did resemble a bright star or a planet. But the give away was the red lights on the tips and the fact that they ""seemed"" to move around. The important one to talk about it the closer or larger one...this one was off to the right (south east) of the others. It was bizarre, it also had the tripod like shape from the naked eye but when you used binoculars, you couldn't make out a shape, just flashing red blue and yellow/white lights, flashing quickly and it seemed to look like panals of lights, like six panels three on top and three on bottem with no shape in between, but from the naked eye there seemed to be shape that changed sometimes it looked like probes would be circulating around the object it also seemed like there was a hazey white area that would extend out of it like fog or steam but it would be just for an instant...also you couldnt tell if the craft was moving or not and at one time it seemed to be moving quickly towards our direction only a few seconds later to seem evern farther away then it was before, it also seemed to be ""dipping"" part of itself in and out of the clouds or the haze that it was producing, at one point the object looked as if it turned on its side and without a doubt I made out two wing like shapes that were very long and pointed they were shaped like long d! iamond shaped swords, they were narrow it made the craft look sort of geese like, but then out of nowhere its shape became enigmatic again. with out a doubt, what we saw was not a natural part of the constellation (i.e. star, planet) we just thought it might be interesting to see if  others had similar sightings and from what we see, it looks like whatever we saw tonight others in the area and south. cal have been also sighting these red blue and yellow white flashing things. well if there is any thing we can do to help let us know. Thanks. Oh our background is, well we are all twenty somethings with 2 of us having B.A. degrees with some grad school classes. I personally am a very overworked and busy single mother of three who trust me doesnt need more drama in her life then what is already present. The things that we saw (they are still there right now, same place) they were definantly strange and not anything that we could explaing through our experiences. We will try to video tape objects tomorrow if they are still around…",2003-09-17T00:00:00,33.42126454293629,-111.772797322253

Again, I was in the front yard playing my guitar when my dog barked to the west.  There was no moon and the stars were shining brilliantly.  In the same location as before, approximately 3 miles west of I-10 and some 3-5000 feet high, were 4 orange orbs, hovering.  They would occassionally disappear and reappear in the same location.  This went on for about 10 minutes when the one on the far left (south) reappeared even further south.  The second one from the north did not reappear.  Eventually, and I'm not sure when, the one on the far south could no longer be seen.  I am not sure if it is due to obstruction or if it had disappeared.  I did get some pictures which are not developed yet, I will at my earliest convenience.  However, I was using an SLR and the film that was loaded.  At 400 and without a tripod at night, I can't imagine the photos turning out, but we'll see.  Anyway... I watched the two orange orbs for around 20 minutes while I took pictures.  At one point, it appeared as if there was a string of lights beneath the one remaining to the north.  The string appeared to be in parallel with my angle of view as they were extremely close together and slightly at an angle going from upper-right to lower-left.  I am guessing there were 4 or 5 in the string.  As in my previous post, they seemed to disappear when known man-made aircraft entered their airspace.  But when the aircraft left, they would reappear.  I ran out of film and turned my back on the lights to get my other camera, when I emerged the string was gone.  The single orb to the north was now very low on the horizon, lower than the mountains to the west so I know for sure they are closer.  I managed a few more photos using my truck as a resting point for the camera.  I also forgot to mention that at one point two of the orbs were very close together.  I'm still a little excited by this, but hopefully my pictures will help me piece the order! of things together.  Unfortunately I have no other witnesses to corroborate my story.  Suffice it to say, they were exactly the same in shape, size, brightness, and activity as the orbs of my previous post.

PD)) Wobbling bright ""twinkling star"" exhibits white/yellowish light along with bluish and red randomly flashing lights. Riding in the passenger seat of a car East on Hwy 40 toward Vernal, UT, I watched what I thought to be a very bright star or planet in the low Eastern/Southeastern sky to the right of a 3/4 orange moon.  As the moon rose in the sky and turned to white, the bright star remained in approximately the same position in the sky.  I observed the light intermittently as I gazed at other objects (stars, Mars, the moon, planes).  After approximately 10 minutes of this stargazing I began to think the light was twinkling quite a bit and uncharacteristic of any star or planet I'd ever seen.  I was not aware the driver had also noted the odd characteristics of the light until he asked aloud, ""Is it just me or is that star flickering a lot?""  We both began to watch it in earnest at that point.  We watched the flickering until we lost sight of it as we entered the hills, but not before deciding the white/yellowish light just might be intermingled with intermittent red flashes as well.  We anticipated picking up the sight again once we cleared the hills some 5-10 minutes later, but were surprised to find it was not to the right of the moon where we'd ""left it"".  We continued our drive into Vernal scanning the sky for the same light, possibly tracking across the sky at this point.  Instead we spotted an identical light in the low Northern/Northeastern sky.  We watched from outside the car for a few minutes noting now this light had definite flashes of red.  The other witness got the binocculars and through these I saw definite bluish light as well.  It was also apparent this light was not completely stationary.  It didn't track across the sky, but seemed to ""wobble"" in place.  After some time it became apparent it also moved from side to side at times, but maintained the same general visual position in the sky.  During this time, another identical but brighter light was spotted in the low Western sky.  Through the binocculars the red light on this object almost seemed to be circling around an object and t! he bluish light was even more visible.  This object behaved in the same way, not stationary, but not tracking or moving rapidly.  It disappeared below the horizon at about 23:00, but the light in the Northern sky remained in relatively the same position until we tired of watching it at about 23:30.  The following night of 9/15/03 as stars were beginning to appear, we located the light in the low Northern sky easily just as before exhibiting the same colors.  The light in the Western sky was not as low as the night before, but it was also earlier in the evening.  Unlike the previous night, however, the Western light blinked out numerous times for a few seconds while we watched.  We left these 2 lights in these positions to investigate the posibility of them being satelites as a family member stated he'd heard of ""red white and blue satelite(s)"".  We can not find any information or mention of these on the internet.  The only ""red, white and blue"" accounts were on this website, the most parallel account also occuring in Utah a couple of weeks ago some 3 hours drive time from here.  The account in the Wasatch Mountains above Salt Lake City dated 8/23-8/28/03 is precisely what we saw in color and behavior and location, except we did not see them moving rapidly enough in one direction to say the lights moved out of sight or below the horizon as opposed to the Earth rotating and causing the position change.  I could only surmise the light moved and disappeared below the horizon because the other stars in visual proximaty did not move out of sight during the same time frame.  However, I'm unsure what effect altitude or distance from the Earth might have on an object's position in the sky and movement through the sky from horizon to horizon. I know nothing of satelite characteristics except for the common white light tracking fairly quickly across the sky.  (We also noted 2 of these moving across the sky the night of 9/14,in close visual proximaty to the Western light.) Are these colored, wobbly flickering lights possibly satelites as has been suggested to me?  If so, could you elaborate on the cause of the patriotic colors and odd wobbly movement?  Please do not contact me except to answer the questions I've posed or to request more details of this specific occurence.",2003-09-17T00:00:00,40.54972769230769,-109.5689723076923

This is the third time our family has seen UFO type objects in the 9:00 p.m. hour in our area.  We live down a dead end road in the hills in between Charlotte & Greensboro.  If it wasn't for our yard light, it would be totally black except for the stars and moon.  We see planes in their normal flight patterns fairly high above us every evening, but these sightings are definitely different.  The first sighting was at 9:15 p.m. EST on a Monday, Memorial Day, May 26, 2003, when he walked out to give our dogs some leftovers.  He saw a very large rectangular object hovering at tree level in the east about 1/4 mile away.  It made a strange and scary noise and he hightailed it back to the house.  It just disappeared after a couple of minutes.  The second sighting was the same.  The last sighting last night was odd and unnerving.  We were watching the Monday night game with the front door open, which faces south.  I was bored with the game and glanced out the door and a light caught my eye as it appeared to be below tree level on this side of the mountain behind it heading towards our front door.  I asked my husband what that light could be.  He looked and we couldn't believe what we were seeing.  We called to our 15 year old son and we all went out on the deck to see what it could be.  It was a square type object full of light moving slowly towards us below tree level.  Since we had seen other strange things out here, I ran and grabbed my camcorder.  With the yard light to my left and rear, I was first unable to find the object, so I moved to a dark portion of our deck and picked up the object.  It moved towards us and then turned east and was out of sight very quickly.  There was no sound and should have been as it was within 2000 yards of us.  After it disappeared, we saw a regular plane coming out of the east towards the west and heard it's sound.  My husband and son went back inside the house and I stayed out to see if it would come back.  Within 1-2 minutes, I saw lights coming towards me ! again through the trees from the south to the north and then it turned towards the east and went out of sight.  It didn't seem to be the same type craft as the first time but it could have been.  It happened 5 times ending at 9:50 p.m.  Since my camcorder ran out of battery, I grabbed my binoculars and caught the light on the fifth time.  I noticed that this time it looked like a triangle shape with 2 lights on each wing and 2 in the front center with a red light on top as it banked out to the east in a clearing of the trees.  I worked for Northrop Grumman in the past and it could have been a B2 or something.  It had that shape but it seemed different from the craft we all saw.  Maybe there is some testing or training going on here but the crafts were all silent this time. I am reporting it this time in hopes of finding out what it could have been.  We've only been here for a year, we are originally from Virginia Beach.  Any ideas out there?  The camcorder shows the lights have a square look and haze to them probably because of reflection but comes into view like something else.  There was what appeared to be heat lightning briefly following the sighting.",2003-09-17T00:00:00,35.2149,-80.0023

I am a 37 Y/O male,un-married,no children,currently residing with my immediate family...  I was walking my dog at approximately 10:30 PM (22:30 hours)in my back yard at my current residence - It was dark and had been for some time,I cannot be absolutely sure of the EXACT time of this sighting-but I do know that it was somewhat late in the mid to latter part of the evening,and a clear - or rarely sparsely cloudy night - as the stars were well visible.The exact meteorological conditions could-I suppose-be varified through the Nation Weather Service database..  As I was doing a bit of stargazing - to the northwest of my position at what I would guess would be a somewhat low altitude-I observed a phenomenon that appeared to be a large,bright green meteor like apparition - in scale,about the size of a qaurter at arms length from my perspective at line of sight.The object suddenly appeared,intensified,and then faded or ""blinked out"" within a time span that was a little less than a full second (0.7 to 0.9 seconds).  The object had an appearance exactly similiar in nature to a bright green roman candle fireball falling to Earth,or a bright green rescue flare.The color was similiar to a slightly lighter shade of green than a green traffic signal,and remained mostly that color throughout the sighting.It was travelling at a speed that could be associated with the speed of a pyrotechnic effect like a flare or firework falling to earth.  As the object traversed lower,it began to spit out orange sparks on it's contrailing end before completely fading out.It was traveling at an approximate trajectory inclination of 120 degrees travelling towards the ground(?) with the true horizon line representing 180 degrees as a reference.  I deduced that it was NOT a firework or flare because it's origin was skyward and it was NOT fired initially from a ground source - also - there was absolutely NO sound associated with the object that might be similiar to the ""fizzle""sound emitted by a flare-or any explosions or sounds one associates with fireworks.  Admittedly-the object COULD have been a rather large meteor,but it's speed seemed too slow for me to say conclusively that it was for sure. THAT-and had it BEEN a meteor,then it would've had to have been very large-as I have rarely seen meteors or shooting stars that approached that type of near object intensity.  My impression after a bit was that a close orbit satellite had perhaps encountered problems and re-entered the atmosphere(which IS a valid possibility). I have worked in a metal shop-and am aware than certain alloys with specific chemical compositions CAN produce a green flame under high heat conditions from an arc welder similiar to the color I observed.  The object startled me a little-as it seemed close in proximity to Trenton.If it had been a solid object falling to Earth-then I would roughly guess that it would have fallen to the ground within a radius of around fourty(40)or less - to sixty(60)miles from my position,although that could be an observation based upon natural conditions that could have produced the illusion of local closeness - had this indeed been a meteor.  The light intensity from the object was appreciable-but it did not seem close enough to the ground to illuminate any type of ground structures or clutter.",2003-09-17T00:00:00,39.4842,-84.489

We were talking about what we saw to my friends husband , when we saw another light in the sky, also in the east. This one was a white light. The light  was bigger than a helicopter or an airplane light. The planet mars was in the sky to the far right. In comparison to size the green ball and the white light was double the size to mars. The ball was traveling south. Movement was slower than a shooting star. The white light was moving very slow. Location was just to the left of where the ball was, it went left, then seemed to go up real slow, then looked like it was either moving in a west direction or east.

The craft's 'wingspread' was an apparent two inches at arm's length.  It had four white lights in a diamond shape at the front, an apparent one quarter inch in size at arm's length, and two solid red lights on each of the apparent leading edges.  None of the lights blinked and all were very bright.  We heard the craft coming over the trees at the water's edge before we saw it, so it was apparently flying very slowly.  All were in awe upon seeing it, as it was flying much too slowly to be a 'standard' aircraft, the lights were very bright and distinct, and yet it was apparently high the sky.  The sound it made was that of a very high flying commercial jet.  It was flying west to east, directly toward Duluth, Mn.  Prior to seeing this craft, two of the witnesses had been watching two apparent military aircraft in the distance north of the lake, flying east.  After the craft passed overhead, these two military craft were seen flying very fast southeast to intercept the unindentified craft.  No sound was heard from the military craft, which suggests they were at high altitude, and one of the witnesses, formerly in the military, stated that they were flying above mach speed.  They covered ground VERY quickly.  They then intercepted the unidentified craft several miles away and then flew next to it, while two more military aircraft appeared from the south and also flanked the craft, as it disappeared into the distance.  All of the military craft were much smaller than the object, which dwarfed them.  From this, it was estimated that the size of the object was approximately one thousand feet from wing tip to wing tip.  Thirty minutes later, at 12:30am, several military craft were seen coming from the east, circled the area, and then joined with a group of aircraft following the exact path of the first object, and attempting to fly in the same triangular pattern, apparently in a attempt to show that the first object was only a military excercise.  Again at 1:34am, two more military aircraft circled the area, this time close enough that through a binoculars they could be identified as fighter jets (the lights on these aircraft made structure visible), and again they joined with a formation of other aircraft flying the exact path of the original object, and in a triagle formation.  All witnesses thought this situation had an element of high strangeness about it.  In one hour and thirty five minutes, twenty six aircraft were observed, including the original object.  It is believed that twenty five of the aircraft were 'normal' military craft.  The witnesses have been in this area during the summer for many, many years, and have never seen this number of aircraft, either during the day or at night, and hardly ever have seen military aircraft of any kind flying overhead.  We are not on a normal commercial route and seldom see commercial craft overhead.  It could be that the first two military craft flew in from Minot Air Force base in Minot North Dakota, although this is only speculation.  We were able to video tape portions of the encounter, although we did not get the object on tape as it first went overhead, as we needed to send someone through the dark and into the cabin to retrieve the camera, thus the quality of the video is not very good.  This was the first sighting of any kind for the vast majority of the witnesses.  I'm the only person who has ever seen a UFO, having made a report to MUFON several years ago.  Only one of the witnesses had been drinking alcohol, and that only beer.",2003-09-04T00:00:00,46.6282,-93.2608

I first thought that it was someone with a powerful laser pointer having some fun - the lights moved in a jerky manner, as a light directed from the ground might, but I have tried to shine a laser pointer on the underside of a cloud at night before, and I realize that they are not powerful enough to do this at such a distance.  In any case, I was startled when the lights came to the edge of the cloud formation and did not disappear, as they would have if they were merely lights being shone on the bottom of the cloud by people below on the ground.  The lights instead continued on and quickly vanished over the top of Sandia Mountain.  I waited to see if the lights would return, but they did not.  I turned around and noticed my kitchen clock - it was nearly midnight, so I would put the time of my observation at around 11:55 P.M. Mountain Time.  It was only after the lights vanished that I realized that they had moved without making a sound.  With the low-hanging clouds tonight, if it had been military or civilian jets, they should have made a noise I could hear.  Also, I believe that jets have blinking lights - these were on steady and bright.  Also, jets tend to move in a straight line - these lights jerked back and forth, not a lot, but far more than a jet could do.  I have never made any kind of a report before, and this may mean nothing, but it was interesting.",2003-09-04T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

This was very exciting so I called the local news station Fox 11 news and I got a hold of somebody at the breaking news desk.

As I was fixing my rootbeer float, my dad came storming in to the cabin yelling of a UFO. I immediately ran out to see what everybody was looking at. I looked up and saw this large slow moving craft that made a low rumbling sound, like a passenger jet at 30,000 feet. The craft had a flying wing appearance with 4 red lights on the trailing edges, 2 on each side spaced evenly across its wingspan. 4 white lights in a diamond pattern were focused near the center and were equally as bright. It was flying slow enough and/or low enough that the sound was not delayed but seemed to emanate directly from the craft. Holding my hand out above me, the craft was about 2 inches wide in the sky and was moving at a rate of 1 inch per every 2 seconds, and seemed to be accelerating. After about 30 seconds of watching it move in a straight line across the sky, 2 aircraft which appeared to be F15's were moving in on its location at very high velocity. Once both reached the craft one F15 followed off the crafts left wing, and another directly behind it. Both of these F15's had noticeable wing tip lights and a center flashing light, standard to military aircraft. In the distant we could still hear the low rumble of the craft yet no sound from screaming the F15's, which suggests they were too far away too hear, which would also imply the scale of this craft was enormous. After another minute or so, we could still see the flashing lights of the following F15’s in the distant, while another F15 flew overhead at very high velocity toward the craft in the distant. From then on we saw an occasional pair of F15’s which looked to be in a search pattern across the sky. Not more than a half hour later 4 military aircraft flew over head in a formation that looked similar to the craft that flew over, yet only a single white light in the center, one red light to the right, and 2 red lights way too far off to the left. All had flashing lights. They looked as though they were trying to “copy” the lights of the first craft. A! lthough, it was obvious these were F15’s or similar because they were traveling at much higher velocity and the delay of sound was very long. Within a time span of an hour, 2 more F15’s had circled around and met up with yet another formation of five F-15’s that closer matched the look of the first craft, yet even this time it was obvious again that these were more F15’s in a V-formation at high altitude, high velocity, and long delay of sound.

The craft in question came out from behind the tree line above and out in front of us heading NNE.  If I was to hold my fingers out at arms length and about 2 1/2 inches apart, that would be about the size it appeared in the sky. The sound was a low rumble like you would hear from a jet liner going over, except that the sound was coming directly from the source, as opposed to trailing the aircraft, which makes me think that it wasn’t very high in the sky, but yet I would estimate it at between one and two miles. It turned to the east and continued on until it was out of sight. As far as the shape, I would say it was like a B2 bomber but would have had to have been bigger. A little before we saw this my brother and nephew had noticed a couple smaller aircraft flying around to the north of the lake. As the big one turned to head east, the two screamed across the sky and met up with it a ways out. We could not hear the smaller planes so they must have been pretty high up. On a normal night we may only see one to four planes on average, and knowing how slow they move across the sky I thought that the two planes must be jet fighters because they crossed the sky quickly. Within an hour later 2 smaller planes came back from the east and we watched them thinking that it may be the same two that had caught up and escorted the big one. They had made a couple of turns, which again made me think that they were not commercial planes ( again, what we normally see up there are commercial planes that fly high over head in a perfectly straight line.) Anyway then we heard planes overhead and saw four planes flying in ""V"" formation and trying to follow the same route as the big craft flew. The formation looked like they were trying to make it look like it was what we saw earlier, but was obviously not. After a while and seeing a few more planes jetting around the sky I went to bed, but was told that everyone that stayed up saw one more display of the ""V"" formation a little later. A few key points to myself are. 1) We normally will only see one to three planes per night. We sit out at the campfire every weekend looking up at the stars and counting satellites, so it’s not like we don’t look up. On this night we saw in excess of 20 planes, all after 11:45 p.m. 2) The big craft appeared to be flying too slowly for something that big. 3) The fighters that screamed across the sky to intercept or escort. A couple of questions. 1) What was this large craft? 2) Would the airforce admit to flying ""training exercises"" or anything else? 3) Is it possible that this large craft was below radar and the other planes were waiting for it to show itself, and we saw it as it was going up and the two smaller craft streaked toward it when they picked it up again.  Lastly I would like to mention one thing that may have nothing to do with this but may be worth mentioning. About an hour earlier than the sighting of the big craft, we heard loud commotion back in the woods maybe a mile or more that sounded like many coyote’s or wolves howling or fighting. This went on and off for about a half an hour or so and ended shortly before seeing the big craft. These sounds were coming directly in the area of where we saw the craft come from. Probably just a coincidence ((NUFORC Note:  The date of the sighting was August 30.  We have amended the data above.  PD))",2003-09-04T00:00:00,46.6282,-93.2608

We could hear it coming before we saw it. It was around midnight so it was dark and all you could see was the lights. There were four white lights on the rear of the craft in the shape of a diamond and two red lights on each wing, Maybe one on the end of the wing and one in the middle of the wings. None of the lights were blinking like all the other aircraft in the sky today. The lights on the wings were angled back so you could tell that the wings were swepted back like a jet. It reminded me of a Stealth only in a much much larger scale. At first I thought it was more than one plane flying in formation but the lights would'nt have made any sense, because there would have been only one plane with the four white lights on the back of it and four other planes flying with only one red light. So it came to our conclusion that it could only be one plane. Antway it continued across the lake and at that point we could see two other planes coming across the sky at a very fast rate of speed to meet up with it and fly almost like escorting it till it was out of our sight. About twenty minutes later a squadron of planes flew over us in the same exact spot and the same direction almost like they were trying to duplicate what the other had just done. Only the precision flying wasn't there, and the lights were blinking on these planes. They had red and white lights on them too. Only each plane had red and white lights on them. After a while another squadron of them flew the same way and a little while another squadron. All of these planes had both red and white lights blinking on them.

Mass Sighting:  Tonight on September 2, 2003 I had a call from a gentleman who lives 30 minuets northwest of Barrie, Ontario. The witness reported that he and his wife were driving out of Barrie on their way home and recorded the time as being 12:29 a.m./12:30 a.m. from the clock in their vehicle. The fellows wife was driving and he was in the passengers seat. As they drove along they suddenly were enveloped in a very high intense white light. The witnesses reported that the light was coming from behind them. The husband first thought it might have been a O.P.P. cruiser with their spot lights on. But they soon realized that it was something very unusual due to the light growing in size around there vehicle and the surrounding area. Also the couple mentioned it all took place very quickly, in approximately five seconds went by before the event was over.  The witness said the light was so intense that it lit up the whole hemisphere. They said from their location on the highway they had a beautiful view of the area and the whole sky was lit up. His wife who was driving looked into the outside rear mirror and observed an object coming up from behind them with three colored lights on it. (In the sky)  His wife reports that the lights were orange, red and green in color. Also they added that the white light which engulfed their vehicle was so bright that they had a very hard time seeing where they were going. Also their were a number of cars on the highway at the time and everyone hit their brakes as the witnesses noted all of the car's brake lights came on. The fellow said their had to have been some 10 or 12 vehicles on the road at this time due to the long weekend.  Just as his wife glanced into the mirror and saw the three lights behind their car, there was an explosion of this bright intense light and then it disappeared. All the light was gone, and not a sound was heard throughout this whole event. They did mention to me that the vehicle's windows were rolled up and they were listening to music.  After the couple arrived home and started thinking about what just took place, they wondered if an aircraft had exploded as they were trying to make some sense of what they witnessed. He told me it was a clear night so know lightening was around. The fellow said they saw some neighbors sitting outside, so he went over and asked, did any of you see that bright light? All of the neighbors said yes, and commented what the heck was it. Others who were camping around the area also witnessed it. Pilots who were on the ground at the time, saw it. Also the T.V. and radio stations were reporting it as well and a number of area residents had called in reporting they saw this very bright light which lit up the whole sky.  Anyway gang, there is a lot more to come of this sighting. This is just the first of a few reports I will be making on this event.  Thank you to the witnesses for their report.

The area I live in is very quiet, so it was unusual to hear an airplane, especially one loud enough to wake me up.  I went to the window to look outside (my bedroom faces west) and I saw a bright light in the sky.  It seemed too large to be a star and it wasn't moving like an airplane.  Instead, it stayed stationary.  As I watched it, I noticed that the light would be bright one moment, then it would be gone, then it would be bright again and then it would be gone.  I watched for about 10 minutes with the light pulsing on and off until it finally disappeared. The time between the light appearing and disappearing was probably around 5 or 10 seconds.  Since that morning, I have looked in the sky each night to determine if it was a plane or a helicopter that I saw.  The planes I've watched since then don't stay stationary that long and they fly across the sky along a particular route.  I don't know how long helicopters can remain stationary, but the object I saw seemed too high in the sky to be a helicopter.  I have also checked to see if there are other lights in the same area that I may have misinterpreted for this object, but all of the lights that I have seen (from houses and buildings)are much lower in the sky than the object I saw. I also thought that clouds could have intermittently covered the object and made it appear that the object was flashing on and off, but I believe the skies were clear that morning.  Because I haven't seen anything in the sky like this before, I thought I would report this to you.",2003-09-12T00:00:00,47.82623459119497,-122.3462679245283

I was told about a sighting report which comes out of Barriere, British Columbia. There was one witness to this event which took place on September 3, 2003 at approx: 11:10 p.m. A lady had been outside and was making her way back into their home when she happened to glance up and saw a huge cylinder shaped craft flying very quickly, she claims it was really low. This witness told me that even with it being dark out, you couldn't miss seeing it. It was larger than any aircraft that she knew of, looking at it length wise. She said there were a large number of bright white lights on it. Her thoughts were maybe these were windows and they were running down the full length of the object. There were no wings noticed on the craft and when I asked more questions, she said it actually reminded her of a long tube. No sound was heard and the sighting lasted for approx: 5 seconds.  At the time of the sighting her boyfriend was inside their home and he reported to his girlfriend that their cat went nuts when the object passed by. Of course he had not known about the craft until his girlfriend told him, and he mentioned about the cat at that time.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

At 7pm we decided to take the half mile hike up to North Horn to watch the sunset. After watching the sun go down i turned to look to the East for Mars. In the northeast a flash of light caught my eyes. It happenned several times an at first thought it may have been a firefly playing tricks with my eyes. Flashes got more frequent an we all began to see them. They appeared to be out in the distance 10-15 miles out against the shadows of the next ridgeline. The flashes were very bright alternating between blue/white and orange. The patterns were random. We at first were convinced they were explosions from military testing. We ruled that out knowing that the fire risk was to high for such activities. The lights most certainly were not planes or flares. The flashes varied slightly in intensity. The area we were watching was roughly in the area that the Appalachian Trail would be heading after it left the Bigelow Preserve, toward the Forks area of Maine. Among the flashes we could make out what appeared to be a red antenae like object that was not flashing but glowing. My two friends thought they also saw small objects in the sky being illuminated by the brighter flashes. After 15 minutes or so we were more than a little ""freaked out"" by what we were watching and decided to make the half mile descent back to camp. I know that this is pretty out there but it was a very clear night and all three of us watched for a good amount of time. I would love any info that anyone has abouth this phenomena.

Ten times faster than any jet we've seen.  Also it had red and green lights that were very bright and visible.  It passed over us so fast.  Too dark so couldn't make out a shape.  How could we go about finding out what that was?  Is there such an aircraft?  Not sure what we saw.  Neither one of us is really a believer in UFO's.  If it's a legitimate aircraft, how can we go about identifying it?  Oh, just remembered another detail.  At the time of this sighting we had the hot tub on which is kind of noisy.  When we sighted this object we heard no noise from it, which usually you could hear a jet over the hot tub motor.  We turned off the hot tub and still heard nothing.  Very strange and has made us wonder.  Please advise of a source to ID this and weather there's such a ""legitimate"" aircraft that fits this description.

It lasted for just a couple of seconds once I awoke and seemed to fade out but at the same time a long drawn out buzzing started.  It was more similar to a musical note than a mechanical buzzing - the buzzing tone you hear from a tuning fork as it rings in your ears.  It was moving around outside and I thought perhaps a street sweeper was out there but there were no other noises, just the buzzing hum.  No engines, no radio, nothing else.  My dog was under the covers shivering which is very unlike her.  She is a terrier and usually has no fear; just growls or barks at all night noises.  I got up to look out the window but saw nothing on the ground or in the sky.  I still heard the odd humming noise that was moving around in the distance.  It would fade out and become louder.  It stopped for a couple of minutes and then started again and finally quit altogether.

They moved very slowly and she thought she saw red & green lights like the landing gear of a plane but when she got the binoculars, she noticed more colors of lights.

About an hour ago I had a fellow telephone me from Terrace, British Columbia to make a report, he said they had heard me on the radio speaking about UFO sightings in the area. He and his fiancée were on their way home, which is in the Thronhill area of Terrace when they spotted a strange object hovering high in the sky.  The couple were driving along Crumb Road and looked up just over the trees and high up underneath the clouds they saw the object. He described it as being rather flat, dark gray in color and it sat stationary for approx: one minute before it disappeared. They both saw a number of lights on it, the fellow said he thought there were 5 lights, and his fiancée thought there were 6. All the lights were white in color and the witness said they looked like the headlights on a vehicle. The witness believe the lights were running around the object but was hard to say for sure.  His fiancée thought at first it may have been a plane, but they soon ruled that out because it sat in the same position for such a long time. ""It did not move"". After I asked a number of questions, the witnesses said the object would have been shaped more like a disk in shape. It was rather long, but not a lot of height to it.  I asked the witness if he might give me some kind of idea of the size of the craft. As we know this is not an easy thing to do. The man turned to his fiancée and asked, both said they thought it may have been around one and a half thumbs wide. This was a guess at how long this object may have been. No sound was heard, mainly because the couple were in their vehicle and they may have not heard anything due to the altitude the craft was at. They also reported that the sun was not shinning off it, in other words no reflection off the object.  The couple said after the object disappeared they drove to the airport just to have a look to see if any planes were around the area, he told me there was nothing in the air.

As I began to enter the bend in the road prior to the highway, it was directly over top of us.  There were four lights, with the two on the outsides being slightly the largest.  I could not see a shape  of the object, per say, because the lights were so bright and it was so close.  I told her I was stopping the van when I got out of the curve, right at the highway intersection.  By this time, it was obvious that the object was in fact hovering, b/c i had to look 'behind me', thru the back van window and also in the driver's side window to see it.  It was still up there.  I said, ""Let's get out"".  As I unlocked the doors, I was watching it out of the corner of my eye (I had my head turned slightly left looking out the back side window at it.  We both jumped out of the van.  The very second I turned, it was absolutely and completely GONE.  (This thing was SO CLOSE to the ground, that the lights were almost blinding to look into.  I would have compared the lights on it to vehicle lights, maybe 4 car lengths ahead coming toward us.  It was, however, considerably wider). We literally jumped back into the van, and went into town (it was 8:40 when we arrived at the store, b/c the lady told us she got off at 9PM, in 20 minutes).  We got our few groceries, came back, <still saying NO WAY>, and returned home not seeing it (about 7 min from the store.)  Maybe because of my work background, I told her let's not discuss what it looked like, lets both go home and draw it.  We did.  It was the same thing.  I still have the drawings.  It was UNreal.  She and my husband and I went back out about 15-20 min later and reinacted it as closely as possible.  I turned on all lights in the van, at the area 'it' was seen inust to prove to myself that it was not reflection! from inside the van.  She lit a cigarette, that wasn't the 4 lights.  Nothing made those lights appear again.  This was a craft of some type.  I could just 'sense' it was hovering (well, how else could it be suspended in the sky so close to the ground unless it was in fact a craft, hovering?????)  We are still 'anxious', for lack of better word, still not believing that we saw this odd looking thing.   Both of us continue to say, ""This can NOT be for real!""  But it is.  It was.

I initially thought the largest light was a bright interior light of the helicopter cabin, followed by a slightly smaller light on the rear rotor, topped by the third navigation light, a point source blinking at about 1 or 2 Hz.  After observing it for a second or two, it hit me that the pattern of lights didn't match a helicopter. I didn't hear a sound coming from it, which occurred to me after the event.  There also is a fair amount of freeway noise coming from the direction of the sighting, which may have been drowning out the motor if it were a helicopter.  This object was traveling east to west.

From the description I received I believe this sighting was of the planet Mars. A bunch of folks were observing the Moon and Mars in the Cranbrook, B.C. area. There were some clouds which moved in front of the Moon and the planet Mars, as the clouds moved out of the way before the next batch roll by all the witnesses observed a orange colored moving around the night sky, but where the light was located was in exactly the same position Mars was. I believe when everyone lost sight of the planet due to clouds, and then seeing it again as the clouds passed by, it gave the illusion of the planet moving, or an object as reported to me. Also due to the length of time the light was seen, my conclusion after talking with the witness is that everyone was watching the planet Mars.

I just posted a sighting report for September 3, 2003 which came from a witness who resides in Barriere, British Columbia. A witnessed watched a extremely large craft fly quickly overhead.  Just tonight I had a telephone call from the same folks. The man's wife was outside tending the farm animals and her husband was with her. He takes his video equipment with him on many occasions as he is a sky watcher and does catch some good footage of different things. He also caught some great footage of the forest fires which were burning in the Barriere area.  Tonight on September 10, 2003 at 8:50 p.m. the couple heard a sound coming from the north, when they looked towards that area of the sky they saw a bright white light heading directly in their direction and it passed soundless over top their farm. Both stood speechless ! They looked again towards the north where they could still hear the sound coming from, which at this point was growing louder and louder as it approached their location. Seeing the fellow was so shocked to see what just went over top of them, meaning a large silent bright white light, he never thought to ""try"" to take a bit of footage. But he did say the white moved very quickly and was soon out of their line of sight due to the surrounding area. But as the sound from ""something"" else drew closer and at this point was at the edge of the farm, he started rolling video tape and was surprised to see two large military helicopters fly low over head. He said I don't know what one would call the make of the helicopters, but the two of them were really large and flying in the same direction the light was heading. The witness also told me he has good equipment for his camera and did catch the two helicopters on film. (The footage will be making it's way to me as soon as he can get a copy made up).  (HBCC UFO Note: Due to myself knowing there is a fire in that area, I asked if the aircraft the witnesses saw were anywhere near the fire. The fellow said the helicopters were not even close to the area where the fire is burning. The fire is burning way up on the Bonaparte area and the two helicopters should have been way west of these peoples farm. I also asked one of the witnesses if he knew of any helicopters flying at night due to the fire activity in the area. He said he knew of none flying at night. He did say the run of the mill helicopters are seen a lot during the daylight hours but no military helicopters have been seen in the area. He also added there are military personal in the area and many of us would have heard of this on the news. There are a good number of Canadian troops on the ground fighting these awful fires through the province. I also asked the witness how bad was the fire in the area, and he told me it wasn't bad at all. (There is a bit of important information I cannot give out as it could lead back to one of these witnesses. This bit of information is key to knowing what is flying and isn't). Something else which stuck me as odd. A shor time ago the media, along with the general public were at one location taking pictures of the forest fire. I was told the RCMP showed up and took everyone's film away from them.  I also have heard from people in the Vernon area that the military is buzzing around. Matter of fact the witnesses in Vernon, B.C. said it was if they were on some kind of alert.  I telephoned the Kamloops airport tower just after I talked with the witness, but the airport operations were closed for the night as all I got was an answering machine telling me the hours they operated in. So I will be calling them back first thing in the morning to see if I can get any information on aircraft flying in that area at the time of the sighting. I will also try the Comox military base on Vancouver Island to see if they are flying military choppers in the Barriere area.  So what we have is a bright white light/object flying low over top of the witnesses farm, followed by two military helicopters following at a distance behind the soundless light.  ------  I was just typing this report up, and in came another from Cranbrook, British Columbia and a number of people saw something very strange in the sky September 9, 2003. So I should have the information on this very soon and posted.  Take care  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

It was a quiet street. Something caught my eyes in the sky above me. When I glanced up, I saw 3 bright lights (I thought they're stars at first) in a triangle formation moving at a fairly low altitude. By low altitude I mean an altitude where helicopter might fly at (not plane). My second immediate thought was they could be Canadian geese simply because of the triangle formation and the low altitude they're flying at. Only when I begun to notice the speed that thing was flying at and when I starting to make out the underlying shape of the object, I dismissed the geese theory and I was certain it was somekind of aircraft. Since it was moving at a very quiet demeanour, I basically ruled out helicopter. In addition, I just want to mention that those 3 bright lights weren't blinking at all. Hence, it couldn't be a commercial plane in my opinion. Now, I don't necessary believe that this object is from out of space.

PD)) large ufo -triangle shaped-three lights September 9, 2003:  I was headed home from a friends house tonight in Tampa, Florida on 275 south heading in the eastern direction towards Brandon at 12:30 am eastern time, when a strange light in the sky caught my eye.  I took a second glance and noticed that it looked like nothing I have ever seen before in my life.  That’s when I got concerned and started to pay close attention to it’s details. It started off as a huge ball of light (almost blinding bright) with a rectangular shaped trial tapering off of it which fluctuated in length. It looked as if it had just taken off from somewhere to the west and was headed towards my direction and grew in size. Then this ball of light morphed into three separate lights forming the shape of a triangle which continued to flicker. All three of these lights had distinct coloration’s to them the main most radiant light at the front/top of the triangle was a pale yellow color, the light on the left was a pale red color, and the light to the right  was a greenish blue color.  The shape of the lights were in the form of an acute triangle and just floated with such grace. I turned off my radio and it made no sound. As these three lights got closer they stopped flickering and a from appeared around the lights. The shape was of a triangle craft with the top peak cut off almost in half. The body was a gray color with a gray blue paneling around it. By this time it was hovering over the tree line and was the size of one and a half football fields.  Then as soon as I got a good look at it the ship gradually disappeared, starting a the rear two dimmer lights which faded away like streaks in the sky as if it was traveling at great speeds. The main light gradually diminished in size and raised in the sky as if it took off towards the south east until it fully disappeared. Every thing about this unidentified object was so geometric and precise in it’s shape that it was breath taking. This sighting lasted for about three to five minutes and other motorists on the roads had pulled off to watch this s! trange appearance. Once I got home I called a friend of mine who lives in the Tampa area and told him about the sighting and he confirmed that some in his dorm told him five minutes before exactly what I had explained to him. So I defiantly know I was not the only person aware of this sighting in that area along with the other motorists on the road with me. Let me assure you that I had always felt neutral on the subject of UFOs until what I experienced tonight. Now i am sure that they do exists.",2003-09-09T00:00:00,28.006814358108112,-82.47646101351351

On the bottom of the ""hot balloon image""  was a blinking light.  We watched for awhile and tried to determine what it was. . .we couldn't figured it out. . .because it moved to quickly to be a hot air balloon and not the shape of a blimp and moved much too quickly for it to be one.  Was not the moon because there was a blinking light on the bottom of this aircraft. . .I said it must be an UFO. . .they laughed. . .I said, ""Well it is an unidentified flying object. . .none of us can tell what it is!""  Could this be some kind of alien aircraft?",2003-09-04T00:00:00,40.6987,-74.3296

A very, bright large point of light flashed on for perhaps 1 second or less and then faded. It appeared to be white with a tinge of yellow. It happened at least 8 more times or so at approx. 1 - 2 minute irregular intervals. The event took place in approx. the East to SE sky (relative to us) and approx. 70 - 80 degrees off the horizon. The light appeared each time in the approx. same area. We had tree outlines for reference. The light would ""blink"" on and then seem to do a quick ""fade"". Our last sighting was of the light turning ""on"" but much dimmer this time and approx. 2 -3 degrees to the approx. south of the original clusters. Sky conditions were clear with scattered thin cirrus. No moon. No northern lights. Mars was way, way to the SW from our sighting.

The three objects moved at a constant speed in constant formation to the south and no exsaust trails or sounds where heard. No anti collision lights where seen and no markings could be seen. From my view the objects where smaller and slower than airliners and there was a brief discusion as to the close proximity of the craft, that they could not have been airliners. My neighbor thinks they might have been military aircraft but I do not agree. I was in Navy aviation for many years and am highly trained in observations and understand aviation and air traffic.

I live in an area where we have no street lamps. On several occassions during the past six years about this time of season I have seen  what almost could be mistaken for a tiny star in the nights' sky. Except that it is moving across the sky at a very good rate of speed. It's direction is coming from the South and moving North and sometimes South to Northeast or so. In the past I was by myself when I viewed these things. My thoughts were that it was a possible sattlelite, but on one occassion two or three years back I saw one of these do a tight zig zag pattern as it passed over head. Anyway I had a hunch that tonight I might see one of these Traveling Stars as I began talking to my thirteen year old daughter about my previous sightings. I guess as the conversation tappered off we began to look up into the night sky. It was a clear night. No fog maybe some slight haze and a full moon rising but low enough not to interfere . It was dark in our back yard and we were in the hot tub looking up when by chance my daughter spotted what I had described to her just moments before. So we got very exicited I thought once again that may be it's a satalite. We watched it pass and as it was passing I was yelling to my wife inside the house to come outside and get a look at this thing. I wear glasses and my wife wears glasses but my thirteen year old who spotted it has twenty - twenty. My wife did not make it outside in time. It probably took about fifteen seconds from time of spotting till it crossed over going North till it was far from sight. My daughter asked if it could be a UFO and I said I don't know for sure. It was a school night(09-11-03_ about 21:00)and she after seeing this wanted to go inside. I do not know my GPS location on the map but if this helps I'm located about 40 miles south of San Francisco, California which is SFO= 37deg/37'/5"" North-----122deg/22'/22"" West  Note: One of my previous sightings I called Lick Observatory and inquired about Satalites crossing overhead for the time/date or UFO reports but did not get any definitive answer. Continued: I was now alone and looking up gazing around and was wondering if my wife and I would have some quite time in the hot tub and would'nt it be neat to see some more when there it was again another little star like object traveling probably the same path as the previous one did. I yelled out to my wife and she was near by this time and she came out side with her glasses and I pointed to the proximity in the sky directly over head now and her eyes found the object in the sky and it too went out of sight. A third passed over in the same fashion except it sort of skewed it's course just as it crossed over our area. It's direction headed sort of North by Northeast once it passed over us. Now during that time on the cordless my wife called her sister whom lives in Sunnyvale about 6 - 7 miles North from us and my wife tells me that her sister went outside and she also had a chance to catch a view. But I'm not sure if she saw what we were seeing because she mentioned to my wife that she saw them moving and line up and that there were 4 of them. Decription: These things which I was seeing looked like a tiny greenish stars. It seemed to be very very high in the sky (may be 60 to 100 miles out). Not like a B1 or B52 bomber or jet airliner at 35,000 feet. This was much higher like sputnik or the Space Station which fell to earth some years back. My Thoughts: Some kind of controlled satalite or UFO.",2003-09-12T00:00:00,37.254088571428575,-122.06302285714285

He was watching an obect in the sky, but no one else was paying attention to him.  then he described it as a UFO.  I looked up to spot it, but couldn't.  Then a plane passed and he was trying to spot it with someone else and said, ""there, to the right of the plane"".  At that point, I was able to spot the point of light he was referring to.  I would describe the color as brilliant pink.  TA first I was skeptical and thought that possibly it was a child's baloon because of the color.  But since it was stationary, I soon felt that it wasn't a baloon.  I continued interacting with people at the party and would occasionallylook up at the object.  It was so small, that it was very difficult to locate.

I also had a small fire that I was tending to nearby, the remnants of an old tree that had fallen days earlier.  I was looking at the northwestern sky, noting that it was remarkably clear this evening.  I began to trace out the constellations of Hercules and Corona Borealis, when I noticed that within the adjacent constellation of Draco three previously motionless objects, that I had assumed where stars, began to spread apart in the sky!  These objects resembled stars in relative size, magnitude, and color; however, they spread apart, briefly, and began to travel in tandem across the sky!  I watched them travel across the sky in a triangular pattern until the three objects grew faint and disappeared.  I have seen satellites in orbit, they move faster across the sky.  I have never seen a satellite orbiting close to another.  Certainly, they would not grow faint and disappear.  I have seen high flying planes in the sky, as I live near an airport, however, I have never seen them fly this high or this close, nor did I see more than one light on any of these flying objects.  Their flight lasted 20-30 seconds by my best judgment, I knew immediately that I had seen something extraordinary. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether  the witness may have observed the three satellites, which are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy ""NOSS"" system.   However, those satellites remain in the same apparent formation, and do not spread apart.  Hence, if, in fact, they moved, relative to one another, they probably were not satellites.

The weird thing was it was clear or it did not have a middle (only the outside shape of a triangle).

After it did the U-turn and it was flying horizontally. It hovered over the ground then went straight down and landed.  We could see where it landed though the trees.

I noticed them approaching quite far in the distance and looked like a single light until it approached closer to me It took only 25 seconds to pass by me from the first light I saw and then clear the horizion where it disapeared in the light reflection of the city.  No sound emmitted from the objects as they passed by, as I expected to hear something with the speed in which they were obviously traveling, guessing 1000 kms per hr plus at minimum.

At approx 0:45 hours I was laying on my couch looking out a large picture window towards the North East.  All lights in my house were turned off.  I saw what appeared to be a meteor shower in the northwest sky.  Something about the way the lights were travelling made me quickly realize it was not infact meteors.  I went out my front door and looked to the sky where the light were and watched as they moved positions, almost like how birds flying south do.  There appeared to be 7 of the objects moving at about the same speed but changing places.  The creepiest part of the whole experience was that they didn't seem too far off and they where completely silent.  I am involved with jet car racing and know that to attain a speed like what I witnessed would have to involve some sort of afterburning jet engine that would create and incredible amount of noise at that altitude and speed.  I an located just to the east of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in Sherwood Park and from where I was they appeared to fly from The Fort Saskatchewan area towards the Camrose area.

This morning, at about 3:35 AM, I had a pretty amazing sighting.  I went out in the back yard for a smoke and, as is my habit, I scanned the sky while puffing away.  I noticed a star moving, then another near it.  After checking to make sure it wasn't illusory movement, I noticed a third.  Basically, it was a triangular formation, two lights leading with the third trailing them.  The formation came in from the south-east.  As if that wasn't enough, as the trio passed directly overhead, a fourth ""appeared"", joined the trio, and seemed to drop in altitude (perhaps because it definitely grew much larger and brighter than the other three).  The fourth came in from the east,  then changed course and speed to match the trio; the fourth partner sped off ahead of the trio to the north-east.  The trio followed slowly, taking about 3 minutes to cross the sky and disappear.  (By the way, I say ""trio"" rather than ""HUGE black triangle"" because the stars only semed to dim and blur as the triangular formation crossed them, rather than completely blocking stars as I expect an intervening triangular vehicle would.)  Anyway, I was amazed and felt fortunate.  Nope, I wasn't inebriated/chemically-modified in any way (besides the nicotine).  Just amazed.

Before I forget any of the details I would like to report what I saw. I live in the middle of the city in a highrise apartment building on the 17th floor. I was watching TV and then my husband told me there was sparks at the sky. So he got my attention and I looked out at the window and sure enough there was something peculiar.  At first there was only a few of these red lights or these red star like objects. There was a tall building blocking  a part of my panoramic view of the sky, so it looked like these objects are coming from behind that building.  And then it kept on coming, lots and lots of it...  I'd say hundreds or more, lots of them! And they floated upwards toward the sky slowly, dispersing themselves as they move, distancing themselves from each other (from my point of view). There was no sound and we were just watching it in awe. Never seen anything like it. I'm a UFO skeptic and also a backyard astronomer.  I'd like to call this a natural phenomenon, but nothing fits the description.  What ever it is that I saw I highly doubt that its a meteor shower, because it doesn't come from a point in the sky. Rather it comes from just above the horizon and floated upwards, traveling from west to north of the night sky before it dissapeared slowly.  It wasn't a firework either, there was no noise at all.  I'm pretty sure other people would see it, because it happened in the center of Bangkok.

I off course then explained that it must be a radio/telecommunications satellite, but as we were watching it, it changed direction randomly ( something a satellite does not do - Below is a sketch of the path it followed ) . It then started to accelerate in speed and changed colour ( blue, red, green.  I can’t quite remember in which order - it all happened so fast ) and vanished into thin air.

Full Description of event/sighting: As my boyfriend and I were on our way home from work, I looked up and noticed what appeared to be a plane about to land at the nearby airport. It was V-shaped with plenty of bright lights and was very close to the ground.  As we drove closer, the object appeared to change shape from a V to an oval shape. It also picked up speed and started travelling in the same direction that we were going (east) and by this time it appeared to be quite far off.  I wasn't sure if I was seeing things right - I thought perhaps that these lights were a reflection on the windshield or something but my boyfriend verified what I saw. I was still doubting what I was seeing so I stuck my head out the window because I wanted to see the object with my bare eyes. As we were turning into our driveway, the flying object seemed to stop abruptly and then started to approach out direction (west) and as it was doing so, got much closer to the ground (I'm not sure how low). We got out of the car and stood at the end of the driveway to watch to see where it was going. It hovered and its pattern of lights were changing now from random and extremely fast flashing to 5 bright white lights.  It was really hard to tell how far away the object was at this point but we both new that it was a lot closer than before. It did not appear that the lights were attached by any one object; rather, it was as though they were together in a group formation. As it was hovering it was ""pacing"" north and south very slowly. As we walked closer to the door a red/pink light appeared and it seemed as though it were trying to hide from our sight now. Then as we were walking in the door, it hovered back into our view. I absolutely could not believe what i was seeing. My boyfriend's witnessing to it was the same as mine.  It just so happened that as we immediately turned on the TV in our room, a program came on television that was about UFO sightings. It was too odd to be a coincidence.

I was driving home alone from our local theatre along Highway 3B going south. I was not too far from home and I noticed that a bright light was coming through my passenger window. I looked out the window to the sky and saw the most amazing ""craft"". There were no vehicles directly behind me so I drove very slowly. What I saw was a huge craft in the shape of a V hovering very low in the sky.  There were three lights on each ""wing"" of the V rotating rapidly in circles and creating bright white lights. There were no colours at all in these lights. There was also a very bright light on the ""nose"" of this craft. This thing was absolutely huge. My heart was racing as I tried to explain to myself a scientific reason why it was there. I could not pull my car over so I decided to get home as quickly as possible as I was almost home. I watched in the rear view mirror but could not see anything. I pulled into my driveway and ran to my deck as quickly as possible. This ""thing"" should have still been in the sky but was nowhere to be seen. It was incredible. Has anyone else in this area seen anything like this?  Update:  Hi Brian.  I am a (deleted by HBCC UFO). We had a storm so bad the power went out at approx. 4:45. We had to stay a little late in hopes that the power would come back on. We had an incredible downpour of rain and in the southeast towards the Wash. border a fire started. We had power on the West side of Trail but not on the East (divided by a river) I decided to go see the local movie because there was power on that side of the river. I'm not sure about the moon as it was very overcast. I drove my friend home after the movie and......  On my way home travelling alone East on Highway 3B, my car ""lit up"". I looked out the passenger window to the south and saw a ""huge craft"" in the shape of a V. There were three bright white lights on each ""wing"" of this craft. There seemed to be rotating extremely fast lights within the lights. (like the chasing lights you would see on a Christmas tree) There did not seem to be a body to this craft like a plane with passengers would have but rather just a V. The ""nose"" of the craft also had a bright light and the lights were beaming upward but the glow so intense that this is why the light shone in my car. It was not a beam of light but rather a brightness.  This thing was hovering very low and very slowly. I am not good with distance but my husband says the way I described it, he would guess approx 100 metres high.  Keep in mind I was driving. the speed limit was 50 km but I could slow almost to a stop as I had time to look in my rear view mirror and there were no cars behind me. I wanted to pull the car over and take a closer look but this is a main highway and there was a guard rail to my right. I had time to turn my music off - I heard no sound although I did not think to roll my windows down. The size was that of a large plane and it appeared to be grey or silver in colour. I am not sure because the white lights were so intense. There was no colour to any of the lights.  I remember telling myself to pay attention to detail. This is very hard to do when the mind is confused and trying to reason with what the eyes are witnessing. Because I couldn't stop I decided to go a bit above the speed limit and get home as quickly as possible. This sighting was VERY close to where I live so it was a matter of travelling up the road a bit and turning south (right) into my neighbourhood. I got out of my car ran to our deck and looked in the direction of the sighting but saw nothing.  We do live by and the sighting was by our Canadian Armoury site.  I did not have any ""missing time event"" I was so amazed by this sighting though and so confused by it that I had to take a sleeping pill to calm me down to be able to sleep. I had some dreams in regard to what I saw but nothing I would consider out of the ordinary.  I can't think of anything else to tell you. Today I am still rather shaken and trying to apply logic but this thing was so large and hovering so low. I don't know what is capable of doing this.  Yes you can speak about it with Wayne on KBS. I am curious to find out if there is anyone else who may have seen this. It was hovering above an area where there are quite a few homes so you would think somebody should have.  By the way, (deleted) e-mailed me and said he must have just missed it. I think he was also at the movie and I know he would have travelled home in the same direction as I did.  Hopefully I've answered all of your questions. I am now a true believer that ""something is going on out there.""  I realized I missed answering a couple of your questions. We live near two airports. The main Castlegar airport approx 30 km north. We also have a local airfield approx 8 km southeast. I didn't see any other planes or aircraft in our area.  Take care Brian. Thank you for listening.

Just as my clock hit midnight, me and the group of people that were on their boats were attracted by brilliant lights of many colours in the sky, they were too brilliant and too close to be a star and they moved soo fast that it was impossible for them to be a plane. At first they just hovered in circles, and a few minutes later, they went down very fast. When this happened people got scared because they thought it was a meteor, and i remember some woman scream. but a few seconds later it went back up hovered in circles a little more and then just dissapeared in the sky. Im not really a big believer of ufos and that things, but the next day in the newspaper ""La Nacion"", appeared a big article talking about this light that apparently more than the people that were in the river saw, and that until today no-one has figured out what it was.

My first thought was it’s an airplane but it did not look right it was at a very high altitude I asked my wife to take a look and she did not know what it could be. I continued to watch it and I notice a second one heading in a direct path toured the first one. At this time I realize it could not be two planes flying that close tours each other then when they past each other which looked like to be about a ¼” something wasn’t right. I ran in the house and grabbed my camera and took two photos of the second one they both were moving what seemed to be very fast. I have never believed in UFO’s and I gave thought of sending the pictures to someone but I did not. Then this morning I was watching the news and they showed the pictures taken in Mexico and man what I saw was scary because the pictures look just like what I saw.

Since i am very familiar with the area i pulled  off the road onto a small road turned off my car and got out i stood thier looking at this thing for about 5 minutes all that time i had a ringing type sound in my ears it was like a low flat ringing i noticed it right as stopped my vehicle thier was no sound of a motor or propeller noise only this ringing type  noise ,it went away after i pulled back out onto the road i was worried that the military would be comeing this area is very well guarded thier is said to ! have cameras set up everywhere monitoring the base  everyone that goes by this place. I started driveing down the road i looked into my rear door mirror and i could still see the lights it was as if the object was just sitting thier in the sky.

I never told anyone about that night,i wanted to but around here storys of ufo's aliens  it is looked at as crazy talk,but i know what i saw that night and i wished i had a camera because i would have used it but all i have is a clear memory that i still think of to this day. Allso 2 days after this event i got extremly sick and weak i consulted my doctor which he told me he did'nt know what made me sick all he could do was tell me to drink water,and get rest the following day i felt much better,did i get sick from some type exposer to something that night ? Probably not,but it crossed my mind. Allso 1 week after this event i recieved 6 phone calls only who ever it was would not talk they would stay on long enough for me to say hello then hang up i have never gotten calls  of this type ever and allso my phone number is private that just added more to think about from that particular night. thank you for reading this and allso for giveing me a chance to tell this,it has in a small way released many many years of preasure because i did want to tell someone,but fear of ridicule can be be very strong in makeing a right decision.Ever since that night i have not watched the sky as i use .

Two or three other objects, similar in appearance yet smaller in size and more difficult to see, were then observed trailing the larger object as it reached a 90-degree zenith point in the sky.  Spread out at random distances up to a total of about a 40-degree arc, each object caught up with the larger object and flew around the sides and rear of the larger object in honeybee-to-hive fashion.  Each smaller object, one at a time, disappeared into the back of the larger object. The larger object, picking up speed, kept moving in a straight line towards the east.  At about 55 degrees up from the eastern horizon, developing thunderhead clouds obscured the object from view and it could no longer be seen.

Note:- Sorry, E-mail Address not included due to spamming idiots.  To begin with, I apologize for not being able to, not only pin-point the dates of these events with any accuracy, but the years also. I have read your Hoax/Joke reference & concur with the rationality of its content. Secondly, both my wife & myself are not prone to UFO/Alien theories, BUT likewise, we are also old enough (mid-60's) not to be so gullible as to not believe that there are indeed ""things"" in this world/universe which do in fact appear to be rather unexplainable. Thirdly, since it is you who has ""publicly requested"" reports of UFO??? sightings via this Website, here is what ""we"" saw in the first incident sometime in the '80's, & what ""I"" saw in a second incident in the mid to late 90's.  We live on the N/E. shoreline of 14 Island Lake in the Municipality of of St. Hippolyte, Quebec (50 miles N. of Montreal). House located on hillside ~50 ft. above water & ~75'from water's edge. When facing the lake from our deck, there's a huge 90'-100' pine tree about 30' left of the deck, most of whose branches extend outward toward the lake, and which hides our view down the shoreline to the left. Extending outwards across the lake, about 1/4 mi. away, beyond that pine tree to the left, are two islands in the distance which hide most of the rest of the lake surface to the S. & S/W. from our view. Also, across the lake, about 15 degrees to the left of us, is another island (with open water to its left and right) which is also visible from our deck as well as the shoreline and rising mountains beyond the far shoreline ~1/2 mi. away. To our right there are also tall trees 60'-70' which partially block our view of the mountains to the W. & N/W. Obviously at night up here it can be very dark and any unusual light(s) or lighting will immediately attract the eye.  In both these incidents, it should first be noted that even in full darkness, the outlines of the trees on ""our"" shoreline, on the islands, and the outline of the distant  mountains are clearly visible against the sky are always visible, unless of course it would be cloudy/misty. In both cases the nights were starry & clear.  First Incident:- (In the 80's). While standing outside leaning on the railing & facing the lake talking & having a smoke arpound 23:00, suddenly from our left (from beyond the branches of the pine tree), an emerald green mini-ball of light suddenly just shot in a absolutely dead straight line across the lake on the ""near side"" of the two islands I just previously described as being ~1/4 mi. beyond the pine tree. I would say that the light was traveling downwards at maybe 2-3 degrees. It then disappeared behind the trees on the second island I just described, but it did not re-appear over the water to the right of that island. It just disappeared. All this could not have taken more than 2-3 seconds.  The part I find interesting, is that this light was not up high in the sky, but very low over the water. It had to be, because it's line of travel was well below the outline of the trees on the two islands to our left. Therefore, logically, if it was below the island treeline, that would have to mean that the light past between us and the islands. And since it was streaking downwards towards the right, it could only have gone either into the lake at some point behind the other island, or into the shoreline on the far side of the lake. Those latter two locations are out of our line of sight from the deck. My wife & I just looked at each other in silence; we knew we'd both seen what I described, but at the time, we figured, ""Who the hell's gonna believe that."" Come to think of it, right now, I'm still trying to figure out why I've even bothered sending this report.  Really, the best way I can describe the shape and brightness of this light, would be to say it sort of resembled the appearance of Disney's ""Tinkerbell"" when she was very far in the distance; just a small brilliant laser-like light that seemed to have a hint of a faint halo but with no real space between the light and the halo  - and with just a bit of a shimmering effect to it.  One other thing that might be worth mentioning, is that the next day there were also reports in Montreal, and on the South Shore of the St. Lawrence River of people having seen a shooting emerald green light in the sky.  2nd Incident:- Same setting as 1st incident, only I was alone standing at the front door leading onto the deck at about 23:00. Suddenly, this time from the right, the same green light streaked across the lake in front of me and just disappeared in mid-flight; it just sort of ""winked out"" so-to-speak.  This time it appeared to run in a very horizontal plane as it streaked by and was only visible for 2-3 seconds. Again, this light had to have past directly over the lake, because I could see the light against the mountains in the background across the lake, and since the mountains across the lake are about 250'-300' high, I would guess the light must have passed by at ~ 100-200 ft. above the water. This time the light appeared to be closer to me; maybe 1/4-1/3 mi. away. Note:- the lake is only about 1/2 mi. wide at this point.  So there ya have it - our visit from ""Whatever"".

I was about 12 years then. I shouted to my father to look up in the sky,we ran to where my dad was,by that time the space craft was right over our house. It just hovered there for about a minute or so, it never made a sound, it was a very clean and it was round with large pipes protruding out of the bottom. On the top of the craft there was a object shaped just like a windshield of a car rotating around, something like radar or a force field or something.The very outside rim had windows all around it,my father saw people looking out at us. Then after a minute the craft began to move without a sound, it was travelling west. It came from the east over the bay of fundy. The spacecraft was only about 100 feet above our house,it was the size of tennis court or a little bigger.It moved slowly west about 2 miles, then it stopped for a couple of seconds,3 large orange balls of lava looking material dropped out of the bottom with equal distance between them. We were all standing there staring at this monment in our history wondering WHAT,WHERE, WHY, HOW and WHEN or if we would ever see this ever again.Ater the 3 balls fell to the earth the craft dissappeared instantly.Those few short monents have been with us all our lives. I ask my brothers an sisters over the years if they ever think of that night and all of them including myself an my dad said they think of that night every day.We are not sure of who they were but they know that we are thinking of them. I often think they will be back one day, either for a visit or to accomplish whatever it is that they have to do.This was such a great experience,it was so uplifting that it makes me fell very special to be apart of that very special evening.

PD)) Childhood abduction and mental and visual encounters through out life. When I was 8yrs old I went for a walk in the woods in the mountains in Colorado.  There I had an encounter.  I disappeared for hours. When I returned home, I remembered some of it but not all.  When I tried to talk about it my parents just said I had an imagination.  In 1985 I went to a hypnotist, and had him take me back.  All my life everything kept coming back in dreams and thoughts.  By 1985 I was in tears most of the time. I couldn't get them out of my mind.  Also throughout my life I had other sightings, tetepathic messages sending me places, and some times others with me and saw what I saw. After my sessions with the hypnotist, I remembered.  And knew I wasn't crazy.  I remember standing under the ship, it cast a circular shadow, and I could see the sun shining on the ground around it and in the trees. I don't exactly remember entering the ship, but I remember being on a moveable table or something.  There was a small being walking besides me.  He didn't scare me, actually I felt safe as long as he was there.  I remember going down a corridor oddly shaped, with light that seemed to come from the walls.  I remember going past an area that looked like somekind of control area. It was all high tech, smooth, and hard to describe.  I drew pictures of everything I could remember, including the panel boards of sorts.  The small being with the very large eyes was still with me.  Then I remember passing an area with floating spheres and another type of a being.  Very tall, bald, large head,large eyes, but not as large as the small being.  I called them the Elders, they seemed so intellegent, and aware.  Then before I entered another area I saw another being, whom I will never forget.  He was humanoid, and very impressive.  I felt very safe.  When I entered the area, there was a baby, maybe about one.  It was sitting on a table, then a large transparent amber colored round flat object dropped down in front of it.  The baby was startled, but calmed down when it stopped in front of it.  It ha! d two arms on the side of it that controled its decsent, and was secured from above.  It had areas in it that were indented, I drew a picture, it is easier to see than to explain.  Then they stopped me next to a girl that was laying on a table.  She had a clear thing kinda domed over her head.  She just laid there. I can't remember too much until awhile later when I was placed in an area with others.  The area was darker than the areas I'd been in, and the ceiling had lights on it.  The whole ceilins and lights rotated and in the middle the lights were pulsing.  after being in there, I couldn't remember much.  It is as if they tried to erase my memory.  They did a lot of it, but somehow, I was able to remember some, and sub-conciously I retained a lot of memory.  I tried to tell people, and my parents, but no one would take me seriously.  T%hey just thought I had a big imagination.Anf throughout my life I kept encountering them.  Sometimes I'd see the ships by myself, and at other times there would be other people with me, so I knew it wasn't my imagination.  Now that I am grown and have kids of my own I am scared.  I have 6 children, and one night 5 of them were with a babysitter, in Gonzales, Lousiana.  I went out to eat with a friend.  While eating I got this real uneasy feeling, and told my friend I had to get home right away.  We doggie bagged our dinner and left. When I got home the babbysitter was screaming, the kids were all talking and excited. After calming everyone down,I asked the sitter what happenen.  She said that my daughter A had come in to say that there were lights in the sky outside.  So everyone went out to see.  When the lookede the lights were gone, then they saw it.  An object of sorts hoovering about 25 feet above the house.  Silent, no sound, and strangely no lights. Just a dark object, that you could see the shape.  My daughter R. ran into my shop and hid under my tee-shirts on the rack.  The babysitter said she tried to get the rest of the kids back into the house.  She said s! he got them in for a moment but they ran out again.  They said I came home just as the object left.  She was my friend, but didn't come back to my house for a year.  It really scared her. And made believers of my children.  I don't know what I would have done had I been home at that time.  Why did they come?  What do they want?  And why when I see them, do I feel some kind of a connection with them?  They are strange, yet not strange, alien yet not alien.  I don't know what they did to me when I was younger, nor do I understand how they can get into my head.  I mean, one time they told me to go to Giant Rock Airport in the desert of California.  I heard them in my head all day.  My husband told me to just go. I ended up with 4 other people and we went to the desert.  There all five of us watched a ship in the sky, moving all over the place.  Now I had witnesses, I was not alone.  Then once I disappeared for hours.  I was only going to the store.  I had taken my (black) kitten with me. when I got  home, I told everyone that I had seen a ship, but I didn't know I had been gone very long.  But it had turned my black kitten into a black and white kitten.  There were white hairs all over it.  And I don't remember anything except seeing the ship.  Yet it had been hours, and to me only moments.  And the kitten was my proof.  Everyone at the house saw it.  That was a good calling card.  Now, I don't know what the future has in store for me and the children who now are adults, and know that something else is going on, that none of us understand.  Maybe someday we will find out why, if they ever return. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",,39.65298571428571,-105.43921428571429

Suddenly, we both noticed several bright lights high in the sky.  As I recall it was late morning and since I was home at the time I can only assume it was summer.  No school or I wouldn't have been there. All we could see were the lights.  No shapes were seen.  They flew a bit eratic (up and down motion) and not in a straight line. I remember asking my mother what they were and I remember her saying, ""Oh, nothing to worry about"".

This triangle was not a sharp arrowhead type but just the opposite: a wing-like triangle much shorter than its width. Its appearence was wider than the moon, maybe two and a half moons. It was bright gold colored and there was no variation that would give a clue as to any curvature or depth to it. It could have been a flying flat two dimensional object for all I could tell. It was turning slowly without banking and there was no sound nor exhaust.

The area was woods and no houses.We, as students were immediately sent to our classrooms, where we sat silent, due to teachers orders, until 2 pm. I observed a man walk by the class window. He was not a sheriff, as we had been told the sheriff had been called. He was in a black suit, with a black briefcase. I did not see any others. He was walking towards the craft, to the south, and not on the side of the principals office, which was on the east side of the buildings. At 2 pm. The alarm to go home sounded, and we were told we could go. A girl and I headed towards the direction of the craft where it had landed. The tall pine trees had covered its descent, but we did not see it leave. My friend and I met other students coming back from behind the school from the landing site; some had went to find the ship.. We were told it was gone, but we still went to the site, where we found a large approx. 40ft diameter ring. It appeared to be burned at the ring all around the edge..(  Later on when older,I would return, and find for years nothing grew there.) My friend and I saw nothing but the ring, so we left. Something scared us, and we began to run, but I do not recall what. I went home and told my mom, who came back to see the ring. She saw it also.That night something scared me again by my home, which was not far from the school. Later on in the 70's there would be many sightings in the county.

The voice I heard in the Control Tower identified himself as a USMC Captain, the Duty Officer. He said there were four or five other observors in the tower with him. At one later point the object departed (tracked by Washington FAA Center) and proceeded down the Potomac River (north bound), climbed to an alt of approx 1000' AGL and speed of about 100 kts. It was tracked by the Center to a position directly over the White House where observers saw it turn upward at a high angle of attack and flash out of sight. The object was later reported (according to Washington Center) by a NW airlines B-727 at FL330 NE of WashDC enroute NYC. It tracked the airliner for a few seconds then turned and flashed out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,,

I am now a retired police sergeant. We heard a faint hum then out of a dense woods across the road. At tree level we saw an elongated triangular shaped craft. It was just above the tree lines and was moving South to North.  Dad and I watched as the craft, now silently glided directly over our yard and ourselves. The craft was so low that it brushed the top of an old apple tree in the backyard.The tree was probably a story and a half high.I will always recall looking up at the bottom of the craft. It looked like I was looking at the underside of the a nearby railroad bridge (girders, supports.)There also appeared to be a large square in the center of the craft. I am unsure if the square was a door(opned or closed) or a structure. The craft rose rapidly as it glided northbound then zipped outa sight to our east. The apple tree's leaves turned brown and curled up, like live brush exposed to a fire. The tree's interior subsequently dry rotted, the tree died and Dad had to cut it down. Dad and I discussed this event until his death August 2001. My children all heard their grandfather tell the same,unchanged facts about the event. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There were green and orange lights on top and I'm not sure those colors are correct since I've put the memory away a long time. It was early evening the light was waning but the ship was clear to see because it was so close. I can't remember how long I stood there and stared at it. I guess I was mesmerized. I don't remember any fear or panic. The weird part is my mother and her best friend were 100 feet behind me looking out over the river engaged in coversation. I remember later telling her what had happened. I don't remember the ship leaving. Years later she had no memory of me telling her any such story. I told my grandfather the story at a family get together when I was 30. He was a no nonsense German Catholic who believed in hard work. He said years earlier when my mother was young, she and a sister and brother were in the back seat of grandfathers car when they saw a UFO in a field outside of town. He pulled the car over and watched until it left. He said it matter of fact like watching a flock of birds leave. My mother doesn't remember this either. This is my only sighting.

This thing was very large, at least a city block long from tip to tip and had dim white lights all around the edges. The color was gray/black and it blocked out the stars above as it passed over us at approximately tree top level and very slowly. There was no sound, nor was there any wind disturbance of any kind.  We kept asking each other ""do you see that???"" and I even pinched myself to make the point of conciousness on my part clear to myself. We did not notice it until it was almost directly above us as we sat in my '63 chev convertable with the top down (facing north) and we watched as it slowly made its way west and disappeared into the distance. The strangest part I thought was the fact that none of us were frightened by this unusual event. This was in a place that we called ""space country"" because there was not much of anything but space out there in the early 70's. Dirt roads and wheat and corn fields with nobody out there but us usually. We would go out late at night and hotrod our cars along the dirt roads. The area is what is now Aurora, CO. Back then it was approximately 15 minutes east of the old Stapleton International Airport via I-70. Later, a few weeks? we were out there again and it was day time and we noticed a few radar domes nearby where the sighting took place and speculated that the craft was spying on the installation which we found out was Buckley Air National Guard Base rumoured to be a testing ground for experimental aircraft. The craft we saw as related here, in my opinion, was not made by humans. It far surpassed any of the stealth type aircraft that I have seen currently deployed by our USAF.

He looked up and there it was a craft approx 200feet across. About 60-100 feet up, it was just hovering there inching its way south towards highway 17, which, is now I-880. We lived on Norton Avenue, which is off of 1st Street near Avery Honda. 1st goes onto Stevens Creek Blvd. The craft was heading southward. No sound...just the light breeze of the evening blowing the 50-foot tree in our back yard.

Dad told us ""look up"" I did My God! There it was this large circular craft burn marks on the edges, a bright whitish center extended from the bottom of the craft it was 30ft in diameter with multi colored lights surrounding it. These lights were an integral part of the extended bright white circle on the bottom. They formed the raised edge around the center bright white circle. We watched in awe as the craft slowly inched southward not even thinking to grab our Polaroid one step. The neighbor pulled up and stepped out of his car looked over at us and then looked up. I think it was the only time I heard him cuss. My dad went over to him on our side of the fence and asked do you see that? He looked at my dad and said, ""I see nothing at all!"" and then resumed looking up. As the craft moved southward me and my brother climbed up onto of the garage and watched it head southward. I could see the saucer shape the center of the craft was tall and spherical forming a half circle about half the diameter of the whole craft. The edge of this sphere shape slowly tapered to the outer edge of the craft where the bottom and top of the craft came together. The whole craft was symmetrical in design a circular saucer shaped craft. There were not sharp edges except the out! er edge and the protruding bottom white lit circle with multi colored edge. No lighting was visible from the top of the craft. My mom finally figured out about 20 minutes after the craft was out of sight to call the air force.

I was coming home from a business meeting with lawyers and representatives from Paine Webber about a new offering. In the car ( a 1977 Lincoln Continental) was my accountant who was driving. It was midnight.. It must have been early 1978. We saw what appeared to be very bright lights in the sky on the same plane.About 6 of them.Each with intensity of search lights. We saw them from the eastern shore of the Delaware River as we were heading west to my home. The lights stood still. As we crossed the NJ/PA bridge the lights still remained in the same position. We drove up Wrightstown Road and they still were there.Comparing the height to radio towers nearby these were about twice the height. I got out of the car and had my Minolta 35 mm camera that I had used to photograph properties for our presentation to Paine Webber. The camera worked fine. We stopped the car and looked up and the same lights were there. I tried to photograph them but the camera would not click to the next frame. I tried and tried.One flash and then the series of lights moved without a sound at such a speed that they were miles away in a second or two. We both were shaking with excitement.My account was a very staid person and unemotional person but he was afraid to talk about it. When we started the car to leave we saw there was a deer lying in the ditch of the farm road that 'woke up' and stretched and jumped into the woods. Upon arriving home my wife met me at the door. She sleeps early but was wake at midnight.For some reason the home phone rang and stated there was a fire alarm set off at my sister in laws house.We were on a notification list. She immediately called her to find out nothing happened there and all were sleeping. I contacted every airport and the Willow Grove Air Force base speaking to a Colonel. No one knew a thing. The next morning at work I was telling the account to my employees and there was a newspaper advertising agent there to take our new business for the week.He called his boss at the Trentonian Newspapers.The boss asked me to tell him exactly what happened and what time. He then told me that his secretary and her husband saw the same thing moments earlier in Florence New Jersey about 320 minutes away by car. After giving the film to NICAP they kept it for 15 years and finally mailed it to me empty. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)),2004-06-04T00:00:00,,

I saw a light in the Southern sky that looked like Venus to me and, as a joke, I told my brother ""Hey, look! There's a flying saucer!"" and I looked at him, waiting for him to call me a dork or something so I could tell him ""I made you look!"" But he didn't look back and his jaw dropped and I thought he was putting ME on so I looked and it looked like there was a black spot in the sky, about the size of a quarter at an arm's length.  It became quickly obvious that the object wasn't flying _over_ us but rather was coming _toward_ us, so we stood up. In a matter of 30 seconds from my first sighting the object (and maybe a minute or two from when I first pointed it out) the object was directly overhead. We instinctively got out from under it as it descended, walking about 50 feet so we could take in the entire sight of it. I thought it might just land on the lawn and squish the house, and us with it! I'd guess it was about 100-125 ft wide - it was wider than the house - and roughly six or eight feet thick. It hovered just a few feet over our parent's single story home, around 25 feet off the ground.  It had a small steady red light at the N by NE side of the ship and was aspirin-shaped, cobalt blue in color - like gun metal. It had what looked like an observation deck on top of it with what appeared to be smoked-glass panes, set at 15 degree angles, just slightly tilted. I tried to see inside but I couldn't. Well, we stood there for a few minutes and I turned to my brother and asked him ""Is that a flying saucer?"" and he said ""what else could it be?"" and we both laughed. Then a white light started flashing on us. That happened for roughly 20-30 seconds. I looked for a bulb after it stopped but I couldn't see one. I looked at the underside of the disc and didn't see any markings or rivets, welds, etc. My Father was a welder.  After a few minutes, the saucer started to hum like an electric motor and when the hum reached its peak or became in phase or whatever the whole disc sort of clicked visably - it moved just an inch or so and then started flying over the cow pasture next door. It was moving at a pace where anyone could walk along with it, 3-5 mph. After it flew over a few of the neighbor's houses it took off like a bat out of hell! It turned into a blur at a straight line toward the sea, to the West. After a couple seconds, it looked like someone drew a line of light from where it was on the horizon to the stars, roughly at a 45 degree angle and the end of the line eventually caught up with the point of origin and then it looked like a star for a second, and then the light went out.  It was silent except for the humming before it took off and it didn't glow or anything. I wonder if anyone else in the area saw this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-06-04T00:00:00,,

Myself (witness #1--name deleted) and a friend of mine at the time ((witness #2--name deleted)), which were 15 and 16 years old at the time had gone out on the side of town to a small wheat field that was ready to be harvested on a beautiful clear warm Friday evening and parked in a circle in the middle of the wheat field that had been made by the farmer from turning around in, I assume, (his barn and tractor were behind us off the side of circle. To be honest my friend had bought a six pack of Michelob beer and we were going to drink a couple beers though at the time of this incident we had not yet opened one beer and were completely sober and straight. Anyway, it was just getting dark but still a little bit of light. We were talking and I was sitting in passenger seat anf ((witness #2)) in drivers seat and I was staring at this red flashing light blinking like a heart beat up in the sky directly in front of me. I thought it was a radio tower with its red warning lights so a plane does not fly into it but after a short bit it started moving to my right very slowly. At that time I asked my friend ""hey what is that?"" and we both thought it was a small cessna airplane flying extremely low. It kept getting lower and lower and swung around to the far side of the wheat field and came right over the top of the wheat, still with its light blinking. It started coming right towards us and it came so close that our skin and face and car and the wheat around us was glowing red when it blinked. We both kept saying to each other ""What is it?, what is it?"". I had my head stuck out the window trying to get a look at what it was but even with it that close I could not make out a shape nor could I hear any sound what so ever. It kept coming towards us then my friend paniced and started his car to take off because I guess he was more frightened than I was. When he started his car the light stopped for a few seconds then started going back the way it had been coming accro! ss field but then took off at an incredible speed up into the sky. We drove as fast as we could to the dirt road and went in the direction it was and by then it was higher than commercial jets fly and kept going higher into the atmosphere until it could no longer be seen. There is no possible way that anyone on earth had anything that could go that fast, I mean it was fast. The human body could not handle that kind of 'G' Force as far as I know. Then it was gone.  The following Monday in the newspaper someone else had seen the same light/craft (UFO) but they saw it on the west side of town we were on the North side of town and by the time they quoted seeing it they had to of seen it about 30 minutes before us. We never reported seeing anything to anyone thinking people would think we were nuts plus because we were out there to drink a few beers and were only 15 and 16 years old and that would get us in trouble with the parents. Now that I am 40 it is of no concern to me anymore. ** There is no doubt in my mind that that UFO was from some other life form and planet or where ever, no doubt what so ever. There is no way what I saw could of been from Earth, none what so ever! I am 100% convinced that we are being visited by beings from another planet or where ever here on earth and that the government has to know about it and is keeping what they know from us. They must tell us everything that they know which I'm sure is a lot. When they finally are forced to do so then everyone is really going to be upset with the government for keeping it from them for so long. Us mere earthlings can handle the truth. I already know the truth, somewhat, I know they do exist with out a doubt and so do many other people who have had encounters with them. The aliens I'm sure think that every human being has been informed of their presence, but this is far from the truth. I think it is stupid for the government not to tell what they know, if they would then everyone could come together with their info they have and maybe we c! ould become a bit more savy on their ways and maybe what to expect in the future. They could be sizing us up to take over our planet and with their technology that would not be very hard at all, probably with a snap of the fingers or whatever they snap. I often wondor what would of happened if my friend would not of started the car. We could of had it land right next to us and met the aliens or then we could of been abducted also! Yikes, maybe it was good he did start the car, I'll never know I guess. As far as the date goes I only remember it was 1978 because I was 15 but I really not sure what month and what day, but there was a story that following Monday in the paper and it happoened the Friday before that. The wheat was ready for harvest because I went back out there next time I had someone with a car to check out and see if wheat was singed or burnt or partly harvested or anything strange but when I got there it had already been harvested. What about radio activity on a geiger counter? Would that possibly pick up something? It has been 26 years ago this happened, I thought I should document it somewhere, do you not agree. I live in Hawaii now and Jeff still lives in Pampa, Texas. Also, the final assembly point for all nuclear weapons is 45 miles from where this happened which is like a baby step to these aliens I'm sure. Pantex is the name of the place. I know they have interest in our nuclear sights, weapons and such so I thought I would throw that in. That is possibly why they were by this little hick town of Pampa Texas either that or needed some wheat to make some bread with. My tele.# is ((two numbers deleted)). ((witness #2)) is probably listed in the phone book in Pampa Texas if anyone ever wants to talk about this sighting. I always wodered if I were to get hipnotized if I would remember anything more.

My earliest memory dates back to when I was an infant.  I'm not sure how old I was but my next memory is my third birthday.I remember a gift that I got and I also remember having this first memory at that time.I can recall even at that age a want to hold on to it and I have.  I am lying on my back in the grass.It is night and there is cool a lite breeze.I remember this because I could feel it blowing my hair around.It tickled my forhead.I felt very at ease and calm.  The sky was so beautiful.It was filled with dozens of geometric shapes.There were many different colors and they had a soft internal glow that bordered on translucence.They were very soothing and I felt that they were my friends.I know that they were soothing me,like a mother would a child.I cant explain in words what I felt inside but it was like communicating.  The duration is probably about 2-5 minutes.Throughout my childhood,it was always my strongest memory and inspired me in everything I did.I've always thought that it is what sparked my curiosity about sciece at an early age(got my first shock at 5 by poking around in a telephone outlet).  Anyhow,when I was 13,I went to live with my grandparents as a result of my mothers death.I stayed in my dads old room.At about the age of 15,I started having weird dreams.There were so many that I cannot remember the chronology,but I will state some.  One of the first was one in which I was having a dream about eating cereal.I thought I started to fall back in the chair and got that rushing,falling into oblivion feeling,that woke me up.I was lying flat on my back in bed and someone approached me from the left.I couldn't move.From here it gets a little foggy,from terror I think,but ""he"" lifted my shirt up to my armpit then used something to cut me just under my left nipple.It didnt hurt but I was very scared.I then felt a horrible,numb,type of pain.A pulling sensation coming from the area where I was cut.I couldnt turn my head to see,but out of the corner of my eye,I could see him pulling out a piece of tissue.The pain was incredible.That all I remember until the next morning.My chest was a little sore and I had light scratch in the exact area where he cut me.I also have no muscle in the lower portion of my left breast.I'm 25 years old today,I work out,and I still have no muscle in that area.  Another dream is one where I wake up in the middle of the night.There is a pink hazy light coming from my window.I get up and look out.It looks like daytime on an overcast day except in pink.I look to see what time it is and my clock is not on.No power in the whole house,so I dont know what time it is.I had a very strange feeling at this point and decided to go outside.The sky was overcast and pink.Where I live was only a mile north of Rosenblatt Stadium and you could see it from the backyard.We also weren't to far from S.A.C,so on some days you could wee jets flying in that area. I went around to the back and was shocked to se the sky filled with U.F.O.'s.Discs,cylinders,pyramids,spheres,Etc.I also felt that they saw me,or better yet,were waiting for me.I dont remember anything after that.  There are many more but I am no good at typing and am tiring already.  One day I got up the guts to bring them up to my dad, ""jokingly"",and he later confided in me similar experieces he had as a young man in that house.  At the age of 18,I moved to AZ and the dreams stopped.I moved back to a rural part of NE 1 yr later.I have been here for almost 7 yrs now.The dreams have started again and now they involve my young son.This also coincides with a recent sighting of a U.F.O.(it was on the news,on tape).I really wish they would stop.I call them dreams but honestly,there is nothing more real at the time.I've never told anyone else about them before,and feel kind of silly,but I need to get it off of my chest.  I know this isn't a specific ""sighting"",but I had to get it out.Sorry. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

I spoke of it only briefly and guardedly to my two best friends at the time, but the incident has stayed with me.  I'm sure that it was a Saturday, and I think that the date was probably November 22nd.  I was nineteen years old, just about to be twenty. I was living away from home for the first time, in the town of White Sulfur Springs, West Virginia, attending a photography school.  I'd set off to drive to visit my mother in southern Indiana for Thanksgiving week.  I was approaching the town of Alloy, West Virginia, heading west on US 60.  Alloy's about 20 miles SE of Charleston.  It's very small, and may not appear on some maps.  The day was cold and grey, and the tops of the mountains were hidden by clouds.  I regret to say that my attention wasn't fully focussed on my driving - my radio was fading in and out (The Who - 'Magic Bus'), and I was trying to simultaneously adjust the vernier knob and drive.  I attach no particular importance to the problems that I was having with the radio.  That's just a lousy area for radio reception, there in the mountains.  At that point the road is skirting around the flank of a mountain, so that to my right was a rising slope, and to my left was the wide valley of the Kanawha river, with another mountainous ridge rising up from the far side.  There was some sort of heavy industrial complex situated in the valley by the river - if memory serves correctly, it was a steel mill.  I crested a small ridge, and saw a sign to the right side of the road warning me that heavy trucks entered the highway ahead.  I noticed a light grey or aluminum hemisphere just barely visible over the crest of the next ridge, perhaps two hundred yards away.  I glanced at it, classified it as the top of a tank truck, and went back to fiddling with radio.  A few seconds later, as I started to top the next ridge, I gave my full attention to the road, expecting to meet the tanker that I thought I had seen.  The road itself was empty.  The hemisphere that I had seen earlier was hovering above the road, perhaps 50 feet in the air and climbing.  It took me a few seconds to accept what I was seeing, and by that time I'd passed under the hemisphere and lost sight of it.  My last glimpse was of it seeming to tilt slightly on edge as it rose.  It was overall a light grey or aluminum color.  I can't say if the finish was reflective, as the sky was so heavily overcast.  A circular patch about 2/3 of the diameter on the bottom was of a darker grey color.  It seemed to be flush with the bottom, just as though the color were painted on, with no difference of texture or anything.  The edges where the hemisphere met the bottom were widely rolled, not at all sharp.  The bottom was very slightly convex.  I noticed no surface features apart from the dark patch - the whole thing was quite smooth-looking.  The thing was perhaps 15-20 feet wide, and maybe 8-10 feet tall.  It took me a few seconds to recover.  During this time I was coasting downhill slowly, my foot off the gas, looking in my rearview and side mirrors trying to see the thing.  To the right was a pulloff marked ""Alloy Slag Dump"", and I pulled in and stopped.  I jumped out of the car, and looked back up the road, maybe 100 yards or so to the road just below the crest of the ridge where I thought it must have been sitting when I first saw it.  Nothing was there, and the sky was empty as well.  I looked up the mountain (now to my left, as I was facing the way I had come) and saw that the top was obscured by clouds - the cloud deck was maybe 100-150 yards above me, and thick.  Looking for it in the sky was futile.  I remember saying to myself that there could be an aircraft carrier overhead, and I'd not see it.  Nor was there anyone else about who might have seen it.  The parking lot of the steel plant below me was almost empty - just a handful of cars, and there was no guard in the gatehouse.  Still, I was excited - I'd actually seen a flying saucer!  I grabbed a camera and a couple of empty 35mm film cans from my gear (I had three loaded cameras with me, but obviously had had no time to use them) and set off back to the spot where I suspected it had touched down, looking to take photos and maybe collect samples.  I got about three steps, just as far as the rear bumper of my car, when I abruptly had a very vivid image of the car being found empty, engine running and door open, with my new winter coat and several thousand dollars worth of camera equipment sitting in the passenger seat.  All that would be missing would be the driver and a cheap 35mm, and wouldn't everybody just scratch their heads and wonder?  Suddenly I was terrified.  I was alone, with no-one in sight, and those clouds might be concealing anything.  I got right back in the car and drove off, considerably rattled and eager to get into a town.  That's the almost the end of the story.  Later in the journey, somewhere in Kentucky near Louisville, my car broke down.  I bundled up and started walking.  A very nice old preacher stopped to give me a ride.  He left me at an abandoned gas station which had a working payphone, and I sheltered in the disused men's room while my mother drove down to get me.  Apart from the shock of actually seeing the UFO, three things stand out in my memory.  The first is the radio.  I know that it's common to experience radio trouble in conjunction with a sighting, but I honestly don't think that was the case here.  I have no real evidence to offer beyond the fact that I usually got bad reception in that area between the mountains.  The second is my abrupt mood change upon beginning to walk toward the presumed landing site.  I do associate this with the UFO, as much as I dislike the idea.  For lack of a better term, it felt to me (and still does) as though the imagery of my empty car were being imposed upon me, instead of arising naturally from my own imagination.  I had the sense of being warned off.  That's what really frightened me.  I'm not a small man, and I'm not timid, and at the age of 19 I thought I was indestructible to start with, but that got to me.  Again, I have no real evidence to offer apart from my own impressions.  The third is the preacher who gave me a ride.  In the years since this happened I've read quite a bit of UFO literature, and I'm aware that many people would jump on that as a sign of possible abduction (at the time I'd never heard of such a thing).  I don't think him stopping to give me a ride was anything more than what it seemed to be on the surface - a kind man stopping to help someone on a cold night.  I debated whether or not to include the incident at all, but finally decided that I should for the sake of completeness.  I'll send along a drawing of the thing by snail mail.  Also, please note that while I think the object was probably landed the first time I saw it behind the ridge, I didn't check that box because I'm not sure. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were sitting on the sidewalk in between our homes talking when we both saw movement above our heads and looked up. The triangular shaped object, about 18-20' long seemed to be following the direction of the road (North) then it physically turned (not banked) left. I say it turned because at the speed it was traveling (about 60-70 MPH), it any plane would have needed to bank. It flew right above the tree tops (approx. 40-50 feet), made no sound (but a slight whoosh), had no lights, was completely black, didn't shake the trees, and had no flame from behind (like the flame from a jet). We sat there looking in the sky for about another hour hoping it would come back, completely dumbfounded. We thought it was strange that we would see such a thing in our neighborhood (very busy suburb of Philadelphia) and we were only 12 miles from the Philadelphia International Airport.

The things that do stick in my mind are that it was moving slowly, with no sound audible. In addition, there was a blue glow all around the edges of the craft, which I think was grey or dull metallic color.

I was not there that weekend to see the object reported but from what I have been able to gather this is an excellent case.. Why? becuase it happened in 1986 and I dont think the flying triangle was seen or reported at that time.. That didnt happen until 1989 over Belguim.. Similiar cases after 1989 have detailed wavy air or something seen coming out of the object.  In other words, this is one of the first. Michigans chapter of Mufon did investigate but know one claimed to have seen the object except for these two people.. I know for a fact that more people did see this object becuase they are the ones I heard it from.. One described to me a diamond shaped object that reminds me of the Cash Landrum case of the early 80's. In the Cash Landrum case it was reported that the victoms had burning and watery eyes caused by exteem levels of Untra Violet light.. Makes me wonder if the two people mentioned in the article below were exposed to the same kind of UV lighting..  Here is the story of the Bankson Lake Triangle From the Kalamazoo Gazzete and featured in the newsletter page of banksonlake.org  Here are some highlights from the article that was put into the Kalamazoo Gizzette on September 1986  Not Everyone will believe John Long and fishing buddy Richard Jandura, story about the huge UFO they saw over Bankson Lake near Lawton on the evening of Aug. 1st 1986  Both witnesses eyes burned for days after watching the silent triangular object fly over head.  ""It is a very credible report, Very credible,"" said Shirley Coyne of Flushing, director of MUFON's Michigan chapter.  What the two fisherman claimed to have seen around 10:30 that clear night was a giant spacecraft about the size of Wings Stadium Long said . The object had a bright light in front and three red lights blinking on each side.  The craft moved slowly from the southeast toward the northwest about 200 to 300 ft over the lake, the white light in front suddenly flashed brilliantly and went out.  There were several other fisherman on the lake, apparently none of them saw the UFO because it moved with absolute silence. The flash of light ws beamed toward the front of the craft, so it did not reflect off the water.  Jandura heard a young boy on the shore yelling ""What is it?"" What is it?"" as the UFO traveled slowly across the lake for about 15 minutes.  To the person who was yelling what is it? please feel free to contact me with what you saw, if you are out there.  As the craft moved off in the direction of South Haven the two fisherman saw a wavy pattern in the air behind it, as though somekind of exhaust.  The Kalamazoo county airport was contacted and nothing unusual was reported on radar.  It should be noted that 30 minutes prior to this event a similiar objects was seen over Jamestown Ohio. Aproximately for 5 minutes. Earlier that day over Texas yet another stranged shaped object was spotted and reported.

I was riding my bike up the street with my friend to my house and just when we reached the edge of my driveway, my friend yelled ""Look!"" and he pointed to the sky ahead of us.  I saw three black or dark gray saucer-shaped objects rapidly flying up at a roughly 45-degree angle, one right after another.  They looked like they had come from an area of woods north of my house that is now a neighborhood.  They were moving so fast and quickly disappeared in the clouds.  My friend and I were stunned because they definitely weren't airplanes.  They made no sound that I could notice.  My dad was right there in the driveway washing his car.  I asked him if he saw the objects, but he was looking down at the time.  The weird thing is that I had deja vu right at that moment.  I remember having a dream before where I asked my dad ""Did you see that?"" while he was washing the car.  Probably just a coincidence.

I had just come home from saxophone lessons and while getting out of my fathers truck I noticed that the night sky was very dark. Noticing it and thinking nothing of it, I rushed inside and upstairs into my bedroom to put my sax away.  I closed my bedroom door almost all the way, flipped the wall switch on, and the lamp on top of my dresser came on.  As I emptied my pockets onto the dresser, some sort of movement outside my bedroom window caught my eye enough that made me look directly out the window.  I looked for just a moment and thought that my eyes were playing tricks.  At the very instant that I turned away, I got intense goosebumps all over my body, and the lamp on my dresser went out.  At this point I was startled by something out of the corner of my eye and turned and looked out the window to my left which i was standing less than 15 feet away from.  Outside the window there was a pulsating spherish orb of blue light about 1 foot in diameter.  It was such a luminescent blue light that I was captivated by it's beauty and scared to death at the same time.  I was so scared that I don't think I even tried to move, I was frozen in place by fear.  Shortly after I had noticed this Blue orb of light, it moved toward the window, and somehow moved through the window into my room.  Once this sphere had completely moved through the window, it dissappeared.  Now the sphere dissappeared, however instantly a band of light of exactly the same color about 1 foot wide appeard on the floor, walls, and ceiling forming a tube around the room, up the walls and across the floors and ceiling, accompanied by a loud electric hum.  It started at the window side of the room and moved across the room at about 2 or 3 feet per second with the hum.  The light travelled across the entire room much like the bar of light on a photocopy machine, and dissappeared when it hit the opposite end of the room.  The soun! d was gone too, and there was nothing to see at the window.  I was so scared that when the light and hum were gone I was still frozen in place for a few seconds.  Then I rushed to the switch, flipped it twice, and it did not come on.  Then I ran to the stairs, slid down them on my behind, and ran into the livingroom hysterically crying to my mother and explained what I saw after she said that she did not see anything or see anything.  She told me it may have been ball lightning.  I don't know what it was, but I know that it was there because I saw it with my own two eyes.  The lightbulb in the lamp on my dresser was burnt out.

It had a sort of vaporish mist surrounding it that exuded no trail. I watched it pass over the trees and it disappeared from view. It appeared to be descending so I waited, listening, expecting to hear a crash of some kind. I did not hear a crash so I assumed it continued on.

My report concerns a sighting by a very close long-time friend of my family whom we regard as a very honest and trustworthy person who lives outside of Scottsville, Kentucky.  She told the following story to my late Grandmother only because she trusted her, and she truly believed that nobody else would believe her fantastic story.  My Grandmother told me the story a little later on.  I, as a person who has witnessed a UFO up close before, did believe her story.  I cannot be sure about the exact date of her sighting, but I do know that it was sometime around the middle of the 1990's.  So I used the date of 1994 to be as close to the accurate date as possible.  This lady who saw the object lives directly beside my late Grandmother's residence in Scottsville.  Anyway, as she told it she was driving to work early one morning from her home in Scottsville to her job in Franklin, Kentucky.  Her travel route takes her from the old White Plains road exit in Scottsville that leads directly into Franklin about twenty-four miles away.  She works in a medical facility there.  Shortly after she has crossed the Allen County line into Simpson County she said that she looked ahead of her through her automobile windshield and noticed something rather odd.  It seemed that something was sitting out in the middle of the road directly in front of her line of sight.  After slowing her automobile down she finally saw that the object was indeed a perfectly shaped disk, and it was hovering directly over the road ahead of her.  The disk was hovering low to the ground and was very silent-no noise at all.  Being alone, she did not want to stop and investigate, so she just kept driving slowly and passed directly underneath the disk.  The lady said that as she drove underneath the object she looked up at it and saw that is was definately a disk and somewhat large.  We did believe her story because I can tell you for a fact that she is a lady of honesty and integrity as was stated above.  There is absolutely no way that she would ever make up a story such as this.  She stated that! she had never seen anything like this disk shaped object before, and had no idea of what it was or where it came from.  I do wish my name to remain anonymous in this report.  Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))",2004-06-04T00:00:00,36.729839999999996,-86.56202333333333

This event took place in early fall around 1949-50. It occurred after a Boy Scout meeting in the Baptist Church.

It occurred after a Boy Scout meeting in the Baptist Church. The Baptist Church sits on a knoll with the parking lot below. The Church is a square building that rises about 100 feet above the floor of the parking lot and faces due South.  There is a sidewalk in the middle of the parking lot that leads up a broad set of stairs to the front of the Church. In Texas in the early Fall the days can be warm and then it cools down pretty good in the evening. After the Scout meeting my friends and I went outside and laid down of the sidewalk looking up into the clear star filled sky.  Since the sidewalk holds its heat it provided warmth and permitted us to talk, look at the sky and be warm at the same time.  We were talking about the sky and the stars and then one of us noticed a V formation moving from the top of the Church due South.  There was no sound and our immediate reaction was that it was geese flying south for the winter.  The formations kept coming  at irregular intervals when suddenly one of us realized that the formation was moving across the sky at a rather fast pace and for it to be geese we would have heard them honking if they were low enough to be picking up the lights from the city.  San Marcos in the late forties was a sleeply little college town and we didn't have a lot of city lights in those days.  The Baptist Church was about two blocks from the city center.  Another observation was that if they were high enough for us not to hear them then they were moving at a tremendous speed because they were clearing the sky from the Church front to the horizon in about 10-15 seconds.  We had some pretty smart boys in that group who grew up to be doctors and lawyers, and scientist and we quickly concluded that what we were seeing was not geese, ducks, or airplanes.  We had seen plenty of airplanes with the airbase in town and with the big bases in San Antonio.  These were not airplanes.  The formations were usually v shaped and sometimes there would be an outrider apart from the formation.  They would enter our field of view from different tracks always coming from ourhead over the Church heading due south.  Puzzled by the whole thing we went across the street from the Church and knocked on Mr ((name #1 deleted)) door and asked him to come out and see what he thought.  Mr. ((name #1 deleted)) owned a grocery store in the neighborhood and we all knew him.  He agreed to walk across the street and take a look. As usually happens the formations seemed to stop.  Just as Mr. ((name #1 deleted)) started to leave a formation came over and we pointed it out.  He studied it and another one that came over and then exclaimed - "" I think those are what they call Cosmic Rays"".  We really didn't know much about cosmic rays and since the objects were luminous the ""ray"" idea seem plausible so we just said --Oh.  We went back and casually watched the formations for a while and when they started to become less frequent we all went home. Years later when we were much wiser we realized that what we saw that night was not cosmic rays. The ojects as I remember them were cylindrical and luminous.  There was no blinking and the objects maintained even spacing and did not wander around like geese and ducks in formation. The light seemed to be reflected but since there really wasn't that much light to cast a reflection it is hard to say where the light was coming from.  If they were low enough to pick up the lights of the town then the objects must have been very small and would give the appearance of geese/ducks in size at the lower altitude.  Since there was absolutely no sound and the formation did not act like birds, my memory want to say that they were probably larger objects at a much higher altitude and were emitting their own light. Whatever altitude they were at they were moving very fast, even by todays standards of flight.  To be at high altitude and move as fast as they were in clearing the night sky from Church to horizon would put them in the SR-71 catagory and we never had too many of those during their era. I don't even think an SR-71 going flat out at altitude could have cleared the sky as fast as these objects. I am a retired Air Force General Officer.  I am not a pilot but I have been around airplanes and high tech all my life and I cannot account for what we saw on that cool fall night in Texas.  I would say that the IQ level in the group of boys there that night was in the top five percent and as I said earlier they all grew up to be very accomplished professionals.  We were young but we weren't stupid. I happened to hear Peter Davenport on the radio talking about not getting enough reports especially from the late forties and early fifties and decided to make my contribution.  I would be interested in knowing what you folks make of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,29.87306124031008,-98.01287441860465

When I was around 10 years old traveling in my dad's car going west along Lake Erie near Ashtabula/Cleveland, at the Painsville/Willoughby border, probably around 1956, hovering above Lake Erie, there was a huge rectangle about 5 miles long and 3 miles wide.  It was around 9/10 PM either in November/December.  As I raise my right arm now it would be about 2-3 o'clock from the Lake Erie horizon N-NE from the Painsville/Willoughby line. As I look at it through the L of my thumb and index finger now as an adult, the rectangle void was 5"" High, the length of my Index finger and was 9"" Long or Wide the projection from my thumb angled out including the length of my thumb from the bottom of my index finger.  It was almost like the size of a business envelope resting on the L angle.  This triangle was empty looking as though it was a void. The odd thing was that the stars that were surrounding the object were shining as usual in the sky, there were no lights flashing or edging the object but and blackness of the void was blacker as though it was a black mirror which was different than the sky with the stars. It looked like a door into another dimension.  My parents told me it was just a lack of stars because there was no moonlight and insisted I close the car window. Several years ago when I started to hear the people on your show talk about the triangles I was hoping someone would talk about rectangles but so far haven't heard anyone talk about them.  However, if you put several triangles together you can have a rectangle.  I will never forget seeing this void, this emptiness.  Even at that age I felt as though it was Big Brother watching.

I was looking south, and the Akron/Canton airport was behind me to the north. At first I thought it must be an aircraft flying directly at me and only appeared stationary, but the shape of the object was not correct for this. My guess was that it may have been a mile distant and approximately 30 degrees up. The weather was sunny and bright with white fluffy clouds, but the blue sky was exceptionally clear. Frustrated that I could not determine what it was, I remember running toward it to get closer, but the bouncing of my eyes interfered with my vision, so I stopped and watched while standing still so I might determine some movement. There was none, and then suddenly it moved to the west (my right) at an incredible speed, much too fast for anything I had ever seen. It went behind a cloud and never reappeared from the other side. Immediately following the incident, I continued home for lunch and told my mother what I had just seen. I knew she wouldn't think I was making it up, but I doubt she agreed with me that it was a UFO. Except for the speed, I'm not sure I would have thought it was a UFO. For years I pretty much kept this information to myself, thinking a rational explanation would emerge, but I'm 60 years old now, and the only things that sound similar to what I saw are the descriptions of UFO sightings by others. Now, 47 years later, I can say I have not seen anything since that even faintly made me think I was seeing a UFO, yet I can still remember clearly the details of what I saw that day.

I hesitate to think of this as a ""UFO"" sighting simply because I saw no ""objects"". The points of light seemed to be white in color and very small, occupying perhaps the same minutes (or seconds) of angle as most stars.

During the encounter my girlfriend (who had lived in LA some years previously) kept shouting ""Those are birds!"". After what may have been only a few seconds or as much as a minute the lights ceased to appear while one of them moved generally Westbound at what I perceived would have been a high rate of speed. Frankly I hesitate to clog the database with a ""sighting"" that is not particularly anomalous. Being nighttime I had no teresterial background to judge distance or size by. The points of light were very small and no detail of any ""structure"" or even ""reflective surface"" was visible. There were no attendant sounds that I heard. Given that LA has enormous ""light pollution"" I find the bird hypothesis likely (birds riding ""thermals"" could account for the twinkling in and out of the light sources) though I have never seen such a display before or since.

As we drove, one of us noticed the object in the sky. It was impossible to determine the size of the craft as we had no way of telling how high above us it was. It was possible to clearly see its shape (a jet black triangle) against the night sky. There were no lights of any kind that we could see, so we assumed it was not a plane.  We stopped the car and watched the object fly slowly over us and behind a hillside, making further observation impossible. Judging by its speed, it seemed unlikely that it was a standard aircraft (and also judging by its shape and the lack of lights - the area is part of a flight path to Manchester Airport so we're well used to planes flying over, and know what they look for), and having seen a number of military planes fly over, it was moving too slowly to be one of those. There was also the fact that we could hear no sound from it.  It's true that there are people who own private gliders and motor-powered gliders in the area, but having seen those fly over my house before I know that we would have heard an engine. There's also the fact that anyone flying a glider at that hour in the dark would have to be suicidal.  It's possible that it was a stealth plane, although that seems highly unlikely in West Yorkshire, and I would have assumed that such a craft would have flown faster.  We ultimately observed the object for a period of no more than ten minutes, and we all agreed that not only had we never seen anything like it before, but that we had no idea what it was. At the time we didn't report it as we felt foolish claiming to have seen a UFO. There was no report in the local newspaper at the time either, so clearly no one else reported it! I only tell you now as I found your website this evening. (Incidentally, the only reason I remember the date is because I keep a record of all the films I see.)  I would be interested to know if any other such sightings have been made in the area. (I know that my cousins, who live nearby, and my next door neighbor, have all witnessed UFO activity in the sky, although none of them have ever seen a black triangle).  Thank you to the witness for the report.

I hope the writer of that report can read my sighting below, from my personal UFO Journal and know he or she is not alone in seeing this type of shape changing object.  Thank you.  Gil Rodriguez  1997 - 16. Spring - April or May. I lived at my present address of 640 East 79th St. between Glenwood & Farrigut Roads. While finishing up a long walk, one morning about 11:30 am, I had the urge to look behind me (a soft (mechanical sounding) voice said ""LOOK UP"") and I saw a large dark (very dark gray to black) doughnut shaped object moving in the sky over my left shoulder. It was over to the North West, a few blocks up around Utica and Foster Avenues when first sighted. I could see the sky through the center of this object. It looked to be 2000 to 5000 feet above the area. After a few seconds it moved over with a fast jump or dart like movement and was almost directly over Glenwood Road where I was walking as it changed shape several times from a doughnut to a cigar shape with the front 1/5 of its length bent back, then it became a straight cigar or cylinder shape, then a chevron shape. It made a jump or move down quickly over the street (maybe 500 feet up) and looked at least as wide as the street (Glenwood Road) I was walking on (it had now changed into a cigar/cylinder shape). After changing again into a chevron, it changed into a figure eight. The exact shapes it changed into, the sequence, I have drawn on paper from that day with a letter I eventually sent to Sightings and Encounters. (I never heard from either show). I somehow had the impression that this thing was alive or that it was some kind of creature, especially when it was cigar shaped with the front 1/5 section bent back. During this time there were about 5 people on the street within the next two to three blocks who were looking at it and pointing. One guy yelled out ""what the hell is that"" when it was shaped like a figure eight. I was thinking at this time that if I ran home, I could get my video camera and get some video of it. The object stayed ahead of me as I ran. I ran the remaining six or seven blocks home and went inside calling my wife, mother-in-law and daughter frantically to come outside and see this UFO. I went back outside! and was joined by my daughter, my wife and mother-in-law (there voices can be heard on the tape). I taped for about 54 seconds where you see it changing shape three times before it moved into the clouds. You can see it change into a chevron, a ball or disk and finally a dark/black cigar/cylinder shape before moving into the clouds (my daughter is heard saying "" it’s going into the clouds""). Today, 1/03/03 I remembered that my first thought was that it was a long string of large black balloons that might have flown off from a parade or a street fair, but the shapes it made especially when it came down over the block (Glenwood Avenue) I was walking on (doughnut, cylinder, chevron and figure eight) made it look like one solid object, with no segments.",2004-06-04T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

From my location in North Austin, I noticed several military jets flying at very high speed at low altitude towards the object. I drove towards the location of the Walmart shopping center and saw a blue/green diamond object in the sky with the military jets circling it. I know hundreds of people in North Austin and Round Rock saw this take place. After an hour or so, the object disappeared and so did the military jets in the sky. In the summer of 1999, I saw news story on one of the local Austin TV stations, of a farmer in Williamson County, finding a military jet top canopy, in his drained cow pond, and he was clueless how this part of a military jet ended up there. That story was never seen on TV again, it could be that one of the military jets flying around the UFO crashed that night,and the pilot ejected, but the canopy of the jet was not found because it was submerged in the cow pond.

There was a huge bluish light and the impact lifted my car off the road and over into the next lane, almost off the road. I pulled over, and the guy behind me pulled over, and we got out and tried to see if we could see anything, but all you could see was this huge bluish glow. The guy was just as shocked as I was.

We could see spotlights searching the skies over Milwaukee about 15 miles away. There were some clouds in the sky, but not many. All of a sudden, I saw movement over my head. I looked straight up and a saw a white circular craft moving slowly from behind me from south toward the north. It moved very slowly. It was above the clouds. I double checked to see if there was a possibility of the searchlights from Milwaukee to be making a search way out here in New Berlin, but it wasn't. The white craft was above the clouds. It was about the size of a quarter held at arm's length. It moved slowly toward the north, never deviating from its course and never changing speed ... very slow. The strange thing was that before it got to the horizon, it blinked off like a light bulb. I called my sister on the telephone who had been about 25 miles away and she said that she had seen the same thing, so we reported it to the Hynek Institute in Chicago, giving a written report within the week. Hundreds of people have had to have seen that, but we never met any. The very next day, on July 5th, during the afternoon, there was another sighting by hundreds of people on the Lake shore of Lake Michigan.

Witnessed. I was Twelve years of age in 1960. It was a beautiful late summer evening, the days were still long and it was just approaching dusk at about 8:30 PM. The sun was at the horizon but had not yet set, even though the sun disc itself was out of sight.  I was dozing in a steel framed hammock in thr family back yard when I had an accident that threw me into the air about seven or eight feet. I descended upside down and landed directly on my head. The last thing I remember was a loud snap, cracking sound as my head snapped into my right shoulder. That, except for the incident that I will relate next, may have been the tragic end of the story.  The next thing I am aware of is that I am standing up holding onto the nearby handrail. I don't remember getting up, I'm just up. Then I hear a voice in my head say ""Look up"". So I look up, there in the sky, directly overhead (86 - 88 degrees from North Horizon) are three hovering discs, all identical except the middle one is lower than the other two. These discs were the same color as the sky, sunset orange on the West side, and a darker pewter or brownish on the East. I would estimate the diameter to be five inches at arms length for the two at higher altitude, and about 8 inches at arms length for the lower disc. My judgement of the perceived altitude above me was about 120 feet.  I yelled at my brother who is already looking at them, ""Chuck, LOOK!"". He saw the whole thing. He says that a beam of light came out of one of them and hit me. I cannot verify that, as I was out of commission at the time.  After looking up and perceiving the three discs they immediately moved in perfect silent unison, due West to the horizon in about two seconds.  Shortly after that I had a long series of REALLY WEIRD nighttime events. Something came into our room almost every night for a long time. When they came I would call to my older brother but he wouldn't wake. Then his weird experience would happen. I won't try to describe it here but it was scary, unknown, and very nebulous. I started to draw these figures of flying beings. My school performance went from poor to exceptional. Emotional problems that I had been experiencing seemed to reconcile themselves.

It made no sound. This happened years ago but I didn't think much of it until I started noting that many of the reports are of these triangular aircraft.  It all started after my two friends and myself were walking out of Dry Canyon right above Logan, Utah after hiking and having a simple cookout.  The night sky was clear and we could see miles in all directions as you can in the desert on clear nights such as this.  We were on the way home.  No car was necessary as Logan is within walking distance of the Wasatch National Forest.  I was talking to one of my friends when the other pointed over my shoulder and said, ""What is that?""  His voice had a timber that leant to the urgency of his exclaimation.  I turned in the direction that he was pointing. SSW.  I saw a triangular craft moving slowly in our direction.  It fit the descriptions that I have been reading on this forum.  It was triangular with 4 lights.  Three small lights at the tips and one large light in the center that seemed to slightly illuminate the ground.  It flew directly over us at about 1000 ft and we were illuminated slightly as the large central light passed over us.  It made no sound.  There were two smaller craft at each wing tip that could not be discerned except by there dark outlines.  If you were to gauge their relative sizes, I would say they were approximatly the size of a minivan next to a bowing 747.  The three craft went over us and continued NNE until we lost them in the night sky.  The silence of the craft was earie.  After some reflection on what we had seen, we thought it was simply a new form of military aircraft practicing bombing runs over Logan as Hill AFB is located near Ogden, Utah.  I am also a skeptic considering I am a scientist and yet I have yet to see a craft such as this in any of the military arsenal since.  This makes the encounter all the more interesting.

Anyhow, we were leaving the woods at some point between midnight and 2 in the morning (EST).  I remember a bright blue flash that looked like lightning, it lit up everything and refelcted well off of the snow.  We looked to the north to see what looked at first like a bright blue firework (with trails) shooting straight into the air from ground level.  It kept getting higher and higher to the point we both realized it was not a firework.  It got VERY high into the sky and then quickly it turned south at a 90 degree angle and shot across the entire sky.

I believe that I saw what might be otherwise classified as a UFO, however I do believe that it was a man-made aircraft.  I had a very close encounter with this craft.  At the time, I was driving a Chrysler Reliant, and I was heading home driving up the Niagra Escarpment.  The night was very cloudy and a storm had just precipitated.  There was heavy cloud cover, and on my way up a long stretched road heading towards the mountain, I noticed two lights which at first I figured would be a low - flying passenger jet.  However, as I continued up the road, I was surprised to see that the two white lights were fixed above the mountain, and that the jet was much smaller than that of a passenger jet all together.  I was very amazed as I ventured further and steadily closer to this object which I then discovered was hovering at a fixed position.  It then came to my attention that I was about to witness a craft which no one in the public audience has witnessed before.  This craft was at such a low altitude that I lost sight of it while I rounded a turn and could not discern it through the tree tops.  After I rounded the turn, I could clearly see every contour of the craft...  it had just completed a nearly 180 degree turn in the same position... it had a cockpit, with small airleones at each end below it... it had delta shaped wings which came together at the end with a concave curve at the rear... the white lights were at each end of the wing tips.. I stopped my car directly underneath of the craft.  I opened my door and looked up at this craft which travelled less than 5 k/m per hour over my head without a sound.  As shocked as I was, I watched as the craft continued to move until I could see the rear of the craft once again.  Shocked and scared of being a witness to this craft, I drove away.  I write this email in hopes of some response which might explain what I saw.  I do believe that it was man ! made, be cause the craft had two green lights and two red lights on its undercarriage, similar to what is regulation of man made aircraft.  Its undercarriage seemed to have a carry cargo door which I honestly believed would have opened and lifted me inside as I was directly underneath it.  However, this never happened to my recollection.  I have never seen any plane which could maneuvere as this craft can, or hover without a sound.  Please, tell me what this is.

The craft was observed from the control tower of Nellis AFB by this writer and an assistant control operator and and base operations officer, who came up to the tower stating that had been flooded with calls from Las Vegas, a city 10 miles South of the field, telling him that a strange object was buzzing the city. He asked what aircraft were in the air. We replied that all aircraft were on the ground, except for a F86 fighter jet that was inbound from March AFB, Riverside California that was due in in about 45 mins. All eyes were trained towards Las Vegas with binoculars and saw nothing, but shortly, coming around Sunrise Mountain, which is a 5000 foot mountain located five miles East of the field, was a very silvery disc shaped aircraft about 500 feet above the ground trailing a vapor trail. We were all in awe, especially the vapor trail at that low altitude in the dry desert air and the craft was mirroring the orange sun, which was setting in the West. The craft stopped and hovered at the end of the East/West runway about a mile from the tower at about 200 feet and remained there for about twenty minutes. There is no other way to describe this object other than a very shiny disc with no other chararistics like windows, doors, antennae etc. Following the period of time that it hovered at the end of the runway, it started moving again, trailing vapor again and passed over the highway West of the field. It made three circles and a circular ring of vapor and hovered again about two miles West and the vapor dissipated. The sun now set behind the sheep mountains and the craft was no longer mirroring the setting sun, now looking like an ominous dark object. The incoming F86 was ordered to expedite and investigate the object. He descended at very high speed and approached the area. He excitedly radioed that he sees the object and locked in on it but it dissappeared very quickly' The personel in the tower also observed the craft disappear. The writer was encourged to write this because of a recent article in the newspaper regarding a UFO Sighting by dozens of people over the towns of Orland Park, Matteson and Tinley Park.

We noticed in the upper right-hand corner of our bedroom window that there was a strange redish-orange glow. It was gradually getting larger and larger. As we looked out the window, we saw a large sphere shaped object slowly desending. It seemed to be going down into a pasture between our house and my uncle's house about a quarter mile away. This thing  glowed with redish-orange light so bright that it light up our room like it was daylight. It took around ten minutes for it to disappear...then every thing was dark again. My parents also saw this and my uncle's son,whose bedroom faced our house. We went out the next day to see if we could find any sign of the object,but found nothing.

There were approximately 10 neighbors outdoors at the time, engaged in gardening, playing with kids, berbecuing, etc. When the object was seen, all stopped what they were doing and came to watch. It had stopped and was hovering over an apple orchard that was maybe three blocks south of the neighborhood.  It was  a saucer-shape, definitely metallic and had a copperish or bronze sheen to it.  The size is hard to determine, but it must have been at least a large as a 1960's car, given the distance from which we were seeing it and the detail we could see.  It definitely had port holes, or circles near the mid-section. It rotated around as it hovered. It was totally silent, there was no noise when it entered the area, hovered and left the area.  Everyone was dumbfounded and stood together for quite a while. Finally, someone shouted he needed his binoculars and another one said he had a camera with film.  As the men began leaving the group, the object then rose into higher and accelerated rapidly away, leaving in a westerly direction, against the winds and disappeared in the distance.  Everyone was stunned by the event and we children were warned not to mention it to anyone. No report was ever made of this for fear that the reputations of the observers would be damaged.  Those who were there included an insurance agent, a regional sales representative, an employee of the USDA, a vice-president of a small factory, housewives and children of varying ages.

This is when this ufo had moved into the eastern sky.  Then coming from the north are four jet airplanes heading toward this object. They were probably scrambled from the national guard out of Indianapolis after radar picked this ufo up on their screen.

The jets were going nowhere, except to eventually turn around.  I checked the daily newspapers for two weeks following this event, assuming that others had seen this ufo or at least a report on scrambling these jet, but to my surprise nothing was printed.  Later, during that same time period, while walking, I noticed what appeared to be a ferris wheel in the north-west sky.

They were stopping and going and changeing places with each other.  If you were to look straight up above your head and then tilt your head down about half way you could see them.  They danced around as if playing with each other.  They were spaced apart from 3 inches to several feet apart as they did this.  Then they divided and were spaced far from each other in sort of a triangle shape but way too far apart to be connected together as if they were lights on an airplane or something.  Then they all took off at the same time from a still position.  and shot straight up.  It was then that my sister and I saw a much larger object almost directly over head.

At the time this sighting took place, I was 14 years old.  I was talking to the neighbor on the phone when I first noticed a goldish colored ball of light flying over the field behind our house.  My first thought was it was one of several local farmers who had small planes getting ready to make a turn in preparation to land.  As I watched it, I could see something just wasn't right with the way it was flying, even though most of the farmers were flying the old Piper Cubs, which are capable of flying quite slow, this was even slower than that.  I had seen probably hundreds of fly-bys by the local farmers over the same field, and this just didn't compare to any of those as far as speed, flight pattern, and the coloration of the lights.  Instead of turning as I expected it to, the light just continued to come straight on towards our house, and soon the brightness of it's light was just too different from any planes landing lights I had seen.  I yelled at the neighbor on the phone to tell his parents to look out over the field, I then yelled to my mother and two brothers, who were in the next room, to look over the field at the light, which they did.  Just as the light reached the edge of the field, and the fence line, it was if someone turned off a switch, and it went dark.  My mother and brothers came into the kitchen where I was, and I asked my mom if she knew what it could have been.  Before she could answer we heard something passing over the house.  It was more of a sensed sound, rather than audible, maybe more like we felt some sort of pulsing vibration.  Mom seems to remember it sounding like an air compressor, like those at gas stations as they replenish the air supply.  When I heard this I ran to the front door, and opened it to go outside, I can remember my mom yelling not to open the door, but it was too late as I had opened it and exited to the outside.  My mom and brothers were standing on the porch yelling at me to come back, as I stood in the front yard looking up at the bottom of the craft which I don't think was more than 200 feet or so above the house.  There was 1 large light in the center, with a ring over real small lights around that, and a medium size light at the end of each point of the structure, but under the edge, not at the wing tips. I belived the large light was blue, the circle of small lights were orangish.  The ones at the wing points were red and white.  As I looked up at it, I felt something like a mist, it reminded me of a very light spring rain as far as size of droplets, and intensity.   The craft was not moving fast at all, maybe 5 to 10 miles per hour, but that estimate may be off because of it's size, which was I estimate to be 200' from furthest point to furthest point.  I then noticed that my eyes were beginning to burn, and that when I tried to look up at it, I could no longer keep my eyes open.  It was not a burn like an acid burn, but more like an irritation, as you would get spraying a fine mist of salt water into your eyes.  At this time I retreated back to the porch, where my mom and 2 brothers were.  The craft seemed to stop over the trees across the street from our house and just hover there for about 3 minutes, then began to ascend straight up.  It did not change it's attitude to ascend.  The front did not rise, the back did not drop, it just remained level and started to go straight up.  I then noticed that at a high altitude a single white light appeared and seemed to be getting larger and brighter.  In the next few minutes, I seen 3 more craft, identical to the one that had passed over our house appear, it seems from 3 other directions.  I remarked that the one that had passed over our house had arrived out of the south, of the others, one came from the north, one from the east and one from the west.  That large white lighted object grew to be about 10 times the size of each of the smaller craft and then stopped it's descent.  All 4 of the smaller craft seemed to be hovering, with fronts of their craft pointing towards this large white object.  Then one of the smaller craft moved slowly towards the larger craft, and when it's front seemed to make contact with the larger object, it suddenly began to rotate in a clockwise fashion, nose to large craft. This gave me the impression that the larger craft was in fact rotating in this fashion. and the small craft must have docked with it.  One by one each of the other small craft also docked with the larger craft, and soon all 4 small craft were, as best as I can describe it, sliding sidways around the perimeter of the larger craft.  This went on for about 30 minutes, when one by one each of the smaller craft broke away from the larger craft, and flew off in opposite directions.  One to the south, one north, one east and one west.  The large white object simply ascended back up into the sky until it was lost from sight.  When my dad arrived home soon after he was sceptical, so he split us all up into different rooms, and gave each of us a piece of paper and a pencil. Told each of us to draw the object and label anything we had seen. It wasn't long before he was frantically running from room to room, because all of our drawings matched.  My mom appeared on several local radio programs over the next few days and was interviewed.  Many of these programs had people calling in claiming they saw the same objects.  It turned out the neighbors had been so frightened by it, they closed all their curtains, lit candles and had all their children gather in the living room and prayed through the whole ordeal.  The story also appeared for several days in the local newspaper, The Beloit Daily News, Beloit, WI. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,42.4257,-88.9878
UFOs visited our Minuteman ICBMS during the summer of 1966 and I was there.,Rapid City,SD,,disk,several hours,"Occurred : 6/25/1966 21:30  (Entered as : 06/25/1966 21:30) Reported: 4/10/2004 6:11:39 AM 06:11 Posted: 4/27/2004 Location: Rapid City (Ellsworth AFB), SD Shape: Disk Duration:several hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36146.html,"UFOs visited our Minuteman ICBMS during the summer of 1966 and I was there. Another old sighting.  I was a System Analyst for SAC in the early 1960 and stationed at Ellsworth AFB, SD.   I  held the nation's highest security clearances, daily handled nuclear weapons and carried launch codes and keys.  I thus took no drugs, was a tea toddler and have never hallucinated in my life.  I was on active duty at the time.  This was early summer 1966.  I was on base during the evening, when excited reports of UFOs on our silos were being passed around in the living quarters among the men person to person.  ""Excited utterances,"" they are called in legal jargon.  I went down to Job Control, which tracked the 150 missiles and the ten Launch Control Centers.  These Centers were manned, twenty-four seven, while the missiles are unmanned.  That evening, in Hotel Flight, as I recall, we had an ""outer zone security violation,"" meaning that something had passed over the silo....this is often blowing vegetation or a light footed animal. The system will generally reset with the manual override.  However this silo did not reset.  Worse it was soon followed by an ""inter zone violation,"" meaning that something large enough to set off the vibration sensors or to touch the combinations locks, etc., was on the site.  When the violations happen in this order, the manual calls for  a ""strike team"" to be dispatched from the LCC's above ground facility, which would be between ten and twenty miles distant. These teams generally consisted of two Air Policeman with automatic weapons.   These men having no training in the weapon system, no clearances and are the worst educated airmen on active duty.   However they are in constant radio contract with their dispatcher and through them with the MCCCs in the LCC, a hundred feet or so below ground and via patch with Job Control back on the base, about 100 miles, in this case to the WSW.  These men reported seeing a ""fly saucer"" on the silo cover, inside the silo and smaller objects around it, that appeared to be lights ""floating"" in the air.  The larger saucer was sitting on the silo door, a massive 30 ton concret ""hatch,"" on a short rail track.  It was thus well  inside the fence and entirely unauthorized.  As this was an armed and targeted missile, aimed at the Soviet Union, this flagrant breach of security was taken very seriously by all concerned.  Minutes after these objects were spotted, the call came excitedly to our quarters, so I arrived within thirty minutes of the initial OZ security violation.  I actually arrived before the AP s arrived at the silo in question.  By the time of my arrival, at JC, the JC Commander had taken it upon himself to send the nearest team, then at work on the missiles.   This team turned out to be about thirty or forty minutes away.  Now this was entirely ""out of the book.""  No open silo, as the one left was, was ever to be left without authorized personnel on it, since it would be launched.  Nevertheless, the need to have a qualified observer at the site being probed by the UFOs, obviously overrode the Technical Orders of Operation.  So the EMT team, that was nearby, was dispatched from their silo, which was under going some form of routine maintenance .  I believe this was an EMT team consisting of two Analysts and an Air Policeman.  A Command decision, backed by SAC in Offitt AFB, lay behind this unusual order.  Thus one AP and one Analyst were sent to the silo in question, leaving the open silo (and its deadly missile, in the hands of one man, hence the security breach).  I remember not only overhearing the radio conversation as these Airmen approached the silo, a conversation that confirmed what the other AP s had seen, ""holly shit, there is a fuckin saucer on that silo...""  but I talked with this man, a day or so later, myself.  He had been ordered to say nothing to anyone about what he saw.  But did confirm these orders and the facts as I knew them to be.  An Analyst, he, like me had spent an year in technical school, so we were close.  During this same period, our helicopters were roused and dispatched.  Arriving as the UFO was rising up out of the silo.  They gave chase, but were unable to close, as the objects accelerated towards the NNE.  The sightings continued for about a week with the same pattern.  First an Outer Zone beach and then an Inter Zone.  We had no smaller aircraft, being a tanker and bomber wing, but evidently were able to call in a nearby KC-135 ( i.e., a 707 tanker) that must have been on ""rotation"" nearby.  I myself overheard the conversation between the pilots and ""base operations"" confirming the sighting of the or a UFO in the area.  Said UFO followed the KC 135 back towards the base, with a strong radar image, but no visual image.  The plane was required to ""fly by"" so it could be observed and nothing was seen where the radar said something was.  By this time the Base Commander and the Wing Commander, were in the area in staff cars.  I spoke briefly with the Wing Commander, who I knew well, Col. Burrell, that evening.   As the helicopters returned, with then was a photographer who had been rousted from his bunk.  He was loaded into the staff car and driven away under escort to the photo lab.  I did not speak with him, but clearly saw his photographic gear.  I did not see these UFOs.  I did, however, speak directly with airmen who had seen them and indeed were seeing them.  During that week there were numerous reports, so numerous that the Air Force announced that B-58 bombers were flying over on ""maneuvers.""  But, of course, whatever landed on Hotel 6 wasn't a B-52.  I am fully confident that during the summer of 1966 UFOs visited our Minuteman silos in the Dakotas, landed upon and penetrated those silos.  We were powerless to stop them and the USAF covered up this entire chapter.  I suspect it is still classified and that I should not be talking about these events.  I vaguely remember being instructed not to speak about these matters and was, of course, operating under very tight above Top Secret security clearances.  I come forth because the missiles are non longer on active duty, the silos decommissioned and the time long past.  I can think of no reason why these events should be covered up in the name or color of national security.  Something major happened that summer.

Anyway I was curious and went to your archives and lo and behold a posting of 3/9/2004 drew my attention. I believe it was from Va. The report read that the person saw a large rectangular craft.......had a starry looking underside and so on. well this really blew me away because in Oct. of 1990 I saw something that was very similiar. I was living in Ripley Tn at the time. My dog woke me up about 1:00 a.m. barking his head off. Thinking that maybe something was wrong with my horses I grabbed a flashlight and went outside to investigate. Seeing that the horses were fine, I found the dog barking in the back yard and looking up. At the time I didn't think to look up, but did hear a low hum like you'd hear from power lines only a bit deeper and louder. I got the dog around to the front yard and sat on the front porch steps to have a cig.Anyway I looked up to the sky since it was a clear and starry night and noticed a huge patch of stars that seemed to be very close.(meanwhile the dog is still whining and distressed and I keep hearing this low humming noise) all of a sudden this patch of stars starts moving and then I could see this huge rectangular outline ariund the whole thing. It must have been the lenth of at least 2 football fields and was at least as 3/4 the width of a football field. To tell the truth I was pretty shaken at this point but I couldn't move...... this thing wasn't that high only ,maybe 300 feet. Then it started sorta of floating to the South towards Memphis. It seemed to have come from the North. The humming stopped,a few of the star like lights flashed and it just moved on. I had never seen anything like this in my life.Finally when it was out of sight I went back inside and my daughter who was 12 at the time yelled out Mom, why were you out so long? I just told her at the time I was checking the horses. I can tell you this....I laid awake a long time that night pondering all this and the next morning felt sort of addled but I know what I saw and have never forgot it. The only people I've ever shared this with was my daughter when she was grown, my mom and my husband of 7 years. But when I found someone who'd seen something so similiar and so recent I just had to share this. I hope you put this in the recent postings so that! if anyone else has seen something like this,maybe they'll come forward to. Thanks for letting me get this off my chest! I am 48 years old and not an avid ufo seeker though I do like to stargaze and if a ufo shows up fine but since this happened have had 2 more sightings one 3 years afo of the classic triangle of lights and another in March of a phere shaped objuect seen in broad daylight. My husband was with me and saw the last two himself. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-06-04T00:00:00,35.7328,-89.6593

It happened one morning on the way to work when I was driving I noticed a reflection from something in the sky that caught my attention. As I observed it closer I noticed it was a metallic sphere of some sort which was absolutely dead still in the sky it didn't move whatsoever. I only saw this object for like 1 min at least, it was difficult keeping on eye on it as I was driving, but I looked back up again to where I had saw it and it had vanished from sight. After I had noticed it had vanished I saw what I believe was a kind of haze or even a heat wave left in the sky. It seemed at first like it had left really quickley and left a mark in the sky, but I had come to the conclusion that it might well of become invisible or even transparent. I know what I saw wasn't a plane or a blimp, all I know was it left very quickly almost like it had sensed it had been seen.

The article goes like this:  ""I was contacted by Omar to let me know in a calm and precise wayy that last Tuesday he saw UFOs over Cairo that emmited a very bright white light that doesn't resemble any electrical light that we know of. --Omar is a good friend of my kids since they were together in school, 4 years back, he graduated from the American University in Cairo, he is now working hard in a media and TV company in Cairo, Egypt--  the objects were similar to Neon lights that were floating  in the sky, or similar to a huge Frankfurter shape with rounded edges. Omar said that this was not the first time to see those flying objects.  He continues that 8 years back he was sleeping on his bed in one summer night and saw a huge light ball outside his balcony with a trail of non-contineous lights. It lasted for few seconds, turned the place into bright daylight then vanished...  ..I asked him wither someone else saw what he saw last week and he instantly said that his mom and driver also was there and saw that.  They were all in the car on the ""Mouneib Bridge"" going from Cairo to Giza and saw those bright objects above the Giza Pyramids, so they stopped the car and went down to watch better, and kept watching till they dissapeared.  At that point I myself discovered that I also saw those same lights later during the same night and in the same pattern Omar has discribed!!...  [the writer goes into details about perseption theories and how other countries are studying UFOs phenomena since the 40s]  [the writer switches to his story] ""I too saw the same phenomena later during the same night, 01/25/2000, i was coming back on the Alitalia flight from Algeria via Italy to Cairo airport. we were still far above Cairo with its glittering lights.  I suddenly saw this bright light very visible among the relivantly dimmer city lights. Then it dissapeared. It was similar to a big light bulb. I first thought it was coming from the plane's strobing lights but when it happened again i could tell that it was un-naturaly bright. And was moving with the plane and not stationary as i first thought.  It was visibile that it is a rectangular shape flying just above the ground illuminating the ground as it hovered above land with its very special bright pure white (not yellowish as the rest of Cairo's other artificial lights). It happened 4 or 5 times between 11:30 and 11:45 then we landed in Cairo Airport and i forgot all about it till I heared Omar's story.""  [the writer also discribes another incident] where another male was ubducted into a UFO while he was sleeping in an empty lot in southern Egypt. when he saw a landing UFO and creatures came out and took him inside on an operation table where he was exposed to some rays, later after this insident he started having strange powers like eating and swallowing broken glass and inserting a nail in parts of his body and taking it out from the other side without any trace of blood.  And he demonstrated those powers in my office infront of my own eyes.  Omar also started feeling those strange powers, for example sometimes if he just rests his hand on one of his friends that person could fall down to the ground with extreme pain!  Lately he started noticing that when he holds a cola glass bottle in his hand, the liquid will turn into frozen ice in the middle of the bottle, while stays as liquid above and bellow the area where Omar was holding it.  Omar also continues that when he saw the fire ball years back, his brother was sleeping in the next bed and didn't see the ball, but when the fire ball crossed infront of the bedroom window the sleeping brother punched the air upwards with his fist while still sleeping. And in after the light dissapeared in few seconds his arm went back to his side whithout waking up. Omar remembers that during this incident there was a ringing or beeping sound coming from the tin trash bin in the same bedroom.  The sound was similar to the effect resulting of hitting the tin with another metal piece.""",2004-06-04T00:00:00,,

Upon finding this I became curious, so I checked something out...and I was amazed to find a sighting similar to ours (in exact same location!) Therefore, I thought I should report this even though it happened almost four years ago. I didn't know what to with this information at the time but I'm thrilled to have found this site now and think such events should definitely be reported. While vacationing with my mate in Florence Oregon, August of 2000 (can't recall the exact day but I'm sure it was the first week of Aug) from our resort window - which was a perfect unobstructed view - we watched two extremely large, bright orbs hovering over the pacific ocean (very far out, probably thousands of miles, in the middle of the pacific.) They were too high to be ship lights and too active to be stars...they moved up and down, sometimes going quite high, sometimes hovering just above the water. We watched them through high powered binoculars as they shifted left, then right, then up and down. They would come closer and suddenly move a great distant away again at an extremely fast pace (in almost a flash.) I forgot to mention, one was a reddish orb, the other a green one and both approx. same size - although the green one seemed slightly smaller at times (maybe farther away?) Out of the brighter, reddish orb a smaller white glowing orb appeared to come out of it and circle around it, then float beside it for a time, then go back inside. We watched this happen for almost two hours when below on the beach, a man was walking alone and we watched him stop and observe the moving lights. (Maybe he saw them from his window also and went down to get a closer look.) Suddenly both of the massive lights went very high and just as quickly appeared to descend, then vanished - poof! (They appeared to have gone under the water.) We have never seen anything like this before nor sinc! e and are not UFO watchers. Needless to say this was quite unexpected! We assume it was probably some type of Gov. experiment/aircraft. Thanks! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-06-04T00:00:00,44.1213,-124.00230000000002

They were really bright, but not bright enough to light up the sky. They began to circle each other, very slowly in a clockwise direction. The lights crept away from each other across the horizon. The light that was moving to the right made me think. The shadow on the moon is cast by the earth. The flashing light did not show up on the shadow. That light must have traveled behind the moon.

We were far from any population centers, no lights from towns or rest stops, when we spotted an orange globe, or sphere hovering motionless in the sky. At first, I thought it was a Union 76 ball, but immediately realized that there was no gas station around, and the thing was so huge, that I knew it wasn't a logo. It was orange, but then changed to red, then dark red, back to orange, to yellow, to pale yellow, then to white, and back to yellow, orange, red, and so forth. We started to pull over to get a better look at it, and it took off straight up. It moved so fast that it couldn't be followed with the eye. It seemed to leave a trail as it passed through some part of the sky, maybe as it went through some thin clouds. I'm not sure about why it left a short trail at one point, only that it did. It paused, was stationary for a few moments, then disappeared. It didn't ""fly away"", it was just there one second and gone the next. The whole episode lasted maybe 5 minutes at the most.

Being a Marine my hair was short but I could feel electricity pulling my hair upward and an electrical charge on the back of my neck. As the light got closer the faster it skipped until directly overhead I noticed a electrical snapping sound.

Walking along a road in Walberswick along the coast with a friend.  Looked up and saw in the distance, coloured lights, thought it was a helicopter at first, there is a US base nearby.  Then the object came closer and was clearly a flying saucer.  The object had a band of moving lights around the centre of the craft.  The lights were all different colours they did not merge but moved around.  The craft manoeuvered fast, shot up and down then away then back then hovered sometimes coming almost above us.  It was a spectacular sight.  We were absolutely transfixed to the spot. There was so much movement and changing position.  The speed of the craft was phenomenal. Then the craft went away and we stayed for 30 mins or so and thought it wasn't going to come back, but then it did and it all started over again.  I don't really know how long we were there.  There was no sound, the craft was large and moved like nothing I had ever seen before. Finally it went away.  A year later in central London I was walking alone to work early one sunday morning, I looked up and there was something I thought at first was a helicopter, the sun was reflecting off a very shiny, but matt, silver coloured object.  Then I realised it was not a helicopter, there were no blades rotating it was just this thing in the sky, completely motionless and again no sound.  I stopped and stared at it.  It had no windows no lights no nothing and it was a cone shape.  Then in shot up and stopped and then came down again and finally just shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.  I believe that the second sighting was linked to the first.  I beleive that even though I have no recollection of it, that at the first encounter something happened that has been wiped from my memory.

It was around Memorial Day Weekend, 1979, when my immediate family gathered at our newly built  beach house on Spyglass Drive in PCB.  It was right after dinner, the sun had been down for an hour or two.  Through the living room picture window, I noticed a bright light hovering--actually descending slowly at about  70 degrees until it reached the horizon.  It seemed to light up the ocean below it and it glowed intensely.  Then another bright light appeared in the same place high up in the night sky and began to slide toward the first one.  I called them to the attention of my family--who continued watching TV.  So I went outside, on the balcony, and was surprised at the brightness of the two lights (the picture windows had darkly tinted glass).  I looked at them and decided they were the perfect subject to test some new Kodacolor 400 ASA film I had just purchased.  I was into photography then and had a nice Minolta.  I shot between eight and ten exposures bracketting around a second each.  I am attaching two I recently scanned.  In a matter of half an hour there were five bright lights hovering over the horizon, as you can see in the top photograph. The little vertical lines under each light are the result of my moving the camera slightly during exposure.  The photo below, which may be the first one in the series, accurately reflects their ""shape"".  My father, mother, brother, sister and brother-in-law came out to see them.  We all wondered what they could be.  Helicopters?  The night was silent but for the murmur of the rolling waves.  My brother-in-law went to the piano and played the five first notes of the ""Close Encounters"" theme by John Williams.  We saw the neighbors coming outside also and asked them what they thought the lights were. The lady said we should tune in the local TV news at eleven. ""They will have the answer,"" she said.  In about 45 minutes the lights went back up into the sky.  One at a time, but faster than they came down.  We want inside to watch the news but they were not mentioned.  So I called the NBC station and they didn't know anything about any lights.  They suggested I should call  Tyndall Airforce Base--which I did; but no one there had an explanation for whatever it was that we saw.  The next morning I asked everyone if I had dreamt the thing about the lights.  No, I hadn't.  But nobody really wanted to talk about it.  I kept insisting.  My father said: ""We're near the Air Force Base.  They test things all the time.""  For a while I showed the photos to friends and told the story.  Then they were put away.  I just came across them again and scanned those two when I went looking for family photos for a web page project.  I'm sorry that the files are big, but if ever resolution mattered, it's in these cases,  no?  I also have the negatives which may contain more picture information.  Any one interested in this?

On a Friday night a buddy and I were sitting on the front steps of another friends house, waiting on him to get home from eating out with his parents.  As we sat there talking I noticed a humming sound that sounded different from any airplane that I have ever herd before.  I looked up toward the sky (southeast) towards Birmingham and notice three lights in the sky above that formed a perfect triangle.  The two on the right were smaller in size and would have formed the base of the triangle.  The one on the left was larger and would have been the apex of the triangle.  The apex light was white and the two smaller lights were white with a red tint.  Since I was taking my private pilot ground school, we had learned that red was on the left, green on the right, and white on the tail.  I was trying to make sence of the lights but it just wasn't right.  The lights were moving towards us from the southeast heading northwest.  If the lights were on a plane, the plane would have been flying sideways.  I then got my buddies attention and pointed the lights out to him.  As we watched the lights slowly move across the sky, I was telling him if,that is a plane, it is very low and we would hear it, and that the direction of flight would be different than the lights.  The house that we were at is up on a hill and from our position you can see the lights of Birmingham in the distance some 12-15 miles away.  To the southwest of us about 1 mile a baseball game was underway at parkwest and you could hear the pa being annouced at the game.  I notice a plane had just departed from BHM and was climbing out towards the north in a slow arc.  The plane was very identifible as an F-4 phantom recon aircraft that was based at BHM.  This was identified by the two bottom stobes that we saw all the time in our area.  As the F4 got closer to the objects above us, the objects slowed and came to a complete stop.  To get an idea of the spacing of the objects overhead, they were about the width of an adults outstrected hands in the sky (2'from the apex to the base.)  The two objects that formed the base were about 1' apart from each other.  As the F4 got closer, the two objects that formed the base began to separate from each other, widening the base to what appeared two be 3-4' in the sky.  They slowly started to move to the southwest which is a 90 degree turn from the original direction.  As the moved the gatherd speed and instantly streaked across the sky leaving a white line that dissapeard as fast as it appeared.  As soon as they were gone, the largest (apex) light slowly started in the same direction (toward the ball park) as did the other two.  It too started to build speed and in a blink of an eye streaked across the sky and left an identicle steak of light behind it and was gone.  It would remind one of a shooting star.  From out position on top of this hill, you could see 15 miles.  So we were able to follow these light all the way across the horizon.  The F4 continued its approach and made a large circle back towards Birmingham.  My friend and I just looked at each other in disbelief and asked each other ""did you see that"".  We told out friend what we saw and his parents.  They just looked at us as if we were crazy.  The next morning I went to my private pilot ground school at the birmingham airport and asked my instructor, who was a F4 pilot at the time if they scrambled any F4's last night to check out what we had seen and he said he didn't know.  This has been on my mind ever since and I felt the need to write it down.  If anyone else has had a similar experience I would like to read about it. Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

On return from school, I looked for the object but it was gone. Although my entire family was in the kitchen during the my initial observation, for some reason I did not mention it to anyone.

It was a warm and sunny day with clear skies all around.We heard a loud steady noise coming from the top of the hill (similar to wind blowing through a pile of irrigation pipe commonly used at that time). We ran to the top of the hill where the noise was coming from but did not see any irrigation pipe anywhere. We were standing in what seemed like a very strong wind blowing straight down on us and the noise was coming from above us. The pasture grass was blown flat as if you would hold a leaf blower down to the ground. The area that was being affected was about 30' in diamater. As we stood there mystified as to what was causing the noise and wind, it started to move to the east away from us and  subsided. We did not see any object in the sky. I really do not remember thinking about this to much but it is something that I have never forgotten. Several years ago I was having a couple of beers with a friend of my that was there that day. I said to him "" Do you something that we have never talked about?"" and he replied "" You mean that day we went fishing?"" and he refused to discuss it further. It seems strange that he would know exactly what I was talking about almost forty years later. I talked to a meterologist several weeks ago and described to him what we heard and felt and he did not seem to think it could have been a wind shear. I am looking for some explanation to this or is there instances of a similar occurance. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,40.4447,-98.2739

Back in the Nam I was part of a LRRP unit. LRRP stands for Long Range Recon Patrol and it consisted of a team of 6 men. a Team Leader, Asistant Team Leader, Medic, Engineer, Weapons Specialist, and Radioman. I was out with my team in IV Corps in the Vietnam Jungles. We had humped through the boonies all day and we set up an NDP (Night Defensive Perimeter). We took turns sleeping and keeping watch. At about 01:45 I heard movement ahead. My bro Levin heard it too. We woke up the other 4 men and we all readied ourselves for the upcoming contact. Suddenly we saw it... an alien. In real life. My stomach sank as I saw the creature. It looks like the modern alien... a grey human with a long face and large black eyes. It gave off an eery glow. Anyway, my friend Boltach raised his weapon and fired. He hit the being in the head with a short controlled burst. A brilliant blue syrupy fluid splattered the trees behind the alien. Just then we saw a dull light in the sky. Back then, we had a device called a Starlight scope. Only special operations had them. It is a lot like night vision. I focused in on the light in the sky and at that moment two more lights appeared. They formed the shape of a perfect triangle. The light at the top circled the two below in a figure 8 and zipped off. The remaining two seemed to collide and both zip off in the same direction as the first light. That night two other LRRP teams in our AO (area of operations)reported in the same activities. We called into HQ and they said they were having radio problems and would be offline for the rest of the night. We linked up with the other 2 teams for security reasons and shared our encounter with them. 4 of the other men with me on my team that night were later killed in various engagements in the war and I haven't been able to get in contact with anyone from the other teams. Only me and Levin are still around. I hope you can come up with other stories and vets who have reporting UFOs in the Nam. Out.",,,

The date entered is just a good guess.  I was 14 or 15 years old at the time, and although I do not remember the exact date I do remember the details as though it were yesterday.  I was laying in my bed trying to go to sleep, looking out my bedroom window.  My room was dark so I could see outside very well.  I saw a white light traveling just above the horizon at a speed I would consider to be in the range of an airplane.  It was traveling from the north toward the south.  I watched it for a few seconds and it came to a complete stop.  I thought huh,  this must be a helicopter.  It set perfectly still for a few minutes when I saw a smaller light come from behind the moutain I was looking toward and it went toward the larger light.  It went straight to it and when it got there it seemed to go inside the larger light.  I could only see one light anyway.  The larger light proceeded south at the speed I first saw it traveling, then accelerated very fast and went out of sight.  I have searched through your reports around this time and have saw no story that related to this sightning of mine.  It has been around 36 years since I saw this and I'm sure not to forget it.  If any one has any similar story or has sightings occuring in Alabama on or about this time I wish you would send them in.  I have an interest in the UFO phenomena because of this night.

After parking the car, I happened to glance up to observe very low hanging clouds and peeking out from one such cloud was a triangular shaped portion of a craft just exposing enough area to include a large observation window. Of particular note was the rootbeer metalic color of the craft. I have since seen such metalic colored material on 5 inch wide ribbon cabling used on experimental micro wave missiles. This area is very near a military airbase. Moffett field.  The craft remained motionless and no noise was heard. It was as if it was hovering very still as observations were being made.

The above information is mostly approximite.  The incident happened about 32 years ago, I have never made a report like this because I didn't think it really mattered.  But because it was very interesting I thought you would like to hear about it.  This incident happened after my mom picked me and my friends up from school.  We went to school in Agura, California, so my mom would drive through the Santa Monica mountains to get to our home in the Los Angeles basin.  This time she decided to take a rest at one of the look-outs along the mountainous coastline.  What I remember is my mom pointing up to the sky and gasping at the brite light's over the ocean.  It was really incredible to see these brite lights just sitting there not moving.  It was a site to see.  The form they took at first was just kind of spread out, and I'm not that sure how many there were, just that there were a lot of them.  Then with a blink of an eye all but one darted off into outerspace!!  Then they came back slowly and all of them merged with the single one that had just stayed there not moving.  My mom commented that the single one must be the mother ship.  She felt a calm feeling and that they were telepathically communicating with her. Also I was feeling very nauseous and under the weather.  But even though I felt sick I was overcome by a wonderful feeling.  As we witnessed these bright lights merging then they seperated again very slowly.  Then again in the blink of an eye they were gone.  The one distinct thing about these lights were that they were very bright white lights.  Everyone with us felt like they were putting on a show just for us.",2004-12-03T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

It was about 6:00 - 7:00 when we arrived and it was still light out.Looking out the window directly to the east we all saw a bright light just above the horizon . My first thought was  this is a star of some kind but much brighter than any other star I have seen . It kind of flickered at times but stayed at the same place & maintained the same intensity for about 2 hours .I thought during this time it must be a plane coming this way but It never really seemed to move at all.At dusk some of the group left.Two of us remained and we went to sit on the steps outside . The light seemed even brighter now being darker out but seemed to be in the same place. I mentioned something about the light to my friend & we both looked at the same time. Just then the light sped north and then made a perfect right angle turn straight up & gone!This happened in a split second & it had to be going very very fast.

I said, ""Oh my God, it can see us, it can hear us....it is coming over here"".  My stepsister screamed and fell to the bedroom floor.  I looked back at her and then back at the window.  I saw nothing in the yard, but then this soft whitish glowball crept up from the window below to show itself right in front of me in the window.  I looked into it trying to fixate on something concrete but could not..it was like looking into an endless thing.  Next, I felt this temendous feeling of joy, euphoria of love...nothing I have ever experience in this life.  Then, a butterfly fluttering in my chest.  I became uncertain and then I felt three thumps in my chest.  Each stronger than the one before.  I decided then to say ""hi"" and wave to it.  It ripped out of my body making me feel like it took something from me. The glowball flew across the street over a house.  My senses for the next few weeks were heightened.
