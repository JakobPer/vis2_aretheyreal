In autumn, 1968, I had been working Minuteman Missile Security, USAF, about 60 mi. E. of Rapid City, S. Dak.  I'd been chosen for TDY training.  Finishing early one day, my former crew of Security Police returned from 3 days afield.  They were buying all the binoculars & cameras they could afford.  It seems a ball of light was hovering up & down over a missile site in ""India"" Flt.(White Owl/Plainview area). The Strike Team was sent to check unusual alarms & reported it.  The dayshift crews(SP)and cook went up to the roof of the LCF & watched this action in the distance for several hours.  The ""Capsule Crew"" officers reported strange readings on their monitoring instrumentation.  The Missile Wing Hdqrs. back at Ellsworth called the LCF Security NCO, saying: ""You DO have something out there, don't you?""  The object was never seen again. This event occurred about 2 months after Rapid City newspapers reprinted accounts from papers in Wyoming and Colo. about USAF Security Police Strike Teams (2-man, in a pickup truck)had been ""chased"" from missile sites all the way back to Base, not just the LCF, at full speed, in those states. Since I read the newspaper accounts and had worked with these peers, I'd have expected some report of this to be on-file.  Apparently, such is not the case. I was NOT a witness to the object, itself.  If my peers had been joking, they would not have purchased the items mentioned.  All of us had SECRET clearances at the time. To my knowledge, none of my peers were ""warned"" at all, about keeping this ""quiet.""",,,

The sky was clear and there was not any other traffic. I was returning him home to our parents as he was 13 or 14 years old. He had been visiting me in the western part of the state. We were talking as I drove along and as if out of a science-fiction movie a large craft just appeared above and to the left of the road about 1-2 miles in front of us. I mean, I was looking ahead when this large craft just appears in the sky. It was descending abd was tilted down at about a 45 degree angle.  It then leveled itself over the highway then descended again, tilted down as before, and left my sight as there was a farm building sight with a grove of trees blocking my sight. That's when I turned to my brother and found him looking at me. At the same time we both said ""Did you see that?"". We're still traveling east and getting closer to where we saw this thing land. I say 'land' because we're in Iowa and we can see the farm place and all around the vicinity for a long way. I mean, we were really wondering what this was going to look like on the ground and close enough to the road to throw a rock and be able to hit it, to make a point. Probably a minute after we lost it from sight we were passing the farm place and there was'nt anything there except a harvested bean field. We arrived at our parents house a couple of hrs. later and told them about what we had seen. Understand, it's been 33-34 years since this took place, but our oldest sister[17 at the time] it was either 1 or 2weeks later brought my attention to the Des Moines Sunday Register. On the front page the second bold -type heading read"" Mysterious burn spots found in soybean fields "" and went on to mention Iowa and surrounding states south and west of Iowa.

It was 1974 or 1975, can't remember for sure without doing some research, I was working on a dredging project  on the Snake River, just below Ice Harbor Dam, a few miles northeast of Richland, Washington, five miles from the confluence of the Snake and Columbia Rivers. A large, disc shaped object, black on the bottom and silver grayish on the top, moved slowly across the Snake River, north to south, directly across my field of vision. I was sitting in an operator's cab about forty feet above the river and watched the object float silently across my field of vision. No noise, no lights, no erratic motion. Sixty to eighty feet long, fifteen feet high, moving at 10 mph, I got on my Motorola Radio and asked all vessels in the area did they see what I just saw, of course everyone that answered made fun of me. It wasn't a plane, it wasn't a blimp, it wasn't a helicopter. The Hanford Nuclear tank farms are about twenty miles south, huge electro transmission towers run down the east side of the river from Ice Harbor Dam. When I heard the UFO's description on the radio last night a huge weight was lifted from my shoulders, it was the same object I'd seen two and a half decades ago.

""However they saw me"" about 9/2/03 I saw on the history channel that the cattel mutalations started in about 1967.And they say that it is lasers that make those clean cuts. And back then there was no laser or portable ones. 1967 in late june I was 8 year old-- this was after I saw the ufo--I was playing alone in the woods just behind the house for a while. Then I came to the front of the yard to see we had company--My dads sister and boys my age --they went to the treehouse--so I to went to find them --I went up the tree into the the treehouse --5 minits or so later I noticed my right leg felt funny --So I went back down to the house to my bedroom and pulled down my long leg bluejeans --with no cut in them--or no blood on them --I looked at my leg and I had a 6 inch long cut a inch and a half deep--still not bleeding--and no pain --I went to show my mom to take me to the doctor and have it sticked up--She said what happend --and I said I don't no-- But it is a laser cut made by that ufo I saw. 1968 in june agin--I was with one of my 3 brothers picking blackbarrys with the family dog. This time we where accross the road from my dads house direcly under the path of the ufo I saw the year befor.  I said to my brother --I found more barrys over here so we went deeper into the woods and never seemed to find the barrrys --We thought we got lost--We got picked up by a ufo and they took us to a place and dropped us off--We think-- WE saw pine trees with snow on the branches ? --The next thing we no we found areselfs inside of a hourse fence a mile from home.--there is no way we could have walked there without crossing a tar road and 2 dirt roads. We did not cross any roads lost in the woods to get there. Thats where they dropped us off. We new right what had just happend. Also we don't remember when we lost the family dog. but the dog was at home. 1976 trapping season my same brother went to cheak our trap line in back of the house--with a friend they dident go far--on a hay feild at dusc they heard a crashing noise like branches braking--They stopped and saw a dark image of a small ufo come right out of the forest and stop at the feild --then it started to glow and they ran and got me and we all went back to the spot --we took a gun with --We dident see anything at frst so we went farther back to a tree line dividing 2 feilds--At the end of the next feild we could see a red object that flew in the night sky slowly over the trees --the light would go out--and when it came back on it was forward and down from where it was--and when the light went out agin and came back on it was back and up from where it just was--and we could see the tree tops lighting up under it --like it was taking picturs 1999 I was at my dads cabin in atkin MN with my family of 3 and we slept in a camper in the yard that stay.after we left my dad called me to say there was 3 dark rings in the grass in the most open part of the yard.He said they where not there untill we stayed over the weekend ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Her ex-husband decided to come back with us, so we ended up with two vehicles. My friend and her ex were in the car ahead and I had the children with me.  I remember quite a cars on the highway with us.  I can't remember how, when, or why, but the next thing I remember is standing outside the car looking into the sky.  Everyone was standing outside their cars looking up.  There was a huge ship in the sky with lights on the underside. It would pulse red then bright white.  Four smaller ships emerged out of the larger.  The four smaller ships put on a performance I'll never forget.  They would fly at ubelivable speeds towards each other and just when you knew they were going to crash they would veer off into different directions, or just stop as they came together seemly as one and hoover then shoot off in different directions.  It is hard to describe in words the flying feats they performed.  It was as if they were performing for us.  I'm not sure how long this went on but the next thing I remember is the larger ship hoovering just above the trees and people from the highway entering. The next memory is driving home (Orange, Texas) and one of the smaller ships following all the way.  From that time forward I have experienced many encounters, usually a small ship, sometimes white light, but usually red.  The details of these encounters I prefer not to discuss online.

I have never heard of anything like this. We lived several miles from both an army and air force base and their helicopters were a constant nuisance, flying way lower than they were supposed to do. So low, I could see the faces of the pilots and it would shake my house and wake up my babies, drowning out anything I was watching on TV or radio for several minutes at a time. I would call and complain to whoever I could and they would deny they were their helicopters, as they were required to fly no lower than 1,000 feet and not over residential areas, having different flight paths, I was told. I got nowhere with stopping them. I would call when they were pounding noise over my house and tell them to hear this and tell me they weren't coming over my house, but it did no good. They only denied they knew anything about them.  We lived out in a remote area, where houses were spaced out and far from town, however we had houses and an apt. building within sight of us on a lonely country road surrounded by acres of thick woods. My house was a mobile home placed on a brick basement down in a dip or hollow of the dirt road with rises of hills on either side of us. We were surrounded by woods and tall skinny trees. Aspen, birch and pine. There was nothing on the other side of the road from us and behind us but woods. We also had thick woods on either side of us, but at the top of the hills, were houses. We had a dog that was about 98% wolf and Malamute. He was big, fast and fearless. He was always barking at moose or bear that would come into our yard and was afraid of nothing and no one. We kept him leashed on our deck at night. He usually kept silent watching until an intruder would come too close and then I'd hear his chain sliding across the wood before he'd start barking to chase them off, pulling on his chain to give chase.  He ran free in the daytime with me for protection from bear and moose as I'd take the baby up the road for a stroller ride. One time he saved the life of my 1 yr old baby and myself when he lept out of the woods to get in front of her stroller to face 2 St. Banard dogs that were threatening my daughter, growling at her, inching closer to her with teeth hanging out and intentions to attack her. I didn't know what to do with her in front of me just 2 feet from those hostile dogs. Afraid to make any sudden moves. But then, there was my protector, with fangs bared, hackles raised, head lowered, long legs spread ready to pounce, and this terrible rumbling sound coming out of his throat, my dog stood his ground before them giving me time to turn around and run down the hill to my house while he tangled with them both. I thought they'd kill him, but he came home unscathed and smiling, pretty happy with himself.  Besides the helicopters that bothered me so much, I had interference with my TV that only got 3 channels in those early days in alaska broadcasting. The screen would suddenly get snowy and then I'd hear intermittent beeping noises that were very strange and sporadic, like a code or signal of some kind. Very high pitched. If I watched the snowy screen, after awhile it seemed to form into patterns I could see somehow in conjunction with the beeps. Usually after that, the black helicoptes would come flying over my house so low I would run out and curse them, shaking my fist at them. My wolf dog would watch them, unbothered.  But this one night, I was ironing while watching TV while my husband dozed in his chair and my babies slept in their rooms. The dog was out on the porch. Suddenly the TV did it's snowy beeping thing that made me mad because I was watching a movie. But while it was quiet, I heard the dog's chain sliding across the wood deck like it did when something or someone came into our yard, and then I couldn't believe my ears, as he was whining like some terrified dog next to the house wall. I had never, ever, seen or heard such behavior from him for any reason. He got louder and louder and was scratching and banging on the wall in the corner of the deck, trying to get off his leash and run away. Trying to hide for some reason.  I couldn't believe this and without thinking I could be in any danger, as he would be taking on any bear or moose that could be there, I opened the door to see what could possibly be wrong with him. What in the world could be out there to make him be acting this way? This was a first and I wanted to see what would scare this brave dog. When I opened the door to tell him to stop it, I looked to my left where he was cowering without looking to my right. I was scolding him when I noticed he wasn't looking at me, but over my head, behind me, while he was trying to back himself into the corner of the house, pushing back with his front paws as he sat down with his back to the wall and nowhere else to go. Something in his eyes, the look on his face of pure terror made the hair on the back of my neck stand up and I wondered what he was seeing behind my back that I hadn't looked at when I came out on the deck.  I turned around and was so shocked by what I saw that I almost fainted. I noticed at the same time that the night had taken on a very loud hush. Not a sound was to be heard and it seemed there was a heavy thick feeling in the air. The silence was profoundly loud, somehow. Total silence, giving me the sensation that time stood still or suspended as nothing but my dog moved behind me or made a sound. Everything felt slowed down somehow. Slow motion for me. Slow thinking, responses, maybe shock.  And in this total silence, there hung at tree top level on the hill above my house, two oblong black boxes, just hanging there, sort of floating, not moving or making a sound. One was right at the tree top level, the other one was slightly behind it and higher. A cord of some kind connected the two boxes like a gas hose, coming down from the higher one and bending like an ""S"" to the lower one. Reminded me, in later years, of the way our airplanes refuel each other while flying. But it connected them from the back of the lower one to the front of the higher one. There was nothing discernable on or about them to say which was front or back or anything distinguishable in any way. They were smooth without anything sticking out or raised or reflecting any light. They had no lights either. They were about the size of the freight containers that big rigs pull, or bigger. Very long and square edged. They were solid, dense, black. No shine. I couldn't comprehend how these heavy looking solid huge box shaped things were defying gravity to be so silently hanging there. Just there where nothing should have been floating.  It suddenly hit me that my wolf dog was still crying and trying to dig a hole thru the deck behind me to get away and I was all alone standing there facing this dangerous situation outside in the dark. I hadn't even heard him for that time in space. I felt very threatened by it. It seemed malevolent. Brooding, watching me. Caught in the act, whatever it had been doing as they floated there. I felt watched like a bug on a slide. That it would somehow grab me or hurt me any second, the longer I waited out there all alone. It was obvious my protector was not going to be protecting me this nite. No one knew I was out here, either. My hair felt like it was standing up all over my body, like electricity in the air. After staring at that for I don't know how long as I seemed too stunned to move, it was like I ""woke up"" suddenly, coming to my senses. I turned to the front door I'd come out of to dash back in the house and was so afraid, I couldn't get the door to open or the knob to turn.  I pounded hysterically on the door, calling to my husband to open it up as I thought it had locked behind me. All the while I pounded on the door and screamed for help, I was aware it was still hanging there to my left, watching me. I was afraid it would take me I was making so much noise, if the door didn't open. I don't know why I thought going thru that door would save me. After what seemed like an eternity of banging, the door opened and I fell in the door to the floor, yelling at him to shut the door, shut the door. He was confused, not knowing what was going on, saying the door hadn't been locked and what was wrong with me and the dog? I hurridly told him about the black oblong boxes hanging ominously outside up on the hill and he laughed at me like I'd been dreaming. Maybe 15 seconds had gone by since I fell in the door and I dragged him outside to see for himself but they were gone. Completely gone. Not a trace. We went back inside, I was shaking all over, telling him over and over what I'd seen. The beeping stopped on the TV and the program came back on and then the helicopters came by.  I have told many people about this story, hoping to find anyone else who has seen such a strange thing but no one has. I called MUFON several years ago to ask if anyone had ever reported anything remotely similar to it, as it has bothered me for all these years since then, wondering what it was, if I had been in danger, if I had missing time. It seemed to be later when I was back in the house than when I went out there. I thought I was only out there for less than a minute, but at least 15 minutes had gone by or more when I came back in. What took my husband, who was sleeping in his chair not 5 feet from the door, so long to wake up and open the door with all the commotion I was making? Why was my wolf so terrified when nothing fazed him in his life before that? I wondered what my dog saw that I didn't or didn't remember seeing? Or what he heard or sensed that I didn't. The man that I talked to at MUFON said that around that time in Canada just a couple, or maybe a few isolated cases of black oblong or square boxes were reported, but never again or from anywhere else that he knew of. He had no clue about it anymore than I did, saying it was fairly rare.  I would like to know what they were, what they were doing there, if anyone else has ever experienced anything like it or has any ideas about what we experienced. It was also strange that it was so quiet and no one else seemed to know about it. Other dogs weren't barking or whining. How did they leave so fast? I am not a good person to measure distances, but I'd say the tree was maybe 4 carlengths (end to end) high, and it was maybe 5 or 6 car (van) lenghts (end to end) from my property up to the hill where the tree was where they were at. I don't know how far that measures, but they were close. And what about those black helicopters? I always thought they were associated with the military bases, but what were they doing always going over my house and that beeping on my TV?  I've seen other things at different times in different places, but maybe I should make a different report out for each one. Thank you ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My engine (diesel) did not stop due to the fact that it was a compression release type shutdown. There was absolutely no sound audible above my own engine noise, I did not try to stop and could not risk looking up from the narrow two lane road in the dark as I knew that if I looked directly into the source of the light I would lose all night vison and what little visual contact I had with the road, I couldn't risk that as I was traveling at 65-70 mph at the time.

It was about 10 AM with a clear blue sky when I turned off Hwy 101 to go up the Hoh.  I was looking at the tops of the trees when I saw a silver disk about 100 yards away just above tree top level.  It was moving very slow in the opposite direction (east to west).  The sun reflected off the craft.  It was a silver disk with a round dome on top and bottom.  The top dome was bigger than the bottom one.  My guess is that it was maybe 30 feet wide.  I watched it for a few seconds (ten at the most) before I lost sight of it through the trees.  I though about stopping to get out but I thought that I'd be able to get a better vantage point and look down across the area from a clear cut (logged off area).  One never came up.  We stopped at a store about 15 minutes up the road. When we got out of the car, two low flying military jets flew over head in the direction we had just come from.  When I saw it, I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  At first I told myself it was an airplane but there were no wings.  It just didn't belong in the picture. My fiance (now wife) and cousin did not see it.  They noticed that I was looking at something as I drove but they told me that they figured I was looking at a bird or something.  I didn't say anything to them until afterward (""I just saw a flying saucer."") because I wasn't sure of what I was looking at.

My wife and I were driving along the highway, neither of us remember any other traffic on the road. We first noticed that the craft seemed to be   be standing still in the sky so we slowed down and finally pulled over to the side of the road. We opened the window and even though the (plane) was not very high i n the sky, it made no sound. Eventually I got out of the car and walked to the side of the road. I remember the gravel under my feet. My wife says she doesn't rememeber me leaving the car, so that remains unclear. Shortly after the incident, my wife and I just returned from a party were entering our home when the phone rang. The person on the other end said he was with a ufo group that met regularly at lakehurst navel base. He asked if I had seen something unusual or reported a ufo. Since My wife and I had told no one  of our sighting, and because he got my first name right and my last name wrong and I had never heard of the group he spoke of I quickly rejected his offer. My wife and I discussed again what we had seen. We surmised that we had seen some new military aircraft, larger than a 747 that could remain staionary for almost a half an hour without making a sound. We felt after that phone call it might be best to stick to that story, even to ourselves. But that is only where the story starts. A couple of years later, to quick smoking we both decided to visit a hypotherapist. The sessions worked, but later my wife admitted to remembering something she had never told anyone. She told me that years before our sighting, she had experienced, missing time while driving near her home, in Woodbridge NJ. She said that it was almost like waking from a strange dream, angry and frustrated because she appeared to be lost only a few miles from her home. It was then that I was able to tell her that I remembered a similar occurance. While we were still just dating I was driving home from her house to my house at the Jersey shore, when I felt myself getting drowsy. The next thing I remembered was awaking at my exit, some 30 miles later, only checking my car's clock it seemed to have taken an hour to make a drive that usually took half the time. As we talked, my wife also related something else that raised the hairs on the back of my neck. She said that one night in bed she woke up only to see someone or something seated on the edge of our bed. She said that the figure said nothing only quietly stared at her, while she unsucsessfully attempted to wake me. She than said that she went back to sleep, and until the night she told me had forgotten the incident, chalking it up to a bad dream. For all these years since we have laughed off all those incidents as bad dreams or silly misconceptions, until last week, @sept 25th 2003. My daughter who is married and a mother, living with her family in Georgia, (we currently live in Arizona) was talking to me on the phone when she mentioned a strange incident. She told me that she had awakened a few nights before to see a troll like figure on the edge of her bed. When I hung up I told my wife she shouldn't have told our daughter about the troll, as we'd called him for years. When she swore she hadn't and I saw the look of concern on her face, I knew she was telling the truth. We decided then not to tell our daughter anything, but to tell our story and see if some one else has experienced something similar. Nothing has happened to us persoonally recently but the incident with our daughter has left us perplexed. Are there any other intergenerational events like ours. By the way our daughter has never to our knowledge seen a ufo, though when she was in the second grade she won an essay contest by writing a story describing being taken up in a space ship. Her teacher was so enamored by the reality of the story she asked us if she could keep it and thinking nothing of it we let her. Now we are sorry we didn't keep that story, because it might have been a  true accounting of an encounter. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-10-07T00:00:00,,

WA My friend and I were heading home late one evening (from another one of her dreaded dog shows!)  We were driving east on the very outskirts of Ellensburg, WA.  We were chatting away, trying to pass the time since it was a long trip home.  It was an extremely clear (and slightly frigid) night.  We both noticed that off to our left, about 50 feet away, was a stationary, extremely bright, orange,  seemingly burning orb.  At that close proximity, it seemed to be about 3 feet across. It was very unnerving. Niether of us talked much of it for the duration of the ride home.  I think we were struggling to rationalize it.  The oddest thing that sticks in my head today: Is that it was DEFINATELY dripping something. (I haven't found anyone online that has seen one ""dripping"". (?) It was a thicker consistency than water it seemed.  It's hard for me to guesstimate how high off the ground it was, as the hwy/road we were driving on is elevated from the valley floor below.  But from the perpective of the level of the road, It could not have been more than 30 feet.  So Maybe it was 100' of the ground?  Final note:  Oddly enough, when I was trying to research this phenominon at the local liabrary - I found a small book entitled ""Orange Light Theory""!  The information was focused on the history of similar activity in that area dating back into the native american history.  It also noted that one of the more recent and documented cases were from volunteers that were at ""fire look out"" builings located on each end of the valley.  They both continuously kept tabs with each other via radio, on whether it was something for them to dispatch firefighters.  Or whether it was one of the stationary orange lights they were getting used to seeing. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-10-07T00:00:00,46.979,-120.4703

I work for a locksmith shop in EL Paso, Tx. The date of the incident was July 19, 2000 around 1:00 PM. My self and an accompanied employee stopped at our 1 O'clock appointment on Robinson Street in Central El Paso. My employee and I approached the front door of the residence when he noticed up in the sky next to the sun a triangular formation of three spherical dots. We stood there in auh and wondered what they were. The customer of ours answered the door to greet us. She wondered what it was we were looking at so she looked up too. Her gesture was, ""maybe they are Harrier Jet planes Hovering"". In response I told her, ""Yeah, but where are the wings"". These dots just hovered in that triangular formation without moving for about 10 mins. My employee went inside to see what it was she needed and I stayed there looking at them. After those 10 minutes past, there was a first visible sign of movement. The dot north of the triangular formation moved through the formation in a southeasterly direction and did not stopped until all three dots were in a single line formation. There were two dots close to one another still in their orignal positions and the third dot which had moved southeastern was further in distance from the other two. I could not believe what I was seeing. I then went inside the home to help my employee with the work. I wondered what it was I was seeing and remebered thinking to myself, ""is this what I think they are"". I went to the back yard of the house and looked up in the sky. The two dots that were next to each other were gone and the third dot in the south was still there. But the more I looked at it, it seemed to brighten up as the powerful reflection from the sun was bouncing off of it silvery in color. It almost seemed to grow in size because of the expansion of the reflection of light. I know El Paso fairly well. I've lived here all my life. The path that the dot had taken southeasterly was in the direction towards lower southeast El Paso. I figured that the dot maybe ! was hovering between 15,000-to 30,000 feet above the ground. Because there patches of clouds in the vicnity of the dot. The direction I was looking in was towards southeast El Paso where Zaragosa Drive is, which is about 20 miles from where I was. That's about the distance the UFO was from me, I suppose. I stood there for about 15 minutes, after that I went inside through the house to go out the front door to our service vehicle. My employee was in the back of our truck changing the locks. I looked towards the southeastern sky again and notice the dot was gone. The way El Paso is divided is like any other city. We have sections like central, west, east and northeast. The very last tip of the Rocky Mountain chain stops in Central El Paso. The mountain divides the city in two major halves east and west. From there you get the rest of the sections here in El Paso I mentioned. Well, by now I was looking in all directions at the sky and could not see a thing. My employee asked me, ""what was that"". I told him joking ""maybe they were UFO's"". He laughed and so did I. We continued to work. The house faced south into Mexico and we had backed the truck in to have better access from the house. My employee was changing the locks and I was standing outside the truck with my back to the north. My employee looked over to me and then he noticed a dot moving from west to east from the north slowly under a cloud that was low in altitude. He screamed to me to look. I saw the dot moving in that direction and as it reached the mountain it just suddenly turned south, traveled a small distance and stopped below another dot we had not noticed was there. I thought, these cannot possibly be balloons because there was stiff breeze west to east that was moving through El Paso. Only something with some type of propoltion can change directions like that. Looking at the two dots they seemed to be getting smaller, both of them at the same time, which meant they were traveling upward towards space. Eventually they faded out into the blue! atmosphere. After that, all of a sudden, in the same path, position and direction, maybe atltitude west to east from the north a dot was traveling again. This time it went straight over the mountain to the east and disappeared. By this time I was feeling previledge at what I was witnessing. Hard to believe, Yes, but not impossible. As we were trying to finish that job I called my uncle and told him what I was seeing. He was shocked. At that same time I looked up in the sky, because a large circular cloud covered the sun. An aurora of light on the egde of cloud emitted. If you ever seen a desert sky during the summer, the sky is very bright and hard to look up without squinting. At the northern edge of the cloud two dots appeared and stayed a certain distance from the cloud. As the cloud moved east, so did the the two dots. They seemed to dance with the cloud, but at the same time the distance between tehmselves and the cloud never changed. If the cloud slowly rotated, so did they. This cloud as it was moving still covered the sun. I was still on the phone with my uncle telling him to look up in the sky towards that cloud where the sun was. I guess where he was he could see the dots. Anyways, when the sun was about to pierce out the egde of the cloud the most northern of the two dots seemed to have changed shape as it moved south above and over the cloud. It looked as if it were tumlbing. I could see this tumbling motion because of the reflection of the sunlight from it. Then, as it reached the south side of cloud still tumbling, it literally vanished from my eyes. I did not see it fly away up, down or sideways. It just vanished. We finally finished the job and traveled to another job site. As we were driving down the road from where we were, I could still see those dots traveling in all directions. I was dismayed and disarrayed but, I felt wonderful and previledged to have witnessed the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life (other than my child being born). Before this incident I always looke! d up in the sky, not because I was trying to find UFO's, but because I love jets. I never stop looking up, but now I know what to look for and where. The reason I say this, is because I have seen on eight different occasions after that day, the spherical type of UFO phenomenon.

PD)) Three faint objects in wedge formation travelling very fast and very high I stepped out to smoke a cigarette, like I have done many times before.  I was living in a rural area, and light pollution was almost non-existant.  It was a crisp and clear night.  I was looking at the sky, as I always did, spotting satellites and meteors, etc.  I then saw three very faint lights, in a isosoles triangular formation, travelling from north to south.  There was one light in the front of the formation, and the other two were behind to left and right.  They travelled in a straight line like satellites do, and made no sound.  Their brightness remained the same the entire time I saw them.  The strange thing was that at certain times, one of the two trailing objects would start to lag behind the other two, and then suddenly accellerate to catch up, to make the formation a perfect isosoles triangle again.  I was unable to tell the altitude of the objects, but it seemed they were in earth orbit.  If they were in orbit, the three objects would have been separated by several miles between each other.  I thought they might have been fighter jets from Plattsburg AFB, and if they were they would have been flying very high.  However, they covered the sky from horizon to horizon in about 3 minutes, and as I said they were very faint.  My second guess was they were maybe SDI satellites, due to the triangular formation, maybe used to triangulate an incoming warhead?  I thought I would report this anyway, hoping maybe someone could answer this.",2003-10-07T00:00:00,,

Clear sky, no clouds. Returning from walking to a store in ""old"" Bellevue, I look up as several airliners, having departed Sea-Tac Airport, one-by-one climb out and turn right over the city. Though there is a high, evening haze, and their altitudes estimated to be between 6,000 and 7,000 feet, the aircraft are sharp in outline and therefore easily identified as to type. (that is they are not so high that the haze obscures detail). Another flies over. I glance up, but in an instant see something else. Something so unlike anything I have seen in the skys, that I do a ""double-take"". For there, hanging stock still and silent, high-- very high in the haze, so high that only vague detail can be seen--is a huge, globe-shaped object! Perhaps pale yellowish-green, or a light copper color--dificult to tell through that haze. And, while in general it is a ball, the surface appears to be composed of a number of adjoining planes: either triangular in shape or rectangular, or perhaps some other geometric figure, or maybe all three. Again due to the altitude and haziness, I am not sure. In addition, some of the planes appear to protrude beyond their neighbors.  Staring at the object for perhaps 20 to 25 seconds, I wish that I had my binoculars (I'd gladly have given a $50 bill to've had 'em with me). Then--""Why not? I'll run home, grab them, rush back and have a real llok-see!"" Shaking my finger at the thing and shouting, ""Stay there. Don't go 'way. I'll be right back!"", of I dash. Arriving againat the spot, huffing and puffing after the four-block round trip, I look, but alas--see nothing. Even searching all about several times with the ""binocs"" reveals only empty, hazy sky. It is gone, dammit!  I return to the location, at the same time, for two successive evenings, thinking that perhaps I had actually seen a giant satellite of some kind. But, nothing is there. No, I did not see a satellite; what I did see (though ever so briefly) was a gigantic USO-- Unidentified Stationary Object--bigger than a football field. Heck, bigger even than the stadium, itself! It may have been 500 to 700 feet, or perhaps much greater, in diameter; furthermore, at an altitude of at least 30,000 to 40,000 feet, it looked to be about the size of a dime when held at arm's lenth. Yet, at such a height; therefore, so far up in the haze, I could still just make out htos adjoining and interlocking planes which made up its surface.

I asked my brother if it was a ufo and as a typical older brother he told me to shut up and go to bed.  Well about 10 min later my mom started screaming and told everyone to go to the living room and look out the big window which faced the same direction as my bedroom window.  As we all ran to the room to see why my mom was screaming (there were 4 boys and my dad and mom) we heard a humming noise over our house.  When we got to the room we all saw a disked shaped object with alternating red and white lights around it in the distance.  It seemed like and eternity that it just hovered there, as we watched we saw some planes getting closer and eventually it seemed as though it wavered a little bit and proceeded to shoot straight up at an enormous speed.

We pulled off the highway along with about 40 other vehicles and we got out to have a better look.  The craft was like any other I had ever seen and I have seen plenty. I have worked in aviation for about 15 years including a tour in the U. S. Airforce. This massive craft just stopped and hovered over us for about 6 minutes. It was black or dark grey and had very few lights but there was enough residual light from the highway streeet lights to allow us to see the size and shape of the craft and some of its massive demensions. I would have some difficulty giving an exact lateral measurement except to say that it could have easily have contained a nuclear aircraft carrier. It was nearly as tall as it was long if you were to include the vertical projections. It was hexagonal in shape and had 3 vertical projections above the upper surface ending in a t tail formation located equidistant at the 120 240 and 360 degree locations if you were to look at the craft as a disk. there was one white light in the center of the bottom surface of the craft and a red and blue light on each side of the horizontal element of the vertical projections. The craft was completely silent. After about 8 minutes the craft moved suddenly and rapidly twards the northwest in the same direction that the other 2 craft had gone and was shortly followed by 5 F-16 fighters from I believe Otis ANG Base which is in close proximity to the south west near the towns of Sandwich and Falmouth. That base is no longer active.

I stopped my car at the top of the overpass and just watched it move slowly W, right along I-195, and eventually disappearing over the trees in the distance.

"3 people in Abilene, TX observe star-like object performing normally physically impossible maneuvers in night sky.",Abilene,TX,1995-07-15T00:00:00,sphere,2 hours,"Occurred : 7/15/1995 00:00  (Entered as : 07/15/1995 0:00) Reported: 10/31/2003 11:22:41 PM 23:22 Posted: 11/8/2003 Location: Abilene, TX Shape: Sphere Duration:2 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32795.html,"3 people in Abilene, TX observe star-like object performing normally physically impossible maneuvers in night sky. I had been sitting on the front porch here in Abilene, Texas, in July of 95, with my wife and one of my employees, enjoying a pleasant conversation, when I decided to walk out to the end of our sidewalk to stretch my back and legs, leaving them chatting on the couch on the front porch. Once I reached the end of the sidewalk, I looked up and noticed how bright and beautiful the stars were, so, it being such a nice, warm summer evening, I decided to lay on my back on the end of the sidewalk, and to watch the stars for awhile. After laying there for only a few minutes, I thought I saw something move out of the corner of my eye, up in the sky, perhaps a shooting star, so I moved my gaze over to where I thought I saw it.   After only a few seconds, I saw a ""star"" suddenly start to move in a very birarre pattern, in an area about the size of a silver dollar, held at arm's length.  It moved within that area for about 10 to 30 seconds, then stopped.   When I looked away from it, and then looked back, it looked so much like any other star, that I could not differentiate it from any other star I had been seeing, so much so that I couldn't even tell if I was looking at the object that had moved, or if I was seeing a star. When the ""star"" moved, it did not accelerate the way everything else I had ever seen had; and when it came to a stop, it did not slowly decelerate, either.  When it moved, it was instantly going full speed, and when it stopped, it just stopped.  There was no speeding up or slowing down.  It was either moving at full speed, or it wasn't.   And when it turned or changed direction, it did not do so with a curving movement; it just suddenly changed directions, often changing it's direction of movement 45, 90, even 180 degrees, going back the direction it had come from! After performing these ""movements"" for 30 seconds or so, it would stop for about that same length of time, and then start moving again. After seeing that happen a couple of times, the reality of what I was seeing, that I was definately seeing a genuine UFO, so overwhelmed me, that I actually wondered if I was losing my mind!  So much so that it actually scared me! I needed someone else to tell me if they were seeing this too, so I got up and, unbelievably calmly and quietly asked my wife if she would mind walking out to the end of the sidewalk with me.   She did, and when we got to the end of the walk, I turned my back to where Pete was up on the porch, 40 feet away, and told her, ""Honey, I want to ask you something, and when you answer me, no matter what you have to say or how you feel, I want you to WHISPER your answer to me, and I don't want you to make ANY kind of movements with your arms or hands, or even your head, that Pete can see from up there on the porch.  In fact, I am going to stand with my body between you and Pete, and if you have any pointing to do, be sure my body is between the two of you so that he cannot see you. (I am a full head taller than her, and wider.)  Do you understand?"" She said yes, so without looking up or pointing, I told her, ""I want you to look up into the sky, where the stars are, right directly above my head, but do it very casually to where Pete won't notice, and I want you to tell me if you see anything unusual, but remember!  Do not SAY or do anything that Pete could hear or see."" I stood very, very close to her, doing my best to block Pete's view of her, and she began to search the sky above us.  After about 20 seconds she started to say, ""Honey, I don't know what you're wanting me to see, cause I'm not seeing anything..."", and just as the last word was leaving her mouth, I saw her eyes get big, and a very excited, stunned look come on her face, and knew she had seen it too, so I very quickly whispered, ""shhhhh! Don't say it! Whisper it in my ear!"" I leaned over and put my ear close to her mouth, and she whispered, with trembling and excitement in her voice:  ""A star!  There's a STAR moving around in a very weird way!  It's zipping around, changing directions, and not speeding up or slowing down!""  I told her, ""take my hand, and with your finger, trace out the pattern that it is making.""  And she drew the exact patterns on my hand that I had seen the ""star"" make. With great relief, having been reassured that I was not going insane, I whispered ""thank you"" to her, and told her that I was going to call Pete out and go through the same thing with him, and for her to be very careful not to give him any verbal or visual ques whatsoever as to what we had seen, or what we wanted him to look for. To make a long story short, I repeated this same ""test"" with Pete, and he too, went through almost the same exact stages that my wife had gone through; at first not seeing anything, and then the sudden realization that he, too, was seeing something like nothing else he had ever seen in his life! We watched that object for a couple of hours, as it performed ""maneuvers"" in a certain area of the sky, about the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length, and then, after doing that for several minutes, it would suddenly make a ""long jump"" over to another part of the sky, where it would repeat the same or similar maneuvers that we had seen it do, in the location it had just left. We all feel absolutely sure that this object was a long ways outside of any atmosphere surrounding our planet, and while it certainly appeared to actually be as far away as the stars themselves, especially when the objected stopped, I realize it was probably actually between the earth and the stars, probably far closer to earth, than to the stars, although when the craft stood still, it looked so much like all the stars, that there was NO way you could tell if you were looking at a star, or at the craft!  (I have a feeling that this was deliberate on the part of ""some body!"") We watched it for perhaps two hours, during which time it slowly made it's way from almost straight overhead, to towards the southeast.  (My wife says it moved towards the southWEST.)  We watched it for so long that we could no longer stay awake, having all of us put in a hard work week, and seeing that it was apparently going to do nothing but continue what we had been seeing it do for the past two or three hours, my wife and I went in and to bed, and Pete went home.   Even now, years later, we still sometimes watch for it to reappear, as we are sure and hope that it will. Since then, I visit endless websites and listen to Coast To Coast AM and other programs almost every single day, hoping to hear about others who have seen a similar object, and every now and then, I do!   In fact, I read of someone seeing what is apparently the same exact object, only YESTERDAY, October 16, 2003, on the National UFO Reporting website, and so I felt prompted to also post my report of this similar sighting. In conclusion, I'd like for it to be known that I am 50 years old, that I was born on an Air Force Base, that I have been a student pilot, and have attended dozens of air shows, and have watched many television programs about air craft, but I have never, ever seen anything that could even remotely do the kinds of things that this craft did!   Unless the pilot of the vehicle had some kind of survival gear light years ahead of anything we have now, there is no way a human could have survived the instantaneous application of g-forces that were obviously applied to the body of the vessel's pilot, (if it even had one!)   And obviously, the craft itself had to be light years ahead of anything we have now. Having been a communications technician, and always being strongly interested in these kinds of things, I would dearly love to have the opportunity to work with, and hopefully even to take a ride in, one of these vehicles, some day! PS: Abilene is the home of Dyess Air Force Base, the home of the B1 bomber, and this incident happened about 3 miles from the base, but over East Abilene, not over the base.  I have, however, since seen a missile like object, during the ""Gulf War,"" take off from the area north of Dyess, go apparently to the edge of the atmosphere, and arc over, then to head east towards the general direction of the Middle East.",2003-11-08T00:00:00,32.39435138461539,-99.79004400000001

We consider the source of the report to be highly credible.  We express our gratitude with this individual for sharing the report with NUFORC.  PD)) My friends and I were approached directly by a cylindrical UFO from about three miles away to within 60ft of us, while driving. Peter, I agree with your position regarding the submission of observations and incidents to a central point for all the obvious reasons. Please do not publish this report with my name.... I have several other incidents to report and will be happy to provide them as time allows. It was good to speak with you regarding your concerns and I look forward to speaking with you again,    23Jan99, Oakland CA, Cylindrical UFO:   I met ((male name deleted)) about 3 weeks before this sighting, below.  I told him two nights before that I had seen UFOs, that I suspected there was more to it.  I told him that, if he spent any time around me, he might see them, too. ((female name deleted)) has tolerated my focus on the UFO matter for the majority of our relationship.  She was privy to conversations with my relatives about sightings that occurred earlier in my life so I had the semblance of credibility with her.  She was also aware of my discussions with ((male name deleted)). On January 23, 1999 myself, ((name deleted)), and ((female name deleted)) were Southbound on I-80 in Oakland, CA.   I was in the front right hand seat, ((female)) was driving, and Ian was in the back.  It was about 7:30 PM, dark with overcast above 4500ft.   The lights and skyline of Oakland, CA were visible and reflecting light off of the overcast. As we began the large curve leads past the Oakland Post Office I looked past ((female)) and pointed to the East and said ""Now that’s unusual.""  Several miles away we could see a large yellow light over a white light. It was between the Oakland hills and us. We then made the curve at the Oakland Post Office and, at the point were the freeway begins to rise we again spotted the unusual light.  At this point it began to turn and changed to a cylindrical shape viewed broadside. It was emitting yellow light from its entire length.  It was cylindrical but slightly tapered.  There were no wings, no rotors, no thrust port and it was clearly not a blimp.  On its underside, at each end were two very large white lights.  It was traveling end forward and perpendicular to our direction of travel - Southbound, from left to right us at a moderate rate of speed.  It was about 3 miles away, perhaps further.  On the front of the cylinder, above was a small, irregularly fluttering green light, on the front underside a small red irregularly fluttering light.  ((female)), who was driving, exclaimed ""Weird!.""  ((male)) was having some difficulty locating it.  It was already obvious to me that it wasn’t anything conventional.   As we continued Southbound the object arrived at a point between us and the Oakland Federal buildings. At this time we began to make out details including four equally spaced vertical separations and a horizontal deck. Towards the leading end we could barely make out shapes. I am left with a distinct memory of this craft and crew framed against the background of the newly completed Oakland Federal Buildings.  The craft must have passed with in 100yds of them as it continued to approach.   Suddenly, in a moment, faster than I could blink, the object leaped from the location near the Federal buildings and stopped about 60ft from our windshield. It covered perhaps two miles in a manner that should have killed anything living that might be inside.  At this point the I-80/880 freeway rises off the ground to about 75 feet, passes under the Highway 24 overpass and continues for at least a mile as a raised freeway.  So our vantage point regarding what followed was from 40 to 75feet above the ground.  The entire side of the craft that was facing us was transparent.  It was as if one half of the tube became transparent and the side facing away from us was opaque.  It was emitting a very yellow light from its interior.  Inside, it had a deck evenly dividing it in half, lengthwise.  There seemed to be 5 evenly spaced vertical ribs against the opposite wall from the one we were looking through. The entire interior of the craft appeared to be visible.  It seemed to be completely hollow, with no ‘engine compartment’, or any other furnishings. It had similar dimensions to a cardboard toilet paper tube.  A width to length ratio of about 1 to 5.  I became aware of three shapes that were visible at the front end of it.  The first was somewhat obscured by the large, white external light directly underneath.  The other two were evenly spaced from the first.  At this point I had a rush of adrenaline and my vision seemed to go telescopic. It was like this bizarre scene I was witnessing suddenly filled my entire field of vision.  ((female)), who was driving, said ""Are those ?""  I blurted out ""No!,"" before she could say what we both already knew- aliens.  This is a scene I am not likely to ever forget.  There was no mistake.  These were not human beings.  At the front end of it, with their hands resting on a thin bar or table were three people.  They seemed so similar that they looked like paper dolls.  ((female)) and I could both could see them clearly. They were standing, you could see their legs below the bar or table, facing us.  They were backlit by the yellow light and it was reflecting off the flat sides of their heads. They were staring right at us.  The sensation was one of very focused attention..  The heads were oversized, their foreheads were about a third larger than that of a human being.  The eyes were very large and dark and they have an occipital ridge, eyebrow, oriented like ours..  They seem to have narrow shoulders and hips and they have longer upper arm and upper leg bones than human beings.   This gives them a sort of stretched appearance.  They seemed to be about the same size as human beings, though I didn’t have reliable scale of comparison. The face is small, under the eyes but because of the backlighting I couldn’t see other details.  It was one-step above a silhouette.  Even so they were clearly not human beings.   I would like to try to describe the sensations running through us at this point.  ((female)) was doing her best to maintain control of the car while being emotionally overwhelmed.  Ian was counting down through the list of things the object was not.  I felt like Bugs Bunny looks when he loses morale and his ears droop down over his shoulders.  I slid down in the seat and made a conscious effort to stifle the fear that came with realizing that ‘it’  was happening again.  The fear was along the lines of ""I’ve studied hard to understand this, and based on what I feel about what I’ve already seen and what I have learned, I really wanna be somewhere else, anywhere else but here.""  I didn’t sense danger as much as I felt extreme self consciousness.  The reality of the fantastic was scary.  I have prepared myself for this type of thing, both as a martial artist and a UFO experiencer so the fear phase was very short-lived.  I moved through it quickly and started observations.  I turned to ((female)) and asked her what time it was.   She said ""7:34."" Then I rolled down my window and started really watching.  She took confidence from my focus on observations and started watching closely herself.   We went below an overpass, the Highway 24/ I-880 overpass, and the craft intercepted us on the other side. It was less than its own length from our windshield.  In other words, it was flying sideways from its original end-on orientation about 75 to 100 feet in front of our car.  It was about 50 feet in the air.  At this point it had turned off its internal or deck lights.  Now only the two large white lights located at each end of the craft and the small red and green lights were visible.  Its interior was no longer visible. It was very difficult to see the structure behind the lights.  It hovered for a long minute directly in front of the windshield before it slowly passed in front of us, as we did 65mph, maintaining the same distance from our car as it did so.  ((male)), who was in the back and was just beginning to clearly view the craft hovering in front of our car began asking questions. ""Rotors? A Chinook?""  I rolled down the window. ""No, no noise, too big, way too big.…""  The light from the two fixtures on each end of the craft was shining through the window and casting the shadows of bugs from the windshield onto my hands.  It lit up the inside of the car.  As I turned my attention from myself to the craft, I felt very 'altered.'  My feeling about this is that it was a result of the adrenaline rush that had been occurring since this thing started.  My sense of time went away.  The experience took on a ‘slow motion’ quality.  As the light poured through the window onto my hands I was aware of a long, still, silent moment.  This sensation lasted until the craft began moving away. Nobody spoke as the craft began a second maneuver.  I could hear everything around me.  I was hyperaware.  The fact the craft was soundless and was displaying other unusual qualities at such a close range contributed to the ‘weirdness’ of the moment.  It left such a strong impression that even a year later it is on our minds daily.  With the window down and the object less than its own length from our car we could detect no sound.  It was absolutely silent. There was no thruster ports or jet blast, no sense of  anything at all holding it up.  It seemed to move through the air like a fish through water.  Silently.  No hum, no vibration, no sound at all.  It seemed to be very much under control and capable of very articulate maneuvers.  All we could hear was the sound of tires on the road.  Several of the cars around us slowed, we could hear the changes in tone of tires and motors.  I assume they also saw the craft.  I distinctly had the internal mental impression of ""Stop the car,"" but this is the last place in the entire state of CA that you would want to try and stop. ((male)) and ((female)) said they had the same sensation. The light fixtures themselves must have been huge, I have yet to see any night time lamp in the entire Bay Area that big.  The light itself was white to off-white in color.  Maybe similar to sodium street lights with fixtures the size of Volkswagens.   At the same time it wasn’t so bright you couldn’t look at it.  It had a very busy quality.  Almost static.  At one point I could estimate the craft spanned 8 lanes of freeway.  It was about five times as long as it was wide, I’d guess 30 to 50ft wide and perhaps 140 to 200 feet long.  It easily spanned eight lanes of freeway.  Even more bizarre was that at this point it was within a hundred yards of the Oakland Police station, no small building itself.  It held its position directly in front of us as we did 65mph.  It was now flying sideways or broadside to its original orientation about 75 to 100 feet from our windshield.  The craft then passed to my right, continuing to fly next to us in our direction of travel.  The ‘back’ end swung away from us was now it was parallel to us, keeping its same close range on our right passenger side windows.  It was now flying backwards with respect to its original orientation.  I studied it carefully through my open window.  I was alert, more so than in previous experiences.  It slowed over the Jack London Square area as we passed by it.  I looked up through the open window and watched the ‘front’ end of this thing, its red and green lights fluttering on and off without rhythm, swing over our car.  Then it passed behind us, crossing back over the freeway and returning toward the East.  As we drove away from it we could make out the very rectangular silhouette of a cylinder viewed side on.   Susan began making comparisons between the length of the craft and the width of the buildings it was passing over.  The last we saw of it was a pair of lights above the radio repeaters in the Oakland hills, boosting at about a 45degree angle upward into the overcast..  I turned back to Ian and said, ""That was ((deleted)) bizarre.""  Right in the middle of downtown Oakland in front of God and everybody.  I immediately began noting all conditions.  Time, location, etc..  I distinctly heard cars around us slowing.  Should have started noting license plates. There was a police helicopter hovering over Fruitvale avenue, in San Leandro with its spotlight on.  It was perhaps four miles South of the craft as it headed upward and Eastward.  During its approach, the craft passed directly in front of several apartment complexes and office buildings as it approached.  It passed by  the Oakland Police station at less than 50 yards.  When it left it was visible to more apartment complexes on the South side of the Oakland skyline.   Another detail concerns the appearance of the object once it had shutoff its internal lights.  While it hovered in front of our car I noticed another unusual quality. There was overcast to 4500 feet, the ambient light of the city of Oakland was reflecting off of the clouds.  I feel there should have been a visible silhouette of the object.  There was not.  Though it was obvious that the external lights of the craft were attached to the airframe, the object itself was not visible behind the lights.  This bothered me, because it seemed unnatural.  There was obviously something between the clouds and me.  I was looking right at it, but I couldn’t see it.  It is a very odd quality.  When it passed to my right, the island of Alameda was behind it.  Directly across from Jack London square is about 1/3 of a mile of open water, then a marina, then a business park.  There is very little light rising up from a very large area.  Against this background, the object itself was visible.  When it began its turn to pass behind us, the underside of the object was clearly visible.  It was only 30 to 40 feet over my head as I looked up through the open car window.  The bottom was smooth, seamless with visible lateral striations that made it look similar to an aluminum thermos bottle.   It was lit up by its own external lighting.  When I looked back at it as it crossed over the high-rises and it returned to the East, I could clearly see the out line of a cylinder over its own lights.  The flight path of this craft was amazing.  The side of the craft the people were looking out of remained facing us through the whole maneuver.  The changes in direction and orientation appeared seamless.  There was a sense of acceleration as it first approached and when it left us.  There was no sense of ‘correcting’ maneuvers to maintain exact distances while changing direction and attitude.  It approached to intersect directly in our path, then it was hovering in front of us at an even distance flying broadside to its original orientation.  At no time did it wobble nor did it veer either closer or further away.  It didn’t overshoot as it took its position in front of us.  It moved with exact precision. The actual interception and turn might be considered a ground reference maneuver whereby a pilot picks a point of reference on the ground and flies as exact a course around it as possible.  As weird as it sounds, our car seemed to be that point.  The entire experience lasted from about 7:30 to 7:37 plus or minus.  It took about 6 minutes. The interception and turning maneuver itself lasted less than two minutes with the remainder taken in the approach and exit.  The object was visible longer during its exit.  We saw it travel laterally then directly approach us. We watched its entire exit, until it lifted into the overcast.  It is my opinion that I have seen this craft, or this class of craft on three occasions.",2003-11-08T00:00:00,37.80316672771673,-122.2309960927961

The object was huge, silent and low, about 200-300 feet up and at least 70 feet accross. There was a white light at each corner of the object. I could see the shape of the object against the night sky, which was most stunning, it was a triangle. It was moving north east. I was so intently watching the object, that I did not notice that I was driving off the right side of the road. As I violently swerved back onto the exit ramp, I nearly hit a Michigan State Police suburban that was parked on the side of the road. I fully expected to be pulled over, and hoped the trooper had seen the abject also. I pulled alongside the trooper, expecting a strange look, when I noticed his dome light was on, with a brief case open on his lap, frantically searching through the papers in the case. I waited for a couple moments at the stop sign waiting to be pulled over. After I was not arrested, I excitedly got back on the highway in the opposite, in persuit of the triangular craft. I followed for about a half mile north, as the craft moved northeast and I lost sight as I went Due north. The direction the craft was heading was towards a military base in Grayling, Michigan. I am close to a local private pilot, I am quite sure the craft was headed toward restricted airspace. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-11-08T00:00:00,44.2915,-84.734

We holding together our walk to looking around the light from the top of pyramid where there is so powerful search light that beam upward very high in the sky, it a ways up high, very impressive to look the light beam. Then we walks back and so she pat my shoulder to look up the light. Suddenly, we saw three UFOs dances into the light beam, that looks like as housefly dance at any theirs house. They’re so luminous brighter and it is oval shape. she ask me what do I think of those, maybe we know what are those. Yes, that they’re from another world not like as ours.

Set tv on and get me to see the tv news, final the news got report about the UFO at the same night time what many peoples saw. More people called to make reports on the news.

Honey Moon Bay (Lake Cowichan, Vancouver Island)  A gentleman called the toll free number to file a report on seeing some bright white lights flying low over the tree tops on the mountain behind his residence. Besides reporting lights for January 4, 2004 he also told me he witnessed bright lights on January 1, 2004. He went on to explain there is no service roads, or roads of any kind up on the mountain. The witness said there also is a large canyon which cuts through the mountain side where some of these lights were being observed. The fellow ruled out any kind of vehicle due to the roughness of the terrain and again the lights were traveling over the tree line. He said there was not a sound coming from the lights, as his home is close enough to where he would have heard if the object was a helicopter or other type of aircraft. Also seeing it was after dark and traveling so very low a pilot would have been crazy to fly an aircraft at such a low altitude in hazardous conditions. The lights were not traveling at a fast clip, but moving slowly. When the man decided to run and grab his binoculars and came back out on his deck, the lights had vanished. As he thought back he thinks that there were more lights on the one bright object. At one point the light traveled down the mountain through the canyon towards his direction which was to the north. As it drew closer to the lower part of the mountain it turned to the west and of course disappeared soon after.  Two years earlier the fellow and his girlfriend saw similar lights on the mountain at approx: 10:00 p.m., but this time the lights seem to hug the mountain as they flew slowly along.

I was watching a dvd on my computer, in my first floor apartment.  My computer room has a large window through which I first saw the object.  At 17:10 I was distracted by flashing lights outside.  It was already dark, pretty much full-on night.  I glanced through the window to my right and saw what I first thought was a hellicoper making a slow progress above the trees.  The object was unusual though, because it was arrayed with a row or two of flashing white lights that were remniscent of emergency lights -- the kind that police vehicals use.  The difference being that these were white, and seemed to be all over  the ""helicoptor"".  There was no spotlight and the object made no sound.  The object had come from the northwest and was moving south.  It slowed to a stop and started going in reverse, northward.  That was when I pointed it out to my girlfriend who was sitting to my right.  It then tilted one of its points towards us and started a lazy circle, revealing a triangular shape.  At two apexes were were alternating red lights, with the flashing white lights on the bottom.  In the center of the tirangle was one slowly flashing larger red light.  I could not discern a light at the third corner, but sometimes thought I saw a bright white light flashing there as well.  It seemed that the pattern of flashing lights changed as the craft moved in different ways.  The lights often changed between white and red.  at 17:11 the craft had completed its circle and was hovering over an area about four blocks away to the southwest of my location It was about the size of a silver dollar at arms length and seemed to be hovering,  I would estimate at between 200-400 feet up.  It then performed a funny little twist.  While hovering, it rotated so that it now hovered on what I would have called it's tail.  My girlfriend and I agreed that this did not look like any kind of helicoptor we had heard of.  She said it could have been some form of super-light airplane.  I dont know how it would maintain any lift while hold still though.  We both agreed that it seemed to be stationary. It began hovering to the north and rotated so that the ""front"" point was now level and facing north.  It then picked up a lot of speed and flew out of sight.  It seemed to accellerate very fast and was out of sight within 4 seconds.  at 17:13 I picked up my camera and went outside hoping for it to reappear.  It almost immediately came back into view, flying this time from the west.  I listened carefully for any sound.  I could hear the faint sound of a proppeller plane, but it seemed very distant and faint. The object went to and hovered over the same area as before and began moving back and forth.  After a minute of this, it began to move slowly back to the north.  My camera's bateries were too low, so I could not get a pciture of it.  Some neighbors were walking up the path from the parking lot and looked at what I was trying to photograph.  It was a man a woman and a small boy (named Andy).  The man immediately commented that it looked like a UFO to him.  (But he said UMB because his english isn't that great.)  I asked if he meant UFO, and he said yes.  I told him it was probably jsut a weird plane, and they went inside.  I didn't want to look like a crazy person taking pictures of ufo's.  Soon it picked up speed at an alarming rate and was gone again within seconds.  I could still hear the distant propeller plane sound, which seemed to be coming from the south. I went inside to look for camera bateries.  I went back out to watched the sky for a while and it did not return, so I went back inside. I could not keep myself from glancing out the window every few seconds hoping to see it again.  Then at 20:09 I saw a triangular arrangement of yellowish-white lights, much farther away, moving in from the north to the south.  I was about to go outside to take a pciture, and the object disappeared before my eyes. About two hours later I decided that the most obvious explanation was that the object went into an unseen cloud.  It is possible, but it truly just winked out instantly.  This could have been some type of silent helicopter festooned with about a dozen flashing lights and having really awesome manuverability.  I will email you a map of my area showing the path that the object seemed to be going in, with my location marked on it.  I'll also send you some photos of my view, with overlaid drawings of what I saw (as soon as I can get my camera working).",2004-01-17T00:00:00,47.7543,-122.1635

I looked at them briefly and assumed they were weather balloons and turned away.  A split second later my friend screamed at me and said   ""oh my god, one of them just exploded"", to which I turned back and saw that the second cigar shaped object hovering at the lower altitude had turned bright red and began to fall from the sky towards the mountain range.  About half way through the fall object number two disappeared.  After that I saw object number 1 which was also white/gray in color turn a bright red and lower itself in altitude so it was only slightly hovering over the mountain range.  At this point I determined this was neither an airplane or a weather balloon. By this time we were back in the car driving east on the I40.  I then saw object number one fly lateral with the mountain range across an incredible amount of distance at an amazing speed.  I estimate that it moved across 75 degrees of mountain range in roughly 5-10 seconds.  The cigar shaped object appeared to be approximately 1/10-1/20 the diameter of the moon.  It then disappeared when it hit the end of the mountain range and we were all in shock in the car.  We then drove for about 5 more minutes when we looked back at the end of mountain range and saw 6 bright red cigar shaped objects appear in a circular fashion for about 3-5 seconds and then disappear.

Okay, my need for knowledge has outweighed my better judgement to keep my mouth shut. I am desperately seeking a logical explanation for what my husband and I saw, so I am trying all avenues. My husband and I were sitting on the lanai around 7:00pm Hawaiian time on Monday, January 5, 2004. On our visits to Maui we spend a good amount of time out there watching whales, sunrises, sunsets, stars, planes etc. It was our last hour before we had to go to the airport for our trip back to the East Coast of the US. The sun had been down for a good amount of time and venus shone very brightly. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright light that I initially assumed was a plane....but it was glowing bright orange. I am horrified of flying, so I thought that maybe the plane was on fire or had exploded, but we hadn't heard any noise. I pointed it out to my husband whose reaction was ""that's not right.""  We continued to watch it for about ten minutes, I even had time to go into the condo, unpack my camera, change lenses, come back out and take a couple pictures. Unfortunately, I had had my camera set for a long exposure, so the pictures aren't any good....convenient, I know. So anyway, it continued a path directly in front of our condo, it didn't seem to be at a very high altitude. Here is why I am having trouble finding a logical explanation:  It travelled very slowly, it was a constant glowing orange color in an orb shape, it maintained altitude and eventually made a slight ascent, and it made absolutely no noise. I cannot wrap my brain around it. It could not have been something on fire like a plane or something burning up upon reentering the atmosphere because wouldn't that have moved in a downward motion, moved faster, had a comet-like tail, had debris breaking off, changed in color or made some type of noise? I also do not believe that it could have been wind shear and sun reflection. The sun had been down for too long, the object was not that high in the sky, there was no slight variations in ! color li ke a reflection, and the angle of the reflection would be impossible. Any other expanation, I would welcome with open arms!",2004-01-17T00:00:00,,

Myself and two friends were driving back home to pheonix after a short trip to las vegas. We were stopping for gas when the driver of the car commented on ""the really bright stars"" that had appeared about 45 min before the sun was ready to set. The objects seemed to be moving... so, stuck in the back seat of a civic in the middle of the desert, I had little else to pay attention to. Within minutes, one of the objects (which was first a bright light, then a cigar shape) turned red very suddenly, and it appeared to have exploded. Excited, I yelled to my friend (who had first dismissed the objects as weather balloons), who then, nervouse, watched intently with me as the first object began to fall, while the second object, still white light untill this point, turned a bright red and appeard to hover about the mountain range adjacent to interstate 40 south bound. The object started to do several other bizarre things, like break out into a lateral acceleration that must have covered 50 miles within seconds, stop, turn colors, lift into the sky and return to it's low altitude, go in reverse immidiatly with rapid speed, then rocket off again. After reaching the near-end of the mountain range, the view opened up, after which we were all shocked to see the object we had observed ""meet up"" with 5-6 more just like it, but each one was a varying intensity of red light (kind of how closer stars are brighter vs. farther stars at night time).All of these objects demonstrated thier agility and handling just as the first. One by one, the objects were either dissappearing behind trees/hills/poles or literally vanishing into thin air. We saw several other objects that were clearly airplanes and helicopters during the rest of our drive that evening, but absolutly nothing like the red lights on the mountains. We attempted to take photographs of these objects with a Kodak Max disposable camera, but the lights did not appear through the view finder of the camera when we were making the snapshots.

In fact we watched several commercial liners and a helicopter fly in the approximate area of the sky only lower during this ""sighting"".

It looked like a white needle against the sky.  Second, it took about 15 minutes to move across the horizon.  If what I saw was an exhaust tail, the tail was big enough to indicate the plane was moving very very fast, yet it could not have been, since it took 15-20 minutes to move across the sky.  Third, unless the object was very far away, but in that case I should not have been able to see it with the naked eye unless it was huge.  Also, if they were moving that fast I should have heard some sort of sonic booming - I heard nothing.  Fourth, they were flying over mountains, and were angled down 20 degrees as if landing.  This is odd.  Fifth, there were 3-4 (at least, the first one was already in the sky when I started and the last was still in the sky when I left), which is also strange.  Sixth, the crafts were flying right underneath the sun, which could mean absolutely nothing, or could fit in to something else.

It's color was a desert sand color, the nose area appeared to be a reddish orange.I took this color to becaused by friction of this missle against the upper atmospher causing the nose to heat up.It had no wings or tail assembly, I heard no noise and saw no exhaust trail. It appeared to be 2-4 feet wide, and at least 100 feet long. It was a solid object, without visible windows, or lights of any kind.

I know what I saw, but you pointd out a valid fact, since I saw the missil against a bright blue cloudless sky, I couldn't really estimate the distance correctly, however I am quit sure of it's size. I therefore feel that this missil was in fact very close to me, in addition to that the closer it was the faster it's flight would appear to me,as it crossed my window. As far as no sound, the missil must have been subsonic when I saw it.Bradley Field, which is 35-40 miles northwest of me didn't see this missil, visually or on Radar as it was below there line of sight, Pilot's didn't see it either because it would have been obscured by ground clutter.Lastly the missil's flight path was more similar to a Cruise missil than a Ballistic missil, as it had a flat trajectory.

On the night of February 23rd (2004), while taking the dog out the backdoor, i was looking up into the sky to pass the time while waiting. While doing so i noticed an unsual set of lights high in the sky at some distance, being near a flight path normally this would be assosciated with being a plane, however the object did not move in any direction, just sort of hovered, and was far to high to be a warning light on a tower. After going back inside i called on my brother (12) to come have a look to see if he saw the same as me. The lights were still stationary. I ruled out it being a plane as it stayed in this position  for around an hour, after a while of watching i went away from the window and later went back (bout an hour and half after originally seeing it, the light were no longer there). The object consisted of a bright white light that spanned the breadth of the object, with blue and red flashing lights, the white light also appeared to flicker. The next night was Tues 24th, i normally go out drinking with all the people from work on a tues and it was around twenty past ten and i went to wait on my bus at the road behind my house to go into town to meet them. In the sky in a near position to the night before was the same light patttern, i watched for around ten minutes while waiting on my bus, again there was no directional movement of the object. After getting on the bus i couldnt see it from the bus, i mentioned it to my mates but they just laughed. This night however the object seemed bigger than before only slightly, indicating it was a bit nearer this time. Tonight (Wednesday 25th February) i was working in the next village at the Burger King, and around half ten i was taking some rubbish bags out to the skip at the rear of the shop, on my return i could see again a similar formation of lights in the sky, much clearer than before, but still at some distance, being directly under the flight path now i had to wait to check for movement, again no significant motion just hovering! , i shouted the other two workers from inside hte shop to look, both agreed there was the white light spanning the breadthe with red and blue flashing lights, but immediatley dismissed it as a plane. I told them to come back in ten minutes, and it would still be there. Sure enough ten minutes later it still was. However they just laughed at me and said ""haha how do ya think its a ufo? haha"". When bein driven home i continued to watch the lights, when home i again asked my brother (12) to come look, but also my mum and other brother (18) to come look, all agreed that it was very unusual. We al looked through a monocular (best of what was at hand) i had it focused on the light, there seemed to be a saucer like shape with white light round the rim, and red (and some blue) flashing lights. It had a hovering motion. Note that this night it was in a different part of the sky, just a slight more west than the previous nights.  > I am twenty almost twenty one, currently studyin for a BA(hons) in Graphic Communication at Napier University in Edinburgh. I do graphic design outside of University in my own time doing small jobs as i learn the techniques at University.

I didn't really see a craft, but the event was something I can't explain...and has never happened to me before.  I was smoking a cigarette outside the building I work at, a radio station with numerous antennas on the roof and a couple of large satellite dishes in the backyard.  I was halfway under the roof overhang and halfway under the morning sky, which was still dark and very cloudy.  I heard a noise on the ground that sounded similar to the crackling a dry leaf makes being dragged across the ground. It surprised me since it was very calm at that time.  After hearing the noise I looked down at the ground and noticed a strange light...similar to someone from above with a flashlight beam moving in a space about a foot in diameter.  It startled me and I backed up under the overhang and proceeded back into the building. After catching my breath I went back outside where I saw nothing.  After the sun came out I went back to the spot where I saw the light, and noticed a patch of green on the concrete in the exact same spot where the light had been. The astroturf carpet under the overhang is green, and there is moss coming from the cracks in the cement. However, after inspecting the green spot I came to the conclusion that it was neither the carpet or the moss. The shade is different, and I had never noticed it before. It is still there.  It was a very stressful experience, as I had no idea what had happened to me. And after thinking about it, I started wondering if it was an abduction that went awry as I ducked back into the building before 'they' managed to pull me in.  This was also the first time anything like this has ever happened to me.",2004-02-12T00:00:00,43.2049,-124.122

There's an advertising blimp-shaped balloon that appears to be tethered to a tower in the Kearney/Elizabeth/Jersey City area (hard to pin point exactly where it is)that's visible for many miles around because it's floating very high--about the height of a 15-story building in an area with no large structures to obstruct the view.  I first spotted it driving home with husband late one night, while traveling south on the NJ Turnpike in the area of Exit 18 and could still see it when we left at Exit 13. Had my eye on it the whole time because it really had me going. It hovers, of course, but sways and turns with the breeze giving the appearance of something shape-changing. Most odd is it's lighting, which appears to emanate from within the balloon, if that's possible, and gives off a very bright, eerie, blue/white glow. I travel that route fairly often but have never been able to spot it during the day. At night, however, when it's lit--which isn't often--it's quite startling to see.

Whilst travelling north bound along the M1 motorway in Nottinghamshire U.K. my wife enquired what the bright flashing light was high in the sky. There were three other occupants the vehicle and we all looked and saw a large bright white light flashing on and off at a slow pace. This continued evey few seconds and when the light disapeared nothing could be seen even though it was a bright sunny day. We were all amazed and confused to what it could be. the light was intense. After about one minute and in the same direction other bright flashing lights appeared as if they were communicating with each other. We all agreed there were at least four lights maybe five. We continued to travel along the motorway and opened the car windows for a better look. We noted other motorist looking at the same thing. The lights continued for about four or five minutes. Before the lights disapeared I noted one of them move to the 2 o'clock direction stretching as it did before disapearing. We are all professional type people and of reasonable intelligence, but we are all bemused by what we have seen. We are absolutely sure these lights were not aircraft but have no alternative explanation to what we saw. I felt sure that other people must have seen what we did and expected to hear something on the media, but to date I've heard nothing.",2003-12-09T00:00:00,,

I thought at first it was airplane, you know when they streak across the sky with the sun somewhere in the background lower on the horizon.  It had a fairly long trail, that's what caught my attention. It was orange and white across the full length of it.  It moved across the sky from left to right and was very bright against the soon to be setting sun. But there was still enough light out to make out all details, as the sun was full in the sky.  When I headed out onto my balcony to get a closer look rather than through my bedroom window, the thing reversed and started going from right to left.  Still not too concerned about what I saw although a little bizarre, I continued to watch it move to the left.  Suddenly the streak of what I thought was vapors, it  just suddenly disappeared within about 1.5 seconds, and it all came together as one.  That was unusually.  The vapors don't just dissipate within 1.5 seconds.  Then I saw an object in the sky again and it was rather small.  Then I thought for a moment there were two, close together.  At this moment I grabbed my cell phone and made a call to a friend to tell him what I was seeing.

Hello Brian  On November 30. Sunday at 4:45 p.m. I was watching a bright white light hovering low in the south west horizon. It was in the wrong place for Venus. A few minutes of observation and I knew it wasn't a plane or a helicopter. At about 4:50 it was slowly moving toward the west. It remained a bright white light. A few minutes later and I watched it descend into the trees on the hill directly south of Vernon airport. Through the binos I watched it disappear from sight, and the bottom of the light ""seemed"" to turn orange red as if it was shutting down.  Then just over the lake my eye caught strobing lights moving too fast for a small plane about to land.I saw an  ""orb ascend quickly""  towards (sort of) the north from the lake and in the binoculars it seemed to go right by a plane heading southwest.  The plane was low (approx. 15,000 ft) with its wing lights on.The orb had pink strobing lights but was barely visible to the naked eye.The orb reminded me of the globes that appear when Ghosts are filmed. Nebulous but there.The sky was still in its final colors of sunset, though the sun was long gone.  Wow. was I excited. take care  Thank you to the witness for the report.

About 15 miles into the trip we all see this bright light in the sky fade away, then get brighter and then disappear, with no clouds around it. Well after we drop my friend off we were on our way back when we see this strange object with pulsatinc lightsover a cow pasture and corn fields. Each light would pulse three times once at a time.. and it hovered over the car as we were driving.. going almost the same speed were. As it went over us i saw it had a humped shape on top and it was like a triangle. But it also had a light on top and lights all around it. The way it moved is the strangest however.. instead of moving in a straight line, it teeter-tottered it's way slowly across the sky, rockin back and forth like a plane woul with it's wings when it ""waves"". It looked like a worm wriggling it's way across the sky. Throughout the 25 mile ride back we saw lights in the sjy get brighter and fade over and over again... when finally as one got so bright and then it jetted across the sky faster than any plane, and within 5 seconds it had reached so far past the horizon you couldn't see it. When we arrived back to Whitmore Lake just over the lake was this saucer shaped object with red lights all around itjust hovering abover the lake. Well that was freaky enough right.. well when we pulled into the driveway.. the same craft we saw over the field was right over my house... waiting for us.. just above the trees. Shaped like a triangle with a large blue light coming from the center and pulsating white light all around it.. it wiggled it's way once again slowly very very slowly across he sky. I immediately hopped out of the car to grab the video camera but it had already disappeared when i got back outside. So determined as i was i sat for only 10 minutes outside before i saw lights begin to appear just above th horizon. I started rolling film. My mother, 2 of her frien! ds, 2 strangers and I all saw what were anywhere from 2-6 crafts at a time appear and reappear in the distance slowly moving hardly at all really.. and hover in one spot over a period of an hour. I got about a half hour of footage where you can see the lights moving from side to side and fade away and appear out of nowhere. I don't have the equipment to send the video footage over the web however. And just as I type this at 11:30 i see more lights in the same spot so maybe there will be more to this story...",2003-12-09T00:00:00,,

What's going on? My first sighting of this ufo occurred on August 24, 2003, and it has appear just about on every Saturday since. The longest and my second sighting occurred on August 31, 2003 around 23:30pm. It was a very bright red spherical ufo, that blinked, blurred, brightened, dimmed and somewhat changed color to white, and that traveled in a north easterly direction for about one hour. And you know what the strangest thing about that night. There was hardly any commercial or general aviation activity at all during the event. Not even chemtrail activity. After the event of that night, I counted four police helicopters flying around as if they were looking for something. The chapter of MUFON L.A. has a clip of news footage from KTLA of the event on their website. Check it out. In fact, they all(local news stations) have footage of the event. And of the professional-kind footage that is. My third sighting occurred during the wild fires of Southern California: October 18 2003 around 23:30pm, SATURDAY. During this sighting, the ufo appeared first as the usual bright red spherical object traveling in a north east direction when suddenly it took the shape of a chandelier. It was unbelievable. Within this wheel-like transformation, there was about a dozen small bright white star-like objects dancing or moving oddly within the glowing chandelier. I and other witnesses were in awe. There is more to this event to much to get into. I reported this back on,...I can't remember, but you must have my report, right? Duration of this event: 40 minutes. It is now December 4, 2003 and my last sighting of this habitual ufo(if I can call it that) occurred on November 29, 2003 around 19:50pm universal time. Now, during this event, the ufo appeared early in the evening, but this time it was a bright white and yellowish color spherical ufo that suddenly turned into what looked like a Christmas tree. Complete with red, green, white, blue, and gold sparkling lights. Also it appeared to be getting bigger, or growing when suddenly it just blinked out of existence. Gone in a flash.(Duration of event: 5 minutes) One weird thing I've notice during my encounters with this ufo is that when it is about to blink out, there are unusual meteor streaks or what looks like laser fire up in the stratosphere. I've notice that in all my sightings. Also, I notice on some of my sightings, the almost non-present of man-made aerial vehicles, such as airliners, or general aviation crafts, like a helicopter. My educated guess as to how high the ufo is during my sightings,...about 3,000 to 5,000 feet in the air. It is not a plane, or a high altitude jet of chemtrailer. It is definitely not Mars, or Venus, or a supernova, or any other planetary or celestial objects. It is not an astronomical anomaly period. It is not a man-made object either. The people in those areas or cities where the object appears above them have formed ufo watch groups. In fact, many people are scared now, and I've heard strange things happening within those cities. Some are calling the sightings: apparitions of the virgin mary. Please! Some bold individuals are now driving around armed with cameras, video recorders, and even armed with shotguns and handguns.

I just received a call from a local resident who was witness to an amazing sight just west of Houston on October 22, 2003 at 7:00 p.m. pst. The lady had phoned to see if anyone else in the area had made a report on the object.  The lady was on her way back home from Smithers, British Columbia which is about a 45 minute drive from Houston. She had a number of young girls with her as she was bringing them back home from a dance rehearsal which they were attending in Smithers. As she made her way up Hungry Hill, and driving slowly due to the foggy condition and just as the lady was to break out of the fog she noticed a extremely bright white object a head of them and not very high up in the sky. As they motored along the object dropped quickly from the higher altitude to just above the tree tops, still moving towards the west, or in the Smithers direction. (HBCC UFO Note: The witnesses said the white light was so low over the tree tops she thought it was going to hit).  She told me her first thought it was an airplane when it was at the higher altitude, but when it dropped so suddenly she ruled that idea out, still not knowing what it was she was observing. The lady went on to say the object/light was huge. Flat like a dinner plate with something hanging from the bottom of it, there was one single green light on the object on the bottom. She mentioned that they were maybe only a half mile away from the object at it's closet point to them. The witness also said at one point the object moved in different directions carrying these maneuvers out very rapidly.  The lady said she wanted to stop to take a good look due to her driving the car, but all the young kids in the vehicle were very frightend so she kept traveling along slowly and glancing behind her from time to time until the object/light had disappeared from her sight. There was no sound heard coming from the object, she did say they had the radio on, but it was turned off when they spotted the object and the car window rolled down.

I was driving west on Harlan Drive (commonly known as Stuckey Road) about 4 miles east of US Highway 41 in southern Vigo county.  I saw a bright light in the sky to my south at a fairly high angle of elevation.  There was little apparent motion of the light, not unusual in itself. This is about 10 miles south and a little west of Hulman Field (airport) where F16 fighters fly in and out all the time.  However the duration of event and its lack of apparent motion and the brightness of the light were triggers for my interest.  I turned south on Hutchison Street off of Harlan, still on my path home, and I saw the light was now less intense  and I stopped my car about 1/2 mile south of Harlan Drive and got out to look at this object.  At this point I could discern that there were five pale yellow lights in a symetric chevron with the point in the direction of what I perceived to be a slow movement in the direction of north by northeast. The apparent size of the object was about the size of my thumb with my arm fully extended.  There was a single white light in the center of the apparent triangle formed by the vertices of the pale yellow chevron and this light flashed on and off at a slow rate.  The center light was not a harsh white like a strobe light. Also the white light seemed very big for a what would normally be an anti-collision strobe light on an aircraft.  I watched the object over the period of a few minutes gradually go north and become obscured by a tree line to the north. It was completely dark, the sky was partly cloudy and the moon was almost obscured by clouds.  I could not determine the actual size of the object as I had no references to determine its actual altitude. If it was a small craft like a fighter, it was pretty low; if larger who knows?. I could detect no sound. This object might have  easily been some kind of conventional craft, but I have never seen any aircraft with such pale yellow running lights on the leading edge of its wings, and operating so quietly. There w! ere no red/green navigation lights. Hence this registered very strongly with me as an unusual sight.  For what its worth, I am not qualified in any way as an aviation expert; I am ex-military.  This thing did not spark anything except curiosity in me, and I tend to doubt this was any kind of ET craft. However it was flying; it was a real object; it was strange enough to be called unidentified.  So in my book, its a UFO.",2003-12-19T00:00:00,39.429084183673474,-87.3756556122449

Now looking towards the southwest the one witness observed a long, silver point of light. He said it would have been approx the size of a key at arms length. The witness thought it may have been a reflection of an airplane as that was his first thoughts, but he just took his eyes off it for a split second, and when he looked back up at it, it was gone. (He said nothing at this point to his friend)  The two men kept eating their lunch and a few seconds later the witnesses friend said, quick look over there, the friend now caught something with his eyes. When the witness turned to look at what his friend was pointing at, the object had vanished. His friend said it disappeared so quickly, and he said it just faded out into the blue sky. When the friend saw the object he said it was the size of a nickel at arms length. Both men reported seeing it coming from the west and in a few seconds it was in the east, the size of a nickel. They reported the color as being a metallic silver, and at the end of the sighting the friend said it looked just like a sphere in shape.

It struck me that it was at an extremely high altitude and perfectly steady.  Then I immediately realized that the perfect diamond shape (like a playing card) was no bird.  The object was moving along the short axis of the diamond.  The relative size was approximate to a pencil lead held at arms length.  The clarity of the outline gave me the impression that it was less than a mile altitude and under 80’ wide.   It seemed black with a reddish area in the center which was hard to determine against a bright blue, clear sky.  Being somewhat of an aviation enthusiast I realized it was no aircraft I have ever been aware of.  This was confirmed by the complete silence that would have betrayed an airplane, helicopter or model plane.  The sharp shape and completely straight steady motion ruled out any special balloon or kite, especially on such a calm day.  The rate of travel was about that of a private plane but still seemed un-airplane like in relation to the altitude.  Then it suddenly accelerated up to about double it’s original speed, much quicker than any fighter jet could change speed.  A half second later, while still clearly visible, it just disappeared or at least accelerated away faster than I could see it go.  During this seven second event, it traveled less than two hand widths at arms length through the sky.  Luckily, I was so captivated that I didn't think of reaching for the binoculars or camera or pointing it out to my girlfriend.  Had I tried, I would have missed the disappearing act.",2003-08-28T00:00:00,,

It was capable of being unseen while it traveled away and then later appeared again with the lights back on.

I walked my dog and saw it, went back to the house, left in my car to drive to the gym about eight miles away and it was still visible in the night sky.

I noticed a round red ball (basketball size) object darting around in the sky to the north of us, I mentioned this to my brother and we stood there watching this ball moving at incredible speeds not slowing down while reversing direction. when our friend walked up, we mentioned it to him. The moment that he joined us in watching this object the object stopped then moved toward us very slowly to alight upon an oak tree about 20 feet away from us. It then moved to center of bonnie mine road at about 15 feet in the air and began moving south down this road. We followed this object for about three quarters of a mile where the object alighted upon the cross arm of a light pole . upon our arrival at this pole this object lifted off and returned to the center of the road where it continued south.The object continued south for approximatley one quarter mile then turned left to cross a cow pasture. We arrived at the fence of the cow pasture and began arguing about crossing the fence to continue following this object. We were a little afraid to cross this fence to follow the object so we argued about doing so. While we argued this red glowing ball was suspended in the air aproximately 50 feet away and 20 feet in the air and absolutely quiet.We argued for about five minutes while watching this very beautiful and graceful ball in the night sky, Finally my friend decided that there was no way that I was going to cross that fence and gave up the argument. The very moment that he made that decision the odject shot straight up and out of sight in a fraction of a second. Over the years I have reviewed this encounter very carefully many times. The actions of this object would suggest to me, for example, that it had the ability to determine our thoughts. This object was at times less than 20 feet away and I was able to study it very closely. I could see into the ball of light and determined that it consisted of light. There was no craft, jus! t a ball of light. It was very similar to the ball of light filmed in Enland that appeared to be creating a crop circle. That ball of light appeared clear or whitish.

I thought I was the only one to see this but my story is similar to others.  I saw a bright ruby-red light that hovered in one area in the northern sky of Los Angeles.  It seemed to pulse slowly then more quickly and finally disappear.  I saw it twice in the same spot to the north.  I didn't see it move at all, it just hovered, then pulsed and then disappeared.  I called the satellite office of Griffith Observatory once to report it (they gave me the same story that I was looking at Mars).  I called the second time to see if anyone else had reported this, again they said no, I then asked them to log my call in case any one else called in and to keep an eye out in the northern skies.  The second time was the last I saw of this light. I'm thinking this was some sort of laser coming from the Mount Wilson area scanning the sky, maybe even conducting some tests due to the fact Mars was so close to Earth.  I don't know, it's just my theory.  The more exposure we can get on this the better chances we have of figuring out what it was. Another interesting fact I  have noticed is that most if not all sightings were from the San Gabriel valley area (I also was in that area), more specifically Monterey Park and Montebello.

I watched and waited but it did not seem to go away or come closer so curiosity took over and I looked even closer at this object to see weather it were an small single engine aircraft or helicopter. I watched as this object seemed only to move slightly up down and around in a very narrow window of area, as it began to move more noticibly, it's movement seemed to become erratic with short jerky meandering motions with a strange purposefullness about it. As I watched it I noticed it had 6 lightsin a sort of delta pattern, the lights were blinking simultaneously going from nearly white-(canary diamond white)-to beautifull orangish amber- these colors continued alternating one color change cycle per second for the duration from the time that I actually percieved  the blinking...which was actually from the very beginning. As I watched this object it began to descend a little bit and then it cycled it's lights down to orange then it slowly dimmed out within 2 seconds to a really dark cherry color and then to an allmost black amorphous shape with the still visible dark red color in the center near the bottom of the object. This phase remained for about 5 seconds then the lights turned back on again as it were and the fullest intensity of white light came from the 6 lights and it resumed it's cyclical blinking and then began to ascend diagonally south/southwest...while I was due east of it. The object then leveled off and began to move at a relatively slow pace-(considerably less than common commercial aircraft minus small single prop types)-I then noticed anoth! er same object way to the right/north of the other object and still west of me. The newly appeared object appeared suddenly as out of nowhere, or the timer turned on the lights...well this thing just was going at at least a 70 degree angle and had no difficulty gaining altitude and covered several thousand feet at a speed that  ""seemed"" to move around 1500-2000 mph at this time I ran downstairs to show the security guard but I realized that he would not have been able to see it from his perspective and then ran inside to call a friend. I came back outside to look for the first object and noticed that it was not in my field of view anymore and the second was stationary [or it seemed]very high in the sky as if it were a bright star roughly was around the same general vicinity as where I last saw it except higher. I may be mistaken as it might have been a star which seemed to shimmer like a neutron star. I did not bother to continue to watch this star to see any changes and then heard my phone ring so I went to get it. Note:The sky was very clear that night because it had rained a day earlier. I do not wear glasses or contacts and have relatively good eyesight. The entire duration of the movement of the object never once did it or they seem to bank or turn on any deviant axis from their original longitudinal /horizontal fixing...when it or they moved it was only up down or around with a very 2 dimensional quality in the sence -(to repeat )-that they only showed ""face"" or one profile continually. The brilliance of the lights made them very cleary defined that is why I can reccolect 6 lights in their pattern on theobjects #1 and #2...as in the order first described. When the #1 first dimmed out to a blackish amorphous object there were originally 6lights on the object untill it went dark then it seemed to have one dark cherry red glow about the center before resuming blink mode. I truly regret not having a video camera or at least a large pair of binoculars, this was an incredible event to me even though some! what surrealistic...the feeling that I got from viewing this/these objects was that of something intelligently controlled with the intention of being seen...with an otherworldly feel from it which gave me chills at one point while viewing it, at the same time being totally exhuberant like I had won the lottery. I am not a pilot or have ever been...I am a sky watcher -(no optics)- I do not posess any licenses or badges etc. Just a regular guy and no less credible according to my own perspective. This is not the first time I have seen strange things of this sort both here and abroad...I suppose that if you look up often enough you will see all sorts of things. I could not really get a relative idea of the distance of the objects because of the unknowable size of them...a crude guestimate would put them at 5 miles near the vicinity of harwin street @ beltway 8 southwest houston or further. I will send a keymap copy of my point of referance.  sincerely j.c. You may make a summary description for me if you wish-feel free to use this as you please and also mail this back to me as for me to have a written copy of this incident as I did not write it in the beginning or cannot remember where I put the rough draft and allthough this may sound contrived it is the truth...thank you .",2003-09-24T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

Hwy 13 makes a S-curve at this point just south of the Hwy 2 intersection.  Two sets of bright amber lights were first seen over the field just ahead.

The lights were just above and behind an abandoned filling station about 100 feet in the air.  No solid object was seen between the sets of lights even though a full moon was out on a clear night. No sounds or radio interference noticed.  While still driving very slowly attempted to take a couple of photographs of the lights using an auto flash camera.

There were some clouds which moved in front of the Moon and the planet Mars, as the clouds moved out of the way before the next batch roll by all the witnesses observed a orange colored moving around the night sky, but where the light was located was in exactly the same position Mars was. I believe when everyone lost sight of the planet due to clouds, and then seeing it again as the clouds passed by, it gave the illusion of the planet moving, or an object as reported to me. Also due to the length of time the light was seen, my conclusion after talking with the witness is that everyone was watching the planet Mars. I was also told that this sighting was the talk of one of the local coffee shops in town.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

About a week ago (say Sept 10, 2003) around 5:00 a.m., I saw the same thing in the west, southwest sky.  I woke up and let my dog out;  looking up in the sky I saw a very bright light, like a star but a bit larger, and every so often it flashed different colors - red, green blue.  At first I thought it was a plane but it did not move. Then suddenly it shifted sideways quite a distance, then moved in a straight line back to where it was.  I watched on and off for quite a while and the flashing lights continued but it did not seem to change position in the sky, though it seemed to shift around once in a while.  The irregular flashing of the different colored lights and the movement was unlike anything I have ever seen or heard of until I read the post from Courtenay.

I was at a stop light on Kitty Hawk rd. when I saw what appeared at first to be a plane flying very low about 500 ft over the top of a normal size tree. This wouldnt be that unusual since there is an Air Force Base but I have never seen planes landing or even flying that early in the morning since all the planes on the base are training planes. The object had 3 very bright white lights on it in a triangle shape. The lights turned like warning lights on emergency vehicles. I could not see the object itself because the lights were very bright and it was still dark out. I have never seen any lights like these before on any aircraft and I have been around planes for the last 6.5 years, and I have seen almost every type of plane when I was stationed at Nellis AFB. Also there was no sound coming from the object. The object was moving towards the South East very slowly. I watched the object for about 20 seconds and as I got onto 1604 South I lost it in the low clouds.

I just posted a sighting report for September 3, 2003 which came from a witness who resides in Barriere, British Columbia. A witnessed watched a extremely large craft fly quickly overhead.  Just tonight I had a telephone call from the same folks. The man's wife was outside tending the farm animals and her husband was with her. He takes his video equipment with him on many occasions as he is a sky watcher and does catch some good footage of different things. He also caught some great footage of the forest fires which were burning in the Barriere area.  Tonight on September 10, 2003 at 8:50 p.m. the couple heard a sound coming from the north, when they looked towards that area of the sky they saw a bright white light heading directly in their direction and it passed soundless over top their farm. Both stood speechless ! They looked again towards the north where they could still hear the sound coming from, which at this point was growing louder and louder as it approached their location. Seeing the fellow was so shocked to see what just went over top of them, meaning a large silent bright white light, he never thought to ""try"" to take a bit of footage. But he did say the white moved very quickly and was soon out of their line of sight due to the surrounding area. But as the sound from ""something"" else drew closer and at this point was at the edge of the farm, he started rolling video tape and was surprised to see two large military helicopters fly low over head. He said I don't know what one would call the make of the helicopters, but the two of them were really large and flying in the same direction the light was heading. The witness also told me he has good equipment for his camera and did catch the two helicopters on film. (The footage will be making it's way to me as soon as he can get a copy made up).  (HBCC UFO Note: Due to myself knowing there is a fire in that area, I asked if the aircraft the witnesses saw were anywhere near the fire. The fellow said the helicopters were not even close to the area where the fire is burning. The fire is burning way up on the Bonaparte area and the two helicopters should have been way west of these peoples farm. I also asked one of the witnesses if he knew of any helicopters flying at night due to the fire activity in the area. He said he knew of none flying at night. He did say the run of the mill helicopters are seen a lot during the daylight hours but no military helicopters have been seen in the area. He also added there are military personal in the area and many of us would have heard of this on the news. There are a good number of Canadian troops on the ground fighting these awful fires through the province. I also asked the witness how bad was the fire in the area, and he told me it wasn't bad at all. (There is a bit of important information I cannot give out as it could lead back to one of these witnesses. This bit of information is key to knowing what is flying and isn't). Something else which stuck me as odd. A shor time ago the media, along with the general public were at one location taking pictures of the forest fire. I was told the RCMP showed up and took everyone's film away from them.  I also have heard from people in the Vernon area that the military is buzzing around. Matter of fact the witnesses in Vernon, B.C. said it was if they were on some kind of alert.  I telephoned the Kamloops airport tower just after I talked with the witness, but the airport operations were closed for the night as all I got was an answering machine telling me the hours they operated in. So I will be calling them back first thing in the morning to see if I can get any information on aircraft flying in that area at the time of the sighting. I will also try the Comox military base on Vancouver Island to see if they are flying military choppers in the Barriere area.  So what we have is a bright white light/object flying low over top of the witnesses farm, followed by two military helicopters following at a distance behind the soundless light.

We saw this craft at around 10 minutes after midnight on 9/11/03 while on a break while working the night shift.  The craft appeared approximately 1/2 mile to the west.  I estimate it to be between 1500- 2000 feet in the air.  It appeared over a treeline.  Once we saw it we thought it was a new version of the stealth fighter out of Whiteman Air Force Base, Knob Knoster, MO.  If this was one, it was one bad ((object)).  When it started coming to us, we realized it was something VERY different.....we are use to seeing these stealth fighters at all times of the day/night.  We are use to the lighting, and sounds of these planes.  This was different.  First thing we noticed out of the ordinary was the lights.  This one had a HUGE ""headlight?""  It looked just like a car headlightlight beam shing in a fog.  As it got closer we saw the bottom of it.  It had 1 huge dome light on the bottom.  it had 3 much smaller lights that made an equilateral triangle.  This thing was heading straight at us.  That is when we got out of my truck.  It flew by very close to us from the NE.  By this time this thing was probably 500 feet high.  That is when we both noticed how silent it was.  Before that we were just entranced by the lighting of this thing.  But this thing was SILENT.  after it passed, we watched it fly to the south.  Once it got about 1/4 mile away, all we could see was 2 flashing lights.  At that time it looked like a typical stealth bomber.  Later that night my co-worker was taking trash out and saw another one.  He said it was silent as well, but with 1 headlight, and 3 bigger lights making up the triangle, but no dome light.  We figured it might have been a new version of the stealth, but why would a stealth bomber have all those funky lights?  My co-worker and I went to the day shift this week, and today I was telling a friend at work about this encounter, and he told me an interesting story.  He said another guy told him about a girl witnessing the same craft, but she called the sheriff.  He said there was nothing to worry about, but that they had over 100 calls about the same thing that night.  Windsor is a very, very small town, and to have 100+ people report it is just mind boggling.

It was between 17:30 and 18:00 hrs., and I had stopped to search the sky for meteorites.  Although I am not even a very amateur astronomer I do enjoy looking at the night sky through my binoculars, and I try to keep track of upcoming celestial events, such as allignments, eclipses and the recent close pass of the planet Mars.  Anyway, on this particular night I was hoping to catch sight of the tail end of the Leonids, as it had been far too overcast on the previous two nights to see anything.  Suddenly, I was aware of a large, V-shaped craft coming from the Southern sky.  I was immediately struck by the fact that, although there appeared to be no lights of any kind on it, I could see the object very clearly.  It seemed to be giving off light but there was no halo or aura visible.  As it came closer, i.e. moved overhead in a direction that was almost due North, I could see how fast it was moving, and that it wasn't a large craft at all, but rather several smaller, bronze or copper-coloured eliptical-shaped objects flying in a V-formation.  As I watched, and I had an excellent view of it for at least ten seconds, some of the crafts flying on the right hand arm of the V started to change places within the formation, while keeping the V-shape intact and maintaining a constant speed.  I couldn't believe how fast and maneuverable they appeared to be as they moved around within the V; I have seen many acrobatic air teams perform and no aircraft I have ever seen could move like these did.  These craft seemed to be flying at about the same height of a small plane like a Cessna.  We have a small airfield nearby and we are on the approach path for Pearson International in Toronto, so I am very familiar with the many ways aircraft can appear in the night sky.  I also was struck by the fact that there was absolutely no sound emanating from them as they flew overhead.  I watched the formation as i! t flew overhead and out of sight over the Northern horizon.  However, there seemed to be an unusually large number of aircraft in the area on this night, and the buzz of the small aircraft engines and the whine of the larger jets approaching from the Southwest were making rather a large din and could have drowned out any noise it was making. I probably wouldn't have reported this sighting except that I saw this exact object in the night sky almost one year ago.

I really thought it was just a jet coming towards me on some sort of route to the Austin Bergstrom International Airport.  We are in that flight path for some approaches.  I was amazed at how big and bright it was.  It was not high in the sky but over the horizon by about 2 to 3 degrees.  I lost sight of it.  I then turned north on Brodie Lane, headed to work.  As I topped the little hill before entering the valley to my work, I noticed 5 bright white lights over what appeared to be downtown Austin.  I could see the capitol building and the lights were above and to the left, making it generally to the north of my position.  Three lights were in a triangular pattern with the legs being about the width of 4 fingers held at arms length.  If you look at an equilateral triangle, the other 2 lights were in line with the bottom of the triangle and to the right (east) about a finger's width, held at arms length.  All the lights did not appear to be moving.  The 2 lights to the left were all in line with the bottom of the triangle.  I lost sight of them as I continued north.  They were rather bright and all of about the same magnitude.  I called the airport police when I got to work and they said they had not had any other reports, at least tonight.  They said they have been getting several reports all month.  They said they would pass it along to the FAA.  They told me to contact your group.

This light appeared to change in intensity quickly and irregularly.  Through binoculars and a telescope other colors such as green, red, white, blue, and purple were distinguishable.

Here are some of the photos I took.  If you zoom in about 600% you'll see the object more clearly.  I live in Redlands, California.  I'd say that the object was in a southern direction.

Under a telescope, it moved gently off of view.  So it looked like it was still moving, but very very slowly.  Under binoculars and telescope, the light appeared to be 'rectagular' or 'cylindrical'.

We turned right onto Groveville Rd., it's a nice long road, not a well lite road that takes you to Rt. 130 in Bordentown that leads you to the local bar.  half way down Groveville Rd. I noticed just little above the tree tops a very large, slow moving Object, moving across the road from left to right.  On the bottom of this object  appear to have lights on it, but real strange lights, like it was writing out a message, but it was nothing we understood ! I'm telling you Peter this Craft was moving maybe 5 miles an hour if that, and made no sound at all !  I said to Kathy, that's a UFO, she replied no way !  As it pass over to the otherside of the road, just above the tree tops, it started to move back the way it came !  It never stop, it made no turns, it just started heading back the way it came, like someone threw it in reverse without ever stopping!  nice and easy, and like I said before, No Noise ! ((female)) was so scare she screemed out loud  ""Oh No Let Get the Heck Out Of Here""  We just took off and hit the bar to pick-up ((male's)) six pack !  Now if memory serves me it was about 8:00pm when we left  ((male's)) place for the bar. It only takes 5 mins. to get to the bar !  ((female)) stayed in the Car I went inside to get the beer, From the time ((female)) said Let get out of here and arriving to the bar is no more than two mins. As I got out of the Car I looked towards the woods where this thing was going ( you can see real far from the parking lot) but didn't see a thing ! As slow it was moving I should have seen something !  Well we made it back to ((male's)) place, Boy was he HOT!!  He was very angry at us for taking so long, plus ((female)) is ((male's)) girl ! We told him that we just went to the Bar and back, to us the whole ordeal took no more than 15 mins. if that ! We also told him about the UFO we saw but, he didn't want to hear it, he swears we were gone about an hour or longer !  He took his beer and started to drink it, ((female)) and I had Tea. As we were making our tea we talked about what happen and noticed that it was around 9:45 pm .. I told ((female)) it was getting late so I'll have a quick cup and head home !!

We went outside to look at the constellations and spotted a very bright star which we thought was Venus as the last glow of the setting sun lit the horizon a bright but dark blue which made the ""star"" stand out.  As we watched, the star got brighter and bigger.  It was moving slowly towards us.  As it came closer, there was not a sound to be heard.  The shape was triangular and it was low enough we could see lights across the bottom in a V shape, red on one side and green on the other.  There were no flashing lights, all were steady and the bigh white light on the front of the V shape.  There were several other people at the laundra-mat as well as some residents across the street that witnessed the event.  We were all puzzled at what we were looking at.  The main item being that it did not make a sound but just sort of glided slowly across the sky.  It was traveling from west to east in a straight line.

The thought of it being a new military craft crossed my mind, but at that time we did not have anything 'known' that would resemble the craft.

I called it out over the radio to the desk, they said they would check it out, and then said they had just heard other reports of the same kind on police scanners and from other posts, but would get back to me. Later that shift the Armed Response Team came out to my post with the Flight Sgt. They told me that a notation would be made in the ""Blotter"" but as the official word would report, that ""I did not see anything..."" Well I let it go at that because I was a good soldier that didn't know how I might be treated if I carried it out any futher. It has always bugged me that I never said anything to anyone else other than a very few close friends. I don't remember anything else about that night until about a half hour or so before I was relieved of my post at shift change. Since that time though I have had terrible luck maintaing employment and a home to call home. I feel as though I must move every 6 monthes or so. I have moved probaly 30 times since then and had as many or more jobs as well. This isn't something I am proud of or tell many about as it seems very EXTREME. I don't know that it will help to put this statement ""Out There"" , but, I am hoping it will not Harm me. If there is anyone else who might remember anything similar to this at around that time frame or have exrerienced similar problems of mine please list it here in this forum.

To my surprize my cousin Sheree her two childern and her friend Lisa and her daughter knocked on my door. They were hysterical and said they saw a ufo, I in turn summed it up to they must have had too much to drink. They insisted that I go outside and that maybe it was still there. To my amazement it was there. From here I will discribe what I saw: It was a large clear sphere about fifteen feet in diameter and about four stories high. I remember the childern were crying with fear but all I could do was stand there with my mouth wide open starring at it. It must have remained ther for at least 20 minutes, I could see right through it and the stars behind it. It did have a thin cloud like substance on the bottom. The object made no sound and when if finnally took off it still made no sound but move extremly fast upward and over, faster and further than anything I've ever seen. I immediately went in the apartment and called called the police to report and ask if any one else had seen anything like I discribe. He said no and that was that. The next day I read that somewhere in the south a carousel shaped object was seen. Last but not least the strange thing about this whole story is my cousin and I never spoke of the incident for eight years and yet we spoke almost on a weekly basis. Eight years later when I did speak to her about it she said it was the first for her too. She also mentioned that the kids remember the clouds on the bottom of it where she had not but I had.

I was in the Navy reserve from 78 through 85. I was an AE3-Aviation Electrican's mate third class and was attached to a P3 squadren at NAS Moffett Field in Mountain View CA. I was later, after graduation, selected to attend Aviation Offer's Candate School, Pensacola FL. I was living in Pasadena at the time, and was utilizing our P3 anti submarine aircraft as an airlift to my duty station once a month from southern CA.  At the time I was a student pilot, with about 70 hours on the books and countless hundreds of hours flying ""dead head"" on board Navy aircraft and general aviation aircraft. I have been around aircraft all of my life. My father was an accomplished pilot, and at times we owned two aircraft when I was a youngster.  The sighting occured shortly after takeoff from NAS Moffett Field enroute to Yuma AZ and then over to Burbank CA where I was to disembark. I was not an official part of the flight crew on this flight but I always managed to stay bussy helping the crew, listening to radio transmissions and playing with the inertial nav equipment.  We were under condition Five, meaning we were all to be strapped in in spacific places until the skipper called condition two. I was seated on the floor,strapped to the bulkhead, facing backwards on the left side of the airplane. Next to me was the emergency over wing  exit door that had a window in it, offering a great view of anything passing behind the wing, and with almost an unlimited visibility up forward and to the rear.  We had taken off to the North and executed a long 180 degree climbing turn to the South. We were climbing through about 6,500 th 8,500 for flight level-2300. (Turboprops do best around that level.) I was curiously looking out my window, and I could see San Jose airport about 10 to 15 miles to the east. Beneith us was Santa Clara I believe, with residential, and commericial type of development. Suddenly, and I do mean suddenly I spotted ""what appeared to be"" a metallic cylinder houvering just slightly below our altitude off to our left.  Now I say houvering for a reason. As someone who flew many hours in both left and right seats, I developed this uncanny ability, as do all pilots to judge distances, proportions speeds-energy states, even direction utilizing visual skills most people never develop. It's almost like a kinsthetic ability you develop when you fly a lot. Additionally I think I should add here that my eyesight then was better than 20:20 in both eyes, and my color comprehension was off the scale, and my depth perception was flawless.  With that, here Is what I preceived. Again the cylender appeared to have no motion, only a relitive motion to us. If it was moving, it was moving very slowly. I guessed its distance from us to be less than one mile and perhaps as close as a quartes mile. Either way, it was way, way too close for confort, especially since he was not in communication with Oakland flight watch nor was he transponding-obviously.  I estimated the size of the ""craft"" to be between 20 and 40 feet high and between 7 and 13 feet in diameter, a ratio of about 3 to 1, heighth to diameter. Again, it was slightly below us, and again depending on the actual distance I am guessing he was only 100 to 300 feet lower, but not more than that.  There was no one near me, and we were under condition five so there wasn't anything I could do to get another whitness. The object dissappeared behind and below the horizontal stablizer after about 15 seconds of observation by me.  Not only was this thing matellic, but it looked like chrome, like a merror. Infact I was surprized I spotted it as it blended so well into the suroundings. From below it would be very difficult to see.  I should add that Moffett Field was located right next to Lookheeds major instalation, with satelite tracking stations and all sorts of facilities. That compound is like a small city un to itself. May be this was one of thiers, or the Russians, who knows. All I know is that I saw it and for some strange reason I haven't told very many people.  There was one very strange thing that I should report in reference to this sighting, and it is strange.  The moment I saw this thing, and once I got a fix on it, ie its size,speed distance and all of that, I got the strongest feeling from deep inside myself that ""I was not suposed to be seeing this."" It was almost like a voice in my head had stated that to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-01-22T00:00:00,,

But, the lights on this object were NOT blinking on and off.  Instead, they were pulsating in different colors of green, red, and yellow.  There were three or four solid round color patterns of green, red, and yellow that seemed to pulsate as they traveled around the craft in a circle while it flew from south to north.  It would move very slowly before speeding up and slowing again performing maneuvers unlike any aircraft I've ever seen.  We (my brother and I)  got into the car to go get completely away from the city lights, and we were able to keep track of it from the car, but lost sight of it about ten or fifteen minutes from the initial sighting.

A best guess at approximate altitude was somewhere between 800 to 1500 ft.  My mother, sister and I stepped out into the yard for a better view.  I immediately noticed the silence;our usual evening serenade of bullfrogs courting, locusts calling, etc was gone.  Our dogs were not barking; extremely eerie! As the ship inched closer to our home, I began to hear this low humming, the sound a refrigerator gives off.  It moved directly over our house, stopped, and hovered, giving us a dynamite view of its underside.  The ship itself had to be the size of several football fields.  There appeared to be a multitude of colored lights strobing its lower perimeter, with four huge lights located in this diamond-like pattern inside the perimeter. A good description would be like that of a baseball field, a blue light at first base, red at second, white? at third, and blue at home.  I distinctly remmeber one ""mega-light"", white, and if my memory serves me correctly, it lit the point of a cone-like stem protruding down from the underside's midpoint.  It was absolutely the most fantastic sight I have ever witnessed.  Though the ship appeared to hover directly overhead, it was most certainly ascending in altitude because the lights began to get smaller and smaller.  It was amazing how clear the night was, and I note this because, from my upper right, came this gray cloudy mist, which eventually intercepted with the ship.  Once the mist had cleared, the ship immediately ascended straight up, and within two seconds vanished from vision. After having the privelege of witnessing this breathtaking phenomenon, I am certain that the human race is not the only intelligent life in the universe. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I shared an upstairs bedroom with my brother Sam. To better understand the stoty I have to describe the bedroom. It was the entire 2nd floor. About 12'x24' with windows at either end lengthwise, 2 in the main ""room"" and one at the end withthe stiarcase. My brother and I were staying up late one summer night watching tv, playing video games etc. in our room. I remember that a box fan was running in the lone window near the stairs to cool the room down, so that may account for the humming noise I remember but I'm pretty sure the ufo we saw was humming. Anyway we were up late and fianally going to bed. Our beds we on either side of the double windows. As I was falling asleep I noticed colored lights outside. I got up and looked outside the open windows and saw what I thought was a helicopter hovering about 10 feet above and between our house and the next door neighbors. I woke up my brother and told him to check out this cool helicopter because we were both really into anything that flew. As we watched this thing I realized right away that it was not a chopper because there was no rotor wind and it wasn't making noise except for the humming (could've been the fan). Then I started to get a feel for the size of this thing. It looked as though it was only 10-15 feet above the house but it covered an area at least 30' in diameter maybe more. I also noticed two rings of lights on the craft. The inner circle of lights were a very dim white or yellowish color, and the outer ring had different colors that seemed to shift in sequence. The lights were very dim all over the craft. We watched it for nearly a 1min. before I noticed Chris our neighbor, looking out his window at the ufo. Right then the craft took off. Slowly at first it turned about 180 degrees and then it was gone. I've told a few of my friends about this and have been laughed at. I figured that I was nuts.

I am going on memory. My niece and I were playing the game Clue in my room when we were kids. She is 6 years younger than I. So, based on the fact that she was old enough to understand the game, and I was not out of elementary school yet, I believe it was 1978. It was also hot outside, so Iit had to be July or August. (I know we were out of school on summer vacation as well.) I entered the date 7/26 based on similar sightings listed at your site for Missouri. At the time, we were in my bedroom. I lived in a two story house. My bedroom window jetted out of the roof, and was on the side of the house. If you looked out it, you would see the top of the roof of the neighbors house. (These were steep pitched roofs...not flat.) We were playing and I looked up at my neice and said, ""your face is all red"", and she said the same thing to me. We looked around and noticed the whole room was lit in red. There was no noise, and being that the window was open and we lived in the city near the Mississippi River we were accustomed to boats, trains, and airplanes form nearby Lambert Airport. So, it was unusual that if it were a red light coming from above i would have expected a helicopter noise, because whatever it was had to be flying low enough to light up my room. in fact, if you understand where my window was, it still baffles me how that much light could light up the room from that angle without it being right out the window.  The next thing I remember is that her and I ran downstairs and I told my mother and my sister (her Mom) we saw a UFO as we ran out the front door to catch a glimpse from the porch. We saw nothing and heard nothing. My sister thought we had made it up until about 20 years later when my niece and I both recalled this story to her.  I reported this originally to MUFON to see if they had similar experiences in St. Louis during the Summer of 1978 and they referred me to this site.

It wasn't scarey it felt kinda peaceful, but then it occured to me to go get a grown up so I ran inside but by the time I'd convinced my mum to come and have a look they were gone. At the time we lived about 2 miles upwind from a chemical complex so theres no way you could ever smell anything but sulphur so I can't say if there were any accompanying smells. I've read alot of ufo stuff over the years in order to try and solve this one for myself, but so far nope. The ball wasn't the moon and the cigar thingy wasn't quite the right shape for a zepplin, the closest descriptions I've ever come across have been here so I'll share this now with more brains in the hope someone can work it out. Growing up where I have I've seen the prototype probes and delta winged aircraft, so I'm aware of some of the more peculiar objects in the sky at weird hours, but short of viewing a 5th dimensional object I can't explain this one.

We drove back roads through Sharon, Amenia Union and Amenia/ Millerton area.  At some point this object would meet us and follow and play with us as we drove to work.  The craft would parallel our car, stop when we did, cross over the top of the car stopping when we did and waiting for, it had intention.

For weeks and seemed follow/paralleled our car with intention, when we stopped at the 7/11 like store it would disappear and return.  One evening it followed us closely to the turn off to the center complex.  It hovered very close above a high tree for at least several minutes.  It crossed over the top of our car, it shot up straight and appeared to be circular with the circles or outlines changing shape as the colors changed.  It moved staright up, I think we watched it for a few more minutes before we went to work.  I remember being terrified and ((name deleted--witness #2)) assuring me it was okay, that they were friendly.  She was insistent of there friendliness as I was terrified.  We went to work and I told others at work about it.  I also called the State police and asked if there had been any reports.  It would be almost impossible to have been working the 11:00 - 7:00 shift and not seen this huge glowing object at the bottom of the road or driveway.  Many cars were pulled over and were watching.  Most recently I read a book about the Gulf Breeze Sightings, I think the craft I saw was similar to the craft and rings of lights in some of the photos noted.  I have also felt compelled in the past year or so to seek out others who may refute or confirm this incident.  There were many vehicles parked at the driveway to Wasaiic Developmental Center that evening.  I believe this incident occured! in the fall or earl spring.  We also saw this craft for miles along the back roads between Falls Village and Wasaiic. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  Ordinarily, the first possibility to be ruled out in a case like this, in which a night-time light is perceived to be ""following"" a moving vehicle, a celestial body is the first possibility that has to be ruled out.  However, in this case, if in fact the object flew over the vehicle, a celestial body seems unlikely to us.  PD))",2003-09-04T00:00:00,41.7961,-73.5604

We were initially told that a Russian submarine was detected which was making suspicious manuevers in the vicinity of Puerto Rico. We spent several weeks with divers, scientists and other experts on board, attempting to determine what was going on. I was informed that the divers had remarked that this incident was another ""Shag Harbor"". I only learned many years later after leaving the U.S. Navy, through watching programs on cable like ""Sightings"" and other programs on The Learning Channel and Discovery Channel about Shag Harbor in Nova Scotia and also that UFOs were reported to be operating in the waters off Puerto Rico. We never were told anymore about the result of this mission other than that it had been determined that a natural phenomenon of undetermined origin had been studied, that was capable of mysteriously eluding detection at will only to reappear again.

I’ve been reading over some of the reports on this site and I thought I’d take the plunge and report the UFO that I saw in the summer of 1985.  The date is not exact, it was in the summer but it could have been in 84 or 86.  Also, just to clarify, when I say UFO, I mean that as strictly an unidentified flying object because that is what I saw; I make absolutely no claim that it was military, extraterrestrial, or something else altogether.  My mother and I where driving into Belleville at night.  A few miles from the small airfield at Mountainview we saw a large metallic disc flying towards us from the direction of Belleville.  We slowed to a stop and watched it.  It came to a stop about 100 feet in front of us and hovered about 50 feet in the air.  My mom and I were both speechless and just watched it for about 2 minutes.  It was very large (maybe 30 or 40 feet in diameter) and it didn’t make a sound.  I could only hear the crickets chirping in the grass.  It didn’t have any lights around it but (this sounds goofy, I know) it had what looked like a window or a windshield of some sort.  I remember looking in it trying to see if I could see anybody.  I couldn’t.  It was like looking into a 2nd story window of a house, all I could see was the ceiling.  It wasn’t frightening at all; I remember only a profound sense of awe.  After it had hovered there for about 2 minutes it flew off in the direction of Trenton (it’s probably relevant to point out that there is a large military base located there).  Its flight was very smooth and extremely fast—it was gone in seconds.  The flight path of the thing was like a ""V,"" coming from Belleville, stopping in front of us, then flying toward Trenton.  I personally have never heard of any aircraft that can fly that pattern, that fast, stopping in mid air, and never make a single sound.  When it was gone, I looked over to my mom in the passenger seat and asked her if she had seen it too.  She said, ""Yes, but let’s never tell anybody.""  I agreed.  Years later I told my sister about it and she didn’t believe me (no surprise), so I told her to phone mom and ask her for herself.  She did and my mom said quite plainly, ""I don’t talk about that.""  Not corroborating evidence that would hold up in court but the fact that my mother didn’t deny it and at least implied that there was something to ‘not’ talk about convinced my sister.  So that’s what I saw.  I can’t prove it but I swear it’s the truth.  No little green men, no lights in the sky that would more accurately fit the description of a LEO satellite, but one very large metallic disc just hanging there in the air in front of me.  I really wish I knew exactly what it was and where it was from. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))",2003-09-04T00:00:00,44.190413207547174,-77.39515534591195

I was hunting deer from my tree stand that is about 15 feet up on a palm tree in a very remote part of the state in a place called Tiger Island on the mainland portion of Cedar Key.  I have about 49 acres of my own and after sitting completely motion less for just over 5 hours I all of a suddon started to hear a vaccum cleaner noise or a sucking air with no motor sound comming from all around me , since I couldent tell the direction of the sound I remained motionless.  After about 4 or 5 minutes I noticed the noise was above me along with the sky getting darker as thou something was above my head,  I looked up and changed direction in my seat to get a better look at what looked like a flying delta shapped wing which was only about 50 feet above me.  I was able to view it in great detail before it just shot off in a fraction of a second.  The ""V"" shapped wing looked much like a modern B2 bomber except it was only flying about 2 miles per hour and had no engine sound.  The nose was missing or it was concave at the front portion with what looked like air ""vaperizeing"" all around the front of it and ""falling"" into the front of it.  The size was probabaly 200 feet across and 50 feet long, and was blackish blue in color.  It was about 5 pm and I noticed no lights although I could hear over the sucking noise a ""tinkling"" sound coming from the rear wing portion.  This sound was accompanied my an electrical or a shiny foil which seemed to be some sort of a discharge all along the rear of the wing, in other words it looked like sparkling foil?  It's hard to put into words since there is nothing to really compare it to.  I noticed no landing gear doors and no panels or rivets. I did see a few non typical panels whitch were outlined by darker lines.  It seemed to detect my movement when I shifted and I also pointed my rifle at it becasue I panicked in thinking it was not going to continue to move on. When I did so it just shot off without leaving any trail or sound, in fact it was far away -so fas! t the noise of the ""vacuum"" was sudenly gone. I have never seen a UFO in my life except for this occasion and the very next night 125 miles back home in St. Petersburg Fl.  My wife and I were both sleeping next to the bedroom window which was open when we were both awakened at exactly 4:20 am by an electrical ""humming"" sound,  we both got up and sat on out knees in bed and looked out the window and saw a large orange reddish sphere that looked like a miniture sun that was not very bright sitting on the grass just out side our home.  It was about 8 to 10 feet across and about 10 feet from the window.  As we looked at it it began to lift up and very slowly fly up and further away until it was gone from sight.  This sighting was about 10 to 12 minutes baybe much longer I dident time it.  It rose only about 2 feet every 20 feet it drifted away til it drifted over our street and a busy 12 lane street and disappeared about a mile away.  My wife now my ""x"" wife turned to me and said ""What the He&% did you bring back with you from the property?!!""  This was her exact words. I was in my mid twentys back then. I never offically reported this since no matter where I looked, phone book, information etc..  I couldent find any place to listen or take the info, and back then I wasent on the net. Last night we saw the same lights from Cedar Key the lady in L.A filmed on 8-31-03 , and also got them on video tape, possibly the same ones since her footage on CNN looked pretty much like ours did. From what I could tell, and since we were able to see them also I think what ever that was, was going on in space.  The thing that haunts me after all those years about my tree stand sighting is the fact that I remeber clearing my mind and foucusing on a single leaf on the ground and starring at it for over 5 hours before I heard the ""sucking ""sound coming.  The strange thing about this is I have never sat in a deer stand for more then 3 hours since then or before that instance. I remember never moving or blinking!  I sometimes ponder if what I experienced was missing time and the last part of a sighting-  the craft departing the scene and I awakening and seeing it leave when I was supose to be out for another few minutes?!

A few second later I saw 3 other lights lined up with the first light, the second light had the same colour as the first one, the 2 others were green / blue. The first light did not move and the other 3 formed a triangle around the first light which was exactly at the middle. I found that very strange because the objects were exactly over my head and after they formed the triangle, they did not move at all during a couple of minutes. I decided to take a picture, so I ran into the house. I met my girlfriend in the stairs and told her what I saw, but she did not pay attention. I took my camera and ran on the balcony, the triangle had disappeared, but one of the orange / red light was still there.

On the picture I took, we can only see a very small point in the middle of the sky. I was quite disappointed. I was very surprised to read similar UFO reports on this site.

I am a Native Floridian. November 17th 1997, I was watching the Leonids meteor shower on Caldesi Island near Clearwater Beach. When I saw 2 glowing, amber-colored lights to the west out over the Gulf. I pointed them out to my friends but they all just dismissed them as being planes. Until one craft started to get closer. One stayed behind, and the other started approaching the shore, where I was standing. It seemed to just glide right to me. I was so excited that I said to my friends, ""this is definitely a UFO"". After I had said this they all took notice and became very scared. It did not take long for the four of them to take off running towards the pier. The craft was about 500 ft offshore when it sent down some kind of light beam that lit up a boat that was anchored right in front of me.But the light only lit in a cylinder and no light anywhere but the tube of light! I was not the least bit worried for some reason. Once the light beam went off, the entire craft was no longer lit the orange-reddish glow that it was before. It looked as if it was reflecting it's surroundings. I could see the water and the sky's reflection on the craft. It hovered above me and I remember feeling as if I was reporting to headquarters, so to speak. My head was tilted back all the way I was looking up at this object telling whoever everything about myself. I have no idea why I was doing this. I was mesmerized. Then I felt like I was given a telepathic message or picture of them. It was 2 beings that were facing each other. They were very tall and dark. My memory of this picture is not very clear. I know I thought they seemed to be some kind of reptilian creature. I really can't say for sure if they were dark green or black, if they had scales or what. But I do know they had just introduced themselves to me. This introduction must have taken some time. My friends had already reached the pier which was very far from where I was. It was about a half an hour to walk that distance. After the encounter ended the craft just headed over the neighborhood, with no sound at all, it was lurking over certain houses, and I decided I needed to follow it. I ran back to where my friends were. Clearwater Police Officers were at the pier, they had also seen this object. They were all discussing what it could be when I showed up. I convinced a friend to come with me, and we followed this thing from Clearwater all the way to Tampa. It was so bizarre. When we were leaving the beach, watching this thing in the sky, was very eerie. It was as if time had stopped for me, like everything changed. My whole world had changed forever. There was not a cloud in the sky and we both followed it to the Courtney Campbell Causeway. Once we were side by side, it started to created a cloud or fog around it, so it became impossible to see it. After about 10 minutes the entire sky was just fog. So we ended the chase. Even though I still wanted to try to find it. I have had several more encounters with EBE crafts. Two years ago I went to Sedona, Arizona and I saw many in the sky at night. These were blue-ish lights that zipped around really fast, but went right back to where they initially were. I saw them every night for 2 weeks while I was there. Also in Gulf Breeze and Panama City I have seen interesting lights that hover around like bugs, buzzing back and forth. I go to Gulf Breeze every so often to watch them, but I would rather be with a group! Than to just be by myself... I do not want to be afraid of these things. But I really would really like to know what they are. Most people do not want to talk about this type of thing with me. They will either think you are crazy for talking about it, or they just don't believe you. So I hope to know more as to what they are and why they are here, and what they want. If I can find some sort of group or research team in this area it would be wonderful. Could you tell me what web sites if any, or meetings, when and where, that would be great!  Thanks so much for your time, ((name deleted))",2003-09-04T00:00:00,28.0316,-82.8214

I live in Queensland in Australia, in the small town of Gympie. Myself and a friend were travelling to my fathers house to pick up an old car. It was a fine day with some broken cloud. It was about 8am.I am a electrical tradesman and therefore consider myself a fairly well educated person. My neighbour who was with me has his own business and is also well educated. We both had open minds to the possibilty of UFO'S. As we drove to Melaney, there was a substantial break in the clouds as we came over a ridge. To the east of us and at about 1 oclock in the sky, we clearly saw three blue triangles in close formation. We stopped and they appeared to remain in that formation for a short time. There was no noise assosiated with the objects. They stayed in that spot until we lost sight due to cloud cover. I lived for many years near a large Airforce Base and in that time saw many and varied aircraft. I also worked on the base at various times. I have never seen any aircraft that could come close to what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))",2003-09-04T00:00:00,,
Cylindrical craft sighted in London.,London (UK/England),,2002-07-22T21:30:00,cigar,5-10 mins,"Occurred : 7/22/2002 21:30  (Entered as : 07/22/2002 21:30) Reported: 10/1/2003 11:53:50 AM 11:53 Posted: 10/7/2003 Location: London (UK/England),  Shape: Cigar Duration:5-10 mins",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31976.html,"Cylindrical craft sighted in London. I was going towards Notting Hill coming from Willesden Green in a Bus, the 52 route. There was a bit of trafic so the bus would stop for a minute at least. I was looking to the sky, it was mostly clear, some sparse clouds. I noticed this ""star"" that was quite bright I was looking at it for a moment and at that moment I had the impression it moved but since the Bus moved (it was a double decker bus I was sitting on the top floor by the window), I thought that was the bus moving, so I took my eyes of for a while. The bus then stops once again and I was getting quite irritated because I was going to Victoria Station to pick up my mother who were coming from the airport via train and I was a bit late. I wanted to be there before 21:30, so in my irritation I looked up (my eyes were turned to the window of the bus) while the bus was stopped and I actually see the start moving in a random fashion and it moves towards this cloud. As I look at it a bit amazed my outmost amazement only came when I notice this cigar shaped object near a cloud. At first I didn't want to believe what I was seeing, so I thought it was maybe a zeppelin, but then the shape was too slim to be one. The bus moved a few feet but I could still see it.The bus stooped again for a while and still in disbelief I look at it and I notice this strange myst around it, with some sort of faint glow and furthermore I could see the craft slowly disappearing in front of my eyes. I wanted to tell people in the bus ""Look!!!!"", but then to tell them to look at what??? A UFO??? People would have took me for a kook.  Its shape cylindrical and quite dark. I could see a slight seam running through the middle of it. It had two blinking lights, one red and one blue at each end. In my judgement it was a fairly big craft for the height of the clouds, maybe 30m-50m (I am European living in London).  It is my second sighting of strange craft in the sky. My first one was not so amazing, it was a lopsided triangular dark craft with four static lights(red in the middle, blue, yellow, white) when I was young (about twelve). I havn't paid anymore attention to the subject since then.  Now if the these craft don't belong to any government in this planet to whom do they belong?  I have reported this before but I never seen it anywhere not even on the site I have reported it too. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-10-07T00:00:00,,

I was coming home in a friend's car from the 7-11 just up the street from my house late in the night when I first noticed the object.  From a distance it appeared stationary over my neighborhood with one extremely bright white light on each side of an equally bright flashing white light.  This was a head-on view of the object.  We continued down the street heading straight for it, still hearing no discernable noise from the object.  As we came up on it, the object was blocked out by a pine tree just a little further up on my side of the car, so we decided to stop right there in the middle of the sreet.  When the craft emerged from behind the tree in line with the car we were stunned at how low and silent it was traveling, it seemed to be just above the top of the tree making no engine noise at all.  This was when I got a full view of the craft, which appeared to be a jet-black triangle against the black sky with three brilliant solid white lights at the points and one flashing white light at the center.  As my friend and I watched the thing creep by, we tried fumbling with a disposable camera but it wasn't working.  The object seemed to have been going in a slow straight line for the entire time we had observed it.  When it passed directly in front of me I tried to get out and have a better look, but as soon as I popped the door and had a foot out, the object immediately veered to it's left and emitted a sound like nothing I've ever heard.  The only way I can describe the noise is that it was like a chilling high-pitched scream, not like a jet engine which I'm very familiar with living near military installations for my entire life, but a howling that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  After turning, the object picked up speed and passed over the top of a house in a small court on my right and was gone.  We tried catching up with the object out on the main road and back through our neighborhood, but it was as if the thing saw us looking at it and then disappeared.  I estima! te the triangle was at least fifty feet wide on it's sides, I can't really judge the thickness of the craft having seen just mostly the underside, and I'd say that it was at an altitude of no more than 100-150 feet, traveling parallel with the ground.  The object was in my plain view for about thirty seconds and observed altogether for about three minutes.  I have never seen or heard anything like it before or since.  A few weeks ago though I came accross some UFO footage and photos of the Belgium and France triangle flaps which exactly matched the head-on view and underside view and the lighting of the craft I saw.  Viewing the footage really helped put to rest the last remaining doubts I had about what I witnessed.  I credit this sighting with sparking my interest into the reality of UFO's, which I now feel can no longer be denied.",2003-10-07T00:00:00,36.837301342710994,-76.06194814578005

As was described by the writer, A small cylinder shaped object {not a drone} moving all around the military aircraft with no visible propulsion. The writer also suggests that the object was in fact being escorted by the aircraft. This certainly sounds within the realms of possibility and perhaps is accurate.  The object described by the author has shown up here on the central east coast of Australia. It wasn't until I read the report, that the memory of my sighting was brought back.  It doesn't sound very excting, but here's what happened. On the day{shown above} my 11 year old son was outside playing with the boy next door. His Mother was doing a bit of gardening at the front of her house. I was inside at the time. My son called out to me to take a look at a strange object in the sky. It was cylindrical in shape, looked to be 4 to 6 feet in length, maybe 2 feet wide, a greyish brown colour. We didn't notice any lights as it was broad daylight. The object was in totally clear view, with no clouds or shadows to impead or mistake what we were seeing. The object may have been only 100 to 150 feet up, but it's a bit hard to say for sure. The four of us stood scratching our heads as to what it might be. It moved slowly, about the speed of a hot air ballon on a realitively calm day. It's altitude did not seem to waver, nor did it's direction. East to west as if on a tightly pulled piece of string. If it were a loose bag or something, one would expect it to blow all over the place. We watched the object dissappear slowly to the west without a clue as to what it may have been. No lights. No haze, no windows, no fanfare at all. Just a very solid looking object in the sky.",2003-10-07T00:00:00,,

I saw it on Sunday 4-13-2003, as I exited a building materials store in Gresham/ Wood Village, OR. It first appeared as a black speck above the near horizon, and stuck around eight minutes or so. It had no glow, at first appearing black or blue black. Then it started rotating emitting a clear gaseous substance around it, visible during the sighting and in photos. It then changed its rotation, now producing a yellow-green substance from the three near ""bulbs"" two red and one green in the photos sent to NUFORC.  The sky condition was mottled with light and heavy dark rainclouds not too distant behind the orb, to the south.  The pictures are not enhanced except they are cropped to eliminate excess sky, reducing the photo file size.  As it flew (slowly) out of sight heading north over the store it glowed phosphorescent green-yellow-red, changing its shape to a flat slightly inclined (pitched) disk.  Total distance the orb traveled in the eight minute sighting was about 1/2 to 3/4 mile.  I would say the height above ground was about 1300 feet or 1/4 mile, and this height did not change much, if any.  The orb flew by overhead at what seemed maybe 2 mph, but was probably 6 mph after doing the math, when it wasn't hovering and rotating around end-for-end like a puppy chasing its tail. There appear to be two larger spheres (connected) from studying the pictures. Not only did it rotate end-for-end, it rotated on its own axis between the two larger spheres.  It also morphed shape and color almost continuously.  The pictures I got while the orb parked directly overhead, for a short duration, were poor due to my using the camera's digital zoom, and possibly the wrong mode setting.  The camera was new and unfamiliar to me at the time.  All photos and description as the orb was on approach, it appearing as a black speck, to its eventual departure are copied to NUFORC as they were imaged at time of the sighting.  I wish that I had used the camera's movie mode, but did not think of it at the time due to the camera being new to me.  The camera is an Olympus C730 UltraZoom with 10x optical and 3x digital zoom.  Picture quality suffers with digital zoom, aside from hand-steadying problems too.  I wish it had a lens stabilizer.  There were light aircraft flying in the area probably doing touch and go landings at the airport, but they did not try to chase or encounter the object. ((NUFORC Note:  We have received the photos, and they indicate a tiny white speck against a blue sky with broken clouds.  The photos are ambiguous, we believe.  The object probably was more visible to the eye, than it is in the copied digital photos.  We do not know what the object was.  PD))",2003-11-08T00:00:00,45.49032888888889,-122.40389111111111

As we got closer to Odessa, DE, I noticed a really bright light in the sky, over in the distance, not too far above the tree line.  At first I payed little attention becuase i thought maybe it was a C-5 doing manuevers, which isn't uncommon around here.  I just thought it had it's gear down with the landing lights on.  After I looked at it again, and realized it had barely moved, I started watching it closer, and I said to my friend, ""Damn that's a bright light"", that's when he started looking.  I still figured it was probably a C-5, but i watched it anyway.  As we came to a part of the road where it dipped down a bit, I noticed that the trees were about to come in the line of sight, and I expected to lose track of it, instead, i could see the light THROUGH the trees still.  I said ""Damn dude, I can see it through the trees, and he said something along the lines of ""Wow, that really is bright"".  As we cleared the trees, we noticed it was getting closer torward us and RT. 13, but the light was just as bright.  As it came what looked to be lined up with RT.13, it started going parallel to the road,  and if I remember right, the light was just as bright as he started to head away from us to the south.  We came up to a red light, so we stopped, both still watching it as it turned around...but not like a normal plane, not even like a AV-8 Harrier could, it did a complete about face and came back torward us northbound in the SAME flight path as it had gone south in.  I've NEVER seen any aircraft do this with the exception of a helicopter, and I'm a huge flight buff since the age of about 4, and I was in and Air Force Auxillary.  When it happened, after I could finally break my attention away from the craft, I looked at my friend to see him already staring at me in disbelief, and at the same time, we both said ""Did you see that?"".  My friend and I both could not believe what we just saw...even when the light turned green, we! still sat there and watched it, and as it got closer, it was obvious that it was going to come directly over head, so I got out. The craft had roughly about 4 to 6 BRIGHT white lights, and they were formed a triangle shape, and really resembled that of the leading eadge of a large plane.  I couldn't make out the shape of the actual craft because of the lights.  The thing that baffled me was as it got closer and closer, I heard no noise, I even told my friend to turn the car off, which he did, and even as it passed, the only sound we heard was a very low, kind of hum, NOTHING like that of an aircraft engine, prop, turbo-prop, or jet.  As I looked at it...it was really hard to judge distance, it looked like it was both big, and high above, yet at the same time, it looked small and really close to the ground.  Neither of us said anything to anyone, yet 3 days later, while I was in class in school, a friend of mine said she and a friend saw a UFO a few weeks before, and that it had really bright white lights, and it was also near RT.13, I just got goosebumps.  I was just speaking to the friend that was with me about it, and he said someone he spoke to saw the same thing, on the same night, but he's not sure who it was.",2003-11-08T00:00:00,39.4757,-75.6724

Than the race is on, I turned the wheel of the car and went as fast as the car would go. I am doing about 90 mph in a cornfield; my friend in the back seat is yelling it’s over us! So I slammed on the breaks (to avoid hitting a tree), and we watched as it slowly crept off. The whole time our windows are down and we never heard anything..

It was late June of this past summer, 2003 in the ""true"" not the ""deep"" south. I was staying in a guest bedroom of my parents home.  The home lies in the midst of 78 acres with fields surrounding it.  I was sound asleep and then suddenly, I was wide awake.  One set of the bedroom windows faces what I belive is north to north-east and the four dogs that live outside were completely silent.  There were no highway sounds (the highway is about 5 miles away as the crow flies), no night-bird sounds, no insects, nothing.  I looked out the windows and my first thought was that there was going to be a commercial jet airplane smashing into the house.  All I could see in the adjoining field (about 1 & 1/2 football field legnths away from the house) was a large rectangle ""window"" with a bright blue (neon style light - piercing - strobe level bright) and I thought it was a downed commercial jet and it was going to skid into the house. I could tell there was some massive shadow behind it, such as woudl work with a large jet body laying behind the ""pilot's window"". I could only discern in bulk and what appeared to be delta style wings behind the brilliant blue lighted window. It was so eerie as there was no sound.  The rectangle shape of light was, I supposed the pilots' front window.  But then, there was this super-intense bright little zipping ball of light that traveled so quickly my eyes could not even barely track it without ""trails"" of light refracting.  I did not know it at the time, but I had cataracts in both eyes, that may have caused the ""refraction"" of the light in the zipping ball (in comparison to the large light rectangle, in comparison to the enormity of the ""blue lighted window"" and the bulky craft behind the windown, this ball was about the size of a supersized beach ball or 100-plus pound pumpkin).  Anyhow, I watched it for what seemed like a half an hour at least, but I have no idea.  I blinked, stood up, drank some water from the bedside table, but yet it remained.  Then, I laid ba! ck in bed facing the field and the strange apparation and I just fell asleep or something.  I don't know. I was going to wake my younger sister (asleep in the adjoining first floor guest room) and have her look but I fell into sort of a trance or whatever.  Later that day, I went out to the field and could find no evidence of a burn or the weeds or crops that were left mashed down. The following weekend I watched my used copy of the movie, ""Signs"" the wonderful film by M. Night Shalalah (sp) with Mel Gibson.  I had terrifying nightmares and was extremely stressed and frightened.  That movie is frightening but I never made me so panicked before. Strange.  Thanks, that's my story.

After sitting there for a couple seconds, I couldn't see the blinking lights any more and it began moving straight and then right over my house. The lights that were facing me when it was going straight up were now on the bottom of the UFO, so I believe the UFO was rising with the nose in the air. We watched it until it was out of sight. It was heading North West. Also, my dogs were freaking out the whole time it was near.",2004-01-17T00:00:00,41.33870000000001,-72.6907

Only colors were bright white. Unearthly type speed. My mom told me before she left to eventually let my dog out of his inside cage because she new if I didnt he would have an accident in it. At approximately 6:30 PM, I put my dog on his leash and I took hime outside so that he could go to the bathroom. While he was going to the bathroom I glanced around the night sky like usual, except I noticed a bright light that looked like either an extremely bright star or a ufo. At first, I really thought it was a star so I almost didnt bother going to get my binoculars but I was intrigued by it very much, so I decided to go get them out of my room anyway. Before I took my dog inside and myself, I focused on the position of the ufo in the night sky, therefore I would know whether it moved or not when I came back. The ufo/star was above the trees in my woods and to the north. I quickly ran into my room and snatched my binoculars, as fast as I possibly could. Once I arrived again into the garage, I put on my dogs leash and we both ventured back outside to see what I thought, at that point, was a ufo/star. Once outside the door, I noticed that the ufo/star was still to the north but below the trees in my woods. It had definitely moved significantly. Then I decided it was time to look out through the binoculars at the object. I was startled by the objects appearance, it looked to me like a huge white ball in the night sky. Though I wasnt convinced it was a ufo until the object changed shape into a triangle looking object. I noticed this when I wasnt looking through my binoculars, the object went from a very bright plasma looking light, to were it looked like a strange looking dim star in the night sky. I now really realized something strange was up there. I took another peek through my binoculars and the bright ball of illuminated light was now in the form of a triangle type shape.It constantly was shifting from ball of light to the triangle type shape. Another bizarre instance with this object was that I'd be looking at it and all of a sudden you would lose it. I remember taking off my binoculars to see if it disappeared or if it moved. Sure enough the object moved so fast that while I was peering through my binoculars I didnt even notice its quick movement. The object didnt move far when it did this it just moved beyond my ability to see it do so. This object stayed to the north the whole sighting, it just was constantly in different places. After this point, I was almost positive this was a ufo. I stayed out there from approximately 6:30 to 7:28. At 7:28 PM, I went inside because the object suddenly disappeared while I was looking at it through my binoculars. It was absolutely incredible, the object was gone before I could even blink an eye, I almost dropped my binoculars, I was stunned by how fast it disappeared. The object moved faster than anything I've ever seen move on Earth. After this experience, I took another quick look out into the night sky to see if it appeared anywhere else, but it was gone. I'm totally positive this was a true ufo sighting.",2004-01-17T00:00:00,41.753,-83.6319

I pulled my car over to the side of the road, as did a bunch of other people to try to get a better look.  I rolled my window down to see if I could hear anything, but it was completely silent.  If it was a plane or helicopter, it was close enough where I would have definitely heard something.  At this point it was much lower, probably 75-100 feet off the ground.  It hovered and moved slowly and I continued to watch it for another couple minutes until it disappeared behind the tree line and I lost sight of it.  Because of the lighting on the ground, I had a bit of a difficult time trying to decipher the dimensions, but I would have to guess that it was about 20 to 25 feet in length and about 10 feet in height.

My son asked that I go outside to see ""something"". On leaving the building I saw my two other sons' and my oldest son's girlfriend looking skyward. The place we were at is near the airport and I expected to see some type of aircraft or such. Instead, as I looked up at about a 45 degree angle, I saw a group of lights, reddish yellow in color, moving east to west at what appeared to be high altitude and fairly high speed. The apparent ""flight"" path was east to west (after closer thought, more southeast to northwest), with the majority of the objects moving in random directions within the ""flow"" of the group, while others followed a more orderly flight formation of two parallel ""lines"" appearing at arms length to start at about 18 inches wide and maybe an inch separation expanding to maybe 3 feet wide and two inches deep at the end of the sighting (approximately 5- 7 minutes for myself).The random flying objects demonstrated high speed arcing turns, high speed right angle turns, circles and ""wiggling"" flight. After watching for a couple minutes or so, I grabbed a pair of 7 x 50 binoculars from my vehicle and found that I could not see any detail, just star sized lights moving. Again, the objects were reddish-yellow, perhaps no brighter than other stars and visible due to their movement.  They did not display navigation lights nor leave a contrail. As such, there were no contrails visible in this area of the sky during the time these objects were visible, however, quite a distance south near the southern visible horizon aircraft navigation lights could be clearly seen.  The area of town we were in is a commercial district near the local airport and well lighted, however stars are easily visible during the night  After watching for a few more minutes I returned inside the business and asked my fiancée to step outside on the other side of the building to see if she saw the same thing. Joining her was a co-worker of mine and three other patrons, who immediately saw the same series of objects. The general consensus was’ ""this is weird, I wonder what they are?"" My interest was much higher as I am familiar with high performance military aircraft flight characteristics. These objects definitely outperformed any aircraft that I have seen or can imagine.  After spending about two minutes viewing the objects from this vantage point the group moved back indoors as the outside temperature was around 8 °F. The sky was clear with some ice crystals visible in the glare of the street lights.  I then walked back to the location where my sons were.  We continued to watch for maybe a minute at which time an aircraft departed the airport and the objects looked as though they were forming one large, tight group. We watched the plane for a few moments and noticed that the objects were no longer visible.  I do not believe that we saw reflections, birds, ice crystals, weather balloons or conventional aircraft. My family and I have viewed satellites many times and are familiar with satellite flight characteristics. The apparent coordination of the 28+ objects astounded all observers around me.

Driving south on I-5 from Edmonds right around 175th St. I noticed a jet flying across the sky from west to east. Then I noticed what looked like the trail from another jet, except it kind of looked like two trails from a jet real close together. As I watched it more, there was no jet, and the trail wasn't getting any longer. It was completely horizontal (north to south). It was fairly high in the sky, and as I looked at it more over a period of about a minute, I swear it looked like a perfect row of small windows going down the length of it. It also seemed to have a perfect, long, cylindrical shape, with the windows going down the middle. I could tell it was cylindrical because the top and bottom kind of faded as if there was some roundness to the object. I couldn't tell how high it was in the sky, but the object looked enormous. After about two minutes of watching it, it performed a 4 second fade out from being completely visible, to disappearing completely. I've never witnessed the trail of a jet disappear that quick after being visible for that long. There is not one cloud in the sky today, completely empty blue sky except for first jet that I saw, and the other unexplainable object. There's no way I was the only person to have seen it, there was tons of cars on the freeway, and the object was in plain view as you were driving southbound. From where I was, it looked like it was hovering directly over the Northgate area, but pretty high up. First time I've seen anything like that in person.

It is a clear night with lots of stars out - this was about 10 x larger and much brighter than any star, also very colorful. It moved up and down and seemed to be spinning around very fast. Every so often it would spit out streaks of red dots down toward the ground in a tripod shape. At the same time, there were three or four others visible, one to the north, one east and one south. The one in the west slowly got smaller and smaller, then disappeared over the egde of the mountain. The others are still very clear, they look the same, except they are too far away to see any red dots. They seem to move closer, then further away, but always differentiated from the stars around them due to the fact that they are very bright, they are colorful and they have those streaks going out to the sides and downward from them, as well as they seem to move around a lot. My daughter got them on video tape. She is still out there taping them now, it's been an hour, but I'm not sure whether she got it set up in time to catch the red dots of the first one.

I know you guys are pretty open minded to have a website like this and for this story you will need to be.  I dont care if you believe me or not, it happened.  I was on my paper route in my car this early morning at 3:20, I recall the time distincly because I changed the radio to a song I liked at that time.  I was driving on Carlsbad Village Drive, and about a quarter mile to Tamarack road I experienced something.  Now it being so early there was nobody on the road except me.  I was driving about 25-30 MPH when I saw a real bright light in the sky about the size of the moon.  I was totally baffuled by what I saw and I pulled over to catch a better glimpse of it.  I am an avid listener of the coast to coast am radio program so I'm very interested in UFO's and such.  It got bigger as time passed and it looked like closer.  About 1 minute passed and all of a sudden it just disappeared.  I was very disappointed but at the same time going crazy and shouting and yelling what ((deleted)) is that????  Then after 10 seconds of dead silence the round bright object landed RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME!!  It was circular and glowed very brightly.  It was probably 25 feet tall and 100 feet from side to side.  I'm only guessing on the estimates, real rough numbers.  I was so stunned I felt like I was going to have a heart attack.  Then I heard a voice as if somebody was talking gently into my ear.  I looked around a didnt see anybody around me.  All of a sudden the craft didn't glow anymore and on the side of the craft it said ""FUTURE""  The Voice said ""nobody else can see this but you.  we are from the future.  you are the representative now of the future for this mass.  please lead or their will be dire consequences""  I remember every single ((deleted)) word it said.  It talked very slowly and clearly in perfect english.  I still couldnt see anybody but the craft and after it stopped talking i shouted ""who the hell are you????"" and EVERYTHING JUST DISAPPEARED.  After about 10 minutes of me shaking and hyperventilat! ing and me getting weak in the knee's I went back into my car and started it back up.  I then reached Tamarack Road and I looked at my clock in my car and it read 3:02.  I was so stunned.  I immediately drove home and just sat for a few hours at my kitchen table stunned and thinking what to do next.  Then i got on the internet and searched for about an hour until I've come to this site.  My heart is still at a million beats per second. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The light was similar to those I have seen in the past- We live underneath a major air corridor directly south of O'Hare and directly west of Midway airports in suburban Chicago. Southbound aircraft departing O'Hare were operating in the area at 5000-7500 feet, and westbound aircraft departing Midway were also in the area, flying over the O'Hare traffic.  The object was above both flight paths of the jets. At the time of this incident, the object flew high over an MD-80 aircraft departing O'Hare. The object had no red and green running lights, or white anti collision strobes, or landing lights normally seen on aircraft in this area. It entered my vision from above and decellerated and stopped moving, about two miles downrange of my position. Then, the object blinked out, and after a second, rapidly reappeared as a star-like object and accellerated upward at an angle similar, and resembling a curve ball thrown by a baseball pitcher, only upwards.

Saw a large triangle shaped craft moving at low speed around 5k feet, flying south-east.  I observed the craft while driving northbound on I35 at or just north of the 119th street exit.  I could make out a dark triangle shape, with a number of bright white lights in the middle and on the corners and a group of 2 or 4 at the rear.  Did not see any red/green strobes or anything that looked like normal aircraft ligthting.  It was about the size of a nickel at arms length when it was overhead.  I watched it as it came from my left and in front of me and followed it through the glass moonroof as it flew overhead.  If you drew horizontal lines across my windsheild to divide it into thirds, when I first saw it, the object would have been about on the top-most line in my field of view.  Speed remained constant and rather slow, did not do any manuevering.  While I was alone in my car when I saw it, there was plenty of traffic at the time moving in both directions so I would think lots of other people would have seen it. I'm not sure anyone else would have thought it more than a regular airplane, but whenever I see any aircraft it gets my attention and I try to at least guess what type it may be.  The non-standard arrangement of lights and the fact that it was large craft flying low on a route that I drive every day without normally seeing airplanes got my immediate attention.  It struck me right away as strange enough that I was excited to be seeing it in a ""wow, look at that!"" kind of way.  Comparing it to military aircraft I am familiar with, it was too large and wide of a triangle to be an F-117, but too narrow of a triangle to be a B-2.  I have seen both of those aircraft in flight more than once at airshows.  I also remember being suprised at not hearing any sound, while you don't normally hear airplanes when you are driving, being as large and low as the craft was I remember thinking it was odd not to hear it or feel any vibrations.  I did have my windows closed radio on a moderate volume so I cannot say for sure there was no noise. I consider myself an aviation enthusiast and able to identify most military and civilian aircraft.  When I got home I searched on the internet for something similar looking and surprisingly found some pictures that I think looks just like what I saw: http://bcornet.homestead.com/files/litbeam/main2b.htm  In comparison what I saw did not have discernable ""beams"" of light, just bright lights at both sides.  Also where there are a group of 4 lights in the picture, I could only make out what looked like 2 lights that were enlongated and one in front of the other.  They were placed similarly to the 4 lights but looked like those would if you connected them with a line parallel to the line you would get if you connected the two brightest lights on each ""wingtip""  The following is just my opinion on what I saw:  I would not consider this a ""UFO"" in the sense of space aliens in flying saucers, just something flying that I could not identify.  I would surmise this is a rather ""normal"" and unspectacular sighting as far as UFOs go, and is probably something military as clearly other people have documented the same or very similar crafts.",2004-01-31T00:00:00,38.86859124423963,-94.83400184331798

I was able to record some excellent video.  Although it would have been better with a computer automated system of tracking to soften the vibration.  As it drifted east it seem to track smoothly. Then it seemed to start back towards the moon.  As it did, the package seemed to drop something and the balloon looked like it became an elongated umbrella.  Its was transparent looking but showed a reflective white pattern.  As the package fell, it looked like it was tethered on a loosely packed string of pearls. Instead of being straight bellow the balloon, it snaked back and forth in the sky. The length must have been incredible.

While outside talking on the cell phone with my mother, I looked up at the moon, which was directly overhead, and saw a star-like object in the southern sky move westward toward the moon. It looked just like an average star, except it was moving. The object did not blink, was white in color and appeared to be very high in the atmosphere. It did not leave a trail and was moving approximately the same speed as a satellite. The object passed under the moon and was obscured by clouds moving in from the south. The sky was mostly cloudy at the time with a few breaks in between to where the moon and stars were clearly visible.  When I saw the object, I pointed in the direction I was looking (south) and said to my boyfriend and mother (on the phone), ""Look at that star moving up there, by the moon!"" I viewed the object for 3 or 4 seconds before I lost sight of it behind the clouds. I looked at the time on the cell phone and noticed it to be 6:40pm. My boyfriend did not see the object, but continued to look at the sky. My mother, who lives on the North shore of the Lake Pontchartrain (I live on the South shore), did not see the object as she was inside at the time. I then told my mother I would call her back and continued watching for the object, but did not spot it again.  We decided to stay outside a little longer and I continued to watch the sky, which was still mostly cloudy with fewer breaks in between the visible areas.  7:40pm - Spotted what appeared to be the same object again in the Southeastern part of the sky, which was clear at the time. I pointed it out to my boyfriend and said, ""There it is again!"" We both watched the object move erratically northward, then ENE until it passed out of our view of the horizon. Looked at the clock on the cell phone and it was exactly one hour later than the first sighting. Duration of second sighting was 10 to 12 seconds. When I spotted the object the second time (my boyfriend did not see this part), it moved quickly in a very erratic motion then moved northward at a steady rate, where my boyfriend was also able to pick it up. The general movement of the star-like object reminded me of an insect in flight (specifically a dragonfly), where the dragonfly would hover over a potential landing site, i.e.: stick or twig, examine the site a bit but not landing (or as if it was performing evasive maneuvers from another insect) and then flying off to find a better spot, not in a straight line but meandering.  I then called my mother again and told her what I saw. I said the object was heading in her general direction and she should go outside and see if she could spot it. I told her it was pretty cloudy on the South shore of the lake, but the North shore seemed to be in a clearing, as she did not see any clouds, nor did she see the object.  Another factor that my be relevant, but was not noticed at 6:40pm, possibly due to the cloud cover, is there was a strange halo around the moon (one quarter full) that I had never seen before.  The halo was approximately 6 1/2 to 7 feet in diameter from my perspective with the moon being 1/2 inch in diameter. I have see halos around the moon many times before, but they were always close to the moon, never this far away! My father said the halo was probably due to ice crystals in the atmosphere reflecting the light of the moon. The color of the halo was the same color as the moon and a perfect circle. I watched as clouds covered the area of the sky that the moon was located and the halo was also covered. I could only see it when there was a break in the clouds. The object, when spotted the second time, was within this halo on the Eastern side (moon was now in SW sky). I watched the object pass out of the halo and continue on as described above.  We went inside at this point since there were just too many clouds. I went back outside at 8:40pm and the halo was still around the moon, but I could only get glimpses of it through the clouds. The sky was almost completely covered in clouds at this point. I did not spot the object again.  I then went back inside and received a call from my mother. She stated that she could also see the halo around the moon, but it appeared to be purplish in color to her. She also saw 2 beams of iridescent light shining down in her general direction on the North shore of the lake, between 8:00pm and 8:40pm, she's not sure of the time as she was going in and out of the house. She described the lights as being an upside-down v, with the moon being the starting point. The lights appeared to be ""bubbling inside"" with iridescence, as stated by my mother. She thought the lights might be a trick of the eye or a reflection off of her glasses. She could not tell if the beams of light were touching the ground from her vantage point. My mother said she began to feel uneasy at this point and went back inside. I went back outside to see if I could see this as well, but the moon was not visible.  My mother calls back at 8:50pm and says, ""I'm not going out there anymore! I saw the beams of light again."" She went on to describe the lights as stated above, but felt like one of the beams was shining directly at her. She got scared and went back inside. I haven't heard from her this morning, but I assume since she didn't call me back, she didn't observe anything else unusual.",2004-03-02T00:00:00,29.96590338078292,-90.0784456405694

Description:  It was oval and had a square in the middle of it and it was very very bright it had two lines in the middle and a thick antenna on top.  Mom: At approximately 9 P.M. this evening I was seated at my computer desk when startled by a bright light zooming past my window. I immediately got up to see what was going on when the light flashed and was gone immediately, no sound no noise nothing just gone!  I remember thinking it may have been the police because the lights went past so fast, it did not seem plausible at all, but for some odd reason I did not give it any further consideration at that time until my husband was alerted by our 11 year old and our five year old that there was something strange in our back yard.

The daughter described how she and her younger sister were seated in their bedroom, when the entire room suddenly was illuminated by two bright flashes.

The object then accelerated away from them, disappearing from their view in seconds.  The mother, who was in another part of the house, was witness to the two flashes, and she saw the oval object depart, also.  An excellent report, in the opinion of NUFORC!

While taking a walk on Capitol Hill overlooking Downtown Seattle toward the waterfront on a cloudy night, we noticed a rapidly sparkling object in the sky about 23:20 hours. At first we thought it was a helicopter hovering but it was really high in the sky, too high for most helicopters and it had no FAA strobe pattern.  It was sparkling at a rapid pace changing colors all the while and it would momentarily ""dim out"" during this sparkling action.  It would change colors from a bright white to yellow, blue, bright red, and green could be seen just before it dimmed.  The colors listed are not necessarily in order of display as it sparkled but all would be regularly present.  We watched it for almost an hour hoping it would move or do something but all it did was hover in the same spot.  No starfield was visible this night and it was too close and bright to be a star but higher than most helicopters would be seen at.  No way to tell how close it was but used a streetlight pole to determine that it wasn't moving from the position it was in the sky.  The moon would move position slightly in the sky during the hour that we watched the object but the object did not move.  Finally, we were cold from standing still so long and since it was not moving or doing anything decided to go back in and stopped observing the object at aprox 00:10 hours. I must say that we saw two other objects that matched description of the main object but the two other ones were further away and disappeared from view.  Not sure if they flew away in the opposite direction to us or if they literally disappeared.  The were in a row stretching out to the west.  The one in the middle appeared to be more faint than the one on the far (west most) end.  All sparkled the same so as to appear to be the same type.  Could not tell precisely what the shape of the objects were but if we had to guess we would say it was disc shaped.  As far as duration of sighting on these other two objects, the faint one in the middle was observed only briefly and we got the sense it was further away the west most was observed for at least ten minutes.  The main one that remained was in the sky southwest toward West Seattle and more west than southwest.  If straight up was 12 O'Clock in the sky and one assigned the value of 6 O'Clock to the horizon then the persistant object is estimated to have been at about the 4:45 level.

I saw a bright light in the sky to the west at 30 degrees above the horizon which appeared to be over Sagamore Hills which is about two miles from where I was standing in Northfield, Ohio, which was way too brilliant to be a star. When obtaining binoculars, I saw that it appeared to be a sherical shape which was made up of continually changing irregular squiggly lines, looking to be white on the southern most hemisphere, and lime green on the northern hemisphere. This brilliant object was sitting still for about 20 minutes, then slowly moved westward till out of sight at about 30 mph. I took pictures with a digital camera and they revealed a small ""horseshoe shaped object"" that was moving so fast it created the image that it was a sphere, leaving tracers. I looked around the sky and saw a similar object which was blue and white and had blue lights flashing around the center of the sphere. The blue lights appeared as some light colored blue LED's moving around as a marquee would. This object was about 75 degrees above the horizon to the east and a little to the south. It hovered there for about the same time. I noticed about 6 or 8 of these object much higher in the sky, but were very similar except they were white and red looking spheres. They remained stationary as well. Around the brightest one (the one I mentioned first) I noticed several smaller red orbs (almost translucent) that weren't flashing, but consistantly transparent red. There was airline traffic in the vacinity, and could tell very distinctly that these objects did not have the same kind of std. red and white flashing lights like commercial aircraft do.They were moving around the bright object in slow horizontal straight lines north and south and at very slow inclines and descents as to be making passes around the bright sphere, both back and forth.

I was in the car and the angle of declination would have been at about 50 degrees ahead of me and at a distance of 1 mile approximately. The object was blinking white and out, moving at first what seemed to be a gliding/floating movement (like a balloon), only to continue moving linear, heading east towards the Atlantic ocean (only 5 miles east). My wife who was in the car with me, DID NOT SEE, this object, even when I pointed out a building it was over as a point of reference for spotting it. Then the object 'blipped' and took off east and I saw no more of it after that.  I was going to write this incident off as just another incident (I've seen and reported objects before), until a friend of mine, 14 miles south and one half-hour later, reported to me the SAME EXACT INCIDENT. The same with 3 witnesses present and again, the one female present COULD NOT SEE THE OBJECT. We had a laugh about only the males being able to view the object, but then, this only adds to the anomaly and the fact that it was NOT a balloon or any material object that we ALL should have been able to witness.

"Low ""hum"", white lights change to red and appear to almost merge at one point...cigar-like shape.",Solvang,CA,2004-02-06T18:36:00,cigar,5 minutes,"Occurred : 2/6/2004 18:36  (Entered as : 02/06/2004 18:36) Reported: 2/6/2004 10:23:06 PM 22:23 Posted: 2/12/2004 Location: Solvang, CA Shape: Cigar Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34899.html,"Low ""hum"", white lights change to red and appear to almost merge at one point...cigar-like shape. As I was leaving work, as I walked the approximately 150 feet to my car, I noticed in the sky several strong, white lights.  These ""lights"" passed almost directly over my head, at an approximate distance of about 500-700 feet.  It was the proximity of the ""lights"" that initially caught my eye, as airplanes do not usually fly so close.  -It should also be noted that I work in an area of our small city slightly away from the ""main"" town, and thusly it is usually relatively dark (except for some scattered facility lighting).  Also, it was a very clear night, except for some very distant (high) clouds, the night was clear and crisp.  Visability was excellent and without fog, etc.  The lights were travelling approx. north-east and, as mentioned, seemed to be brighter white than conventional aircraft---almost on a level par with aircraft landing lights.  Particularly strange to me was the fact that:  (1)  These (2) white lights were travelling one-behind-another (separated by a distance of approx. 4-fingers (held-out at arms-length).  -It struck me as too wide of a space for the lights to be on the same craft and yet too tight of a space for their to be two craft following one another.  (2)  The lights did not blink initially, but were steady and bright white.  (3)  Although I am not definitive about the exact shape of the craft, as it was a clear night and the craft passed almost overhead, I judged the shape to be a cigar or cylinder (without wings!!) by the black ""space"" that the craft made as it passed over me (i.e. lack of star light in one area).  I definately did not see any wings.  (4)  The lack of sound was unusual, as the craft passed relatively close overhead.  I did hear an almost cyclic ""hum"" though, but this was very low-pitched.  (5)  The SPEED of the craft was VERY slow.  The object almost seemed to be stationery at one point, although in retrospect I believe that it was travelling so slow away from me that it appeared at a standstill.  It was witnessed by myself for at least 5-! minutes, even as I headed home in my car I could see one of the two lights off in the distance.  -The ""leading"" light always appeared to be slightly brighter.  (6)  As I watched it overhead, it was very disconcerting because it almost felt as if it knew I was there (I know that sounds silly) because at that point the ""trailing"" light started to come towards the ""leading"" light as if if they were about to collide or merge.  My initial reaction was, ""Well, if they are airplanes or helicopters I am going to find out because they will crash!""  These two lights came within less than 1-finger apart from one another and then spread out again to their original 4-finger distance.  It was at about that time that the ""leading"" light changed to RED and sometimes would blink...sometimes (not all the time---It was an irregular pattern).  The ""trailing"" light remained white.  Notably, we do have Vandenberg AFB approx. 18-miles from this location; however, the lights appeared to travel more towards Santa Maria than Lompoc and, again, moved VERY slowly.  I did not see any other aircraft (planes, etc.) in the sky, but did (as I headed home) see in my rear-vision mirror (in the light of the full or almost-full moon)see several white contrail lines.  FYI:  I am college-educated and in the medical field.  I am very curious to see how many people report this sighting, as it lasted so long and seemed so unusual.

It's movement hesitated, almost stopping, and hovered. It appeared at times to be a bright round ball of white light with two chevrons of light of equal length on one side of the round ball of light. The side chevrons appeared on one side (180 degrees of the sphere) only. For two hours I watched in amazement as the object moved erratically, in seemingly random but tight patterns. After the first half hour of my observation I awakened my wife and she also observed the object. Gradually with random, back and forth, circular movement and up and down motion, it moved in a northwest direction further and further away - but very slowly. After 1 1/2 hours I asked my wife to awaken my daughter. My daughter also observed what we saw. At times of movement the object appeared to leave a faint trailing edge of light. The tips of the chevron at times appeared to twinkle. After two hours and five minutes of observation, now daylight, the light moving farther and farther away (higher in the sky) I lost sight - just as cloud cover moved in.",2003-12-09T00:00:00,42.74936323529412,-83.0380330882353

We observed it through his infrared scope and zoom digital camera. It appeared to be a very bright, solid object without appendages. Occasionally it showed a bluish tint, but basically was white. It was clearly not an airplane, helicopter, blimp, balloon or anything else we could think of, and it was much too bright to be Jupiter or Mars. In addition, the weather on this day and evening has been very windy, especially for LA, and yet it just hung in the sky without moving for a minimum of 20 minutes.

When I whirled around, I was startled by the appearance of six bright light whites in two apparently separate triangular groups.  Each triagular group of three lights appeared to be the size of a folded postcard held at arms' length. The lights appeared to be quite close to me in terms of distance - maybe 250 yards - and it was immediately apparent that they were moving toward me at high speed descending from an initial altitude of a couple of hundred feet.   There were only the six bright lights, quite small in size, with no structure discernable around them or between them.  The lights were not flashing, and were a constant white colour.  One other witness feels that there were some pink tinges associated with the lights.  Nevertheless the relative spacing between the lights remained absolutely constant in the 10-15 seconds that I observed them, as though they were rigidly connected.   The two triangular groups moved together, with no change in the spacing between them other than an apparent increase in size as the object(s) approached.  There was no sound either preceding or during the appearance of the lights.  At the same moment that I first saw the lights, I noticed two aircraft flying one in front of the other well behind the lights and at a higher altitude.  I believe that the aircraft were military aircraft.   We do not live near a commercial airport, but we do see military planes (A-10's; F-16's) from time to time as we border military area Y-2 in New Hampshire.  I noted the navigation lights and strobes on the two aircraft.  The planes were travelling from right to left of my field of visions, perpendicular to the apparent direction of travel of the lights which was more or less directy towards me.  The lights were not near the aircraft and it did not appear possible that the planes were the source of the light phenomenon.  The lights were much closer, at a lower altitude and moving in an entirely different direction than the planes.  The relative positions and movements of the planes and the lights, and the exact simultaneous extinguishing of the lights (see below) in my mind precludes flares as being the identification of the lights.  As the lights approached from the southwest, and after 10-15 seconds of observing them all six lights disappeared at exactly the same moment, with no change in direction, no residue, nor sound of any kind.  They simply vanished at once while in motion towards me, as though someone turned off a light switch.  The two aircraft made a wide, sweeping turn around our property and at some point about one minute later another two aircraft joined the ""pattern"" circling our property.   The planes remained circling overhead in a fairly tight turning pattern for well-over one hour (approximately 1 hour 20 minutes) at which time they flew off.  This event was witnessed by three people who agree on the details of the event.",2003-12-19T00:00:00,,

As I looked just to the right of the East bound aircraft, I noticed a huge white light traveling in a Southerly direction.  I said, “man these planes are going to collide,” I immediately yelled for my wife “come here now and quickly.”  As she came out the back door I said “what is that” she said “that is a plane”, I said “no” pointing straight up “that is a plane, with the red and blue lights on the wings” (this was the plane the object I thought was going to collide with as it was just about over the house now.)  She freaked!  I freaked and started shaking “no way, absolutely not.”  Ok, I was not disturbed by the fact of a white light traveling (reflection from the sun, etc…); I was disturbed buy the fact of its speed and its ability to stop on dime.

We saw an airplane from one mile and my son said oh, air plane. I said yes this is a Saudi Aramco air plane. They have a few of them to shuttle there staff and also helicopters using same route on a daily bases.  While we were driving, traveling 30 miles speed we saw a plane and it did not move. We came close to it, it was on our right side not far away, maybe 300 meter in the air. So we stopped to see it. I thought it is going to land or had a problem, but Safaniah is 40 km away so we came to complete stop. The plane still in the same place. I thought it was Harrier fighter plane (saw them during gulf war) but this one is white and so beautiful. The minute we stopped, I asked my son to make right turn towards it and this thing started moving north.  We both said oh it is moving now, good but moving at a high rate of speed.

First I thought that is was an aeroplane, but when it did not move for minutes at a time, I decided it must be a star. At the moment, the dusk was starting to fall and the other stars were not out;it is not uncommon to see the north star at dusk. One thing was, the light was getting brighter with a brilliant white glow. I called my father to let him know about it in Roanoke; he confirmed what I was seeing. When I arrived at my house in Roanoke, I pulled out the binoculars and telescope. With the binoculars I could see a round light with a spiderweb like texture (i.e. Binoculars may cause distortion from the distance and brightness). I noticed that there was an unusual amount of aeroplane activity in the sky and around the object. I pulled out the telescope and positioned it to the ball of light. Each time I went to look through the telescope the light moved downward like it was landing. I pulled up my telescope from the back yard to the front to gain a better view and by the time I made it to the front yard, which took about 30 seconds, the light was gone.  I had my scanner on and heard usual police activity in the area, but some messages confused me that come over the air; Some of which were morse code, and someone said ""Turn down the lights and the talking so we dont spook the horses"", that meaning I have no idea.  I drove to the Roanoke Regional Airport and found no activity of Military presense, and I called the security office at the airport, which they acted as if they did not know what was going on.  Roanoke has been a hotbed of activity in the last several months with military presense, mostly the Army and Air Force doing practice runs and drills here. There have been a few UFO incidents in the sky with tractor trailer shape aircraft shooting fine mist and floating long distances on that single shot.",2003-12-19T00:00:00,37.275004150943396,-79.97072547169812

The only thing we could come up with was that it was a group of spotlights, though not once did we see a shaft of light from the ground, nor did it seem to be striking the underside of the clouds. Instead, it seemed to be coming from behind the clouds. Every so often one or two lights would break from the circle and swing very wide. I have no idea what kind of promotional spotlights are on the market now, but I can't imagine one that could spin a cluster of lights that fast, or why someone would be trying to promote their business in this manner just moments before a huge electrical storm moved into the area. The rain began shortly thereafter and eventually obscured the lights from view, although we kept watching the storm from our porch. The storm itself was somewhat odd, but I don't want to take up space describing that here. My wife and I came outside again at about 23:00 and saw the lights again, this time almost directly above us. The storm had passed but it was still overcast above us. We watched and tried to determine a point of origin, but could not pinpoint one. Several times we noticed little clouds lighting up that must have been between the light we could see and its source, which reinforced our belief that the light source was above the clouds. We still never saw a beam of light from the ground. Also, if the light was coming from the ground, it seems like the spots of light in the cloud would have been elongated at their furthest point from the source and rounder at their closest point, especially after the whole thing moved from its point before the storm to its later point that was miles closer, meaning the the angle from the ground would have to have been much sharper, but the lights seemed to be pretty uniform throughout their rotation. At about 23:28, all the lights disappeared but one, which stopped moving and then disappeared also. I half expected to see them again tonight and discover that they were just regular spotlights being used for some sort of promotion, but there was nothing to see.",2003-08-28T00:00:00,36.03468731707317,-86.66000000000001

At 22:00 hours on the evening of March 7, 1978 my friend, Steve Glick, and I were returning from a drive-in movie back to my home at ((street deleted)) Ave. in the city of Simi Valley, CA. I was driving a 1966 Dodge Dart and pulled into my driveway, which was due North. As we got out of the car, my friend said with great emphasis ""what the (bleep) is that"". I looked up into a cloudless night sky and at an altitude of about one to two thousand feet above us, at a distance of perhaps five miles, was a transluscent orb of oval shape travelling horizontal to the ground at an extraordinary rate of speed. Within moments the orb then banked downward and then shot straight up into a cloudless night sky and accelerated to a rate beyond the realm of aviation that I was aware of and then blinked once and disappeared. The entire event took less then fifteen seconds. It was clearly not a vessel that either of us had ever seen before and, in fact, did not appear to be a vessel at all but a kind of ""angelic"" or ""celestial"" plasma. It did not hurt our eyes to look at it and seemed to operate with intelligence and trajectorical intent. The acceleration of the orb was in the realm of the miraculous and caused us both to question what we had seen, or if we had indeed experienced this at all. My friend then said to me ""We didn't see that"" and to this day has not spoken of the event at all. I, however, continue to be informed and changed by it to this day.  I would say this UFO experience was more of an ""Angelic"" witnessing rather than an aviation event. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Large glowing sphere was positioned almost directly overhead.,Kewanee,IL,1989-10-11T21:00:00,sphere,2 to 3 minutes,"Occurred : 10/11/1989 21:00  (Entered as : 10/11/1989 21:00) Reported: 10/10/2003 2:49:06 AM 02:49 Posted: 10/15/2003 Location: Kewanee, IL Shape: Sphere Duration:2 to 3 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32160.html,"On the night of 11 October 1989 I left Kewanee, Illinois and was driving home after a meeting. I was alone and driving west on IL rt 81. At a few minutes after 9:00pm I was approx 4 mi west of Kewanee on a section of rt 81 running north (near the intersection of Tower rd.) On the right (east) is hills and broken timber/pasture and on the left (west) are flat open tilled farm fields. I would have been traveling north. I suddenly noticed a red (red/orange) flashing light. At the time, I thought an emergency vehicle or deputy sheriff had suddenly come up behind me. This happened without warning and I thought the vehicle had approached me, possibly with no headlights on, or was so close I could not see the headlights.  Here, I should elaborate and mention that I had just recently purchased a new (1989) Ford F150 pickup truck and had a fiberglass ""topper"" installed that day. I was unfamiliar with the somewhat obstructed field of view and the still new vehicle. I had not been drinking or using any drugs. I do recall being somewhat fatigued after a long and busy day. I slowed and moved over to the shoulder of the road. As I came to a stop on the shoulder I was still thinking I was being pulled over for some reason. I then realized the red or red/orange light was reflecting in the space between the back window of the truck and the topper. I shut the engine off at this point thinking I had some kind of electrical problem with some lights on the new and unfamiliar truck topper. I shut the engine off and opened the driver's door at about the same moment I realized the light was also reflected on the hood of the truck.  I stepped out of the open drivers door to stand on the ground and realized that a large glowing sphere was positioned almost directly overhead. I estimated the object to be approx 50-70ft above ground and approx 20-25ft diameter. It was smooth and glassy appearing on its surface, which was most noticeable between the brighter intensity pulses. I want to emphasize that these ""pulses"" were not flashes as in on-off but were pulsations of brighter-dimmer, never shutting off completely. I also noticed a strong definite static field that increased in unison with the pulses of brighter light. I could not visualize the surface of the object when the light pulses were at peak intensity. During the less intense/dim phase of the light pulses the surface was clearly visible and totally featureless from my point of view. The surface was very smooth and glass-like transparent and within appeared a swirling, smoky or viscous liquid type substance against the inner surface. From what was visible to me, I would insist this object was a perfect globe or sphere and emitted light from its entire outside surface.  Over the next 1-2 minutes the quality and duration of the bright/dim light cycle changed to a longer bright and shorter dim but the frequency of the light cycle seemed constant- it did not pulse faster, just longer and brighter pulses with shorter dim intervals until it approached constant bright ""ON"". I hope I can make this clearly understood. I could feel the intensity of the static field intensify also. I did not move from my position next to the truck between the open door and cab. I had the feeling that something was going to happen with the changes in the light emissions and static field but did not know what to expect.  When the light pulses became  a constant ""ON"" the object very suddenly shot west with a departure so rapid that there was a vacuum ""POP"". I can only describe it as being like a huge cork violently pulled from a bottle. I was aware of no noise prior to this moment. The object stopped very suddenly in the western sky for a few seconds (3-5 miles away?) then seemed to change directions approx 90 degrees to due north for a couple miles, stopping suddenly again for only a moment then disappearing to the western horizon.  My next recollection was the realization that I was sitting in my parked truck in my back yard (approx 2 miles north of the site described) with the truck pointing west and watching the western sky where the object disappeared. This was not an area where I would typically park. I walked into the house a few minutes before 11:00pm so I was evidently in the truck for some time. It was a very pleasant evening both temperature and weather and I recall an overall feeling of ""stunned amazement"". I do not recall ever feeling fear or apprehension. I realize that some time is unaccounted for but I have attributed that to some kind of emotional shock. I have remained in excellent health.  I would like to thank the witness for his report.

I was 12 or 13-years-old, and my father was having a New Year's Eve Party at his house. One of the guests had two boy's about my age, so we were playing outside as young boys do. My father lives in a subdivision atop a hill in a culdesac surrounded by woods. As we were playing in the culdesac, we began to see strange lights at the bottom of the hill in the woods. I remeber atleast two sets of them. They were white and moved back and forth for atleast 30 to 45 minutes. The trees obstructed our line of sight, so all we could only see the glow of the lights some 200 yards away, and not what was causing them. We urged the adults to come outside and look, to which they resonded in typical adult fashion for us to go along and keep playing our little games. When we returned outside the lights were still there. Even in my pre-teens, I was quite the open minded individual. So, I dedcided we should try and communicate with them. By this point the two other boys with me were becoming quite scared, yet I was relaxed.We stood in the culdesac and I literally said, ""If there is something out there give us a sign."" Nothing happened, at first. We had been outside in the cold December night for nearly an hour, and the others really wanted to go in at this point. But I urged them to wait just a few more minutes. Once again, I said, ""If there is something out there, give us a sign."" Immediately following my second request, a bright ""star"" lit up in the apex of the sky directly above us. Though looking towards the woods, when the ""star"" appeared we all three simutaneously looked up. The ""star"" shot down from the sky, followed by a tail, and struck a wooded, rather large hill about a mile from our vantage point. It was silent- no boom when it hit- yet it cast the most brilliant display of colors I have ever seen across half of the horizon in that direction. The colors bloomed upward from where the ""star"" hit. I remember alot of green, red and orange. From the moment I asked for a sign for the second time up until the display of colors vanished was probablly only 10 to 15 seconds. But, without a doubt, the most memorable 15 seconds of my life. After this happened, even I was a little spooked. I in no way expected such an awe inspiring response. Needless to say, we all ran back inside and did not return to the culdesac again that night. I am sure someone else had to have seen this, but heard nothing. I was young, yet read the paper and watched the news for several days afterwards and found nothing about the explosion of color. About four years ago I ran into one of the boys that were with me. I mentioned to him the peculiar New year's Eve incident and he acted kind of like I was crazy. he literally forgotten- or subconciously omitted- the experience from his memory.

They were all moving north west across the sky. This was the most patterns I had ever seen at one time. In the last month both myself and my wife had seen 4 other triangular patterns always moving in the same direction, but only 1 at a time. What we saw tonight was phenomenal, and is why I am writing in. I have been watching the sky's for as long as I can remember, and before this past couple of months had only ever seen singular lights moving in the sky. I have to say this has kind of freaked me out a bit. Such an large amount, and the patterns were all so perfectly formed, with the lights never breaking formation, with the exception of the ones moving individually. I have seen many unexplained lights in the night sky but this is the most incredible. I will be trying to get some video footage from now on with no guarantees, as sometimes these lights are hard to spot with the naked eye. I hope I'm not the only one seeing these lights in Saskatchewan.  The past couple of months have been just incredible for sightings.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

Sat. Sept 13 2003 in the afternoon, between 2 or 3 pm, I was laying in my hammok in my backyard talking to my mother on the phone as I was starring into the clear blue sky.  The sky was clear, no clouds.  I was looking to the east and saw an object traveling in a  north to south direction at a constant speed, really high up.  First I thought it could be a plane but I thought it was really high and the object had no wings that I could see, it was light blue in color and it looked kind of circular I was watching it with my naked eye (realiseing I couldn't see detail), asking my mother how high planes fly at. A few minutes later, traveling in the same north to south direction as I am looking to the east, a second oject, silver in color and lower in elevation, it looked like it was traveling at the same speed as the higher blue object. I told my mother that these two objects just did not look like planes and suddenly the two objects stopped and became stationary in the sky at the elevevations they were traveling at.  I ran into my house to get my binoculars, came back out and saw they were still in the same position in the sky.  I saw with my binoculars that both objects were spheres with a glow to them.  The first light blue sphere had a slightly lighter bluish glow and the silver sphere had a white hot glow with a bit of red in it.  The silver sphere seemed to change shape alittle as it  looked like it was rotating.  The sun was reflecting off the silver object the blue sphere was really high to see any reflections from the sun.   A courious situation happened soon after the two objects had become stationary, I noticed a  red balloon that had come loose from one of the car lots by my house, it was traveling up to the position of the silver object.  It was almost like the object had seen the balloon too.  The balloon went close to the silver object and as it passed I saw that it never went higher in the sky, the silver sphere seemed to stop it from going higher.  I'm guessing now but silver! sphere seemed to grab it because the baloon was not visible any more.  I watched the two spheres for what seemed to be a good 20 to 30 minutes.  I noticed the objects seemed to getting smaller but they were still in their stationary positions.  Then I lost sight of them, but remember I said courious about the balloon?  The red balloon was comming back down towards the ground,  then I lost sight of the baloon behind some houses.  I kept looking in the sky hopeing to catch sight of the two objects again and to my surprise I saw that the blue shpere (the same one or different) was now in a more northern position in the sky, still about as high as I saw it earlier.  I saw it, then it was gone again.  I could see these object with my naked eye still.  Then as I was laying on my hammok again starring stairght up into the sky,  I saw the silver shere again straight over my position flying north to south at a lower elevation then I had seen it earlier.  I don't know if it was another sphere or the same one but it was silver with the same red white hot glow.  I could see it better the second time even with my naked eye but used my binoculars too.  I was watching the silver object for a few minutes then I lost sight of it.  I know what I saw was not planes, hellicopters, balloons, swamp gas, or any other man made object.  I even entertained ball lightning but these objects acted like they were in flight and also were stationary.  My mother is a phone witness that I was seeing the objects because I was talking to her when it all started and I almost had a second eye witness, my neighbor was in his back yard while I was watching the two objects but he couldn't see them, it was about the time they were becomming even too small for me to see.  My next door neighbor said he saw a blueish sphere across the street the week before from our houses, he said is was hovering below some power lines and caused them to spark.  I looked at the power lines and they are blackened and scortched where the sparking happened.  He thin! ks he saw ball lightning.  His discription  seems kind of like  my blue sphere but I think I was looking at more than ball lightning by the way the 2 objects acted, like something or some one was piloting them.  I live by McChord AFB and Fort Lewis  I see lots of planes every day, I did see a plane flying in the area at the time, it didn't seem to see them. I know these objects are out of this world.",2003-09-24T00:00:00,47.21257223776224,-122.4597204895105

First one we seen moved quickly across sky then faded.  We began to see another in different location and direction, dont know if it was different or same??  We seen some that would fade in and out randomly.. You could see it then you couldn't then where you'd expect it would be after continuing same path it would show up.   Within minutes of seeing all this activity of the lil dots in the sky which radiated white light,  Aircraft was popping.  So basically we didn't think it was normal for the first objects to fly that fast across sky and they didn't blink or have red light like alota air crafts are suppose to.  We also seen another that actually blinked white.  But it was very random.  It would be like blink then 10 secs later blink blink blink... No pattern what so ever.  One of the last events we can remember besides all the objects shootin around was we seen two moving that looked identical.  One stopped and the other head straight towards it then there was only one and it was moving??   So the objects moved very quickly, didn't flash like normal aircraft and if it did it was very random.  The objects would change course and path very easily.  3-5 planes were seen within 5-8 minutes of activity.  We seen what coulda been a joining of two objects, we didn't actually see em join though.

A lady called me from Airdrie today asking if anyone had contacted me over a sighting which took place on September 15, 2003 at 1:15 a.m. While the witness was on her way to Calgary and 30 kilometers north of Airdrie she saw an object at a low level and then it shot up into the sky very quickly, and came to a complete stop.  At this point in our conversation she told me she had pulled her car over to the side of the road, and so did approx: 10 other vehicles to watch this amazing event. On the drivers side of the road there were two cars and two freight liners which had pulled over. Also in her rear view mirror she could see two other cars doing the same.... and a couple more which were heading north bound.  The witness was traveling on Highway #2 going south.  When the lady first saw the object her thoughts were that it was an aircraft departing from an airport, but soon realized that in this area there was no airport. Actually the lady said the sighting would have been witnessed exactly 15 kilometers from the small town of Crossfield. and the object would have been traveling to the southwest. She thought it was odd that the object was departing at such a strange degree, keeping in mind that her first thoughts were of an aircraft. The object, when traveling up into the sky, made a sharp climb and once it arrived at a high altitude it came to a complete stop. It then shot across the sky towards the northwest and stopped again. At this point the lady pulled over to watch it. She said there was only one light on the craft which she described as being very lustrous as if one would look at a diamond. Also extremely bright ! As she and many others watched, the object moved side to side keeping at the same altitude and then it started to flash. The lady said if she had to put a shape to the object, it would have looked like a diamond.  She rolled down her window as she watched. She wanted to hear if there was any sound coming from it. The lady also had turned her vehicle off, but no sound could be heard. The witness went on to say, there was not a sound in the area at all. Not knowing the exact height the object was sitting at, she said the size of it would have been larger than a tennis ball.  She was travelling alone and became quite frightened so decided to continue on her way. She left the area.  The witness did contact the RCMP to see if others had made a report about the sighting but no one had come forwarded.  I have already contacted the Airdrie Echo newspaper in search of any information they might have received. I also will be making some calls and requesting information and help in trying to find out what this object may have been.

I was wondering where the moon was in relation to it, as I had recently observed them together and this made me start to wonder if this was Mars?

PD)) A bright yellow egg-shaped firey object suddenly appeared in the west on 11/20/03 at l7:30 hours, suddenly vanishing and leaving a smoke trail. About 5:30 p.m., mountain standard time, I was driving home from work and was about 2 1/2 miles from my home in El Rito, NM  (the one near Abiquiu) when a large bright yellow object suddenly appeared in the western sky.  Venus was setting brilliantly in the west, and this object looked like it was one inch to the left, or south, of it, if you held up a finger and squinted.  It was an egg-shaped object but definitely had some jagged protrusions, particularly on the left side, and looked to be all on fire.   It was about as big as the sun which had just set.  When the object first suddenly appeared, it was zooming toward Earth straight down and moving at the velocity of a shooting star.  But unlike a shooting star, it never zoomed across the zenith of the sky or made any horizontal movements.  Flames appeared to be shooting out from the jagged protrusion on the left, and from the top (the part pointing away from the Earth), although the whole thing looked to be on fire , and bright yellow.  As the object was zooming toward Earth, it suddenly vanished!  It did not go down behind some mountains to the west of us--it just plain vanished, leaving a wiggly crooked smoke trail behind it.  The smoke was blue-black or black, and it hung in the air for a long time.  By 5:45 p.m., I had arrived in El Rito.  It was almost dark but I could still see a glimpse of the smoke trail through the trees.  This entire incident lasted about 15 minutes.  I was travelling about 45 mph when the object first appeared and I slowed to 30 mph.  I continued to watch it for at least another couple of miles.  I didn't stop.  The most amazing thing of all is that the object suddenly vanished without hitting the Earth.  The smoke trail in the air was most definitely between us, here at El Rito and the mountains to the west of us.  El Rito is about 55 miles northwest of Santa Fe, in the mountains of Northern New Mexico, in Rio Arriba County.  That's what I saw!  That's my report.  Weirdness!  May we live in interesting times!

It was behind the trees near my driveway and at first I thought it was an airplane but the light never moved.  When I pulled into the driveway, I saw that the light had moved.  It was now lower in the sky and seemed to be maybe 2 miles to the east of my cabin.  It didn't move or flash.  Very odd place for a light to be. I had 75 acres of wetland and it adjoined state land which is also wetland for several miles, then forest.  I give this description to put into prospective that I lived at the end of dead end road with no souls living to the east of me. The light was steady and was just above the treeline several miles away. I stood in the driveway and watched it for about five minutes.  I went inside and let the dog out and then went to the window to look at the light again.  It had moved again.  It was now north a bit and when I moved my head to get a better view from a different window pane, the light disappeared from view behind an out building.  I went back out into the yard to see it again, but the light was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-01-22T00:00:00,,

My last tour was on the USNS Kane, a US Navy Research Vessel charted by NAVOCEANO and under command of the Military Sealift Command.  These ships were managed and crewed by a subsidary of Dyn Services (front company for CIA or NSA) and this subsidary of Dyn Services is Dyn Marine Services, who I was employed by.  My position was AB Unlimited, or a helmsman for the land people.  A simple search on the above mentioned corporations will reveal the obvious connection. The ships mission was submarine defense warfare related, whether it was hydrographic surveys (mapping of ocean floor), or the launching and towing of many various types of sleds, bullets, and other ""secret"" equipment.  First, the winches on board were equipped with miles of high tech optical embedded cable that was connected to the various devices, so we actually launched and retrieved to the deepest depths.  I know of several occasions while we were on ops we would have equipment in 13000 feet of water. The ship was divided in two areas of personnel, the crew, approx. 35 including deck and engine dept., and around 30 scientists who were employed by NAVO, the US Navys Oceanographic Office.  There was a big division between these two, the crew and the scientists.  Man, were they ever tight-lipped...and their labs and quarters took up 2/3 of the ship, and all the labs were secure, no entry what so ever to the crew. I served as primary crane operator, and the scientists became partial to me launching with the crane and operation of winches.   In 1995 I served 336 days aboard the Kane-The night of the sighting we were in the Indian Ocean, and were pulling this rather large sled, whatever it did--when an unusual circumstance arose.  The Senior Navo Scientist came to the bridge.  Remember the division factor...and I was on the port bridge wing, my watch partner AB was on the wheel (actually in the bridge, as we were on gyro) and the Second Mate had the watch.  When the Senior came to the bridge he was actually being social, and he came out to the port wing to converse with me.  Cool, I thought, this is unusual...and as we were speaking, I saw it. Coming up from the depths was what appeared to be a small point of light, and was quickly becoming larger as it arose from the depths. When I said ""LOOK"" and every one on the bridge was watching the Senior did a most curious thing.  He ran for the squwak box (here I have to add a note, as the scientists had their own ""conn"" or bridge, if you will, down below they were capable of steering and controlling course of the ship, however the command to turn or change course would always be relayed to us on the real bridge via this squawk box) and he said to his cohorts, and I quote his words ""Gentleman, we have INTERESTING NATURAL PHENOMENA off the port bow,"" with heavy emphasis on the words I italicized.  As he ran back out to the port wing the object, which was round and I would guess 75 feet in diameter, was at this time I estimate was about 100 feet below our ship...it was so bright- the color of a green glow stick...and I also have to add that the seas were glass, dead calm.  Seeing was easy.  At this moment...How do I put it?...the object went back down in the opposite direction it came from- at a very steep angle and whoa...it was haulin***.  With a blur... it was gone. Was it coincidental we stayed in this area for three days, going back and forth, around and around?  I am convinced of alien presence in our oceans.  For I SAW. It is my hope that maybe one day we will know the TRUTH.  Our government knows, that's for sure.  Any NAVO scientists lurking here?  Maybe we all will hear from one who is willing the speak. I would be curious of any similiar expierences.  I have seen pyro plankton, bio luminesence, glow jelly fish, etc.  What we saw was a craft of some unknown type, and not any of these natural sources stated above.",2004-01-22T00:00:00,,

July 17th, Driving south on I-5 towards L.A. at Firebaugh exit, I was traveling in right lane in my '71 bug. I was doing 65 in a 70 mph, and a line of cars was trying to pass me on a small rise, but the lead car in the passing lane was unable to overtake me (it was an older late 60's rambler) so there were three cars behind the rambler pushing it down the road trying to get passed us. As we are driving neck and neck, with the couple seemingly unable to pass me, off to the left in a field, about 60 yards beyond the fenceline, three shiny diamond shape lights doing erratic swirling motions were visible to me. I notice that the elderly couple next to me is also watching the lights. This caused a noticeable reaction in all four cars as our spped was momentarily reduced to see what was causing it, and then the speed was stepped back up. The passenger was an elderly woman with horn-rimmed spectacles, and an elderly man who I assumed was her husband was driving. I look back at the road and these 3 diamond-shaped lights are now at about 10 o'clock towards the east as we are driving south. The lights would move from a triangular formation, break away and do some fast manuevers, and then regroup. This went on for a few minutes. The next manuever placed them fifty feet off to the left of the roadside, where they regrouped and instead of the diamonds revovling as they had done previously while in formation, they now deliberately and simultaneously reflected our headlights back at us, nearly blinding us. I look to my left, and the elderly couple looks back at me as if pleading me to let them over, but I continue to hold the gas pedal to the floor and maintain my speed. I loo at the cars behind them and I can see that their interiors are lit up so brightly I can make out the drivers blue shirt and red tie in the car behind the elderly couple in the rambler. I turn back and look at the three lights and say to myself, ""who are you?"" I then had the prescience to think they may be reading mymind, so I beg! an to chant ""No, NO, NO!"" The elderly couple was obviously scared and wanted over, but I continued forward at the same rate of speed. The lights grew so bright that I was blinded and could no longer see the road at all. This lasted five to ten seconds, after which the lights disappeared, the cars behind me roared by, and I found myself alone, still driving on the highway. I pulled over at the very next exit, maintaining my gaze on the three diamond shaped lights as they sped up into the sky in a rotating circle around each other until they blended into the night sky. At this point I awoke my then girlfriend and asked her if she could see the three lights spinning like a top up in the starfield. She very annoyedly said, ""that's a helicopter, stupid!"" and just as she said that it streaked across the entire visible mountain range to the horizon as fast as I could wave my arm. I said to her, ""OK, so was THAT a helicopter?' She started yelling at me for waking her up, etc.. I told her to go ahead and go back to sleep, that I just needed her reassurance that I was not seeing things. We made it back home to Tucson, AZ. I tried to tell a few people about it, but they became very uncomfortable, and I quit telling the story. I have since travelled back through the area, and although it has been some time, I still can remember it all like it was yesterday. The most eery feeling I got upon revisiting it was I began to wonder what happened to the elderly couple who was unable to overtake my VW that night, and why they had suddenly left my field of vision so suddenly. I began to have the suspicion that they may have been abducted, because there was no physical way they could have pulled away like that with the pack of cars, otherwise they would have done just that, only much sooner, considering their obvious fright. I know the other cars in the passing lane trying to pass me witnessed the entire event. Like I said, I could see what they were wearing, as there cars interiors were also illuminated from the back reflecti! on of our headlights being shined back at us. It was the summer that 4th of July came out and the people I told this story to thought I was acting out a fantasy from the movie, but I hadn't even seen the movie. I also did not believe in UFO's before that experience.",2004-01-22T00:00:00,,

I said to my sister that I did not remember seeing that""street light "" before, she agreed.

As the light moved over,the tennis court lights went out, the courts were completely dark.  My sister and I were at first, completely stunned that when this apparent ""airplane thing"" flew over,the lights went off.  What a coinsidence,I thought. This light that is moving slowly,shorted out the lights. Weird! I thought it must be a plane it was of course moving, slow moving but moving.  We were near a military base so I at first thought it was one of those""secret weapons"" untill it flew over my head and I got a good look at it. The first thing that I noticed about it was,that it did not make a sound!  It was gliding very low, as it rose in to the clouds.It looked almost amber colored and it was shaped like a goldfish sort of, almost like a 1950's rocket shape. We watched it as long as we could untill it disapeared in to the atmosphere,just gliding slowly up. I dismissed it as a military ""secret weapon"" or possibly a balloon. Mostly the latter because of the lack of engine noise. I dismissed the idea of it,not because I did not belive in UFO's ( I always wanted to see one) but because it did not fit my idea of one. It did not change shape or go fast or even flash colored lights and it did not help that we were near Ellington field.  I just plain dismissed it as an unidentifiable flying object not a green martian space ship.

Yes there are UFO's - for example when I see a 747 I try to count the upper floor windows to see what series 747 it is. The 747-100 was glued together and they're not flying anymore - it had fewer than 7 upper deck windows. The current 747-400 has two rows of upper deck windows. It's an unidentified 747 until I can get a look at how many windows the upper deck has, but it's not an alien ship, just a Unidentified 747. There are no flying saucers, sorry. I've never seen one.

Ed Dames, appearing on the Coast to Coast radio program with Art Bell, its host, declared that through a process of ""technical remote viewing,""  he had determined that the entire event over Arizona had been caused by ""two, blue-green, one-half, split-beam lasers,"" which allegedly had been mounted on the tops of buildings in downtown Phoenix, and had projected the images into the night sky above Phoenix.  The proposition is so absurd, in our opinion, that we won't bother to address the issue here, but rather leave it up to the reader to make up his own mind.  We will comment to the extent, however, that the ""lasers"" would have to have been able to project their beams through clouds, dust, and even mountain ranges (!!) in order to have been able to do what is claimed by Dames.

LOCATION:  13 miles north of EPHRATA (pronounced E - frA - ta) WASHINGTON on Sagebrush Flats Road.  (Sagebrush flats road goes at a North by Northwest track from the town of Ephrata to the south.)  TIME:  about 7 pm PST (Dark outside), November 1999  SETTING ONE: About 13 miles northwest of Ephrata, Sagebrush flats road comes out of a small canyon (gentle rolling hills on either side of the road) onto a 2 mile wide (north to south) and 5 mile long flat area with wheat farms and high power transmission lines.  The lines are suspended upon the very tall erector-set towers such lines are usually found on.  The high power lines cut across the flats coming from the Northeast (Grand Coulee Dam) and going to the Southwest.  As I was traveling north and approaching the high power lines, I noticed a very bright light traveling very slowly (maybe 10 miles an hour) an estimated 20-50 feet above the lines.  It was to the northeast and coming towards me – as the road intersects under the lines at a 90 degree angle.  The single light was very bright; such that I couldn’t see the craft behind it.  Not wanting to be directly under the craft when it got to my location, I went maybe 1/8th mile north on the road – all the while watching the light.  I stopped the car and got out to watch.  There was absolutely NO sound from the craft holding the light.  I watched as the light came to the road and made a 90 degree turn to its left and slowly followed Sagebrush road south.  As it slowly, and at a very low altitude, approached the small canyon, the canyon and adjacent rolling hills were illuminated as if it was a bright summer day.  Since the craft/light was now going away from me, I could not see the light, just the effects of the lights illumination.  I still could not see nor hear the craft holding the light.  I watched for maybe 10-15 minutes.  SETTING TWO: My home is about three miles northwest (as a crow flies) of where I saw the light.  When I got home to my wife, I said to her, “You will not believe what I just saw.”  My wife excitedly interrupted with, “You will not believe what I just saw.”  She went on to tell me that 15-20 minutes before I got home (the same timeframe of my sighting) she had stepped outside and looked up to the east.  Hovering, maybe 50 feet above her was a very large (an estimated 150 feet to each side) black triangular shaped craft.  It made no sound.  At each corner were several small bright orange/red lights.  These corner lights gave enough definition of the craft for her to tell it was triangular.  She watched for maybe two minutes and then, out of fear, stepped back into the building.  There isn’t any way these two craft (my light carrier and my wife’s black triangular craft) could be the same craft.  It seems too much of a coincidence that these two craft were in the same general area at the same time.  I’ve always wondered if the light bearing craft was looking for the triangular craft.  That possibly, the triangular craft was hugging the ground for stealth reasons.   NOTE:  I should mention that this remote farming country has frequent daily (and nightly) over flights by military craft coming from the airbase in Spokane, Whidbey Island Naval Air Base north of Seattle, McCord Air Force base outside of Tacoma, and from Canada.  None of the usual military over flights are of strange craft.  Some are large but quiet (not silent) craft.  I felt my sighting was probably of a manmade craft – just silent and for some reason closely navigating the high-power transmission lines.  My wife and I have no idea of the origins of the large black triangular craft she saw.",2004-01-22T00:00:00,47.2724,-119.59000000000002

I then saw a fainter, less red light, about 3 or for fist lengths from the other two, forming a triangular shape with the other two. I thought i could almost make out the outline, but there was no moon, and the sky was incredibly dark.

I'm an outreach worker with the homeless in NYC and me and partner were headed to our dinner break in the van when we saw an object flying erratically in the area of lower manhattan. We were in midtown, around 54th Street and traffic was very heavy so we were basically crawling along. I was driving. So we spot this 'plane' flying east to west and then appearing to hover and just acting in a way we'd never seen a plane act before. My partner was in the military service and he's familiar with planes but he was just as dumbfounded as i was at the way it was acting. So as we were driving south on 9th Avenue, we are keeping our eyes on this 'plane' and suddenly it started to fly straight in our direction. We said 'Great, now we can see what kind of plane this is'...it must have moved really fast because suddenly it just seemed to glide right over us and that was when we saw it wasn't a plane but this HUGE triangle thing with many, many round lights underneath. The lights were arranged in triangular rows and there were three rows of them in the shape of the craft if you can picture that. They were very bright but did not give off any glare. This was just before sunset. We hung out the window as we were stopped at the light. Next to us was a woman in a jeep and she looked to see what we were staring at wide mouthed and she got a little hysterical, pretty much as dumbfounded as we were. The thing made no sound at all.

What compelled me to write was that a) I am a journalist, and you talked about why journalists don't report, and b) I heard a woman from Phoenix talk about how a laser shot down from a craft she observed in 1997. I am not sure of the date I witnessed the craft I saw, although I could do more research if you are really interested, but I think it might have been June, 1995 or possibly, June 1997. I remember that one of the Batman movies was premiering because I thought this triangular shaped black object might be advertisubg that. It was about 4 pm... and I was sitting in the living room of my apartment, which was situated on the thrid floor of a condo adjacent to Beverly Hills. I happened to notice an object in the sky, off to the east, which I realized was not moving. After several minutes of glancing back and forth at this object, I went to get my binoculars. The object was standing practically still and it was a black tiangular shape. When I peered at it through the binoculars, I saw what I recall as orange lights along the bottom side of the craft. I tried to phone the Beverly Hills Police department, but they were not interested. They refered me elsewhere and before it was over, I'd phoned the LAPD, Beverly Hills Police, and a military base, recomended to me by whomever I spoke to at the police station. The amazing thing was no one seemed to believe me. I remember wanting to got get a neighbor to see, but I was afraid that if I left this object, it would dissappear and when I brought someone back, they would think I was nuts. So I stayed put. I had no film in the camera...which I cursed myself for...so all I could do was watch. The amazing thing was that I seemed to be the only one to see it. I remember asking some one from the police department to 'just go outside and look!' and they acted as if I were nuts. Towards the end of the experience, I saw a laser type beam come from the craft down... and because I had been in this apartment during the Northridge Earthquake, and saw the power plant expolode and all the lights flash on and off, I felt as if the beam was going down to where the power plant was. That made me wonder if somehow this craft had to gain power from the transformers there. After about 40 minutes, this simply dissapeared. One minuet I saw it, and the next, I did not. Like some of your viewers, I waited to hear about this on the local news and was baffeled when I heard nothing.

The craft was just above the car and was moving at about the same speed as I was about 35mph. It was going the same direction also. We arrived to my home, and hurried up and was going to look at the craft from the back porch,we ran from the car inside one door and my friend ran out the back door to look at the craft closer. I did not make it to the back porch,because I heard a strange noise coming from my bathroom. My hairdryer was running on high speed. I had not been home since 3pm that day,it was now around 11:30pm. And I have never left my hairdryer of all things on and running. No one else had been to my home and the door was still locked as I left it. I remember turning my hairdryer off and then meeting my friend back in the kitchen area where my back porch door was located. I do not remember what happend after that. Recently, in May of 03, i discussed this with my friend and she did not remember the whole occurence. I had to keep talking about it with her over and over..and she still isnt sure if it even happend or not.

My friend told me she did not turn any lights on that the lights were coming in the windows from the outside,and she was so scared she covered her head up and would never stay there again. I have since moved away from that area and the house had been torn down. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in June 1999 is approximate.  PD))",2003-09-04T00:00:00,38.8619,-82.073

My 2 daughters and I were up in the middle of the night but I forgot what we were doing. My younger daughter (a teenager) went out to get something out of her car on the street of our subdivision culdesac and came back in afraid of something going on outside. She called her sister to go outside to see it with her. they didn't want to tell me because they knew I'd get in the car and go investigate it. So they stayed out there for about 10 minutes and then came running in to get me to come look at it too. They were scared and shaking all over, talking fast, explaining to me that they were seeing some sort of coded message going on with light across the field from our subdivision at a small aircraft airfield.  First of all, every animal for miles around was making noise. It was amazing to me that not one person got up to see what all the noise was about. Not one light went on in any houses around us. Every dog in all the neighborhoods we could hear were barking their heads off. The cows and sheep in the pastures around our subdivision for miles were mooing and baaing, without stopping. Constant. Something was going on, that was for sure. I'd never before or since experienced such a thing with the animals. There was a slight fog in the air, so that sounds were sort of muted or diffused. Even though it was dark out and the sky was dark, we could see this cloud formation over at this little air field at the end of our subdivision, which was east of us.  We were in farmland area. The airport was only supposed to be for small aircraft, yet many times in the middle of the night, we heard big, loud, jets coming in for landings that woke us up with the booming of the jet whining as it came down and I feared it would crash into our house. Or land on our house, it was so low and so close. I wondered about that all the time. Many times, also, I would wake up in the middle of the night to broad daylight, I thought, as helicopters were in my backyard with bright lights shining in my high ceiling windows that I didn't have blinds for, shining lights into our yard. The helicopters were so low, they shook the house and were so loud, they woke us up along with the lights. I wondered why the neighbors never complained about this as it was a constant source of aggravation to us. I always suspected something funny was going on at that little airport, because these big aircraft, helicopters and things weren't supposed to be coming in and landing there. I don't remember hearing any taking off, either. Only landing.  This one night with all the animals raising a ruckus, tho, something even stranger was going on. The girls pointed out to me a light across from us, across the field and landing strips of the small airfield that was either coming up from the ground going into the clouds or coming from the clouds going to the ground. It was impossible to tell because it would suddenly be there and then gone, in a straight bright thin light between the ground and the clouds. But it was a single white light like a laser light that would flash really fast and then go out in very sequential patterns like morse code. We stood shivering on the lawn watching it and counted as it would go, one, two, three, stop. One two three, four, stop. One, two, stop. One two, stop. Sometimes it would go all the way up to 21 and stop. But it would have repeating patterns of numbers. I never knew morse code, but I remember WWII movies and how it sounded as they tapped it out. This looked like what it would sound like, or it was obviously some message or code being played out before our eyes. It would pause between sets of numbers and then do another round of them.  We stood there in the damp darkness, watching for at least 15 minutes, counting and wondering if we should be writing this down to see if someone could figure it out later. Someone who knew codes. The fog was weird, too, because it wasn't everywhere. It was here and there in patches, otherwise, it was a clear night. The whole night and outside had a strange, surreal feel to it. Not quite right. Something weird going on here. There were no clouds anywhere else but over the airfield where the light was going on and off. It was no beacon to warn planes and no spotlight. I'd never seen it before or after in the 7 years I lived there. I wanted to get in my car and drive over there and see what was going on, close up, but the girls were too afraid and wouldn't let me go. They made me come in the house after awhile and were afraid of what was there and what it was doing. We watched out our living room window for another hour or more and it continued, unabated, while the animals never stopped making noise. Finally, we got tired and closed up all the windows and went to bed. I don't know how long it went on before we saw it or how long after we went to bed with all the animals howling. I still can't figure out how it didn't wake up the rest of the neighborhood, but not one opened a window and told their dogs to shut up or anything else. It was like we were the only ones alive on the planet or in the neighborhood to see and witness it.  About a year before that, we were standing talking in the driveway at night in the dark, and we saw a triangular black object with lights underneath slowly and silently go overhead while we watched it cruise by. It was pretty high up and very dark. Nothing reflected off it and it seemed flat and triangular. It came from the east, where the airport was and kept on going west right by us. I thought it was probably one of our military planes.  If anyone has ever heard of anything like these laser lights going from sky to ground or ground to sky of clouds, I would like to hear about it and figure out what it was. It's been on my mind and I keep wondering what it could have been, what we should have done differently to find out and to try to find out what we saw. Why we saw it and no one else woke up. Why the animals were carrying on. The helicopters bothered us the whole time we lived there. They also bothered us where we moved to where I saw another sighting I reported, in Santa Rosa. In fact, black helicopters have been bothering us ever since 1973, in every state and place we've lived. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My family was inside watching TV. As I sat and faced south, I noticed a sudden flash in the upper sky, way high up near the stars. It flashed a bright white that crossed the sky then was gone as suddenly as it came, like a camera flash in intensity and suddenness. I thought that was strange and kept looking to see where it had come from. It was straight ahead in the south, up at the top of the sky where I was looking. It happened again a couple of minutes later. I thought that was even stranger and called to my kids to come out and see this, but they declined.  I waited, looking for something else that might happen and it happened again and this time I saw a very bright yellow/white light moving very fast from north to south way up where the light had come from. Way high up. I watched it and had a hard time keeping track of it as it moved very fast and winked out and in, gone and then showing up a few seconds later way far ahead of where it had been going. Then, as I tried to track it,I noticed that I was seeing something with the corner of my eye, the peripheal vision. It was very faint white, like the moon in the daytime sky and I could only see it out of the corner of my eye. Every time I turned to view it with my full frontal vision, it disappeared.  I kept track of it's movement by looking out the corner of my eye and trying to catch it with my full vision as it moved south to north coming towards my house, altho it was very high up. I forgot about the other light as this one intrigued me. As it moved closer, it was still only visible thru periphial vision until it got right over my backyard and then my house and then I could see it was in the shape of a boomerang, longer on one end than the other of the ""V"" shape, and faint, faint white like whispy clouds look in the day sky but in a row along the ""V"" shape were round white lights. It moved very slowly and silently over my yard and house, but also very high up. I saw a jet moving across the sky with blinking lights and it was very tiny compared to the size of this thing that was moving so slowly and so high up. The jet was down much closer to earth and to me and was just a speck compared to this craft looming silently so high above us. I held up my hand to it to measure, and the faint white craft was the distance across of my thumb outstretched to my little finger if my hand was spread open. Maybe 8 inches in length. The jet that crossed way beneath it, so much closer to the earth and to me was the size of a beebee. I called for the kids to come out and see it, but they were too afraid to come see it go flying past our house and keep heading north until it was too faint to see anymore. It seemed that I should hear some sound, but there was no sound at all.  I don't know what the connection of the flashes of light were to this, but to me they seemed somehow connected. If it was that big and so far away, so high up in the heavens, how big was it?  It's funny about the flashes, too, because I saw flashes several years ago too, in a different part of Calif. I was driving home on hwy 101 and coming from Marin County to Sonoma County and I was surprised to see a bright flash of white light in the dark night coming from my right where there is no housing for miles. I remember thinking to myself, ""Huh. That was strange."" and driving on into the night. A few minutes later, it happened again, and the weird part was, again, I thought to myself, ""Huh. That was strange."" It happened 3 times in a row and every time, I had the same reaction as if it was the first time. Then, I thought that THAT was strange. The strangest part of all was that it seemed beyond my control to think that and keep on driving and not really turning to look at where the light flash came from. Just keep on driving. Don't look. And I did it like it was mind control. It wasn't until I got home that it all hit me as being really strange and wonder why I didn't stop to look and see where the light was coming from. It was also high up in the sky, I thought, but lower than what I saw in my back yard this time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

As I viewed the show I noticed to the NorthEast a stationary extremely bright star or planet.  It was so bright that I wondered what planet it could be this time or year.  I braced myself against the corner of my house and took a picture of it with my digital camera with a telephoto lens at the maximum.  When I viewed the image, it didn't really present change differently from the way I viewed it with the naked eye.  So, I decided to download to my computer and then digitally magnify it.  As I magnified it, it started taking on a shape up 200X before it became distorted.  It definitely was metallic and was saucer shape.  It appears that a light is on top but may be a reflection of the sun.  I thought maybe this could be a satellite but it remained stationary and didn't move for approx. 2 hours.  I, like most people didn't report it because of the possible stigmas attached to the person reporting such things.  I feel though that it is an important picture for those concerned.

I looked up, probably to check for rain, and saw a white-looking sphere gliding overhead. I thought it was a balloon, or given the nasty weather, a weather balloon, but it was hard to get any sense of distance or scale; the sky was perfectly gray and overcast, and there was no noise. I called my friend's attention to it, and we may have asked a passer by for an opinion (I don't remember). Anyway, although I initially maintained it was a balloon, it flew in a perfectly straight line at a constant speed, all the way across the sky, which I wouldn't expect from something traveling on air currents. I'm an engineer with lots of fluid dynamics experience, and I've seen balloons get carried away in wind. If this sphere was entrained in an air current... well, I haven't seen anything like it. Eventually it disappeared over the horizon; not knowing how high it was, I can't estimate the speed, but it must have been fairly quick.  Sadly, there's no abduction to report. If my friend and I were late to where we were going, it was our own fault, as usual. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-09-04T00:00:00,29.96590338078292,-90.0784456405694

Nevertheless, I remember it well enough; its not exactly something I will ever forget.....  It was a bright, sunny, beautiful day, not a cloud in the sky. I was in the car in the back seat, on the right side. Several people were in the car with me, we were driving down the street, maybe 40 or 45 mph. I looked up and suddendly saw a small, round, metallic object hovering silently above the tree line. It didn't seem like it was more than 500 ft in the air. The UFO was reflecting the sun violently, the top of it was very bright. There was no jet streak. Also, it might have been spinning, but it was difficult to tell. The really interesting part is the fact that I had no urge to tell the other people in the car. For some reason I got this weird sense of calmness, like I somehow knew that the beings on board meant me no harm. So I just stared at this thing for maybe a minute or two, trying to figure it out as it contunued to hover in the air. I was also in the process of reading a book about UFO conspiracy, so the experience was especially surreal, since it was on my mind. The most outstanding part of the experience was when it left. When it departed, it did so in a path that was directly away from me, moving in a staight line. So, from my perspective, it appeared to get smaller and smaller, at a very high rate of speed. Very very high rate of speed. The craft literally blasted off into the atmosphere and out into space in a matter of seconds, and still, making no noise at all. It still left me with that state of calmness, and I hesitated to tell the others who were in the car. I still havn't told them, they probably won't believe me. I honestly believe that the beings on the craft knew that I saw them, and somehow made a telepathic connection with my subconcious mind, which calmed me, preventing me from feeling scared. The fact that it went away DIRECTLY from my point of view, in a staight line, I feel, supports this, since the chances of that happening coincidentally are very slim.

September 10, 2003 my boyfriend (architect) and I (software engineer) decided to take a walk on the beach around 7pm towards the lighthouse and bird sanctuary from the far right beach entrance on the boardwalk. There is about a 100 feet of sand between the water and the bird sanctuary that is on the other side of you as you walk the beach. It was about 75 degrees that night and the tide was unusally high. It is very isolated. It was a dark, clear, starry night. When we got near the lighthouse we felt a weird sensation like we were being watched. The only light is the lighthouse light. I even said I thought someone was watching us. We turned around and walked back to where we entered the beach and had an uneasy walk back to the boardwalk. A chill went up my neck and we walked up the boardwalk where the main part of the city is  and I turned my head to the right and said, ""What the hell is that?"" One large looming red orange light was joined by another and they mutilplied outward till there was ten on each side, Kevin turned to look as the formation was collapsing inwards (he saw five lights on each side move) towards the center and then the lights got a big bright flash that filled the entire night sky and Kevin saw sparkly things come off it. They then disappeared. The formation was very sophisticated and I grew up on Edwards AFB and my dad was in the Air Force so I know what military exercises look like and I am an engineer and have worked with flares, so I know this was not either military or flare or fireworks in resemblence. We stayed to watch the night sky as red orange formations lit up the sky, sometimes three shapes very high on the left and then two below on the left of the sky. It was some pretty sophisticated stuff. I remember that even though it seemed to happen fast, before we knew it, it was 9pm. I know it started at 8:30 because the reason I happen to be looking in that direction is because I was looking for the time. I can honestly say that I am a skeptic and whatever I s! aw scared the crap out of me and made me consider having a much more open mind.

I slowed to about 25-30 MPH as did the other vehicles on the road.  The craft at first was almost directly above me and seemed to be at about the height that traffic helicopters fly except that this object was at least as large as a commercial jet.  As I watched, the craft moved along slowly above the road, staying just in front of me.  It then slowly rotated clockwise until the red light was on the top & white light on the bottom.  It then rotated back to it's original position and moved to the east side of the road where it rotated again but to a horizontal position.  It continued to move around some and then crossed back over the road to the west side.  Once there, I saw an arm or wing come out from the side of the craft so that now it is kind of ""L"" shaped.  The wing had pulsating red lights in a circle on the end and then a solid, concentrated beam of white light was emitted from the tip of the wing down to the ground.  It appeared similar to a search light, but was more concentrated.  The beam moved around along the ground.  I watched the craft my entire drive south on Loop 12, then onto Spur 408 until I exited onto I-20 and could no longer see it.  During the entire sighting, traffic around me was also moving very slowly, and some vehicles had pulled over to the shoulder.

Hello Brian,  I've decided to report a UFO sighting that took place on Friday  9:00 p.m., Sept  12, 2003 . I was leaving from the front of my apartment building on the south side of W.2nd ave and Maple st. in Kitsilano. I immediately noticed a bright yellow/red round object  in the sky, traveling from West to East at about the same height as Grouse mountain. It seemed to be over the Eastern North Shore mountains/Pitt Meadows area, or, even as close as the Second Narrows bridge vicinity.Very difficult to judge the locale, exactly.Anyhow, I watched it for a good 5 seconds before it disappeared behind obstructing buildings in the downtown.  I would like to believe that it was a jet fighter going crazy, but ,no flashing lights or sound. A jet helicopter? Doubtful. Too large and fast, I'm afraid. Again, it was covering a fair distance in the short time I saw, and was changing levels somewhat, giving me the impression that it was almost floating while traveling, rather than going in a directly straight line from West to East.Very interesting, indeed.

The sky was ""partly cloudy"" with cumulus clouds and I could see stars between them. 2.  The formation can best be described as being in the shape of a ""snake"" or somewhat like the ""number 3"" with each of the 9 lights appearing to be equal distant from each other from head to tail.  The lead light, or head of the ""snake,"" was the farthest North and West light. 3.  The lights did not oscilate or change color but remained a constant through out the sighting. 4.  There was no deviation in the spacing or speed of each light as they moved in formation from East to West.  They remained constant to each other. 5.  There was no silhouette suggesting a physical presence, in front of or behind the lights.  They appeared to be separate entities. 6.  Holding my arm at length, the size of the formation could be best calculated as between 1 and 1 1/2 inches from head to tail. 7.  The formation came from the East over a large tree, in my yard, that obstructed my view of seeing them further from the East. 8.  My first view of the formation could be best described as at approximately 80 degrees above the horizon and at 1 o'clock. 9.  Total view time was approx 1 1/2 to 2 seconds. 10.  My last view of the formation, before they disappeared above or into a cumulus cloud, could be best described as at approximately 80 degrees above the horizon and at 11 o'clock. 11. There were no sounds either before or after they passed. 12. I was expecting the lights to come out of West side of the cloud at approximately 10 o'clock where I could see star light. The lights did not come out of the cloud. Nothing. 13. After the sighting I stood on the deck, in awe, for approxmately 10 minutes observing the sky and waiting for the lights to either come out of the cumulus cloud or for any sound that would help me verify what I had just seen.

Note: Buckley Air Force Base is East of Denver and it is unusual for F16's to fly over North Denver Metro but, in the last month, there have been several fly overs going from SE to NW at low altitude and at speeds faster than commercial or priviate planes which I can only describe as unusual or concidental.  They normally fly East, South or South East of Denver.  Yesterday (Oct 1, 2003) two F16's broke the sound barrier over North Denver which made the local news and, according to the local newspaper, is under investigation by the military.  A spokeswoman for the Colorado Guard said that two F16's ""... were flying what we are calling an irregular flight patrol in support of NORAD."" (RMN - Oct 2, 2003 - Page 22A).

My sense of direction is bad, but I saw a VERY bright red light in the sky, about 45 degrees above the horizon. I had read that Mars is unlike a star in that it is a constant light,unblinking as stars do. Then I realized that I was looking in the southwest sky and that is not where Mars should be. I continued to look at the red light for at least 2-3 minutes when it blinked out. No movement, no diminishing, just gone. Seconds after that, a blinking light starting at the point the light disappeared and traveling in a straight line from south to north at a high altitude passed over. The light seemed to be red in the center with blue and white lights circling around the red center.I watched it until I couldn't see it any longer. I have since observed passing planes and satellites in the sky. This was definely different. I found this web site while looking for articles for a college class.

The object moves like nothing I've seen before...slowly tilting side to side and front and back on a center axis.  Unfortunately, the video looks ""wobbly"" in places because of the extreme amount of zoom used, but again, you can clearly tell it's disc-shaped and possibly had either a hole or faint light source in the middle...might've also been a reflection, as the sun was to my southwest.

It was bright enough to be able to see well enough to walk without a flashlight.  It was not raining and the temperature was cool. I noticed an uneven break in the clouds at about 75 degrees from the horizon and pointed it out to my brother and daughter who were with me.  We noted that there was a very dark black cloud right behind this light area, and no other dark clouds in the sky.  The object moved from South to North very slowly but the bright light did not change shape, so I began to suspect that we were not looking at a break in the clouds at all, but rather a craft of some sort with a round half moon shape with fog concealing it.  The black cloud did change shape constantly and looked like some type of exhaust, but it stayed right behind the bright object.  At one point, I could see stars behind both the black and white areas at the same time.  It was very large - the size of a lunch plate held at arm's length. No sound was heard by any of us. We watched it for about 10 minutes until it dissapeared from sight.  It is hard to explain, but I ""felt"" that it was a very large craft that might have been transparent with a black exhaust coming from it.  I would be very interested in finding out if anyone else saw this. It is interesting to note that I drove my brother home right after this incident and after only 10 minutes we saw that the entire sky was free of any fog,haze or clouds, and the full moon was out.  I wonder if the UFO caused the fog in order to conceal itself.

We express our gratitude to Kenny for sharing this report with NUFORC.  His website is the following:   http://home.fuse.net/     PD)) Detailed sighting in Southwest Ohio a little over an hour after the Collinsville sighting. This report below is from UFO Research: Cincinnati and it took place a little over an hour after my sighting of the Collinsville object and was reported by the person named in the report. Southwest Ohio was having a very busy week in mid October. Note that the object left heading towards Oxford, Ohio and would have passed Collinsville on the way to Oxford.  ====================================================================================  Subject: UFO SIGHTING LOCATION: Hamilton, OH (Butler County) DATE: October 15, 2003 - 8:45 p.m. SUMMARY  Stuart L***** (name used with permission in original site) telephoned the Cincinnati UFO Hotline (513-588-4548) to report sighting an unusual object. Within minutes, he was contacted at the phone number he provided (on file) and explained that around 8:45 p.m., he was at his Hamilton, Ohio residence and walking past a window (facing north) when he spotted an unusual object.  The object, L***** said, was in the sky situated directly over the Hamilton High School in Hamilton, Ohio (Butler County) and was described as a multi-colored ""upside down diamond"" rotating in place very slow. L***** estimated the object was around 45 degrees above the horizon at a possible elevation of 25,000 feet, about the height of normal airplanes, he said, situated from his perspective 'directly over the High School.'  The witness said that there were a few lights on the object, but for the most part, it was ""luminous."" The witness described a mutli-colored, ""self emanating glow"" which the object seemed to radiate, making the shape of the object visible against a dark sky.  L***** said the diamond-shaped object had changed color from red, green, blue, to white, and the lights were rotating, not flashing.  He estimated the object was 1/4 mile long but said that, at arms length, the object was as big as his pinky fingernail.  The object was visible for an estimated 10-minutes. L***** said he was about to grab a camcorder and the object ""took off"" at an incredible speed to his left, or west toward the Oxford area.  ""This thing just sped away as if going into warp speed,"" L***** said. ""I couldn't believe it.""  He described its acceleration as 'extreme.'  L***** also said that two military jets had traveled overhead about 20-minutes after the sighting, probably flying from South to north. They were apparently flying high and out of sight, but L***** estimated they were military aircraft due to turbine sound of engines.  Sky conditions were clear at the time with temperatures in the 50s.  COMMENT  On September 24, 2003, a Franklin, Ohio resident contacted Wright Patterson Air Force Base to report sighting a pattern of green flashing lights around 10:30 p.m. near her home at the Heartland Subdivision. Franklin is around 17-miles northeast of Hamilton.  Filed, October 15, 2003 KENNY YOUNG -- UFO Research http://home.fuse.net/ufo",2003-11-08T00:00:00,39.42305109489051,-84.5528097323601

I have lived in Northern Nevada since I was age 16. I am college educated in the medical sciences and have specialized in group medical insurance sales since 1981. I have never reported a sighting before although on two nights several years apart and many years ago I witnessed interesting phenomena that may have had mundane explanations. I had only driven on Highway 375 in southern Nevada one other time previously. A month earlier my wife and I drove down to Mesquite, NV together in daylight. On this night, there was no moon that I noticed. It may have been below the horizon or not have risen yet. I was traveling again from my home in Reno, Nevada to my home in Mesquite, Nevada to meet my wife who was waiting there. The night sky was perfectly clear and the weather pretty warm for this date in October. More stars were in the sky than I  could ever remember, but no moon!  At the time I began witnessing the event I will describe in detail, I was on Highway 375 aproximately 20 miles before reaching Rachel, Nevada. At this time I am not absolutely sure which direction on the compass I was pointing but my guess would be Southwest. In any case, as I would notice later on there was a very bright star or planet high in the night sky almost immediately in line with my direction of travel.  I was moving slower than normal because the area is Open Range and cattle are everywhere, sometimes in the center of the highway. Anyway, I was moving about 60 mph and very attentive to road conditions. To my right, near the top of my windshield in the Camry, I was startled by a bright orange colored globe that ""appeared"" for about 5 seconds. As soon as I came to a dirt road on the same side, I pulled over got out but kept my motor running. In the night shadows I noticed a hillside that grew into a small mountain range about a quarter mile away and ran away from my position in the  direction of light I had seen. I guessed that the object was at least 10 miles away althought I had only the dark mountain range to relate to. It was bright orange, the orange was not pale at all but had a lot of red in it. The shape was like a fat cuban cigar, not long at all. In a moment, I noticed two very small white lights paired together and moving upward from the horizon under the area I had first spotted the orange object.  Then parted about 500 feet up from the horizon,going in almost horizontal paths 90 degrees away from each ohter.I followed the white light that was moving toward the small mountain range and it turned and headed along the range. In a few seconds a jet began to follow this light closely. Over my car engine which ran pretty quietly, I could hear the jet engine. Also, I saw the flashing lights of the jet and it looked like the jets I have noticed in the air all my life. Also, on this highway I had already noted that a lot of air traffic was evident on my left, very high in the sky but that nothing commercial was on my right, only these strange sights. It was so quiet I even noticed the noise of the commercial jets, as high as they were, earlier after stopping.  After about 10 minutes the jet following the small white light was gone over the far horizon and I was looking for any other white lights when two more orange globes appeared briefly near the horizon that I had seen the white lights rise. They were the same color and shape but they were lower over the horizon than the first orange light. The lights came on in sequence, first the one closer to the mountain range, then when it went out in a few seconds another to its left came on immediately and also stayed on for only about 5 seconds. The lights had a distinct fat oval shape and clear definition. They didn't grow to oval shapes like a blast would but they simply appeared instantly and disappeared instantly. A few more minutes went by before I decided to continue on to the Little Ale-e-inn bar for a chat with anyone who would listen. As I again drove slowly down highway 375 toward that bright star or planet I reached a higher point and to my right noticed a few red and white lights blinking on the horizon. This time the object seemed to be on the ground and could have been a small plan on a runway about 5 or so miles away. I kept on driving but shortly I was forced to stop again!Just to the left of the bright star or planet I noticed another very small white light that could have been a dim star except that it was moving in my direction and to my left at an angle away from the star. That didn't excite me but within a second or two after following its travel path, it became a bright orange globe, just as bright and exactly like the previous two. In about 5 seconds it disappeared and immediately another appeared just ahead of it. The instant the next light went out a third appeared just ahead of it too! Each light was exactly the same shape, size and coloration. I pulled my car over as soon as possible and this time I turned my engine off thinking that I may stay stopped a while so I didn't miss anything. The first thing I noticed was a low humming sound that seemed to emanate from every direction. If I had the engine running I am sure I would have never heard the sound! In my imagination I thought the sound to resemble a high speed electric motor that had become frozen. The second thing I noticed in the direction of the first sightings about 15 or so miles away was a white glow like a large city gives off when you are far away in a very dark area. I thought that it could be Las Vegas lights but that city was at least 150 miles from my position. However Las Vegas is the brightest city anywhere and it was possible. While at this stop I almost immediately noticed several little white lights, like the head of a pin that seemed to wander aimlessly in the sky on the right side of the highway. Most were pretty high up and a couple so faint i could only see them clearly when I looked at them with peripheral vision. In about 10 minutes I became anxious again to get to the bar and talk to anyone local about my sightings. I arrived at the bar but the lights were out, nobody home. I drove a little bit farther, past the buildings and trailers untill I got to a wide dirt road. At the road I turned into I parked and got out because i was still curious and wanted to see more. I immediately noticed that the low hum was not there. I also couldn't see any moving white lights, only stars. About 5-8 miles away, down the dirt road toward area 51 I did spot a lot of vehicle lights that appeared to be on high beams. I had noticed no traffic before this time so I decided to move on in case they were base security.",2003-11-08T00:00:00,,

My wife and I were southbound on I 87 at the 32 or 33 mile marker just south of Saratoga NY.  I saw a distant object in my windshield that I initially thought to be a hot air balloon in the distance.  The sky was clear and without clouds.  I found it strange to see a hot air balloon as the temperature was only 4 or 5 degrees above zero.  I noticed the shape of the object change so that I no longer recognized the hot air balloon shape.  I mentioned it to my wife who started watching it also.  It then went back to looking like a hot air balloon.  As we continued to watch it became apparent to me that we were closing on the object faster than I would have expected if it were a hot air ballooon.  My first explanation for this was that perhaps it was smaller than I had expected so we were really closer to it than I had estimated.  As we continued to get closer I realized we were closing on it very quickly and as it passed overhead my wife was able to crane her neck and look up through the windshield.  I asked her what it looked like as we passed and she said that what she saw was a disk shaped object, metalic in color, and not entirely smooth.  The object did not have lights.  At the closest point the object appeared about the size of a quarter.  After the experience we tried to make some sense of what we had seen and have not been able to do so.  I don't know if the object was large and traveling at a high rate of speed, or if it was small and moving very slowly.",2004-01-17T00:00:00,,

Even after seeing something a little strange when I was a kid that I’ve never really been able to explain.   I think I was about 14 or 15 (it was a long time ago, maybe 1970 or 71).  It was mid-Summer in my home town, Lansing, Michigan, and my best friend and I were playing softball with some other kids at the neighborhood school ground.  When it started getting too dark for softball, we walked back to our street.  When we got to my house, the stars had just begun to come out.  I went in the house and grabbed a couple sodas and went back outside.   We both laid back on the grass of the front lawn next to the driveway, looking up into the sky.  At the same time, we both saw a stationary point of light that was a blue-green color.  It wasn’t overly bright, but it was larger than any ""star"" I had ever seen, so it was distinctly noticeable, yet it seemed to be way, way up there amongst all the other stars.  I would estimate (from memory) that a bee-bee held between the thumb and index finger at arm’s length would represent the visually perceived size of the object from the ground.  Anyhow, we watched it for maybe fifteen minutes.  During that time, it wasn’t doing much, other than pulsating slightly (twinkling).  Then, we started seeing faint orange glittery streaks of light shooting from it.   I remember saying something like, ""Woah!  Check that out!"" and my friend said, ""Yeah, man, I’m seein’ it too!""  They were shooting out from the object in all directions, and each streak ended in a tiny white sparkle, except for some of them that seemed to be actually impacting smaller ""stars"" surrounding the object, as if it was shooting some sort of weapon at them.  To a couple of imaginative teenage boys, this was pretty exciting stuff.  But even then, I remember thinking, maybe it’s a satellite, or some other man-made spacecraft, and the streaks shooting from it are booster jets being used to man! euver the object or reposition its orbit.  If only I had a telescope.  The streaks were like fireworks right after they’re launched, when you can just make out a faint spark trail as they shoot through the sky before they explode.  In fact, the scene was kind of like a miniature version of the finale of a major fireworks display where they shoot off a whole mess of fireworks all at once.  This ""stellar battle"" lasted for another fifteen minutes or so, and then the thing simply blinked out.  Just like that.  It was gone.  We told everybody we knew about what we had seen, and I’m not sure who believed us and who didn’t.  Like I said at the beginning of this accounting, I’m a little skeptical about things like this.  I’ve always figured that what we saw probably has some perfectly normal, ""down-to-earth"" explanation. (Not that I have any clue what that might be.) (???)  Anybody else ever seen anything similar?

So we hopped into my brothers '56 chevy and followed it along the side of the town we were in.  Then it stopped above an old farmhouse which was approximately an acre from the corner of the hospital.  We parked and watched it as it hovered above a farmhouse which had a tv antena on top.  At that point we tried to become brave and thought we would leave the vehicle.  It seemed as if it was looking at us and could hear everything on the radio as the radio stoped working while we sat there and watched.  There was a beam of light that came fell upon the house and we thought we wanted to get a closer look and were discussing this.

We stood at the deck which overlooked the lake. Mountains surround the area and it is lit by the moonlight. It was very peaceful and pleasant, no one was out at this time of night. I remember feeling safe with guy friend, then suddenly from behind the mountain, a huge, maybe 100' wide flying saucer hovered into the valley like area, almost like it was hiding. It made a very swift humming sound and took over the sky. There were colorful lights twinkling on the bottom of the saucer. I was amazed, I looked over to my friend and he started running and left me there! I realized then how dark it was. The saucer had taken up the sky and the moonlight. I couldn't see the road which would lead me back up to the car. Oh my god, this guy left me! I said ""Wait""!. Luckily, I found my way up the hill by memory, for have often visited Lake Chabot. There he was, my so called friend, taking off in his car. I was able catch him. He was very frighten, where I was more amazed. We went back to my house to share it with my roomate and she thought we were on drugs. Well, we weren't. We talked alone out in front of my house for a few miniutes, then he left.

We were watching one plane flying east and one plane flying west and remarking how much the speed was affected. I live north of the PTI airport and glanced in that direction. There was a extremely bright disc shaped object in the sky over the airport at a high altitude. It seemed to be higher than the planes were flying. I got my girlfriends attention and pointed out the object. the only thing to compare it to was how Venus has appeared recently in the nighttime sky. She thought it must be a star and I myself remarked that it could possibly be Venus. As we watched the object appeared to be getting closer. At the time there were at least six airplanes visible in the sky and each one was leaving a vapor trail behind it. This object was leaving no trail and appeared to be coming straight down vertically and not horizontally like the airplanes. The object suddenly seemed to shift direction and begin to move straight up into the sky. It was getting smaller but was still incredibly bright. A small cloud passed in front of the object but the object was still clearly visible through the cloud when suddenly it just blinked out. When the cloud passed nothing was there anymore leaving us at a loss for what it could have been. The cloud was small and there was no way it could have gone in any direction but straight up without us seeing where it went.,2004-01-31T00:00:00,36.0769630261661,-79.81581387940841

It appeared to be quite high, and was moving quite a bit faster than a commercial aircraft, but definitely slower than a meteor. The light continued going east, and I watched it until it disappeared behind some trees in the distance (almost to the eastern horizon.) The light did not flash or flicker like an exhaust or reflected light, it seemed to be self-luminous. It did not leave a trail behind like a missile or meteor. I did not see any red or green navigation lights as it departed to the east, which I would have expected it it were an aircraft.

Moments later about 30 minutes or so later, I looked towards UCI and ElToro base, then suddenly 5 to 6 flashes of white light flashed into the sky all in about 1 second, then just as the white lights finished flashing about 5 to 6 more flashed but in the color of electric blue, same amount of timing. My night was completed. Thanks to the government, I almost had a heart attack. It was my second time, but not this close. First sighting was about 400 yeard + away. Same color in Mission Viejo in 1996 about summer. Happy Sightings.  ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate location, and elects to remain totally anonymous.

No commercial airplane, helicopter, or army jet I have seen in this town has moved so fast and be so low.  And I've seen all kinds of army jets, some I saw about a month ago because we had a Air Show and was able to see all kinds of jets.  Then after 4-6 minutes this object suddenly moved from the deserted place to a place were there's more lights were you could find stores,malls, and fast food places.  For what I saw, he was close to a WalMart in east El Paso, just floating in top and flashing the same light again but this time he was floating higher in the sky then the object continued to move further away and I couldn't see it anymore.

Temperature was 48 degrees F. The sky was very dark, clear, and stars were visible. When I was approaching my intersection to make a left, I saw it. On the top right corner of my frontal car window, an round shaped, bright light greenish light suddenly caught my eye. I stopped my car in the middle of the street and looked at it. It started to get brighter and then it ""warped out"" leaving a trail of the same exact color for about half a second and vanished, as if nothing was there. After it disappeared, I thought about many things for a moment. It could've been an airplane, a helicopter, fireworks, or something.. it was NOTHING LIKE IT. Then, my whole body started to get goosebumps and my eyes with tears. I froze right there, in the middle of the street for a good 30 seconds. I once saw the UFO sighting shows in television before. It looked exactly like it. If whoever reads this gives me video clips of different sightings, I might be able to pinpoint something similar to what I actually saw.

I was watching the sunset today from my kitchen table. After the sun had fully set, I remained at the table, watching the small TV in the kitchen. At 16:25, something caught my attention from the corner of my eye. I looked back out the window and about one fists width above the horizon and a little left of where the sun had set, there was a very bright line in the sky, about the length of my thumbnail.  I first though it was a contrail, but it seemed too straigth and even, to the naked eye. I used a pair of small birdwatching binoculars to get a better look and discovered that this likely was not a contrail. The front and back where completely flat and the length of the object was extremely straight. It was an absolutely perfect, highly elongated rectangle. After drawing it out to the shape I saw, I come up with a length to width ratio of about 10 to 1.  I was able to keep still by placing my elbow on the table and using one of the window edges (it's a three window bay window) and the siloette of a leafless tree across the way, in order to determine if there was any movement. For the first minute or so I observed the object through the binoculars, it sisn't move at all. Then, over the next thirty seconds or so, it slowly moved about it's own length to the right, then stopped moving again. I aboserved it for another 30 seconds, then it just suddenly hanished. No fading, no perception of it zipping away, it just was gone in the blink of an eye.  I'm a sky watcher and we have frequent airliner traffic over the area, with plains coming and going from Logan airport. I know what contrails look like and landing lights, etc... This bright object was absolutely straight and of uniform width and the  ends were completely flat. The four corners of the elongated rectangular shape were perfect 90 degree angles. The perception was that this was something  far way and very large. I categorize the shape as cylinder, but it was impossible to determine the shape of the object's third dimension from my vantage point.  The best I could tell, the object was perfectly parrallel to the horizon.

My friend and I left a Wal-Mart Supercenter at 9:45 pm EDT.  The store number for this location is 658 according to Wal-Mart's website.  As we approached and entered into my vehicle, a whistling sound like a jet landing at close range was heard.  The sound began at a high frequency, about 18,000 hertz but decreased in pitch at a constant rate until the frequency of the sound was inaudible.  The sound lasted about eight to ten seconds per event and it was heard a minimum of three full times.  The first time that I heard the sound, I thought it sounded like a small military jet landing nearby.  However, this sound was too pure and ambient like it was coming from many different directions at the same time.  My friend and I didn't say anything to each other during the first event, but by the time I started the car and decided to leave the parking spot, we heard it again.  The windows in my car were rolled down and I saw a lady at a range of fifteen feet who was two men ask, ""what is that noise?""  The noise sounded as it did the first time.

We were only driving through on our way for a weekend camping trip.  We are not familiar with any type of airfields in the area, civil or military.  As we exited the parking lot we could hear the sound once again, but this time it sounded more distant.  The only explanation that my friend and I could rationalize is if there is some type of very loud, crisp, ambient car stereo technology that is on the market that we are unaware of.  This sound was loud and it seemed to permeate through the entire parking lot.  There were a few dozen people walking in and out of the Wal-Mart at this time.  It appeared that many people heard these sounds and they were perplexed as we were.  It was a warm, humid and hazy night and the sky was unable to be seen due to the haze and the lights from the area.  The performance of my vehicle was unaffected.

At one point, the lights went into an arc, then flattened out again.  Observed it for approx. 2 hours.  At one point, the object seemed to move from side to side.  Then, as the sky was lightening with the impending sunrise, the object started to slowly rise upward until it could not be seen.  6:00 am:  Got husband and he observed object also.  We watched it for another hour.  Sunday, August 24, 2003 Sighting: 5:00 am:  Object not there. 5:20-5:30 am:  Object there, flashing red-orange, blue and white lights.  Again, at sunrise, object slowing began to rise until it could not be seen.  Observed for approx. 1-1/2 hours.  Monday, August 25, 2003 Sighting: 5:30 am:  Object there, flashing red-orange, blue and white lights.  Observed for approx. 1-1/2 hours.  Tuesday, August 26, 2003 Sighting: 5:00 am:  Object in southeast sky just a pinpoint in the sky.  Noticed another object in northeast sky over Wasatch Mtns.  Through the binoculars and with naked eye could see the same flashing colored lights.  This object was not as large as object in southeast sky on previous mornings.  5:30-6:00 am:  Was watching object in northeast sky.  Object in southeast sky seemed closer because it looked bigger.  Within a few seconds as I was watching the northeast object, I looked again at the southeast object and it was directly over the mountains and big and bright again.  The object in the northeast sky started to go upwards and became smaller until it was no longer visible.  The object in the southeast sky was very bright and seemed larger than previous mornings.  This object could still be seen even after the sky had lightened enough for the other stars in the sky to disappear.  Between 6:30-7:00 am, it moved upwards until it was no longer visible.  Wednesday, August 27, 2003: 4:00 am:  Cloud cover, object not visible. 6:00 am:  Cloud cover, object not visible.  Thursday, August 28, 2003: 5:30 am:  Object in southeast sky over Wasatch Mtns. very bright.  Seemed the flashing colored lights were even brighter than before.  Also saw object in northeast sky, smaller and seemed to be moving away. 6:30 am:  Object in southeast sky higher and moving away.  No longer visible at 7:00 am.",2003-08-28T00:00:00,40.704464857813726,-111.88213884685625

I happened to look up and saw 2 stationary lights in the sky.  Both had the appearance of a star (about the brightness of Jupiter at night) and were roughly a few miles apart (best guess).  Neither had any color, the same color as starlight.  Common sense told me that they couldn't have been stars during broad daylight so out of curiosity I stood there and watched.  My first thought was that they were balloons very high up, but as I stood there and the minutes rolled by, I seriously doubted that as neither one had moved whatsoever.  I noticed, to my amazement, that the light closest to me had a very tiny light flying in circles rapidly around it.  That disappeared and the two lights just sat there motionless.  Neither of the two bright ones moved at all during this time.  I put the groceries away and came back out about 3-4 minutes later and noticed that the light that was farthest away had moved farther east of the other.  Neither was moving but I know for a fact that the one had moved while I was in the house, it was visibly noticable.  I sat watching for about 10 more minutes and nothing.  I found a pair of binoculars and had a look... both looked like stars... very high up and a simple dot of light, just like a star would look.  I went back in the house... and about 5 minutes later, curiosity got the best of me so I stepped back outside to have a look.  Both lights had completly vanished but there were about 4(?) very tiny lights flying around... all very small and much dimmer then the two before.  Hard to believe, but they were flying around each other... kind of a dogfight and I had the feeling that they were very high up.  As I watched they all kind of just faded and that was it.  Needless to say, I had a hard time processing what my eyes were seeing.  Anyway, there you have it.. thanks and had to tell someone.",2003-08-28T00:00:00,39.50650741150443,-119.8174511061947

I watched for about 10 minutes with binoculars and the naked eye (the clours flashing were to me blue and red).  The lights did not move.  We both watched as an aeroplane higher up than the lights went past it and past us, so this confirmed it was not an aeroplane nor we agreed the local police helicopter.  We then spotted another light that was lower and off to the left of the first one, this was hidden by low cloud.  After about 15 minutes and returned indoors.  My husband had gone in and got the video camera and carried on filming the lights and did not come indoor until 23.30.  During this time the lights did not move and as I am typing this I've sent him outside to see if they are still there.

A row of trees follow the road in front of her house, obstructing most of the sky in that direction. That's why I found it so unusual to see lights in the sky coming down the road from that direction. I immediately knew, from years of being on the porch, that you can not see airplanes in the sky from there when the tree's are full of leaves in the summer. I got up and walked out to the road so the trees would not obstruct my vision. One of my friends followed me. We saw a cigar shaped aircraft, flying from left to right in our direction. It was upright or vertical. We could not see the actual craft, but a red light on the top and bottom- solid, not blinking- gave us an idea of what shape it was. By the time we reached the road to see it, it was some 600 yards away, no more than 500 feet off the ground. It was silent and around 100 feet in height. We only got a full, unobstructed view for about five to ten seconds before it went behind a large hill directly across from our location. The friend that saw it with me was quite excited, and his loud exclamations of ""Holy ****!"" brought the other three people off of the porch to see what the commotion was all about. We told them what happened. As we were about to get in a car and drive down the road to the other side of the hill and see where the object had gone, a white light, about half the size of the original object, arose from behind the hill about 300 yards from where we were. It quickly shot directly up and disappeared into the night sky. Once again, there was no noise. We remained outside for several hours. With all of us excited about what we had seen, we spent much of that time gazing at the stars. Because of that, we observed two other strange objects that otherwise would have went unnoticed. They were like dim stars, seemingly not within the atmosphere. I originally thought they were satellites, as I had observed them before. The peculiar thing was there were two of them, with the second trailing the lead one closely. We watched them go halfway across the sky above us, at about the speed of a satelitte, when suddenly the lead light made a 90 degree turn to our right. The second followed accordingly. Their speed remained constant, and we watched them disappear over the western horizon. If there would only have been one, and it had not have turned, I would have thought it normal space debris. However, due to its maneuvering, I believe it obviously was not. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness, and have found him to be exceptionally credible.

Basically it was a meteor that many witnesses observed making a brief streak in the sky that was punctuated by a brilliant flash.

It was moving to slow to be an airplane. It was triangular shaped with bright lights shining down over the river.

Kevin Walston from the Air Combat Command public affairs office at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. The Langley office is the official Air Force contact office for B-2 information. ³Whatever the person might have seen, it was not a B-2.² A spokeswoman at McChord Air Force Base said there were no aircraft from McChord in the area on Tuesday night, and this morning, the National Guard unit at Montesano said that none of their units were operating in the area on Tuesday either. Reports on Wednesday described the rumbling, low-flying craft as everything from a commercial jet to a B-2 bomber to a UFO. One South Aberdeen man was certain it was a heavy-lift helicopter. ³It flew right over my house,² he said. ³It was all lit up underneath. I could see all three propellers.²  Hope this is the one.  As I remember, it occurred a couple of months after the Satsop Earthquake (July 2, 1999). The article was not front page news, which surprised  my  wife and I because of how dramatic it was for us. I remember the article mentioning police reports, and seen from Montesano to Aberdeen, and happened around an hour after dusk. The article may have stated something like  ""military spokesman had said that nothing was noted in the area"" and had speculated that the object may have been a large helicopter. We did not file any report at the time, but since then recent television shows on UFO's have shown pictures that are very close to what we had seen.  I did a quick search of our 1999 archives for ""Helicopter"" ""Military""  ""River"" ""Earthquake"" and couldn't find the article you are referring to.  If you come up with any more information, let me know and I'll do another search. ((NUFORC Note:  This is a celebrated event, and sighting, in southwestern Washington.

I read the post and knew finally that I wasm t crazy.  This very same night I too witnessed a UFO.  It was of a triangular shape and it hovered over three houses in the Hovious Ridge area of Columbia, KY.  I am unsure if this was one of your houses or not?  I was leaving a friends house and as I was pulling out of the drive onto the road the object appeared hovering over these houses.  My legs and feet began to tremble and I just stopped.  I watched it and was afraid to go any further as I knew once I went down the ridge there would be no houses and I would be all alone.  I sat there watching it for approximately 2 or 3 minutes and my heart just raced.  It appeared to be of a triangular shape in the front with all types of different colored lights.  It just sat there hovering.  Watching me. I could barely breathe.  Then suddenly it took off like the speed of light over the trees and towards Green River Lake.  It was beautiful to watch.  Then all my fear just left me.  And I went on home.  I hope that the person who posted back in 2000 comes back and reads this.  Columbia is a small town and i'm sure we are not the only ones who witnessed something dramatic that night.  I think people are just too afraid to say anything about it.  Like, I was.

We walked towards the sound, but couldn't see what was causing it, just stars. As we got closer it was almost overhead, but still couldn't see anything. We reached our fenceline and relized it was about 20ft ahead and about 50ft up. We walked about 50+/-ft to both sides and could tell the noise was coming from the same locale. So we stood at the closest viewing location inside our fence. Our necks were getting sore from looking up, so my wife decided to go to the house to get a flashlight to shine at this invisible object. I tried SOS in morse code a few times, but nothing. My wife grabbed the flashlight and started flashing in a very erratic way. After about 30 seconds the noise changed to a loud jet engine noise and I saw an orange glowball (softball size), it zipped to the east about 100yrds and quickly returned to its original location all in about 3 seconds, almost making a tracer effect.

Report by Oregon UFO Research Assistant Director Eric Byler of Salem, Oregon.  On 9/11/03 Byler received requested mail at home from his contact at the Abatement Department at the Port of PDX. There was a note attached to a computer printout of air activity over the Portland, Troutdale, Hillsburo area. At the top was the Port of Portland insignia and the following typed information to the right of the Printout...  August 29, 2003  Between 22:30-22:40 PM.  All aircraft operations over the Gresham area between 10:30 and 10:40 PM.  *The circles are five miles apart.  ..and a note that said, ""Eric. Possibly the person saw the Boing 767-300 (B763) coming in from the West.  It was headed strait for him for several minutes. I'm also thinking that with all the pilots in the area at that time, anything unusual would have been reported.""  After examining the map Byler concurred with this opinion as the print out clearly showed the flight path and location of the plane in question during its journey towards landing at PDX. The Intersection of NW Angeline AV. and NW 5th St. in Gresham are also clearly marked on the map as mentioned in the original witness report.  There are four commercial flights represented on the map, three arrivals and two departures. At exactly 10:28 PM Boing 767-300 (B763) was arriving and was due west of the witness, 14 miles out and at 6998 feet. The flight traveled for about fifteen miles at 221 miles per hour on a nearly strait on flight path toward the witnesses location at Angeline and 5th, bright landing lights on, and then circled that location at about one mile out.  It then began its strait decent to the North West toward landing at PDX.  Also in the air at 10:28 PM...  1) An arrival due South of the witness, 10 miles out and at 4961 feet.  2) An arrival due North of the witness, 5 miles out and at 1486 feet.  3) A departure northeast of the witness, 17 miles out and climbing at 5666 feet.  4) An arrival that had just landed from the southeast.  It has been confirmed that none of the other pilots in the area reported an unidentified during the duration of the witnesses sighting.  It has been confirmed that the tower did not see an unidentified craft in the airspace of the witnesses sighting.  No one coming or going from the Portland International Airport reported seeing an unidentified craft in the area of the Airport as described it should have been at the end of the witness report.  The witness himself does not report seeing the 767 in his airspace when the printout clearly shows he should have.  The logical explanation is that he did in fact see the 767 in his airspace.  The fact that it was dark at 10:30 PM and that he was only seeing a series of lights lead us to the conclusion that he simply connected the dots with strait lines to give the illusion he was seeing a triangle shaped craft.  This is very common with night light sightings. The fact that the entire sighting took place from a moving car also seems to account for his not hearing the commercial flight and would also seem to account for the other moments in the report when the lights appeared to ""pivot"" smoothly and turn in an odd manor.  Oregon UFO Research Director Skip Schultz writes...""In regards to the Gresham sighting, I have reviewed the data Eric received from The Port of PDX and the witness report. I agree with Erics analysis of the sighting. There were a number of identified airplanes in the approach pattern at the time of the sighting. One aircraft was in the reported location and at the exact time the witness reported seeing the triangular lights in the sky.  Next, if there was an unknown object in the same flight pattern as the airplanes we have verified were there at the time, they would have reported this to the PDX tower. Also, if the witness was able to see the lights, the tower would have also seen these lights. The tower would have immediately called the unknown asking for identification since there would have been no transponder signal. With no response from the unknown, it would have been turned over to our contact at the abatement department for verification. At this point the Air National Guard would have been alerted to scramble and identify the unknown. This did not happen.  The flight data Eric presents clearly shows that at the time of the sighting there was an aircraft in that pattern, in the exact location and landing at PDX. The lights disappearing at the point reported by the witness disappeared at the exact time that the known airplane landed at PDX. Media did not report that a UFO landed at PDX so we can conclude with certain confidence this sighting was the known airplane verified in the area at the time.  There was some disagreement with Oregon MUFON as to whether the pilots would report this to the tower if they had seen an unidentified in the first place.  OUFOR is convinced that there is no conspiracy at the airport right now due to the heightened awareness and concern of terrorist threats and that if an unknown were to have been spotted our contact would have shared that information with us.  We conclude that the witness misidentified the lights of a 767 on its final 7 minute approach to PDX as a triangle craft based solely on light patterns, a very common occurrence.  Special thanks to Peter Davenport for sharing witness information with us and for MUFON State Director Tom Bowden for his follow up investigation in the Gresham area that included several witness interviews.   We also would like to thank Jerry Gerspatch of the Port of PDX (Portland International Airport) for his continued cooperation and information sharing in this and past UFO investigations we have conducted.

While driving the company's 18 wheeler on I-29 just north of Council Bluffs, Ia., I saw something through the top right of the windshield that looked like an airliner (but too many lights), banking then dropping down ( about 1 mile out). When I looked back to the road briefly, I almost couldn't find it again but saw it hug the ground and cross to the interstate beyond the next overpass.  When I drove around a mild curve and went under the overpass, it was ahead of me about 1/4 mile over the ditch moving northbound as I was. I left my truck in cruise at 60mph. It only took a few seconds to catch up to it. It slowly picked up speed as I got nearer and when I was just up to the rear lights, It was traveling about 2mph slower than my 60mph, so I studied the craft the best I could.  The bottom of the craft was only about 20'-25' above the road surface to my right and the leftmost white light (1 of 3) was just to the right of the truck cab. What I could see clearly were three brilliant white circular disc shaped lights about 4' in diameter forming an equilateral triangle about 4'-6' apart 2 leading and 1 trailing center. A single bright red circular disc of lights approximate 3' in diameter located in the center of the 3 white lights.  When approaching from the rear, I leaned forward to look up behind the lights, but couldn't see anything but black and a faint smoky or black misty wake like a boat would leave in water. It looked like it could have been following the underside of the craft, but I really couldn't tell.  The white lights were brilliant and looked like a hundred plus bulbs in a disc, but were too bright to see the light source, but they did not blind the eye when looking right at them. The light they gave off had a flood like appearance and lit the ground and the truck cab very well (about like hallogen). The red disc of light was bright red but did not glare as much and I could see what appeared to be maybe 30 or more bulbs. The actual count could be higher.  The craft continued to fall behind at the 2mph rate until it was well behind the trailer then slowed considerably as I continued at 60mph. When a mild hill and then another overpass came, I could still see the brilliant white light glowing upward in my mirror even though I was possibly a mile or so away and over the hill.  That was Tuesday, and I wasn't routed that way all the rest of that week. The following Sunday, I drove down there to investigate the area during daylight. The ditch in that area extends approximately 50' over to a row of utility poles that are about 35'-40' in height all along the area this occurred. Since all during the event, I could not see the size or shape of the craft, this may help in some way.  Also, I didn't get the precise locations of these, however I noticed there are a few lines coming from the utility poles and crossing I-29 at various points and appear to be elevated only about 2/3 the way up these poles. Maybe that explains why the craft backed off when it did. I think it might have had to stay below radar or something. When I first saw it bank & drop, it went over to I-29 almost hugging the ground and I think it may have dropped where Loess Hills protrudes upwards just east of the interstate.  Also, I forgot to mention the craft moved along like it was on rails, (not even a wobble or bump), nor did it have an angle of attack, (it was perfectly level). I couldn't roll down the right window (it isn't powered and it isn't safe to reach that far), but I had on an empty trailer and was on fairly flat ground and the motor wasn't real noisy, and I did not hear any noise from the craft over the moderate motor and tire noise of the truck.

I was sleeping the other night and was awakened at about 2am by what sounded like glass breaking outside. I went outside for a moment and looked around but saw and heard nothing from my second story deck. Since I live in a second story pent house like appartment I wasn't overly concerned about it. It was quiet and calm with nothing going on. When I went into the kitchen to have a glass of water I saw a very bright flash of light through my dinning room windows that were covered by curtains completly. The bright light flashed for one second perhaps two at the most. Since the windows are very large and tall I opened the curtains immediatly and expected to hear a clasp of thunder within seconds, the weather at that moment was steady light drizzle and no wind at all. I STOOD THERE WAITING FOR THE THUNDER BUT IT NEVER CAME. I then noticed that the bright light had knocked out all the street lights for a two block radius. After about 30 seconds the lights slowly turned back on like they do at sundown. I was so intriged by the event that I made some coffee and stayed up for 3 more hours watching from my vantage point over the city streets and waiting for the light to happen again or a laser or some kind of power ark in the power lines but nothing moved or happened.

I've had a lot of scientific training and I can't think of what the light could have been. I'm just stumped on even a hypothosis on this one. The other thing I wanted to say is that I too have seen on many occasions star-like lights that make turns at super high altitudes or blink on and off in completely clear night skies. I can imagine a rotating metalic cylindrical satelyte that reflects light from one side because it is painted black on the other, so it would appear to be blinking as it moved accross t! he sky as it rotated.

As it’s been getting dark earlier, we decided to jog through our own neighborhood. At about 8:30pm we were heading west down Old College Way. I glanced up and saw a panel of lights almost directly overhead. It was moving slowly and silently from west to east. It seemed to be approximately 1000-2000 feet off the ground. There was no erratic movement at all. After a few seconds the lights dimmed out, almost as if they had sensed me watching. The sky was very clear and once the lights went out, I could not make out any dark silhouette. My wife had not looked up in time to witness anything, but suggested maybe I saw a shooting star. As we looked at the sky, a small private jet went overhead, heading almost due north. It was quite audible and its black silhouette was easily identifiable. It did not appear to be chasing or even aware of the lights. My wife repeated that it must have been a shooting star. However, the lights were very clearly defined. They were three horizontal rows of six lights each. The lights were perfectly round and almost looked light a panel of stadium lights floating in the sky. They were very 3-D looking. They appeared to be angled over the ground at about a 30 to 45 degree angle. There was a definite dark shadow behind the lights like a short, stubby cigar, though the lights themselves seemed to be flat on the same plane. My most immediate thought was that I was looking at the Goodyear Blimp, but the moment the lights dimmed out, the black shape vanished as well. From my experience at football games, I have been able to hear the blimp even over the crowd noise. Whatever this was, was dead silent. The image I have included is a rendering in Photoshop of what I saw.

Suddenly, out of nowhere a beautiful bright vanilla star about the same size and color Mars is at the moment appeared very close overhead in the north sky and started to smoothly descend towards me. It was a steady light, moving deliberately and did not seem to be a falling star or comet. There was no noise. The speed at which it decended is hard to describe as it was as if it was a controlled speed, not really fast or slow but very smooth and deliberate. It came in so close to the yard it was level with the high treetops. Although at first I was mesmerized by it's beauty, the closer it got to me, I became terrified, ran to the glassed in deck door, tore it open and backed in, never taking my eyes off it. I know this sounds crazy but it was as if the light could sense my fear and retreated backwards until it faded from view. It looked like a bright star with a hard, almost diamond-like  brilliant center surrounded by a softer glow of the same color. Also, at the risk of sounding absolutely bonkers, the reason why I got so frightened was, I felt like it would have come right down to me if I hadn't gotten out of the way.

On Wed. September 17th at aproximately 10:30 pm my wife and I began our nightly walk of our dog.  It was a particularly clear night and as we walked I was looking at Mars which was very clear and visible in the night sky.  At about 10:35 pm something caught my attention in the sky to the right of my view of Mars.  It was a flashing white light moving West to east, but it was so high up I thought it was a satelite (which can be seen from time to time on a clear night).  I stopped my wife so I can point the satelite out to her.  She finally focused in and saw the flashing light, however it wasn't the lights I was pointing to... she had discovered a second flashing light.  This one was stationary directly below our Mars view.  The first object was heading directly towards the second object.  The stationary object also had a red light underneath.  When the first object lined up directly over the stationary object the two then began to move.  The first object that had been going West to East now changed direction and moved in unison with the second object heading now in a south to north direction.  At that point I knew that this wasn't a satelite, because satelites don't make a 90 degree turn and change direction.  These objects were very high up in earths upper atmosphere.  We watched as these 2 objects moved northward and then in the distance we saw a third stationary object flashing...  and then a fourth.  The 2 new objects appeared to be stationary and the first 2 objects were heading directly towards them.  At this point we became very uneasy.  We tried to think of rational explanations to explain what we were seeing.  The first 2 objects now lined up with the 2 new objects and all 4 began to head nothwards.  It also became clear that the object my wife had spotted was substantially larger than the other 3 and it appeared by the flashing lights to be triangular with a red light underneathe.  The larger object also appeared to be riding point as it was slightly ahead of the others.  As th! ey began moving north the 3 other objects suddenly went black and only the larger object was visible.We debated that it might be some kind of Military project, however I doubt the military has anything that can hover in the upper atmosphere at a stand still, wait for the other objects to catch up and then proceed, and satelites certainly can't change direction or wait for other satelites to catch up to them and then move.  I consider ourselves to be a very normal American couple and not UFO enthusiasts.   We are rational people and we witnessed something that defies rational. If there was ever a doubt that there is something else out their we have now seen it with our own eyes.  My wife, a devout Christian, didn't want to see this.  It has been an upsetting encounter for her because it cannot be explained.  The entire encounter took approximately 10-15 minutes.",2003-09-24T00:00:00,28.519246697974758,-81.35409597886704

Edwards AFB call-forwarded the witness to NUFORC.    The witness reported that he had just opened a garage door at approximately between 11:00 a.m to noon., he thought, when his attention was immediately drawn to the sky by a humming or buzzing noise, which he at first thought was caused by an aircraft engine.  Very quickly, as he visually scanned the sky to locate the source of the sound, he spotted its apparent source, a peculiar looking luminous sphere, which looked somewhat like ""the head of a (straight) pin.""  It appeared to the witness to be self-luminous, rather than reflective, he thought, and the object was in the northern sky, moving slowly to the south, and executing a steady turn to the southwest.  Its apparent size he equated to noticably larger than that of a large star in the night sky.  As the witness watched the object, it completed its turn to the west, and it accelerated and disappeared from his sight over the mountain range to the west of Palmdale.  The witness spent several decades working in the aerospace industry, and in other technically oriented industries, as well.  He served in the U.

At 14:10 (EST) in Spartanburg, South Carolina, exiting a building, and looking almost exactly east, a plane was seen coursing across the sky.  Immediately after observing the contrail forming, the two observers saw 8 (eight) objects in the sky, appearing like stars (relatively the same size, but more metallic-silvery-shiney in appearance than a star at night) in the blue, daylight sky.  These objects had no apparent formation, but they were moving slowly. Almost 7 (seven) minutes into observing these objects, 6 (six) of the objects appeared to have a two-by-three formation:  two columns, three in each column, almost equidistant in space in relation to each other.  After roughly 10 (ten) minutes of observation, the 8, star-like objects could not be seen; it was as if they had slowly vanished from the observers' sight.  This is speculation:   We thought the objects we saw were parachutes for a while, but we deduced that, given the time we observed the objects, we would have seen them increase in size/get larger and more apparent.  However, the objects appeared to slowly decrease in size and then vanish over time.

I told him to go & get his video camera and film it. He had his wife (Maria) go and get it and they began filming it. It was north of Sacramento area over the city of Auburn, Ca. It was simply hovering not moving and was a good mile or so above the Auburn foothills. During the time they watched it two smaller UFOs came & docked with it and then left again. He was able to get the second smaller UFO on film as it left at a speed of hugh magnatute. It shot away so fast you almost miss it if you do not watch the film carefully. It turned colors at will but the camera did not capture the colors for some reason? After it had been there for approx 25 min or so it began shoting a beem of light or perhaps a lazer? down at my brothers home! the beam hit his neighbors roof then started torwards my brother and his two kids, when he told me that I told him to get them all inside and close the door and the curtains asap! Later that evening both my brother & I began making calls to the TV stations etc. This was what was so amazing--- nobody had reported it or called anywhere to report it! It was as if it were able to match their demesions or brain waves in such a way so that only they four saw it! The city of Sacramento is hugh as well as dozens of surounding suberbs and smaller towns all around and yet no-one saw this ufo or reported it! My brother mailed me the VHS tape of it and after watching it three or four times I looked online for a ufo center to send it to. It was Peter Gershwens (sic--Gersten)) UFO site. He emailed me after receiving the tape and viewing it to say it was a lousy filming job that only showed two dots one leaving the other. No thanks for sending it in no other questions nothing! Just a complaint that my brother did a lousy job of filming t! he sight ing. I was so angry that I ignored Peters email and told my brother if he ever saw another to just ignor it and don't even bother filming it since nobody seems to care. I am only sending this email because of something that I noticed when listening to a couple of sightings you had on Art Bells program this evening. That is-- the fact that in some sightings only a handful of people can see the UFOs! The hugh sighting over Phonix AZ. only a few saw why? I belive they have a way of aligning the dimesionial area they are in with the areas or perhaps brain rythims of those who are allowed to watch? You may be able to contact the other Peters UFO sight and get a copy of this sighting as I sent the original to him. Also accourding to christains the UFOs are belived to be the vehicles used by the angeles. Also as I have studied escatology for approx 15 years now I have found information from the now unsealed book of Daniel that the fallen angels along with Satan are to be cast down by Michael and the Lords angeles in the late spring or early summer of 2006. Please-- Simply note my information rather then erasing it because if it does occur it will serve as a witness of the fact that the Lords word in the Holy Bible is real and accurite. There are two other prophecys to note between now & 2006 first on July 5th of either 2004 or 2005 Terror such as the terror that occured on 911 will occur again, only it will be any type of terror attack on the US. And second the phophecy states ""missle 2004 N.Y."" It does not say if the missle blows up or not only that New York state or City will have some sort of nuclear missle or perhaps dirty bomb missle attack attempted.

We almost thought that it disspeared but then saw it flashing at the other end of the sky...By now, we were extremely excited and in shock.....It pulsed a little more, then slowly disapeared like it was fading backwards....then it was gone. About 5 seconds after that 2 fighter jets came roaring from the far side of the sky (it was loud and thunderous) and they circled the area twice before flying away....  and this was all on the night where there was supposed to be NO airplanes in the sky at all..and no aircraft allowed......so me and my 2 friends were completely amazed...  then next day we told everyone..and of course no one believed us....so i write here today to see if any other people in the southern philadelphia suburb area saw this or witnessed it too...i am completely serious about my report....or i wouldn't have taken the time to write this...cause i am an extremely busy person..., and it took me until now, to finally surf the net to try to find out if others had seen the same thing that night on 9/11/01",2004-01-22T00:00:00,39.99063505273804,-75.14580121369744

Up, left, down, right, and quite quickly. We became exited and nervous, trying to decide what it was. It was undoubtably moving towards us, but not directly (moving irratically). The object was making no noise. We all jumped off the car as it got closer. At this point it was probably still at least a mile or two away. Suddenly, we each noticed that it was changing shape. The upper light moved down towards the others, which spread themselves, and it was now moving in a linear motion, with the lights blinking, and it now undeniably resembled an airplane, sound and all. We were shocked and amazed at this transformation. None of us could deny its behavior before the change, nor expain it, before or after.

At about 2 hours into the trip, we were driving eastbound along Interstate Hwy 40 through Ludlow... just above the Twenty-Nine Palms Marine Base.  Around 03:06am, Our attention was drawn to a ""VERY BRIGHT, single amber colored Object"" (Pic#1)off to our left. I was amazed on the Brightness of this object, It was about a half a mile away at about 2 to 3 thousand feet. I quickly snapped a digital photo with a Sony 3.5mp digital cam but the flash went off, so my wife appears on the photo as a negative refection off the passenger window. What is surprising is even with the flash going off... you can still see the Brightness it had. So after that mistake, I quickly turned off the flash and took another about 10 to 13 seconds later... and what was once one object... appears to have split into two separate objects... (pic#2) What I had seen soon after was it disappearing at a 35 degree angle towards the north. We were not alone on the hwy... there was a truck who I KNOW saw it because he swerved like I did when the object appeared. I exited on ""Crucero rd"" and even saw three California Hwy Patrol Cars parked at the gas station where we had stopped to defragg what we just saw. I ""Stupidly"" said to one of the officers if they had seen the Object I seen ...using the term UFO. I was Laughed at and told Marines are using FLARES to light up the area during maneuvers... which could be true. But I Know what a Military Flare looks like in fight. No parachute, no smoke trail... and I never seen anything take off at a 35 degree angle at a speed from a dead stop.  So I have enclosed five Pics for evidence and my word as it Happened!

There was very little cloud cover and the sky was quite clear. There was a slight breeze, and cloud motion was generally from the north-east. I saw a jet plane pass quickly from north-west to south-east, leaving a con trail that passed through a wisp of cloud. The relatively slow speed of the object caught my attention. There was no exhaust and it's shape was round or globular - it was too small to be sure. There also appeared to be a very slight fluctuation in its brightness, as if it was rotating or wobbling. As I watched, it gradually slowed down until it was stationary. It remained in the clear sky for several minutes - I saw 3 other commercial jets fly by at different altitudes while I observed the object. It then began to drift very slowly to the west, and after a few minutes it stopping again. It was hard to determine size, but I think it appeared slightly smaller. Then it began slowly moving back towards the east, and over the next several minutes became a tiny bright dot. It was obviously rising as it was drifting. I began walking north, glancing upwards to see if it was still visible (it was), until I was nearly at Dundas.  I was convinced that I had seen a UFO. No plane or helicopter could have that shape or behave in the way this object had. Nor could a balloon have hovered or changed direction as the object had. The first object was still faintly visible when I noticed a bright red spherical object, about the same size and altitude, drifting in the same east-to-west direction. The appearance of this new object did not fluctuate, and it moved slowly and steadily without slowing or stopping. It looked like a balloon, almost making me doubt what I had seen before. Then I saw a low-flying jet pass quickly beneath and to the west of the red sphere, following a curved path from north-west to south-west. It was too low for a commercial jet, and it had the swept-back wings and twin fuselage engines of a fighter. It was also perfectly silent, and its underside had no markings and was painted so as to be almost invisible against the sky. Since all this took place over Spadina, I had a clear view. However, buildings prevented me from seeing where the plane came from or where it went, and I soon lost sight of the red sphere also.

The sighting occurred at Rend Lake State Park located south of Mt. Vernon, IL. The sighting involved 3 adult witnesses and one child. The principal adult witness offered testimony to MUFON investigators regarding the incident.  According to the witness, he and his wife and daughter along with their friend were attending July 4th festivities at Rend Lake State Park. They were located at the southern end of the North Marcum Recreation Area when they had their sighting.  All of the witnesses were looking up into the sky in the direction of the lake dam to the South. The witnesses along with an estimated 200+ other people were anticipating the final skydive jump for the day, which was to soon take place. As their attention was focused on the approaching plane used by the skydivers, the witnesses noticed two luminous white objects in the same general portion of the sky. The two objects seemed to be traveling together. They were described as being round to elliptical in shape. The apparent size was estimated to be similar to a golf ball at arm’s length. Actual size was estimated to be 11-30 feet. The objects reportedly moved in a straight line from the South/Southwest to the North/Northwest (and directly overhead) at a constant rate of speed that was estimated to be 500mph. The altitude of the objects was estimated to be 10,000 feet. However, the witnesses were not sure of this fact. No sound was heard and the objects left no trails. The witnesses all agreed that the objects were radiating a bright white light rather than simply reflecting sunlight. The color was described as ""intense white."" They watched the objects until they disappeared behind the trees on the Northern horizon. The witnesses thought they seemed to be flying in the direction of Mt. Vernon, IL where the witnesses reside. Sighting duration was estimated to be 2-3 minutes.  Despite all the other people that were present, the witnesses stated that no one else seemed to notice these objects. The witnesses even asked others if they had seen them after they flew out of sight. No one seemed to have seen the objects, since the witnesses said they received strange looks from those immediately around them when they asked. Weather conditions included clear sunny skies and wind speed averaging 9.5 mph out of the Southwest. This roughly corresponds with the direction of the mystery objects.  Upon completing an interview with the principal witness, investigators drove to the Jefferson County and Franklin County Sheriffs’ offices, since Rend Lake is in both of these counties. Inquiries were made to see if any calls were received by their offices concerning UFO sightings at that designated time and location. Both offices stated that no such calls were received. A trip was then made to Rend Lake to see if some of the Park Rangers had known of any other UFO sightings on that day. After circling the entire lake including every campsite for more than two hours, a single Park Ranger was never found. This search was abandoned and an attempt was later made to email the Rend Lake Recreational Office to see if it would be possible to contact the skydiving group that made the jump that day. No reference was made to UFOs in the email. It was hoped that perhaps the skydivers or the pilot might have witnessed the event as well. Unfortunately, the email never received a reply. Therefore, the report must stand on the sole testimony of the witness and his family.

What can cause so many residents in various communities from Kamloops through to the Okanagan and the Kootenays in British Columbia left scratching their heads, wondering what it was they all witnessed. Also many people became very frightened and ran into their homes. The answers to the questions I have been asked have been hard to come by, but we certainly know something extraordinary did take place on July 28, 2003 in the early morning hours.  The story begins with a family who was camping at St. Marys Lake, which is located approximately 12 miles east of Kimberley, British Columbia, Canada. Around 12:45 a.m. the husband and wife decided to do some star gazing as the children were asleep and the night was warm and the sky clear and full of stars. As the couple stood looking into the night sky they observed a very bright, white light heading in a southeasterly direction. The moon sized light was witnessed flying low over top Bootleg Mountain and across the lake and at times it's speed did vary. As it slowed, then picking up speed once again the witnesses watched the light zig zag slightly and at times it seemed to wobble until it was out of sight.  When they arrived back home from their camping trip they contacted the Kimberley RCMP detachment and spoke to a Cpl. Rod Carbonneau to enquire if others had reported seeing the object. Cpl. Rod Carbonneau said the detachment received no calls over this matter. The Cranbrook Airport was also contacted and asked if there were any aircraft in the area of the sighting .... but none were reported in the vicinity the object was observed. For the couple who watched this amazing sight on July 28, 2003 not many answers were fourth coming. A couple of area residents did telephone the folks who watched the event telling them what they also saw that night, and another did make a report to the local newspaper.  From A Few Witnesses To a Flood Of Calls:  A report was made to Peter Davenport at the NUFORC in Seattle, Washington and then the sighting report was forwarded on to me here at HBCC UFO Research (Houston, British Columbia) for a follow-up investigation. What I did not realize at this time was just how large this one case was going to be. From a handful of witnesses the case exploded  into a major event  where I currently have 157 eye witnesses to something very mysterious.  Two things happened in the early morning hours that Sunday, a large moon sized object was seen by many area residents, and what followed left many folks in communities such as Kamloops, Vernon, Kelowna, Kimberley, Cranbrook and as far as Jaffray, British Columbia scratching their heads wondering what it was they saw. A beam, or ray of white light was observed from Kamloops as far southeast as Jaffray, British Columbia. People who watched the strange and puzzling event said the white light looked as bright as a florescent tube and was arced from horizon to horizon as if one was viewing a rainbow. The beam of light sat almost stationary in this position for approximately an hour before dissipating. Almost everyone  who witnessed the beam of white light said they had never seen anything like this before. All said they have watched the northern lights many times, but they commented this was certainly not the northern lights.  A Few Of The Eye Witness Accounts - The Light/Object (July 28, 2003)  A gentleman from Cranbrook, B.C. telephoned me and reported that he and his family were sitting outside and were discussing how bad the forest fires are throughout the southern interior when one of the family members spotted what they thought was a airplane with it's landing lights on and heading in their direction. As the bright white light drew closer to them, the size was growing rapidly and so was the brightness of the light. Before they knew it, the light/object was upon them. The family was so frightened due to the immense size of the light/object being almost at the edge of their property that the children ran into the house screaming. The mother followed closely behind. The father followed his wife and kids into the home, but stopped to take one last glance at whatever it was, and watched it make a 90 degree turn to the south. When I spoke to the dad he told me that they heard not a sound coming from it.  Another report came from a lady who was with a group of people on their holiday at their cabin on one of the local Kimberley, B.C. lakes. She told me they were sitting outside on the deck when one of the guests pointed towards the northwest. Low over one of the mountains came a huge, extremely bright white light traveling slowly in a zig zag pattern heading to the southeast. As it got closer to the resort area, many people became uncomfortable due to how strange the object/light was acting. As it passed straight overhead not a sound was heard. Some of the folks who were there said it was like looking at a full moon on a clear night. It was that big.  Two men in a pick-up truck traveling north along the highway just south of Wycliffe spotted the large bright object flying south. As they watched the large light/object close in on their location they pulled the truck over to the side of the highway,  and jumped out of the vehicle to get a better look. Due to it being so low, so bright, and passing directly over top of them the light from the object lit up the highway and surrounding area. Both men stood frozen in their tracks and speechless. Both fellows said it moved quickly in a straight line and made no unusual maneuvers. Again no sound was heard which is remarkable due to how close it was to these men, and all the other witnesses.  The above is a small example of what folks saw that night. There are many more reports here of area residents reporting seeing the same thing.   A Few Of The Eye Witness Accounts - Beam Of Light (July 28, 2003)  One lady said what she saw was very strange, it didn't behave like the northern lights as she noted that the lights danced across the sky, or looked like a curtain of shimmering light. She wondered if the long dry hot weather may have something to do with what she was seeing. But her thoughts changed quickly as she watched the beam of light come from the northwest horizon and impaled itself on one of the local hills and that is where it ended, according to this witness.  A party of four witnesses were out for a few days on one of the areas lakes just outside of Kimberley, B.C. Everyone was having a good time talking and having a few spirits. One of the men who was sitting on a camping chair had just poured himself a drink, when he looked up and said to the rest of the people he was with, ""do you see what I am seeing""? Everyone replied, ""yes""! The man who asked the question was so surprised at what he was looking at, he poured his drink onto the ground and thought he'd had one to many that evening!   They all watched a beam of narrow bright white light run in an arc from horizon to horizon. First they wondered if it might have been a search light as it was so brigh but they soon ruled this out due to the miles and miles the light covered. Again all these witnesses said this event lasted for approximately one hour before it dissipated.  Some three weeks after people saw the beam of light on July 28, 2003, I had calls from Kelowna and Kimberley British Columbia reporting that the beam of light was back in the night sky. Two Kelowna residents stood on the patio with phone in hand reporting what it was they were seeing. The exact white beam of light sat stationary running from horizon to horizon and was extremely bright.  Four Kimberley residents stood outside watching the beam of light, they reported standing under a street lamp and even with brightness from the street light they could clearly see the beam of light sitting in the dark sky.  Conclusions:  There is no doubt that something very unusual took place on Sunday, July 28, 2003 in the wee hours that morning. What folks saw in all these communities seems to be a mystery. But I have tried to come up with some reasonable answers for all the questions everyone had for me.  Here is what I know:  157 witnesses watched an amazing event unfold on July 28, 2003  (early morning). Some observed the object and others observed the beam of light. (Exact numbers are broken down for how many saw the object or beam of light below. What I didn't say is how many saw both).  31 witnesses observed a huge, bright white low flying light/object. 126 witnesses observed the reported beam of bright white light.  The International Space Station passed over Kimberley, B.C., at 00:24 hrs. on July 27, 2003. A Fire Ball was observed flying in a southeasterly direction over the West Coast of Canada and the U.S. Most of the witnesses reported the light/object and beam of light running from the northwest to the southeast There would have been a lot of air traffic in some of these areas due to the fire fighting efforts to control the devastating forest fires which raged through some of these areas in the summer of 2003.  Our hearts go out to the people who were effected.  So, the questions that need an be answered are.... What was the strange, large, glowing bright object? Did the object cause the beam of light which sat stationary in the night sky for approximately an hour as the object traveled through the areas?  As for the object, this is certainly a mystery. After a lot of time speaking with witnesses, looking at data on astronomical events, checking on the flight paths, seeing if there were aircraft in these areas flying at the time of the sighting...... I have come up against a brick wall. I have not found any rational explanation for what people saw that night. Fireballs for example as far as I know do not make 90 degree turns to another direction. Also seeing that the object was so low, traveling rather slow in many of the reports and not making a sound. This again is certainly strange. Something else I found rather interesting, was the fact that reported sightings had dropped from my area here in the pacific northwest of British Columbia and reports of unusual crafts of every kind were now being seen and reported  by many people residing in the areas from Kamloops, the Okanagan straight through into the Kootenays. Almost every different shape, color and size have been reported to HBCC UFO Research. Did the over 800 forest fires attract visitors from above? I am sure we will never really know the answer to that question..... ?  The beam of white light ended up still being as baffling as the object. When reports started coming in I was sure what everyone was seeing was nothing more than the northern lights. But as the list of witnesses grew, and hearing their comments, I started wondering if there was a connection to these unknowns and the beam of white light. Out of the 126+ witnesses who observed the ray of light running across the night sky from horizon to horizon, only one report was filed saying they believed it to be nothing more than the northern lights. (which I report on below). Everyone else said they have never witnessed anything like in their lives. All said they have watched the northern lights on many occasions, and in their words ""this was not the northern lights"". A radio station host put a question on air to the people in the area, asking ""has anyone seen strange lights in the night sky?"" I was told reports flooded in over this beam of light, and how everyone was left not knowing what it was they saw.  To be fair to all sides, I placed below an email I received from a person who did have some knowledge in astronomy, weather phenomena and the northern lights. One thing I would like to point out, is that what the gentleman viewed was not on the day of this major event.  The email came from a gentleman who, on the evening of July 26, 2003 and morning of July 27, 2003, stated that a sailing regatta was held by the Kelowna Yacht Club. Although the event discussed in the report above took place in the early morning hours of July 28, 2003, I thought the  report below was important due to how close all of the events were to one another. Plus I want to give both sides on this case.   Mr. Brian Vike Director HBCC UFO Research  Dear Mr. Vike,  Re: July 27, 2003  On the evening of July 26, 2003 and morning of July 27, a sailing regatta was held by the Kelowna Yacht Club.  It was an overnight race north up Okanagan Lake centered on 50 degrees N. Latitude and 121.5 degrees west.  The race commenced near the yacht club and the course was to be north up Okanagan Lake to Whisky Island and then returning to the Kelowna Yacht Club.  The race was attended by perhaps 100 members of the KYC both as participants and safety patrol boats. I was one of the participants in this race in the 25 ft sailboat (name deleted by HBCC UFO Research) along with 2 other crew.  The race continued for the entire night of the 26th and almost all of the boats were back into the Kelowna Yacht Club by 10 am of the morning of the 27 of July.  The sky conditions for the night was perfectly clear and very calm without interference from the light of the moon or city lights.  After dusk a typical number of earth-orbiting satellites were observed.  Around 11:30 pm the first appearances of typical shifty northern lights were visible to the north and north-west and continued to be visible on and off until early morning light.  At the peak of the night's darkness, a stable and continuous band of light was present overhead from horizon to horizon in the East/West direction. I  estimate the apparent width of the band of light to be about 10 degrees at the azimuth. No indication of colour was observed in this band, nor did I observe any detail or shadowing effects. This band of light was, however, unusual in it's stability of form and linearity of line.  After this long and slow sailing event, some of the participants commented to me on the display of northern lights.  Nothing that I observed that evening could be attributed to paranormal activity.   The display of light was interesting but certainly not out of the ordinary compared to many other displays that I have observed in my interest of amateur astronomy.  On a side note, one of my duties was a weather observer/recorder in the Canadian arctic while on station on the Distant Early Warning Line in 1967 and 1968 and was privileged to observe many spectacular light shows at that time.  I am convinced that we observed nothing more or less than the Aurora Borealis and a few earth-bound satellites that night and I hope that my observations might shed some light on the matter.  Kind regards, (Senders name and boat name deleted by HBCC UFO Research).  What folks saw in the early morning hours on July 28, 2003 has left myself and a lot of other people in the UFO field without any solid answers to all of the questions. The one thing I know is that there was an event which took place that left so many residents and myself baffled. It would be nice to be able to supply answers for these mysteries, but all I am left with at this point is another unexplained case!  Also keep in mind that three days later two woman had a missing time experience in Kelowna, British Columbia and the green lights seen on this night were witnessed by others at different locations which backed up their incredible story. Their story can be read at: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/kelowna_missing_time.htm And please .. if you have any similar story to report.... regarding any missing time experience you may have encountered... I'd love to hear from you.  Relevant contact numbers and information can be found at the end of this page.  I would like to thank everyone who took the time to write or pick up the telephone to make a call reporting what it was they saw. All of this data is very helpful. I also would like to express my many thanks to the newspapers who ran an article on this event. The information provided readers with the relevant phone number, email address, fax number  etc.. and toll free number so that more of you hopefully will also make a report on anything strange you may have witnessed happening in the skies above.  At the end of the day, there are more questions and answers.  As time allows, I will be posting all of the reports I received over this case to my website.  Take good care.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  The light split into 4 lights which formed a square.,Sakinaw Lake,BC,2003-08-07T22:15:00,light,10 seconds ?,"Occurred : 8/7/2003 22:15  (Entered as : 08/7/03 22:15) Reported: 9/3/2003 2:42:55 AM 02:42 Posted: 9/4/2003 Location: Sakinaw Lake (Sunshine Coast) (Canada), BC Shape: Light Duration:10 seconds ?",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31174.html,"The light split into 4 lights which formed a square . Dear Brian Vike,  I too saw something strange in the sky, however this was the night of August 7th, 2003.  Here's my story:  My husband and I have a summer home at Sakinaw Lake which is on the Sunshine Coast in BC.  One of my favorite things to do at night is to star gaze from the middle of the lake.  The sky is so clear there compared to the city.  Anyways, on August 7th, I took my star gazing gear (blanket, pillow and flashlight) with me on my peddle boat and like usual snuggled down once I got to the middle of the lake.  I usually stay out for a couple of hours and watch the shooting stars before peddling back to our home.  On this night approximately 10:15 p.m. or so, I spotted what I thought was another shooting star.  It streaked across the sky heading southward then stopped.  I thought the shooting star might burn out, but it didn't.  Instead, the light split into 4 lights which formed a square (1 light in each corner).  One of the lights was brighter than the other 3; made me think it might be bigger than the others.  It stayed in the square formation for 2 to 5 seconds before  it changed forms again.  2 lights stayed in place while the other 2 lights moved slightly away, then stopped.  The 4 lights together looked like a rectangle and stayed this way for 1 to 2 seconds.  Then all of a sudden the 2 lights that moved to form the rectangle shot off northward, like parallel shooting stars, while the other 2 lights only separated slightly and remained stationary.  One of the 2 lights that remained was the bright one.  I was shocked and couldn't believe what I saw. I stayed there until 1:30 a.m. to see if the other 2 would come back.  Then I tried to memorize the location of the 2 remaining lights before heading in, but they looked like stars amongst so many other stars.  It was useless, so I peddled back home.  I told my husband and he suggested I look up UFO sightings on the internet.  There are so many skeptics and believe me I would have been one too, that I said I don't think I'll bother.  My husband printed a copy of your article for me to read and that's how I read about the other sighting on July 28th, 2003 and also why I'm emailing you.If you know or hear of any one else that saw what I did that night, please let me know.  I would appreciate any information you can provide.  Thank you!  Yours truly, (name & personal information deleted by HBCC UFO).  I would like to thank the witness for the report.

Object photographed with digital camera but not seen by the naked eye.,Ottawa,ON,2003-08-21T16:30:00,flash,seconds,"Occurred : 8/21/2003 16:30  (Entered as : 08/21/03 16:30) Reported: 9/1/2003 6:36:42 PM 18:36 Posted: 9/4/2003 Location: Ottawa (Canada), ON Shape: Flash Duration:seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31113.html,"Object photographed with digital camera but not seen by the naked eye. On the above date I went up on the roof of the apartment building we manage, it's a ten story building, to take some sample shots with a small digital camera we purchased from Radio Shack. The idea was to take a series of shots of the Ottawa skyline panning right to left, from East to North East, snapping the pictures in quick succession less than a second apart. The sun was behind me in the West and  high in the sky creating perfect lighting conditions for photography. It should be noted here that I saw absolutely no craft, bird, balloon, kite or anything that could explain what showed up on one of the pictures. When I got back downstairs to our apartment I downloaded the pictures to our computer and proceeded to go over them one by one. When I got to picture 31 there was a small blur in the center of the picture which appeared to be moving from south to north in the same direction as the pictures I was taking. I checked all of the other pictures in case it was a hair on the lens or some other such anomally and found nothing, all the pictures were crystal clear. This ""object"" appeared to be about two kilometers from my position and at an altitude of about one hundred and fifty feet, our building is about one hundred and ten feet high and it appeared to be slightly higher than my line of sight. What interests me is the fact that I didn't see it with my own eyes, secondly, that the pictures taken right before and immediately after, less than a second apart, on the same plane do not have the same image on them. I can only surmise that if this was indeed a UFO it had to be going so incredibly fast that the human eye would not be able to capture or register mentally the image but that the camera did. Given that it is not an expensive digital camera the resolving power is much less than that of a more expensive camera with more pixels. I have toyed with the picture with a ""picture publisher program"" but my best efforts couldn't resolve more than some sort of a flat, blurred, dark object. In conclusion, it sure looks real but who's to say for sure.",2003-09-04T00:00:00,45.3813825,-75.70850071428572

It was much too bright to be a star and remained COMPLETELY  stationary for 3 - 4 minutes.  It was extremely bright at its center.  A really strange thing was how the light from the object illuminated the clouds around it.  I noticed how a cloud below it was softly lit up (not glowing) as a light bulb might shine onto an object.  Then the light from the object slowly faded and the object then turned slowly toward the south and continued on.  The lights were similar in color to a planes running lights except the green was replaced by a blue flasher and the pattern was not consistent.  The lighting effect was as if the flashers circled the craft, as opposed to consistent flashers on airplanes.  The sun had completely vanished at this point and we were unable to determine what it was or the exact shape.

I watched the object continuously for about 15 minutes only leaving twice. Once to get my wife and the once to get binocculars. As it got nearer, the object appeared brighter (no doubt because of its proximity) and also other colors were evident. I waited too long to look at it with binocculars but when I did was suprised at the richness of the color. The ""front"" was a deep blue approaching violet. The center was a brilliant green and the back was a deep red. It was difficult to perceive any definite shape. There appeared to be at least a dozen lights within the colors but didn't appear to be the source of the color. It's important to note that the colors I saw didn't look like a reflection off of any kind of fusalage but rather appeared as a glow like one would observe from neon. The object made no noise, didn't change direction, speed or altitude. The lights didn't change in intensity nor did they blink.

I was up late and standing outside with my dog at 1:30am MDT, just enjoying the cool air and staring thoughtlessly towards the NE sky when over the tree-tops appeared 7 round, very dim pinkish-red lights in a V-shape (one light at the tip, and 3 down each side). The lights were consistent (not flashing).  At first I could barely see the strange lights which seemed to be heading almost straight towards me, but as it approached I could clearly see a large (150-200 foot wide) dark-colored triangle-shaped aircraft.  I estimate it passed about 500 feet to the south of me, no more than 500 to 800 feet altitude, and traveling SW at about 700 mph (estimate based upon roughly 3 miles covered in the mere 12-15 seconds that I observed it).  It did not deviate in either speed or direction.  I was within (no more than) 1000 feet as it passed just south of me and yet it was TOTALLY silent.  The ONLY visible lights were the 7 mentioned above, across the front leading edges.  There was none of the legally required (FAA and military) red and blue wing tip lights, nor flashing strobe lights.  Both the lights AND the aircraft were easy to see looking straight at it, yet would have been just as easily missed had I not been looking right at it as it approached.  I felt like this was intentional, as if to warn close conventional aircraft, but to be otherwise relatively unnoticed.  It was a dark, moonless night (moonset 5:37pm the evening before) yet at the mid-point of my viewing the dark-colored aircraft was quite distinguishable against the starlight... and against the glow of the city lights.  This aircraft was definitely not a B-2 Stealth or any traditional aircraft... TOTALLY silent... unusual shape and lights, and no aircraft that I'm aware of could possibly fly so fast, low, and yet completely SILENT.  At about 3am I called the FAA Regional Control Center in Longmont, CO, and talked with a very helpful and interested supervisor.  In addition to checking their records, he checked with DIA approach (Denver International Airport) as well as Seattle Regional Control Center:  There had been absolutely no military aircraft in the area all night, and no reports of anything out of the ordinary.  I’m sure that this craft was flying below radar.  At the suggestion of the FAA I reported the incident to the National Institute for Discovery Sciences (9-23-03) and now the National UFO Reporting Center (10-01-03).  I have never seen anything even remotely like this before and hope to learn more about what it was.  I’m not one to jump to conclusions, yet I immediately felt that the craft had to be non-terrestrial.  Even if I was to disregard the ""illegal"" lighting, we are clearly many, many years away from producing an aircraft with characteristics such as this.  This was an incredibly fantastic experience!

We looked through the binoculars at the ""star"", and realized it indeed DID have blinking lights on it - they were very clear to both the naked eye AND through the binoculars.

My wife and I were eating dinner at the Himalayian Inn restaurant, in a courtyard off the town square of Sonoma. All of the lights went out in the open-air courtyard and alley that is shared by several businesses, including an Irish pub restaurant. We would learn after dinner that the lights had gone out in the eastern half of the town. We never heard what happened or why.  It was about dusk when we had decided to eat dinner, choosing to sit outside because of the pleasant night.  We were in the middle of the main course when the lights went out.  The restaurant owner came out and we chatted for few minutes as I pointed out a couple constellations and Mars.  He went back inside to find candles and flashlights, while I sat down to finish my dinner.  Just after sitting down I saw a very bright light, similar in luminosity to the International Space Station [ISS], which I've seen on several previous occasions. The light was moving directly north, roughly parallel to the town square.  Because we were under a small veranda, I only caught glimpse of the bright light when it was at about a 60 degree angle.  It moved at a speed similar to ISS, but after about 2 seconds, its light suddenly dimmed and for the remainder of the sighting it gradually faded out of sight.  I commented to my wife about it, but she hadn't seen it. We were in Sonoma for the Michelin Challenge Bibendum as members of the invited press. I own a small refractor telescope and have frequently observed satellites with my naked eye, through binoculars and through the Richfield telescope. Had the object not suddenly faded in luminocity, I would have concluded it might have been the ISS, which will also exhibit similar behavior when it crosses into the earth's shadow. However, since this object was moving almost due north on an apparent track that would keep it in the sun's light, I suspect the drop in luminocity would be attributable to other factors.",2003-10-07T00:00:00,38.2433,-122.4602

Location : Sydney, M4 Motorway Westbound near Cumberland Highway Overpass. This is a zone of medium density housing near Parramatta. I cannot imagine anyone in the location who looking in the direction of this object not seeing it. We were in a car moving at 90kph in a straight line. The object was directly in front of us moving from right to left and perhaps 45 deg and away. We saw it for about 30 seconds as with smoothly cruised past. Opening the window we heard nothing out of the ordinary, no jet scream nor chopper thumps. The night was clear, no rain for weeks, no clouds in the sky. Temp was perhaps 9-12deg. Stars could easily be seen. I don't recall wether the moon was out.  Object Movement : Moving southwest. Approx 100-200m off ground. Travelling slowly and an airborne object, perhaps around 100-140kph. After it had passed to perhaps 1km south west of us it seemed we could only see a static red light(not flashing or any kind of strobe effect). Once we saw the red light we continued seeing it for another 40 seconds before we had passed it(on our left) and it was obscured behind the Motorway walls travelling south approx above the Cumberland Highway.  Description : Perhaps 3 Egg shapes locked in to a tight structure. no connecting structure was seen but they remain at a constant distance and in the same formation. We saw the bottom of this(these) object(s), so what we actually saw resembled the bottom fifth of an egg. Initially it looked exactly like three white helicopters in a very tight formation. The objects appeared lit from below by a weak light. There didn't appear to be anywhere the light was coming from. Not the ground and the was nothing beneath the object. While the object(s) was at it's closest we saw no lights flashing or static, just the three weakly lit egg surfaces. At no point did we see anything above the three surfaces. The three surfaces that we saw were equally sized, perhaps the 4-5m across each 6-7m long and perhaps 10m apart. This did NOT look like a commercial airliner from below, the closest object we could associate it with would be three large white helicopters in a dangerously perhaps impossibly tight formation, again no flashing lights you'd expect to see on aircraft.  My wife travels this route nightly at the same time, Mon-Fri. Never before has this appeared nor any following nights. There are no nearby airports. Helicopter reports of the Sydney Motorways\highways are seen in peak hour only(morning \ afternoon.) and generally fly 3-4 times higher than this object. Traffic on the roads at that time is sparse yet constant car \ 100m). There was no acidents or unusual traffic events. There would have been a number of cars facing this object as it passed before us. It looked extremely 'out of place' like seeing a jumbo 50m off the ground, very wrong in the context of the medium density built up residential area. My wife mad a comment that it looked like an object ""poking out of the bottom of a cloud"" or ""out of some fog"" to describe the way only a few slightly curved surfaces could be seen.

The three lights formed an equilateral triangular with two of the lights forming the base and the third light forming the peak.   They were white with a brightness approximately like headlights of an oncoming vehicle.  Based on nearby landmarks (e.g., edge of the lake, Interstate 40, etc.), it appeared that the lights were at least a mile away from our location, but it is impossible to estimate how far away they actually were.  To get an idea of how far apart the lights were from one another, if I had held a ruler with my arm extended toward the lights, I estimate that the distance between each light would have appeared to have been 2-3"" apart. The lights did not blink or move while we observed them.  We saw the lights for approximately 15 seconds before they instantly disappeared.  We could still see a few faint stars in that area of the sky but saw nothing at all that could possibly account for the three lights.

Also the area I live in is densely populated and some had to be looking up besides me. There was absolutly no sound that came from the craft either, which was very weird. The area I saw it in is also not a flight path for aircraft.  I work for a horticultural company on Mercer Island as supervisor to exterior installs.

The report was of 20+ objects circling one another in a funnel until they disappeared into the atmosphere.  Well, again today I was outside on the trampoline with my two sons. We like to watch the planes as they pass over from time to time. We saw am airliner coming south (toward Atlanta) leaving a condensation trail. As we watched it, a craft came out of the west heading east and passed over us. It was white and I was able to discern that it had no wings and was sort of half-moon shaped. What struck me was the speed of this object. In the 20 seconds I observed it went from one horizon to the other and out of sight. The airliner wasn't even over our heads by the time this thing was gone. It made no sound and left no trail.  I couldn't tell how high it was. It was a good distance up, but not as high as the airliner.  A couple of minutes later we saw a jet or two fly over. They were going faster than the airliner, but couldn't hold a candle to the speed the UFO displayed. They were also leaving condensation trails (not chem-trails).  Overall the speed, shape, silence, and no trail made this object stick out like a sore thumb to me. Again I was in no position to run inside the house and retrieve my video camera.

We have seen it only on very clear nights...it begins to appear around 17:00 and disappears at varying times.  We finally tried to view it through our binoculars and then the telescope...Our best picture, of the one closest to us, was captured on video tape about a week ago....Last night was the first clear night since the video was taken so we took a picture with my camera.  We also saw it land on the hill directly behind the house but it is not close enough to check it out.  We live in the country with a canyon behind our house.  They appear to move and disappear and then reappear later. The video tape show bright flashing lights of many colors and does appear to move just as we witnessed with our telescope.  The camera showed something completely different.  It showed two objects...one that looks like a giant spider but with only 4 legs and the bright light looks like it has a light field in front of it.

It was apparant to me and my roommate (who was driving) that it was not a star due to it's brightness.  At first we thought it was a standard civilian aircraft but there were no flashing lights and it was not moving.  As we drove closer we saw that it was clearly a floating object in the sky.  We got closer and we could clearly see the craft from the underside, it was a rounded triangular shape with three very distinct pure white lights forming from the center out to the points of the craft with one blinking red light between back two lights.  The lights had no halo as you would see on any other lights that we would know of, I could clearly see the edges of the craft beyond the lights.  It was close enough to the car that we had to strain our necks to get a good enough angle to look up at it.  The only point of reference that we had to the height that it was flying was a near by radio tower that had one light at the top. My best estimate for how high it was flying was anywhere from 50 to 300 feet above ground.  As soon as we passed the object we decided to pull the car over and see what was happening.  We got out of the car and no more than two second after we exited the vehicle we looked at the craft when it hovered for less than a second and sped away from a dead stop covering a span of many miles in a very short amount of time.  We were outside of the car for (our most generous estimate)no more than ten seconds when we got back in the car.  There were commercial aircraft in the area, most likely in approach to Des Moines.  The object caught up with one of the aircraft almost instantaneously then turned and headed away. My roommate informed me that he looked at the clock in his car before we stopped the vehicle and it read 10:30 p.m., when we got back in the car after ten seconds of being out of it we both looked at the clock! and it read 10:50 p.m.  My roommate is a college graduate currently looking into ((deleted)) schools and holding a supervisory position at a local ((deleted)).

I was at a stop light and looked up to the mountain area and thought i was wondering why the radio tower i saw looked slightly big. Now remember it was dark around this time. Then i realized that  it wasnt the radio tower that i usually see up on the mountain. It seemed like a triangular object floating. Ive had a great interest in UFO's for the past few years but i always knew that if i was ever to report an UFO to anyone that i wanted to make it under the most objective standards. I realized that it couldnt have been a helicopter since there wasnt a sound at all and the outlining shape seemed to be triangular. I do live around a military base called fort bliss and they sometimes fly helicopters but you will always hear them. There was no way it could have been a plane since the flight pattern taken by this object seemed to be straight for a little bit, seemed to have stayed a little stationary and then sort of zig-zagged. Iam not an expert on planes or helicopters but i usually see these things fly a straight path. I thought that this object could have been a blimp but it seemed too low for a blimp. I always have this notion that blimps are flown during day time. Anaways the lights emanating from this object werent too bright.

My head was facing south away from the den windows. What I remember happened exactly as it did 9 years ago (because I can't forget this moment).

It just made me focus more intently.But when I asked myself why I was focusing so intently at this light just outside the window, my position changed. Suddenly I felt as if someone had picked me up with a giant hand and placed me on my back resting on the sofa.This was performed in one swift motion. I was now facing north.I was completely conscious and realized that this was'nt a dream. Then I noticed what appeared to be a person in a white suit, wearing welders goggles.Then focusing more clearly I noticed that these goggles were fluctuating and changing shape from thick band to narrow band.I noticed it had three long fingers on each hand. It gave me the impression that it was puzzled with me because of its hand movements kept jockeying back and forth resting on the window it had made out of my ceiling and back to its face and then leaning on its long hand.It had no nose or mouth or ears. Suddenly this stopped when I said,""what the hell is that?""It got shocked and leaped up suddenly surprised like it was discovered.It stretched its long arm out to close the window.

It was a warm August night, (not sure though on the date, either 1993 or 94) and I was out on the front porch at home and I just happened to glance up and saw a very bright blinding light that was moving in my direction.  As I looked up it seemed to pick up speed and as the object moved overhead and to the side a bit, the light became an oval glowing white light and I noticed a smaller red glowing light on one side and a small green glowing light on the other.  The object whizzed by, arcing downward and disappearing from sight.  It made no sound at all.  It was very low, just above the tree-tops.  I saw no solid mass that the lights could have been attached to, as this sighting took place on a clear, dark, moonless night.  Total sighting lasted only about 2 seconds.  I was in absolute awe of what I had just seen.  I ran around back of the house to see if I could still see anything.  At that time I became overcome with fear.  I had read stories about men in black showing up at people's doorsteps after seeing a ufo and threatening them not to report such things.  With that in the back of my mind, I locked all the doors and told my parents about what I had just seen.  Nobody ever showed up at the door. Although all aircraft are equipped with white lights and a green light on one wingtip and a red light on the other wingtip, this UFO's lights were too dim and too large.  They were glowing, not shining, like aircraft lights do.  And all the lights were clustered together, unlike an aircraft's.  This was completely silent, moved way too fast, and low, to be an aircraft of any kind.  It was moving North.  This also happened to be around the time that Napa was plagued by unmarked black helicopter traffic for months. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Location: Eastern Kern County, near Ridgecrest, CA. Observer Coordinates: 35deg.,35min N Lat.; 117deg.,42min W Long. Vehicle Flight Path: Over undeveloped desert, managed by US Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  The time was late afternoon, about 1 hour before sunset, clear visibility. The day had been blustery - moderate wind, partial cloud cover. I was inside, sitting at my computer when gunshots from a wash about 1/4 mile away diverted my attention. I gazed out my 8'W x 4'H picture window to the south to see if I could see the shooters. My house borders undeveloped BLM desert land; the view is unobstructed except for some low-lying bushes in the foreground. The desert floor slopes gently upward on an alluvial fan for about 2/3 to 3/4 mile, backed by low hills known locally as the Rademachers; a topographical map of the area indicates the crest of the nearest peak is 1.1 mile distant and 430 feet higher in elevation than my vantage point inside my house.  I couldn't see the shooters, but after a few seconds my attention was drawn to a rapidly moving object at the right-hand-side of the window. My first thought in the first fraction of a second was that it was a bird. Quickly I realized it was not a bird, but rather some sort of aircraft. It followed a straight horizontal path - no flapping or deviation which would be typical of birds in flight. We do have soaring birds in this area, but this was obviously no soaring bird either. The object traveled from right to left (generally west to east) across my field of view defined by the window. It was low in altitude, staying below the crest of the hills at all times, so lower and closer to me than the 1.1 mile, 430 foot elevation peak mentioned earlier; but apparently near the base of the hills where they transition to the alluvial fan. So with the aid of the topo map I have been able to make a good estimate of the object's distance and elevation: I estimate it was 2/3 to 3/4 mile distant and no more than 100 - 200 feet above the terrain it was flying over.  It is unusual for an aircraft to be flying so low in that area - certainly in violation of FAA regulations.  Since I saw only a profile view at a distance, I can't say much about the appearance of the craft. My sense is it more closely resembled a small private plane than a military jet in size and profile. But it seemed thinner in profile than a private plane. My sense is there was a vertical stabilizer at the rear; I am not very sure of that. I can make a rough guess of the length of the craft. Its angular length was no less than 1/8"", no more than 1/4"" at arm's length (30""). At an estimated distance of 3/4 mile, this would be equivalent to 16.5 to 30 feet in length for the object or about 23 feet +/-7; at 2/3 mile the estimated object length would be about 21 feet +/-6.  Field of View: My view through the window can be determined quite accurately from the dimensions of the window and my vantage point. It is close to 36 degrees. Scaling this on the topo map yields a distance of about 2500 feet or just under half a mile that the object was in my field of view, assuming a nearly west-to-east flight path near the base of the hills.  Duration of the sighting: This is my worst data point. It was all over in a few seconds. But was it 4 seconds, was it 8? I guess 5 to 6 seconds from when I first noticed the moving object on the west end of my window until it reached the east end. Let us assume a time of 5.5 seconds in my field of view. For a 2500 foot flight path this results in an estimated speed of 455FPS or 310MPH for the craft.  After a short lapse (2 - 4 seconds?) I thought: ""I must get outside to see if I can see this thing continue its path."" I rushed out of the house to look toward the east (have timed it since - takes about 8 - 10 seconds). I saw no more evidence of the craft, nor was I aware of any aircraft noise in the vicinity. My biggest regret is that I didn't hurry over to see if the shooters had seen the craft. They were closer to it, and of course outside so could have heard sound during its passage. Sadly, I did not attempt to contact them.  Observer is a retired physicist, amateur astronomer and one-time private pilot. He is a long-time resident of the area and is well aquainted with the terrain over which the craft was observed to fly. Observer has 20-20 vision when wearing corrective lenses, was wearing glasses at time of sighting.   NOTE added 23 Sept. 2003: It wasn't until 16 Sept. 2003 while starting to document this sighting that I realized it has characteristics similar to a Tomahawk cruise missile; in other words, perhaps it was a Tomahawk at low altitude. Since the sighting occurred a short distance from the boundaries of the China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS), this may not be an unreasonable hypothesis. A web search revealed several unclassified press releases of Tomahawk flight tests which have terminated at China Lake, but none were found for any time in February 2000.",2003-09-28T00:00:00,35.5542828125,-117.6764125

It was situated on a nice, high hill, with a beautiful view of rural PA and a very dark western sky.  I was a hobbyist stargazer growing up in such a nice dark sky, so I have a rudimentary knowledge of sky measurement.  I occasionally liked to look out my window and stargaze for a bit before going to bed.  Around 11 pm or so one night, I happened to look out and notice an odd sight:  5 or 6 bright amber lights, ranged widely-spaced line on a rising angle of perhaps 15-20 degrees to the horizon.  The lowest, most southern light was perhaps one fingerwidth from the horizon, while the highest northern one was about three fingerwidths.  The lights were all sort of.. drifting in their line, upwards and northern slowly in their line.  Then, the most northern light suddenly speeded up and faded off into apparent nothingness.  The rest of the lights continued to move along the path, until the second light was in the position of where the first had been.  A new light then faded in in the southern end, apparently slowing down from come speed, and took the hindmost position.  I watched this, and another shifting, for perhaps five minutes, then went down the hall and knocked on my parents' door.  They called my brother, and all four of us watched this for another five or ten minutes or so out of their large bedroom window.  I went and got my pair of binoculars to try and see if there were any other identifying lights on the objects.  I could see none, but I noticed either some sort of odd fuzziness or atmospheric distortion, as if they were at least a good few miles away.  My parents got bored and shooed my brother and I out of the room.  So I went back to my own room and watched the 'scene' for another few minutes, the objects rotating in their line another two times, until all of the lights sped up and faded out of view from their then-present positions, and not returning.  Between the first sighting in '01, and when we moved in spring '03, I've seen the same objects doing various boring things (cruising slowly just over the horizon and fading in and out, speeding up etc, singly and in pairs) four or five times.  I'd grown a bit used to it, but the memory still sends my hackles up, as they say. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-09-28T00:00:00,39.785,-75.6823

There was still one UFO on the desert ground.  Then the one on the ground followed the other two up in the desert sky.  The 3 (or 4 couldn't really tell) formed a pyramid formation and were each a different color.  One was green, one was yellow and the other was red (or orange couldnt really tell).  Then about 1-2 minutes later they all formed 1 UFO and the colors changed from all those colors to just a spectacular white color.  Right after that they took off really, really fast.

On January 28th, 2004 my wife and I were driving west on Delaware Turnpike, a main road crossing Albany county from east to west and ending in adjacent Schoharie county, where we live.  We were on our way home from an evening church meeting in Delmar, NY, a western and well to do suburb of the state capital, Albany.  It was about 8:45 PM when we left the church.  Once you pass the high school on the outskirts of Delmar, the drive home quickly becomes rural in nature with only five small villages and a few clusterings of homes encountered for the next 30 miles. Our area had received 5"" of snow that morning with flurries still coming down out of a completely overcast sky.   Traffic was unusually sparse because of poor road conditions: slick road surface, drifting snow, etc.  It was dark and it was cold, about 10º F.   We were between Unionville and Clarksville, the first and second of the hamlets along our way, when we noticed two bright lights in the sky ahead and just a little to the right of us.  I first assumed I was watching the approach of a commercial plane that had just penetrated the cloud layer and whose lights were at each wingtip.  But the lights, very white, were also very bright I thought, and steady, they did not blink.  It really gave me the impression of a car approaching with its high beams on.  We continued to drive a minute or two more and I began to see a third light beneath and between the others.  This light was noticeably dimmer than the others and I could just make out the reflected upward curving underside of whatever it was.  But it obviously wasn't a commercial airplane if I could see the underbelly.  It was at this point I started working furiously to come up with a rational explanation for what I was seeing.  My next thought was that it must be a small civilian aircraft.  But what were they doing up in weather like this?  Lost?  Scared?  Not confident enough to trust their instrumentation and dropped below cloud cover to feel their way home?  At this point al! so I sta rted wondering when this airplane was going to pass us.  It never did.  New thought, it must be a helicopter.  All three lights now appeared to be the same bright intensity and from my perspective formed a triangle pattern.  I had to pay attention to my driving as well as watch the object and was desperately trying to judge scale and distance but in the near total darkness the effort was futile.  I could not get a handle on it.  All I could see were three white lights without the ability to tell how big the object might be or how far away.    And then things got interesting.  As I continued to drive the object appeared to move till it was directly off my left shoulder.  My mind was reeling with the effort to rationally identify this thing so I stopped the car in the middle of the road.  The object wasn't moving.  It hung perfectly stationary above the tree line and over a house whose occupants were either away or asleep.  I hadn't been able to see any structure to the object for a few minutes now, and I made one last stab at rational explanation.  I assumed the home owners must have had a ham radio tower in their backyard and had put up some Christmas lights that hadn't come down yet.  I also concluded that these lights had never moved at all; that our forward motion on the highway had only caused it to appear as if something was approaching us.  I told my wife this, but she said excitedly ""roll the window down!"", which I did.  Our radio was not on in the car and there was no sound from outside the vehicle.  I began to feel comfortable with my last diagnosis.  Then she exclaimed, ""I'm getting out"" and she abruptly and precipitously exited the vehicle.  I felt concerned for her on a road with traffic that travels 50 mph but no one was coming behind or before, so I made a left hand turn into the dark driveway of the house with the Christmas lights.  I pulled ahead till I could clearly see the lights and just sat and watched for a moment or two.  I must admit, I was totally unnerved when all of a sudden the triangle of white lights suddenly drifted off to the east.  Every normal explanation I could think of vanished in an instant.  My first impressions were solidly confirmed; there was something different, unusual, odd, about this whole experience right from the get go.  The object/lights meandered unhurriedly away, my wife got back in the car, and we continued our drive home.  (Let me add that the area this took place is at least 30 miles from any airport and we have no military installations.  Furthermore we have been making this trip twice a! week fo r 13 years and have never seen any commercial aircraft, helicopters, dirigibles or piper cubs low in the sky over Clarksville or anywhere else along our route, ever.  Albany airport is approached from the south and north along the Hudson river many miles away.)      At no time had I entertained any sense of danger, but rather adventure.  My only regret about this episode is that I didn't try to follow the object.  In hindsight that was foolish, but my wife and I were still a little scrambled inside, still trying to make sense of what we had seen.   I had long thought that interest in the subject of UFO's had pretty well died out after it's popularity in the 1970's.  Close Encounters of the Third Kind was one of the best movies ever made for the genre, but that's where UFO's were supposed to be found and should only be found, the movies.  And maybe California.  UFO's and earthquakes are both found in abundance in California, so I understand, we certainly don't have them in New York.  Two days after the incident I felt very strange about contacting your site after doing a search for ""ufo sightings"" on the internet, but there is such a desire to tell someone.  I was amazed at the sheer volume of sightings your website records, and interested at how many of the anecdotal notes have similarities to ours.    My wife and I are both 50 years of age and at the end of a long, happy process raising two good boys and seeing them graduate from college.  I work as a Supervisor of buildings and grounds for the Schenectady ARC (Association for Retarded Citizens).  My wife is a talented Special Ed elementary school teacher in the village of Schoharie where we live.  Her parents are both teachers as well, her father having taught at the University level for many years.  I don't wear glasses (except for reading), my wife does. Neither of us are on any medications.  We do not drink or do drugs, we do not read UFO literature and we do not dream of flying saucers.    My wife will write her own account of what transpired independently of mine, and I will not show her what I've written above until she does.  However, I need to end this by stating that a wife's desires are not always to be heeded, and that it's not always a good idea to pay too much attention to what a woman wants.  On the way to church that night the country roads were in such a snowbound condition she asked if we could take the Thruway home instead, a particularly unusual request for her.  Like most good husbands I would have been happy enough to oblige, it didn't matter to me either way really.  But after church I began our trip home the usual route, and nothing more was said.  Would you all agree, she owes me? ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and he impressed us with his objectivity and sober-minded demeanor.

About 3:45AM one morning I was awakened to a noise coming from my three-year-old son's room.  Eventhough there was a rain and electrical storm outside I could hear this noise, like a clicking sound with some occasional high-pitched  gurgling.  Concerned that my son might be having some breathing problems I sat up in bed and directed my attention to the hallway where his door was.  It startled me that his door was closed, as we had never closed his door in the past.  Again I heard the noise and even though I tried for a brief moment to wake my wife I could not rouse her.  Again and again I heard the noise and was quite terrified that someone possibly was in my son's room.  I quickly gathered my courage and went to my closet for my S&W 45 caliber semi-automatic pistol.  I chambered a round and moved to my son's door putting my ear against the door.  Again I heard the sounds and burst into the room.  What I saw next will never leave me... something I think about several times every day since then.  The way my son's room was laid out was my son's little bed was to the left of the open door and a window was directly ahead.  Eventhough the light was off, a moment after I burst in I looked directly into my son's bed as lightening illuminated the room. I could see my son setting up in bed facing a small alien creature as if they were playing or something.  Simultaneously I realized the window was open, the screen was off and there was a larger alien creature somehow hovering just outside the window.  The rain was pouring into the open window and I have learned since then that the best way I could describe the creature is that it was a ""Grey"".  I was petrified and could not move.  I could tell by it's movements that I startled the alien outside the window as much as it startled me.  The next thing I know, I am laying on the floor looking up at the lightening painting the ceiling and realized that my entire backside is soaking wet, the window open, it was not raining and my son was sound asleep in his little bed. ! Later I found my 45 laying in the center of the dinning room table with the magazine removed and one bullet (the chambered round) missing.  I have not been able to reconcile this event to this date.  The window was certainly open, the screen on the ground two floors below (we lived on the second floor) and the carpet was soaked.  In addition, the missing bullet was never found.  I don't know how long I was out or why I was out but it could not have been more that a couple hours.  I know this was a Grey who, for some reason, was letting it's child play with mine.  I will never be the same.  Before this I thought folks who saw UFOs were quacks. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report indicates no date for the event, and elects to remain totally anonymous.

There would have been at 30 or mor people there between various relatives and neighbors. I was off in the corner of the yard talking with my younger brother and one of my male cousins when I had this eerie feeling come over me. I looked around and didn't see anything, then I looked up and directly over my brother cousin and I was this flying saucer that looked just like the one on the tv show ""Lost In Space"". I said to everyone there ""hey look everyone there's a flying saucer over us"". Nobody seemed to care. They just went on socializing. Nobody panicked. I kept talking with my cousin and my brother in the corner of the yard constantly looking up to see what the craft was doing and seeing if it was still over us. I was facinated by this craft. While watching it it almost looked like a window opened up just like the way the window would open up on the tv show. It looked like the window glided from right to left. It continued hovering over us for quite a while. I have to admit that I was starting to get a little nervous. Then my mom an aunt and a neighbor decided to walk back home by going around the block so I decided to go with them. The saucer started to follow us. It stayed with my mom my aunt my neighbor and I till we got to our house 5 minutes away from the party. I went in my house and came out the back door to see if it was still there. It was . Hovering right over our house. So I went back in the house and came out the front door and looked to see if it was still there and it was. So I said to my mom and aunt that its still here. They still didn't care. I went in and out of my house about 4 times like this when the last time I came out in the back yard it took oo straight up in the air at the speed of light without making a sound. I remember asking my brother and cousin if they remembered seeing the saucer and they both said no. I asked my mom also years later if she remembered seeing the saucer and she also said no. ! I also saw a space craft that looked just like the ""Us Eneterprise"". I was 15 years old and it was prabably the end of January early February. The temperature was about minus 10 to minus 20 below farenheight. I was delivering my papers as I had a paper route at night that started about 16:00 to 18:00. It was a real clear night. There was a full moon out as well as stars in all direction. I was probably 2/3s done of my route when I started up the highway out of South Lancaster heading west to do the 5 houses out that way. I remembered getting this weird feeling that something wasn't right. I couldn't put my finger on it at the time. Then I realized that I wasn't hearing any traffic. The traffic on the 401 carries quite far on a clear crisp night. As I started to cross the stell frame bridge over the Raisin River I kept looking all around me. Something wasn't right. Ilooked up into the sky and didn't see anything. I looked up and down the road. I looked to the north and didn't see anything. Then I looked south and seeming to be just above the tree tops gliding silently and on the edge of the St lawrence River is this huge crimsom red space ship exactly like the ""Us Enterprise"". Now I have to say that I was trying to convince myself that I really wasn't seeing it but there it was bigger than a jumbo jet. I tried to get my papers delivered quickly to try and follow it but it was soon out of my sight. When I couldn't see it anymore the sounds of the traffic could be heard. Cars came up and down the road. Prior that incident there wasn't a car to be found other than the ones on the 401 to the north of me. Again I told my parents but like I suspected the usual reaction was your seeing things. I said yes I saw a huge space ship just like the ""Us Enterprise"". I mean right down to the two potoons and huge light in the middle of the ship. I mean this was the spittin image only it was red. I was absolutly in awe. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There was the beacon and there was another, brighter light just behind and to the side of the beacon light.

I pulled to the side of the road and got out and stood by the side of the road looking at the craft.  It was just above the level of the trees, about 60 feet off the ground and it was less than 100 yards away.  I was saucer/ elliptically shaped, with bright white and other colored lights around it and underneath it.  It was making absolutely no sound.  It was about 100-200 feet in diameter.  As I was watching another vehicle drove by on the road which did not stop.  I would guess the object hadaa height of about 20-30 feet.  After watching it for about 1-2 minutes, I glanced down the road to see if another vehicle was coming so that I could possibly stop the vehicle and get a witness (no vehicle was coming)  My head was only turned for one or two seconds.  When I returned my gaze to the area of the UFO, it was gone.  I t never made a sound and when it left it must have left quite quickly and it MUST have known I was watching it, so I am under the impression that it waited until my gaze was averted before it left.

Hovering , moving fast and seemingly just flying around ...read on Two of my oldest friends and I were headed up a what was at that time a country road with a cow farm and corn fields.  There was a bright light in the sky straight in front of us but at least a mile and a half away.  As we approached it was apperent that the object was hovering over the treeline on the side of the road.  We stopped and I stuck my head out the window and heard a low pulsating humm and saw an array of lights that was in the pattern of a small green center x and four white lights going away from the points of the x and four red circular lights at the end of those.  It hovered for maybe five seconds and gradually increased speed and proceeded west.  We chased it about ten miles and noticed lots of activity in the air. We intersected the path of another craft. This one had no lights but it was noisy with traffic so I couldn't hear if it had the same humm.  We immediately wanted to go pick up another friend of ours(to bad he didn't have a video camera) to prove to ourselves we are seeing what were seeing.  After picking him up we went to the golf course because it's dark and quiet.  We observed at the hight at least twenty craft all at about seemingly the same altitude and heard not one airplane engine. It lasted from 10pm to 330am.  This night was one of those unusually dark nights , no moon , no clouds just dark and cold.  We were living within fifteen or so miles from fort dix/maguire air force base so we have heard military aircraft.  The other interesting thing is the first encounter was within two miles of an aegis radar station among the cow farm and corn stalks. Right on the corner it looked like the top of a battleship so if you are from the area you would know where i'm talking about.  The other odd thing was it was the day of the deadline for the first gulf war and we had heard all the military had to offer leaving from the base. I actually called the police when I got home and asked if anyone had reported seeing lights in the sky and he kind of snickered and said n! o.

I was driving home on a semi-desolate county road with a co-worker.  She was sitting in the passenger's seat.  We both were gov't workers at the time working the evening shift at the local VA hospital. She was an RN and I was a CNA.  At 12:30AM, she looked out her window and saw what she thought was the moon and said it was very low and bright that night.  I looked out her window and saw that it was moving through the trees and over the tops of the occasion house or two.  We were heading east on the road.  A couple of minutes later, it moved to my side of the car and was only about 100 yards from the road.  It was keeping pace with us.  When we came upon an open field, I decided to stop and get out to investigate what this thing might be.  So I got out of the car and this sphere just hovered above the field.  Again, it was about 100 yards away from me and about 200 yards above the ground.  My passenger elected to remain in the car.  It looked to be 3x the size of a basketball from the distance where I stood.  No noise, no sound, no trail,no pulsing lights....just a bright white light that seemed to steadily emanate from within the craft.  After a minute or two, I walked toward the thing and it moved away.  I slowly walked backward toward my car again and it came forward again.  I did this a few times and realized this was no weather balloon or any type of natural phenomenon.  I finally asked out loud, ""Who are you?""  It then grew brighter and my car stalled and the radio began flipping through all the stations rapidly before everything finally quit on the car altogether.  After what I thought was 10 minutes, I got back in the car to start it up and it wouldn't start.  Then, everything came back on again and I turned the key and we were out of there in a shot!  But the craft remained behind my car and it was in view of my rear-view mirror, but it traveled over the road this time.  We were doing 80 mph for several miles until it disappeared.  When I dr! opped off my passenger and got back to my house, the clock in the car read 12:50AM as did my watch.  But, upon entering my home, I looked at the clock in my livingroom, it read 2:55AM as did the other clocks in the house.  I called my co-worker at her house and asked her to look at her watch and then the clocks in her house.  She, too, became scared and we both wondered what happened to the 2 hours that were missing from what should've been only a 40 minute drive.  As it turned out, many people in the area saw this thing.  2 of my brothers saw it and they lived in 2 seperate towns.  One in Victor, NY and the other in Ithaca, NY.  Apparently this thing had been seen all around the Fingerlakes region for most of that evening.  Most of my other co-workers also saw this thing as they drove home too.  My passenger no longer remembers this incident, but I do!  It still remains a mystery as to what happened to those 2 missing hours.  I had another sighting 3 and 1/2 years later on this same road, which I will post in a seperate message.  By the way, I now live in SW Florida.",2003-09-17T00:00:00,42.832600000000006,-77.3096

While hunting in a very remote area of south Texas in a deer blind about 12 feet above the ground I noticed a circular light to my left in the late afternoon. I looked toward it very briefly as I was preparing to come down from the blind. In my mind I registered the light as the rising moon but then I thought to myself that the object was too big to be the moon, even if it was low in the sky. When I turned my head to look at the object again it was gone. I saw this light for a mere second or two.  About fifteen minutes later my four buddies came for me in a pick-up truck. As we were looking at a wild boar that someone had shot I looked at the night sky and saw a very large array of white lights in a horizontal line low over the horizon that seemed to be at least a few miles away. The lights emitted no sound whatsoever. For this UFO to look so large to us and seem to be so far away seemed impossible. I can only describe it as being some type of mother ship and in fact reminded me of an aircraft carrier just floating over the horizon. All of us saw this object and were telling each other ""What the hell is that?"" As we watched this UFO for about a minute the lights would change from white to yellow. And they would turn off and on again each time in a different sequence and in alternating groups. Five on, two off, three on, all off, etc. Then suddenly a fog or smoke cloud appeared over the lights and they all went off. About four seconds later the same lights appeared much higher in the sky almost at forty five degrees to the horizon. Prior the lights were just above the horizon. It would seem impossible for such a large object to rise that high that fast. We all mentioned to each other in amazement how that could have happened. Within a few seconds the lights went completely off and it was gone.  After a short time (about five minutes) we were on our way out of the ranch and heading to the highway. I kept looking at the sky hoping to see that ship again when suddenly I saw another smaller craft high overhead turning in a wide circle to my left. I could distinctly see the back of it and saw a diamond shaped light with lights inside of it that were in a horizontal line and turning on and off in sequence toward the center. This UFO was being chased by two military fighters! This was very easy to see in the night sky and I looked at this with binoculars. All my buddies saw this also. We just kept driving and I kept watching this awesome display until they faded out of sight. The jet fighters lingered in the area for a while circling in CAP (combat air patrol).

As we approached the craft, my friend rolled back the sunroof on his car and slowed down to about 10 mph. We went right under the belly of this craft.  It was rectangular in shape and the nose of the craft was only half as wide as the tail end.  It had 6 red lights on each of the 2 long sides of the craft and it had a very bright white light on the underside of the nose of the craft. My friend asked me what it was.  I told him that no aircraft can fly so slowly and not leave a trail or make no noise and that it must be a UFO.  It was the size of 2 football fields.  And both sides extended well beyond the sides of the road in width.  It was huge!!  The craft was a shiny, black, metallic color.  There were no identifying numbers on the underside as there would normally be on most aircraft.  After we got out from under it, we sped off for home in record time.

At around 1814 I was out on my balcony smoking with my wife and was looking at the night sky as I always do when ever I go out. I happen to look over in the area across from my apartment towards the stadium, and noticed what seemed like a bright landing light on an airplane over the horizon. At first I thought it was just that because it was not moving really fast or turning rather just sitting in one place. Then as I am watching this light waiting to see it turn for the glide slope for it's FAP into SD Airport another light came up from below the horizon at least from what I could see to be the horizon with a building in my view. Anyway another light came up same color and size as the one I am watching, and moved along side of the first light. These lights were a dull yellowish color not blinking or turning other colors. So with the two lights now side by side, the first one moved up and away towards the 2 o'clock position at about 1,000 feet agl, and not fast at all. It was kind of like a bump and go method the second light just stayed where the first object was while the first object moved across the horizon. Now I did not and could not see any visible beacon lights on any of the objects and was to far away to hear sounds of engines, but they were perfect in size and remained a constant dull yellow color. With the 1st object now moving away and the 2nd hovering in place, a third light of the same two I am watching moves to within about 25feet of the 2nd light and begins to hover along side. There were other IA flying all around the area some on FAP and others going to and from the costal area, but none towards these objects. I being foolish in my thinking said to myslef in my mind, I can see you and I know you are there and then I got freaked out.

The sky was clear after sunset. It hovered and sparkled. A red sphere flashed by going south. My neighbor came out on his balcony for a cigarette. The white light hovered. When he went in it started it's  vertical decent. It went down very slowly a bit at a time until it disappeared in the trees, at 500 p.m.  It is difficult to describe the light. In the binoculars it has strobing red and other colours but white is the predominant one. It is white hot like a sparkler and hard to tell size or shape. I find it hard to believe that no one else has reported this as it is predominant in the sw sky and by the airport. It went down just before a jet landed. There is a population density around the airport and surrounding hills, and again I can't be the only one who sees this.  The behavior of the light suggests that some people at a glance would view it as a star or a one spotlight plane on approach. It makes no sudden moves, as it moves in increments. This is a wonder-full event, lasting 20 minutes, from when I start viewing it.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

Just after 9:30pm on 10/25/03 I was standing out on the 2nd floor balcony of my girlfriend's apartment smoking a cigarette and looking out towards the southwest at the stars.  I suddenly noticed the stars disappear momentarily which then transferred my vision on to what caused the effect - a completely dark triangular craft with two or three unblinking red lights, very small lights, on the top of it.  I immediately thought it was an airplane as Jefferson County Airport is only 5-6 miles away, but it was *completely* silent.  It was maybe 3 blocks away from me at an altitude of about 500 feet and traveling no more than 60mph or so.  I'd estimate it's size at about 3 times that of a standard F16 fighter.  It was most definitely not a stealth fighter or a B2  bomber; I'm familiar with military and civilian aircraft and this fit none of the profiles.   Once I was able to track it with my vision I followed it's path, which was south, and was able to see three dim white lights at each corner of the triangle.  Also at this time, I was able to see the ""rear"" end of the craft which exhibited 3 or 4 (was hard to tell) circular, amber-colored (or glowing amber, I'm not sure) lights.  (I'll email drawing)  Finally, as the craft got farther away and was ready to pass out of sight into some low clouds, I heard a single, very short and very faint ""whump"" sound...almost impossible to hear, it was extremely faint and was the only sound I heard during the entire sighting.  I'd estimate the distance at the time of the sound was about 1/2 mile from my location.  If I'd not been watching the craft at the time I never would have noticed it.

Ever since my report June 21st of this year I find myself watching the sky almost nightly. Me and my girlfriend were staying at a small lake cabin that a co-worker is letting us use while he is out of town. This is about 15 miles west of Omaha. We had taken an air mattress to the dock and laid back so I could watch a star filled sky like no other as you can imagine)(12am).  Not alot except for meteors, satallites and the I think I saw somethings that you aren't sure if you did or didn't see it.  By 3:30am she was asleep and I was just staring into the East Northeast direction approximately 30 dgrees down from the straight above position.  In a split second I witnessed a large busrt of yellow light in a perfect circular shape looking to be 3"" diameter from my point of view. This was definately out in space outer earth atmosphere or further. 1 Second later immediately below & to the right of where this occurred I saw a white flash of light about the size of what the International Space Station looks like going overhead. I sat up saying ""what the **** was that?!""  I startled her out of her sleep and she asked ""what?"" I told her to turn and look - I had seen the small white flash again only this time it was 45 dgrees to the right of its original postion. Both times it had flashed on for approximately 1 sec.  As she became more awake I pointed to the area that the light would hopefully show again. Of course it didn't.  This was the most spectacular thing I have ever witnessed - better than my June 21st sighting.  I would love to be hypnotized and taken back to the 24th burst of light and have the description of what I see recorded.  If it was a star exploding which I doubt is there any place I can inquire that would know.  I truely beleave that what I witnessed was the burst of an alien craft coming out of light speed or thru a worm hole or teleportation burst of some sort.  I am not nuts and could not beleave what I saw.  I know others had to see this... p! lease help explain what I saw and are there any other reports -EVER - that report the same burst - size - perfect circular shape - no after effect illumination or glow - I have not reported this to anyone...after all I wouldnt blame you if even you didnt beleave me...It does sound far fetched but it is the truth & like I said before - hynotized me.",2003-08-28T00:00:00,,

The color was that of a lit tail light lens, but not bright as if brakes were applied. This completely circular object, about 6"" in diameter, flew straight for the short duration that we saw it. Sighting was lost as it entered the trees. This was not a flash of light bouncing off an object and again, no other vehicles were within sight.

I reached over to get my digital camera on the seat and kept my eyes on it at all times. Right as I was getting ready to take a picture of it, the craft shot off towards the west at incredible speed. Then 2 hours later I left PB and headed south to Lake Worth Pier to see how the Isabelle swell was hitting there. Right as I was setting up my camera to tape the surfing, I noticed the same craft in the southeastern sky at around 3000 ft up. The craft seemed to notice me when I noticed it and slowly turned away from me showing the rear or front of the craft. It then slowly faded to a small point and was gone in an instant. You'd think with all the people on the beach someone else would have seen it but nobody saw anything most likely because the surf was keeping their attention. The strangest thing about both encounters was the fact that it seemed to know it had been noticed and sped away both times before I could get my camera ready. It almost seems as if they were watching the surfers or the swells coming in at our local beaches. Craft was roughly the size of a commecial airliner in length, and was obviously metallic because of the glint the sun shone off of it. No wings just a smooth cigar shaped object.

My daughter and I were driving in my car headed east on English Road just about 200 meters from Winstead Ave. as we experienced a strange phenomenon.  My daughter is a very rational and academically gifted 16 year old high school student. I am a physician.  I have been in practice for 20 years since completion of training.  I also have a strong background in abstract and applied mathematics and physics and I have actively maintained and advanced my scientific side.  Rocky Mount was engaged by Hurricane Isabel at that time as we had ventured out on the road.  Suddenly, a low frequency, low intensity  hum vibrated the car and though I ducked my head down reflexively, an intense but very transient flash of green light enveloped the car. My daughter asked, ""What was that?"" I suggested it was possibly ball lightening but I am not sure.  There was moderate rain and wind at the moment and the road condition was wet but not flooded.  The sky was overcast with a thick, dark gray and relatively low blanket of rain clouds as one would expect of a hurricane.  However, I had neither seen lightening nor heard thunder during the entire day.  Later as I returned home, I looked carefully at all the wires and poles in that area. There were no transformers to be seen and the wires all looked unremarkably intact.  The area where this occurred is developed on one side with office buildings and has woods and high grass on the other for a space extending about 1/3 of a mile to I-64. In a cursory search, I saw nothing in the area to suggest a meteor had fallen.  I did not see any evidence of aircraft in the area.

It was not yet dark.  I estimate the circumference of the object at about 3/4 of the size of a dime held at arms length. I was sitting on my balcony in (deleted by HBCC UFO) facing east and south watching a thick lower cloud cover get fiercely blown - roughly from west to east (possibly southwest to northeast?).  We had very strong winds that afternoon and evening. The sky was not fully overcast and there were two levels of cloud cover.  The upper cloud layer was much less dense, more dispersed, and did not move nearly as rapidly as the lower cloud cover.  As I looked up between, say, +/-35 degrees to the horizon I saw a perfectly round very white object come into my view moving slowly in a straight line roughly east to west (possibly northeast to southwest) above the lower cloud cover (at roughly the same level as the upper cloud cover).  In any event it appeared to be moving in the direction opposite to the wind.  I observed this object between 30 seconds to 60 seconds.  Towards the end of the sighting the object appeared to smoothly turn away from me slightly as it moved into clouds in the upper cloud layer where I could no longer see it.  It did not reemerge that I could see.  I cannot estimate the size of this object.  I am not particularly good at distances and my only real frames of reference are the two layers of cloud cover.  I don't know the elevations.  I believe it shifted direction slightly because it appeared to reduce somewhat in size before it entered the upper clouds - as if it had turned away and was receding into the distance.  I won't hazard a guess at the size of the object but I will stand on the fact that it was white, perfectly round, and it moved against the direction of the lower cloud cover.

My Wife and I go into the outdoor hottub every night and we have an unobstructed view of the night sky. Thursday night, we went into the tub and sat looking at the passing satellites going over and we noticed an extremely bright, pure white flash of light in the southern night sky at about 80 Deg. above the horizon. This light flashed and was gone. It suddenly appeared again but had travelled approximately one fist width (held at arms length) in a northerly direction. This light flash on and of at approximately two second intervals for almost 30 seconds then the frequency changed to an erratic flashing that would pause for a second, then flash, then pause for two or three seconds then flash. This continued for another two minutes or so and then it just stopped and disappeared. Then, at the same line of travel, back in the southern sky came a second flash. This one was also at about 80 Deg. above the horizon. This one continued for about one and a half minutes, following the same pattern of erratic flashes and also followed the same north bound path, but it was further to the west of the first object. It also disappeared (stopped flashing) as it passed overhead.  I have been an avid atronomer for over 40 years and can honestly state that this caught my attention in that when I went inside, I got on my computer and hit the Nasa Site - ""J-Track"" (Satellite Tracking Software that is available to all) and there were no satellites tracking over our part of Alberta at that time.  I have also been involved in Satellite Tracking of land-based assets and have also participated in the Cobalt Radiation Testing of Chips and related software for the GPS Satellite Constellation Correction and Surveillance Sats Sys that actually tracks and maintains the record of correctional data for the deliniation of the current Glonass and GPS Constellations that are orbiting the earth today. It is not that I do not know what an orbiting satellite looks like as it goes over. THese objects were not satellites or anything that we have sent up. These objects were pulsating at a timed and then erratic rate which indicates a self serving ""at the time of initiation"" protocol, not one that is programmed by any standard we use on earth.  I have seen hundreds of Satellites that spin along their axis in their orbit and have witnessed their solar panels flashing as they rotate toward the sun and these flashes that my wife and I witnessed were simply not the flashes caused by the solar panels of satellites being illuminated by the sun. The lights were of such an intensity that they were similar to th star burst flares dropped from aircraft to light up ground positions......only so very much brighter. My wife says they were like looking into the flash of a camera.  Finally, I was travelling west on Saturday morning at 0400 and was listening to you on the radio for that hour and was taken with the fact that someone had seen the exact same lights over Seattle only one or two nights prior to my wife and seeing them over Alberta.

In some areas of the sky it was cloudy, but we noticed that the lights would continue on, whether they were on top of the clouds or on the clear portions of the sky, so we concluded it couldn't have been 'lightning'. We also concluded that the sophistication of the movement patterns at times were too controlled to have been spots of lightning, as the lights would go in perfect cirles at 180 degrees from each other, and then one would catch up with the other and they appeared to almost be dancing.  The colour of these objects was white and we watched them for forty minutes, before retiring.  I don't know how much longer they were were visible after that.

I was wondering if anyone else in Colorado Springs, CO noticed the object near Pikes Peak, possibly close to Woodland Park, CO? This would be looking southwest from my house; Pikes Peak on the left of the object. I observed what appeared to be a very bright PARALLELOGRAM (exactly what it looked like); yellowish glow, either moving very slowly or nearly stationary. I brought out my field glasses but could not make out any other lights; in fact, there seemed to be dark splotches scattered on it (not symmetrical, just random). Oddly, I could not really get it into focus (it was kind of shimmery), although I could focus on the visitors center (sharper but much smaller) at the top of Pikes Peak fairly easily. It was quite large in comparison to the visitors center so it seems I should have been able to see more detail. Trying to use my videocam and my digital still camera proved fruitless...I couldn't even see it in the viewfinders.  It was visible for approximately two hours and appeared to move only slightly from right to left; at one point it was partly obscured by trees which is how I could detect the motion. It did not move up or down, just slowly side to side. It was an absolutely perfect parallelogram (I even looked up a photo of a parallelogram just to make sure). I made my husband come out and look; he saw it but kind of shrugged it off even though he had no explanation for it.  Size-wise, using the Pikes Peak visitors center as a standard, it was at least five times larger.  I believe I have seen only one other UFO in my life and that was over 25 years ago in San Diego, CA. I called a local TV station about that one (cigar-shaped with colored lights) and other people had also called in about it. I did not call any local TV stations this time (I probably will in the AM) as it was getting late.

One is Near China Lake and the other is on top of a hill in remote location just north of Edwards AFB (EAFB).  The EAFB place is directly under a heavily used,  supersonic low altitude corridor so we see all the military''s good stuff being tested and passing directly over our house 24 hours per day.  (B2, B1, F-117, F-22, JSF, NASA-Dryden stuff, Osprey, C-17 and many other test models.  So we here are battle hardened when it comes to ""UFO"" sightings and many folks just take them for granted due to the heavy activity out here of experimental stuff going on.  Most of us ""literate"" residents of this area know our planes and the generalities and the specifics of sensitive and public projects going on at EAFB/China Lake, etc. because we work there or at Plant 42 (Palmdale) or at famous Mojave civilian airport.  The stuff that goes on at these three locatations is cutting edge.  In fact, the lead British test pilot testing Lockheed's version of the F-22 Raptor was over at my home one day visiting and he said they use my EAFB-area house as a marker from the sky.  That explains why we get buzzed several times a day and why our drywall nails are popping out.  With all that said, please advise that I know my planes, I have better than 2010 vision, have flown helicopters, am an amateur astronomer with a Celestron C-8 (with ""go to"") and a Cave Optics 10"" Newtonian telescope.  I have a wife that is a pilot (we are both scientists) and we have large personal photo archive of really tight shots of just about everything (declassified) that has passed by our house.  Anyway, September 19 I was do my morning mountain bike ride on the I-58 frontage roads on the north side of Edwards AFB (which is west of Mojave). Three silver fighters (not white or black matte or grey) passed over headign north about 1000 feet AGL and about 10 feet off the wing of one of them was a grey flying cylinder about 4-6 feet long. It was NOT being towed and it was NOT a cruise missile, NOT a drone (I am familiar with them from NAWC Weapons-Point Magu), nor was it the Predator or Dark Star, etc.  It had no visible exhaust, no rudder could be seen, no canards or winglets, and it flew around the fighters (from front to back to side, like a toddler hands around it's mother's legs). So it was not being towed.  About 15 minutes later the three fighters returned (again heading in the same Northerly direction), but this time the little cylinder craft was gone.  .  Problem 1: No fighter plane would (to my knowlecge) get that close to a flying missile or remotely controlled object. It was within 5 feet of the planes when parallel to them.  Problem 2: I can't see how this was propelled. It obviously was not towed! And they were travelling 200-300 mph. A little slow for a missile. Besides there are no bombing ranges in this immediate area. They are all at China Lake (60 miles to the north).  Problems 3: if it was remotely controlled how could it fly as such without some winglets and rudder. Of course I am aware of thrust vectoring, but this one had no exhaust. New propulsion technique?  Speculation: Since this was escorted, it was clearly military, and could be a source of similar UFO sightings and reports. For example, a friend saw a small, lone  flying tube/cigar around the canyons back in Sand Canyon in Tehachapi, CA (40 mis west of EAFB) with no visible propulsion system.  Summary:  I wouldn't even bother to report this one, but I think it could be of interest to other parties who have seen something like this and other military craft and think of it as extraterrestrial.  The military has some pretty good stuff that is way ahead of the outdated Stealths.  For comparison, BTW, two years ago in the winter I did see the very LARGE triangular, matte black craft early one very cloudy morning flying north out of Palmdale (Plant 42). While driving on I-14 west of Plant 42 airstrips I saw it lift up into the thick low clouds in thesky so fast I couldn't believe it!  I almost ran off the road. Clearly they wanted this thing up into the cloud cover ASAP.  NO, it was not the B-2 or tiny F-117, the large tankers, nor the C-117 (or others, which are common around here). It looked like about 2.5 times the size (or more) of the B-2 with slight upturn on the tips of the manta type wings.",2003-09-24T00:00:00,35.14950555555556,-117.92507777777776

It was a circular red-orange ball of light that was hovering slowly east. If it were right in front of me I would have to estimate it at walking speed. The size, like throwing a golf ball straight up into the air about seven or eight feet.

Usually, however, a helicopter or plane is accompanied by flashing green or white lights, as I see them on a nightly basis. So I turned off the engine to my vehicle and opened the door to see if I could hear an engine of some kind ... there was nothing. This light continued to hover east for several seconds then came to a stop. It had only been still for no more than two seconds before it disappeared. It didn't fade or speed out of sight, but just vanished like turning off a light switch. I sat there for several more minutes hoping this thing would return, but it never did.

It didn't look like a plane, because it appeared to have too many lights and it was too broad.  It couldn't have been a flock of birds because it didn't change shape and moved too fast.  It just didn't look like anything I've seen before.  I am very puzzled.  I would like to add that my mother had a sighting several weeks ago.  An object of a triangular shape with dim yellow lights on both sides, looked almost like a flock of geese, flew silently and quickly over our house.  She thought that it was birds, but first it's too late in the season, second, it was dark, so nothing could illuminate the birds like that, and third, the lights didn't change shape.",2003-11-26T00:00:00,42.66599931506849,-73.77961926369863

It was a white light, though it may have flickered red, travelling in a straight line at a downward angle of 10°.  I observed it for approximately 2-3 seconds, at which time it faded out.  At 7:18 the same day I observed two more.  The first was heading straight down toward the horizon, and I observed it for several minutes.  It was similar in appearence as the one I sighted earlier, except that it did not fade out and definitely flickered beween white, green and red.  The second I saw for approximately 3 seconds, and was similar to the earlier sighting except that it faded out, then faded in, travelling on the same trajectory before finally disappearing.""  My first instinct (when I saw the first object) was that it was a bit of space debris burning up in the atmosphere.  But the two objects I observed later did not quite fit : the one object faded out then in, and the other changed only in it's color, and I only lost sight of it as it went beneath the horizon. These objects were little more then points of lights - nothing spectacular, but as I say, it was out of the ordinary.  (I object to the use of the word craft on this form - it should say object.  To call it a craft is to make the assumption that it is a manned transport of some kind, instead of being regarded as an Unknown, which is what it is.)",2004-01-22T00:00:00,44.4614,-93.20070000000001

This object was above any streetlights and seemed to be producing its own light. It was a soft, white, pulsing glow. After a few seconds and before I could approach it completely, it dashed off eastward and that was all I saw of it. It was shaped like a disk but on either end had one, wavy, streamerlike ""tentacle"" that also seemes to glow a bit and when the craft was moving, these would flow behind it. When the craft hovered, the tentacles went out to the sides, in line with the craft (like you would see the wrappers ends on the end of a piece of hard candy but longer) and they would move like a flag does in a calm wind.",2004-01-22T00:00:00,36.3598,-75.9962

It was just hovering in one spot and that is when we realized that it was not an airplane or a helicopter or anything.  As we kept driving it was directly above us, and it looked light a big circle with lights on it, and from the lights we could see beams of light coming off of them that looked a bit like the Northern Lights.  We kept driving and then in the sky out my right window we could see a circular ball of light that was bluish-green.  The ball of light would divide and split into 4 balls of light and the 4 balls of light went around in a circle and then combined in the middle again to make one ball.  Then it would go all over again.  I don't know exactly what this was, but I do believe in UFO's now, which for me to say, it obviously happened because I used to be very skeptical of UFO's.

Mystery solved Noises in sky just Lockheed flight tests  By DAVE HIRSCHMAN The Atlanta Journal-Constitution   The mystery of the twin booms that have startled people from Chattanooga to Huntsville since June has been solved. The culprits are new F/A-22 Raptor fighters and chase planes making supersonic test flights over the region.  So far 17 of the futuristic jets have been built at Lockheed Martin's plant in Marietta, and all must show they can break the sound barrier before being handed over to the Air Force. The only problem is that no one let folks in the flight path know the sonic booms were coming.  When residents asked the military about the alarming noises, every branch denied having any planes in the area. ""Each boom sounds like an explosion,"" said Jess Hornsby, 61, of Signal Mountain, Tenn., a Chattanooga suburb. He estimates he's heard 10 in the last three months.  ""There's no rumbling like thunder. It's a loud crack that really rattles the windows.  People here have been wondering what in the world was going on.""   Hornsby, a self-described aviation buff, said he looked up the first time he heard the booms and saw two white contrails streaking overhead.  Each F/A-22 is shadowed by an F-16 chase plane. U.S. Rep. Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.) said the first time he heard the twin booms, he thought a coal mine had exploded. ""I thought I was going to have a heart attack,"" Wamp said. ""It was such a high impact.""  Greg Caires, a spokesman at the Marietta plant, said the planes typically fly about 40,000 feet on a route that takes them from Crossville, Tenn., to Scottsboro, Ala. The planes cover the 110-mile route in about four minutes. The flights follow an existing FAA-approved ""supersonic corridor,"" so rules that prohibit breaking the sound barrier over the continental United States don't apply. Lockheed says it tries to minimize disruptions by avoiding Sunday flights and keeping the planes high. Caires says security rules prohibit the company from telling residents in advance when supersonic flights will take place. Caires and Randy Neville, an F/A-22 test pilot and University of Tennessee grad, traveled to Chattanooga and Huntsville last week to let residents know what the planes have been doing in the skies overhead -- and to expect more booms in the future.  Lockheed is accelerating F/A-22 production and plans to build more than 300 of the fighters. Once residents learned the planes were on their side, Caires said, Lockheed got a warm reception. ""People are very supportive and think the supersonic flights are really cool,"" Caires said. ""I tell them to look to the southwest next time they hear the booms -- but they better look fast, because the planes won't be there long.""",2003-09-04T00:00:00,33.808705515846256,-84.38988231962239

My son came into my room and woke me up to use the camcorder to film the light.  I thought he was talking about a red light about the size of a star, but when I went out with him, the red light, it was huge and a dark red.  It appeared to be the size of maybe a red light signal, or slightly larger.  I was so amazed that I went inside to call my oldest son on the phone.  I dialed his number, and got a recording to a business that my deceased husband worked for prior to his death, in July of 1999.  I could not believe my ears, so I hung up and pressed redial and looked at the number on the display.  It was my sons number, and again the recording came on.  I let my son and daugher listen to the recording, each time pressing the redial button and looking at the displayed number.  I have never memorized his work number, nor have I called that number since 1999.

I was driving on Hwy. 522 eastbound, facing a north direction in this particular segment of the highway, heading from Seattle to Monroe.  I was about 10-15 miles outside of Monroe heading into Monroe.  There is a couple of stoplights at this point on 522 that is famous for traffic backing up, and I was approaching one of these stoplights around 4pm or so, slowing down, when I witnessed the sighting.  At first glance, I thought it was a shooting star (thinking to myself, 'but in the middle of the day, so visible?)  when I quickly realized that instead of streaking across the sky in the upper atmosphere, this was much closer, as low you might expect a small airplane to be that was starting a landing approach (5-10k feet?).  It was a massive fireball, a large burning mass followed be a long tail of fiery debris burning off. It was falling to the earth, and lasted only several seconds before it dissapeared over the trees on the horizon.  This highway is well wooded in this area, almost a path or corridor cut into the forest, and anything moving in the sky would dissapear out of your line of sight beyond the trees on either side, unless the object was heading the same direction as the highway, in which case you'd be able to see it longer until it disappeared over the horizon ahead beyond the trees rather than either side of the highway's close forested sides. this object's falling path did indeed follow the corridor of sight of the highway stretching out ahead of me, until disappeared over the treetops of the horizon. So I got a good 5 second look at it, luckily as it traveled the same direction overhead of the stretch of highway I was on. Were I not in a car, I probably would've seen it much longer from behind me as well, as opposed to just when it just got ahead of me and cleared into the view of my windshield.  From my vantage point, as it streaked and fell and disappeared beyond the trees on the horizon, the trajectory to me looked like it was falling only 10-15 miles ahead of me, like in dowtown Monroe!  In retrospect however, given my untrained eye, what looked like falling in front of me could've really been a much flatter slope and just streaking across horizontally out in front of me, and really hitting earth 100 miles away or more.  I am not real good at judging the three dimensional trajectory when I'm below it looking up at it in really a two dimensional perspective.  Either way, it was extremely low to the ground and like nothing I've ever seen before.  After my initial reaction of a shooting star was exluded, my next thought was that it was a meteorite falling to earth, basically like a shooting star that made it all the way down to here. I also entertained the idea that it was a plane crash or other air disaster (army experiment gone wrong, bad rocket launch, poorly aimed satelite or other man made space device falling from orbit, my imagination really took off in that small instant!), as the fiery mass trailing smoke, flame, and burning off pieces of debris reminded me of some of the pictures I saw with the recent space shuttle tragedy where pieces or wreckage were scattered, falling to the earth in a fiery mass trailing fire and debris with striking similarity to the object I witnessed.  However, it mostly resembled a meteorite to me.  It moved at an incredible rate of speed, a speed that I never thought possible, faster than any plane I've ever seen, including the Blue Angels fighter jets that do an annual airshow in seattle.  The main fireball mass also seemed very large, too large to really be any sort of plane or wreckage.  It was a jaw dropping experience, one that made me cry out ""what the #@%$ was that?  Holy *#&$! ! Did you see that?"" only I was the only one in the car, so I began looking around to other motorists as someone to share this incredible experience if any of them saw it too, but by them traffic started to move and I couldn't get a good look at anyone's face to sense anyone with similarly astonished expressions.  Wherever this thing fell, I wish I was there to see it, as it would be incredibly interesting I'm sure. ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports about this event.

The sky was very clear and many stars were visible over the ocean horizon. There was a slight haze over the water that obscured the horizon.  As we sat on the beach watching the sky, there appeared a bright stationary light with a orange huge high in the sky. It was as intense as Mars and for a moment looked as though there were 2 Mars. The light persisted for several seconds and winked out. We continued to watch and the light appeared again in a different location, it appeared first on the left of Mars and then on the right and slightly lower in the sky. Again the light appeared and blinked out after 2 seconds.  We were really excited as this was like nothing we had ever seen before, it changed position but not in a straight path.  After about 20 mins. 2 lights appeared together to the left of Mars both appeared and winked out after about 2 seconds. The last sighting was to the right of Mars and low on the horizon, the light was partially obscured by the layer of haze and shone more red in color.  We observed Mars for several more nights and looked for the lights, they did not reappear.  The night was quite and what aircraft traffic was in the sky was clearly visible. One thought I had was that the lights might be the afterburners on some military aircraft out over the ocean. I have never observed them at night and do not know how they would appear. I mention this because there is a military base near by and I did see 2 F-16’s earlier that day. They were very load and flew out over the ocean. The lights we saw were stationary and we heard no aircraft noise. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed, but we believe one possibility to explore would be landing lights on approaching commercial or military aircraft.  Just a guess on our part.  PD))",2003-09-04T00:00:00,33.68315,-78.93953909574468

At this point I called my mother and cousin who drove over.  I meanwhile also got my binoculars out and went back outside to get a closer look.

There were dark clouds gathered and they seem to be moving. I guess it was because it was going to rain soon, although it was kinda weird that the clouds were dark since it was a very sunny day. I was wearing my sunglasses and squinting at the Sun. Then I saw this Moon-like object high up in the clouds, about an inch away from the Sun (from my position). It looked like the Moon, or a planet, only it's a little bigger then the Moon when it's full. I couldn't believe what I was seeing because this was during the afternoon, about 2-3+pm. At first I thought it might be the Moon but how could the Moon and the Sun be in the sky next to each other at the same time? I told my friend to look up and she saw it too, she thought it was the Moon but that's impossible. It wasn't as bright as the Sun, it looked disc-like, I even saw some dark patches on it, kinda like the Moon with its craters. on it.  What's even more surprising is that this 'Moon' was moving. I couldn't remember which direction, but I think it was revolving around the Sun. At the same time the dark clouds were moving pass it, sort of like it was trying to hide the appearance of this object. Every few momens I would stare at it again to make sure it was still there and not a trick of the eye. I was holding the life of a kid in my hands since I was belaying. Wouldn't be too good if I had to explain why I was careless enough to let a kid drop 15 feet to his death. Haha. Ok back to the topic. After a while, the object moved towards the sun, at a very high speed I guess, from the ground it looked like it was moving 1 cm a second, but multiply it by the distance this object is away from us, I think that's a very high speed. And moments later, the object seemed to merged with the Sun, sort of like an eclispe, except without the Sun darkening or whatever.",2003-09-04T00:00:00,,

They both moved while keeping the same distance apart the whole time.  We stayed outside for a few minutes afterwards, but didn't see anything else move, so we came inside.

It definitely was not a plane, blimp, ultra-lite craft, heliocopter, or any other aerial craft I have ever seen, since its motion was more like floating than flying.

At 5:00 a.m. on that day  they noticed and filmed blue lights close to their home. The witnesses watched the blue lights travel from the east and then stopped  near their home as seen in the photos below.  The  lights stayed in the area for approximately 20 minutes. I asked the folks if they knew which direction the lights went and they were both unsure.  They may have looked away for a minute or two and then when they glanced back the lights were gone.  Then on the same morning, two hours later, they  saw  more some strange objects and took photos of them as well.  I found the pictures to be very interesting and beautiful with the rainbow as a backdrop. A number of objects can be seen very clearly in the pictures. The witnesses said the objects stayed in their area for approximately an hour, and told me this event was extraordinary.  They watched them flying north and maneuver themselves as if they were lining up one after another.  They also would change positions, spreading out, and coming back together once again.  At one point the witness said they seemed to  leap frog over one another..  It was a strange and exciting experience for the couple. One of the witnesses said someone else must have surely seen this event as it lasted so long and was so very strange. I would really like to thank the couple for sending me the pictures and report.

Rainier - There was a Strobing light that at first glance looked just like an extremely bright star. However, it changed colors from white to bright blue, red, green. It hovered for quite some time making quick erattic movements from time to time (up, down, left,right - which ruled out it being a star, plane or helicopter) but overal stayed in the same location. Could not see visible shape, determine altitude or location over which it hovered - could have been Puyallup area.  With binoculars the object still was too far away, but was able to make out more colors, and the object almost seemed to 'sparkle' with light beams. ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS)) Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),  Thank you very much for the report, and for your telephone call.  My suspicion is that you may have been observing the very bright and colorful ""twinkling"" star in the western sky.  I have been admiring it, of late, too.  The apparent movement of the object is a result, principally, of movement of the eye, not the star.  This type of movement is reported to us frequently.  Please check that same are of the sky on the next clear night, and let us know whether you see the object, or not.  Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center!  Dear Mr Davenport,  ((RESPONSE)) Thank you for getting back to me. The more I think about it the more I am getting convinced it must have been a star (though I've never seen any star like it). It just didn't make sense to me why I would be able to see it for hours while most reports lasts a few minutes at most. If it hadn't looked like it was moving I probaply would have just thought of it as a really bright star - and your explanation on why it seemed to move makes sense.  After reading up on some of the other reports on  the board, someone mentioned the sirius star which I think would've been in that general area at that time.  I will try to look again - with a star map in hand this time! (it's been cloudy last couple of days as you probaply know :) ) and if I find out it was indeed just a star I will let you know so you can remove the report.  Thanks for your time!

It was the 24th and I saw for the second time in a year an unusual black void in the sky above my home on Cape Cod. There were  no stars within the black phenomena even though it was a particularly starry evening. It was as if there was a jet black blob that changed shape from an oblong to a kidney shape up above. My dogs were trembling as if there was a thunder storm in progress. It was the strangest thing I had ever seen and to see 2 similar occurences in the same year that effected my dogs the same way each time was really weird. OK!! Now it's getting creepy because less than an hour ago I saw it again. This time it was moving very fast as it crossed the horizon. I was alone(no dogs) and it was most definitely the same object or whatever it is , as the 2 times before. It is not a starry night at all and it is overcast. This time it stuck out like a sore thumb against the clouded sky. The object was traveling Southwest and was moving at a fair clip, which is totally different from the way I observed it the last 2 times, when it was barely moving at all. This is a strange thing and I would love to know what it is. I know that there is an Air Force Base less than a few miles from my house but it's no plane that's for sure, because it is a massive area. I can't estimate the size because I have no idea of how high above it is.  Anyway, any ideas? I'm stumped and determined to get a picture worth sharing with everyone. Has anyone else seen this before? I would be grateful for any information. Thanks again ((name deleted)), MA",2003-10-07T00:00:00,41.6686,-70.414

We stared at it and wondered what it was and it changed colors from whitish yellow to red and then back to white. It was reflecting (we think) the sun as it set. It moved a little but nothing erratic. It gradually faded.  We went out to dinner and talked to several other people who saw it.  Then we asked the local police and they laughed and said it was a weather balloon and they had alot of calls on it.  I contacted the national weather service and inquired about any possible weather ballon launchings.  I received an email back from a weather rep. and he stated that they certainly did not launch any in that area (also the object was far too large) and that he had seen it also as did hundreds of others.  Possibly miliary, NASA, private or what.....no one knows.  So, in conclusion I think it deserves to be reported.

The story begins while my family and the couple mentioned, along with their son, were vacationing up north on Portage Lake.  In the cabin one evening, we all decided to share strange occurrences we had experienced in the past- paranormal events and stuff like that.  I thought this was strange for my friend's parents to bring up because they are such content, sincere folks- the type of people one wouldn't associate with UFO sightings.  Anyways, they started off by asking one another if they remembered what they called "" the flying saucer"" in the field back about thirty years ago.  Then they proceeded to tell us the story of the disc they saw during the seventies over the field that is only a block from my current residence.  As I describe the story they told, I will refer to the couple as ""Dan"" and ""Ann"".  Here is what they told myself and my family of their experience:   One day (unsure of exactly what season they said) Dan was riding his bike back from the local grocery store a few blocks away.  On his rode home, he noticed a large, blackish-metallic, low flying disc with lights around its perimeter near the water tower down the road from the grocery store.  Being only a few blocks from home, he peddaled home, as fast as he could, with the water tower and stationary ufo on his right and the field and his home on the left (Dan and Ann's home at the time was right at the field's edge).  Dan immdeiately got Ann to come and see the spectacle outside.  When they both got back outside, the disc was over the field, moving slowly in the direction of their home, then it stopped.  Dan and Ann watched the disc for several minutes, as it slowly changed direction, heading back toward the direction of the grocery store Dan had just came from.  As it! flew, it slowly spun (I am almost positive they said it spun) and was outlined with greenish-yellowish, almost fluorescent lights. During flight, it silently zig-zagged slowly back and forth while still heading in the same direction.  Dan and Ann watched the disc until it flew out of sight.  They never heard of anyone else seeing it or of any reports in the newspaper or on tv. ~ These people I have known my entire life telling me of this event now, to me, makes the phenomena of UFOs and otherworldly life a reality.  Another thing that the couple emphasized in the telling of their story was that the disc moved as if it wasn't effected by the same scientific barriers as we on earth currently are- the way it zig-zagged during flight effortlessly gave them the distinct feeling that this craft was either other-worldly or far, far, far ahead of its time. (the date, time, and year of the sighting are mere estimates- I am absolutely sure that it was in the 1970's, though). ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Please contact me this has been disturbing me for a very long time and I need to talk about it.  Thanks  Hello my name is ((name deleted)) this is a real documented case of something very strange that took place.  No one knows or is willing to talk about it now.  It was documented on the 10:00 news in Las Vegas about 7 years ago.  The Government said nothing they neither denied it or tried to cover it up. I along with several friends had a perfect view.  However I did not see the entire outcome this just ending.  If I saw the whole thing I think I would have locked me up in a mental hospital.  Who knows maybe it affected me more than I thought.  And that is why I'm acting so strangely.   My friend or co-worker saw the whole thing and that was the last day I saw him.  He never came back to work because it affected him so much.  All you had to be doing was looking south at the right time and you would have seen an amazing sight.  What I saw lasted only several minutes and the main display only a few seconds.  It will be a day that I will never forget.  I believe it took place August 13 on a Saturday night around 8:30pm what year I don't remember anymore.  It was about 6 or 7 years ago so the date can easily be checked out.    At any rate I was pulling into the showboat hotel.  I was driving a cab at the time so you know I was completely aware of my faculties.  It has just turned dark. Right around 9:30 I saw my friend or co-worker standing over his van looking directly south.  Normally my first instincts would be to ignore him and get into the cab line as quickly as possible.  But he looked like he might be in trouble so I pulled over got out of my cab and asked him if everything was all right.  He said yes but look at this.    I looked where he pointed and I said so what there's nothing there.  Everything was pitch black all you could see was a nice clear sky and the stars.  You could see forever that's how clear the night was.  Then all of a sudden something happened.  I thought I saw a shooting star. Beautiful crystal clear white lights shooting straight up like something you might see at the end of a comet.  Little tiny crystals or like very tiny little white stars.  Millions of them shooting straight up about as wide as normal full size airplane from wing to wing.  They were so clear you could see every one of them.  Like I said I my first thought was like it was a shooting star.  But then I said wait a second this thing is going straight up beginning from several miles up.  A shooting star goes across not up that defies the laws of physics.  It went up for maybe half a mile before the lights started to fade a way.  When I saw that I went into a state of shock.  When the lights fizzled away a tiny ball appeared about the size of a helicopter.  Difficult to tell the size because of the distance between us maybe 20 miles or so.  The ball hovered and from that ball more light appeared like the first white light.  But this time the color of the light was red very bright red.  It came shooting straight out towards us.  It came outwards and moved down at the same time.  And when that light sequence faded another ball appeared just like the last ball.  Now there are two balls at least 300 yards apart.  Now more red light appeared the same as the other red lights.  But these shot straight across.  And when those lights faded away another ball appeared.  The three balls formed a perfect triangle.  The crystal lights that appeared like I explained did it precise formation.  Extremely amazing thing. Now you have three orange balls about the size of helicopters hovering for several minutes.  The more you stared into this thing the more you thought you saw an out line of  a ship.  But you couldn't be sure.  Then the lower right ball started to rotate and all three balls vanished and that was all I saw. I discussed it with my friend and we saw the exact same thing.  But he saw the beginning, which I did not.  He said the lights came down from the stars.  He was so scared he took the rest of the night of and I never saw him again.    It was on the ten o'clock news.  They did a short section on it.  With no answers then at the end of the news they said it was Elvis coming down to the mgm.   A lot of people who saw it convinced  themselves that it was all a fire works display.  But there was a problem with that.  The first problem was that it was completely silent.  The second problem was that the part I saw started half way up the earths atmosphere and was amazingly clear.  To this day I can't watch a fireworks display because it's way to primitive.  The next day no one would talk about it especially the news network.  When I told them I had a perfect view of it they just didn't want to hear about it.  Whatever this thing was it was huge.  The government can't hide things forever.  Eventually one time somebody will have no choice but to listen to the Aliens when they come. I need to talk about this please contact me at 847-((number deleted)) or e-mail me at ((e-address deleted)).  I know Aliens exsist and I belief that this is a bigger cover up than Roswell.

I turned around to see the beam disintegrating, but intact enought to trace it to its source-a light in the same placae I had seen movement before.  Immediately upon the seeing the light, it quickly moved a short distance to the left horizontally and blinked out.

There's a reasonable explanation for at least some of them...  I work at Epcot, and was surprised one night to see small white objects flying erratically over Spaceship Earth (the huge white ball at the park).  It soon became apparent what they were:  The lights which illuminate Spaceship Earth shine up from the ground, and portions of the beams miss the building and continue into the sky.  This light is impossible to see, unless something in the sky enters a beam and is illuminated by it.  For reasons I still don't understand, sea gulls and bats make a habit of flying around this area after dark, entering and leaving the light beams continuously.  From a distance it appears as if small, brightly lit objects are performing impossible acrobatic maneuvers in the sky.  I'm not surprised to see the few reports in your database that seem to refer to this phenomenon--I'm an amateur astronomer used to observing the sky, and I found it quite startling the first time I saw it.

There is a lot of air traffic in the area and, being a private pilot myself, I am familiar with most aircraft lighting configurations.

I can't say for sure what the luminous object was, but I can say with some confidence what the object was not.  It wasn't a meteor because it stopped and reversed direction.  It was not a model airplane because it moved too rapidly, and it was not a balloon because it was a windless evening and again, it moved too quickly.  It was almost certainly not a firework or flare --- it moved silently.  This is the first unusual sighting I've observed in the night sky.  I was not dreaming or intoxicated.

When I was a young girl my dad and I saw a UFO, while we were both awake and outside, in Reseda, CA and ever since over the years I've had numerous abduction experiences-This is a reference for what happened to me last night (January 15, 2004-1:00 AM)  I was sitting up in bed watching TV with the lights off and my boyfriend was laying next to me with his eyes closed, almost asleep. Suddenly a swirling circular distortion appeared in the ceiling above me. It was approximately 2 to 3 feet in diameter. It looked like the reality of the ceilng was rippling like water. Within a moment of it's appearance a bright intense shining ball, the size of a softball, glowing like a light bulb with a surface like glass, fell down out of the swirling circular distortion. It fell within about 3 inches from the floor in front of me. All-of-sudden a long thin green arm, glowing light fluorescent green, reached down out of the ceiling and snatched up the ball and jerked back up into the circular rippling distortion. The arm was extremely long to be able to reach out of the ceiling and snatch the ball up (the ceiling is 8 feet from the floor). This all happened within seconds. As the arm was retracting into the ceiling I  aroused my boyfriend but by the time he fully arose and opened his eyes it was all over. He believed me though. He has also had many strange waking abduction experiences over the years.  There is also a second strange occurence to this happening. My borfriend's brother lives in the same house with us. Over the years he has heard his brother moaning in his bed at night and after his brother wakes him up he seems to remember a shadowy presense in the room, some kind of entity, and having long scaly fingers pushed over his mouth, and being frozen in place and being dragged from his bed. He swears he's been awake when this happens. His brother always finds him awake , shaken, remembering details. Well, later on last night (about 3:00 AM, January 15, 2004) his brother heard my boyfriend (I had finally fallen asleep) start moaning just like all the other times he had abduction experiences. My boyfriend remembered nothing this time though. We are all sane grown people who have not been diagnosed with scitzofrenia and I was wide awake watching TV. I have never told anyone about these things throughout my life for fear of ridicule but this was so strange this time that I had to tell someone.

It also came back on another occasion a few days later but did not stay in the vicinity very long. I talked with the fellow (retied military man) first of all and this is his report he gave me.  The object at one point sat straight over top of their home and was the size of a baseball. The witnesses location is a little south west from Airdrie on the west side of Highway #2. The color on the object changed from white to orange and back again. The object did turn a brilliant blue at one time. The fellow said it was stationary over his home for minutes, then could move from east to west and continue carrying out these types of maneuvers. The fellow actually thought the object was intrigued with the fire they had going in the backyard. He told me the total amount of time the couple watched the object was around two hours. (HBCC UFO Note: Due to the large amount of time the object was witnessed, I asked if the object moved with other astronomical bodies in the sky, and the fellow said no !) He said whatever it was, was moving all over the sky. To make it clear, whatever they were looking at, I was told when they looked away, then looked back at the object, it was in a different part of the sky. Then would make it's move back to where it came from. Both of the witness thought it moved to get out of the way of air traffic as there were aircraft active in that area. They also watched the object move up and down, then move far over to the right, drop down a ways, then move back to the left. (HBCC UFO Note: Both of the folks used the roof of their home as a referrerence point so they knew how far the object moved to the left, right and up and down. At some points in this sighting, they would lose sight of it due to it dropping behind the roof, but it would rise back up again.  He took a guess and figured the object was sitting at approx: 5000 feet and could see the roundness of it. He told me there was sound coming from it. He described it like being a vent people have on the top of their roofs. (the rotating kind, but the sound was at a very low level). Also when the sound was heard, lights would come on around the circumference of it.  I also asked if they had any pets who were with them at the time of the sighting. He said yes. The fellow told me in his words, the three cats went a little squirrelly. He said they seem to cower down, ears fell back and two of then started to hiss.  HBCC UFO Note: The below information comes from the gentleman's wife. I will not give out what her occupation is as it could cause problems if this information came out.  The wife told me the object would have been located approx: 5,000 feet in altitude as she has knowledge of how the aircraft fly in and out of the airport. She said it was certainly hovering around the airport area and the night was very calm and silent. She also confirmed the object did make a strange low pitched noise which she thought was rather eerie. From what she observed, she could see white lights running around the object and another light sitting at the bottom of the craft and it would change from orange to blue. When the object moved in any direction all the white lights went out, but the light at the bottom did stay on, when the object came to a complete stop, the white lights running around it came back on. She said it was definitely round in shape. She said they both thought they were seeing things and did not want to tell anyone about it due to others thinking they were crazy. But it sounds like to me the witnesses had a good seat for an exciting display.  Thank you to both of the witnesses for their report.

I fellow called to report he witnessed something very strange when he was driving up Deerfoot heading towards Airdrie. He watched a small ball of white light cross the highway in the distance a head of him, the ball of light turned in his direction. The witness said he was doing approametly 30 kilometers an hour and observed the light getting closer. All of a sudden the object stopped, still a ways away from him, there it had changed from a ball of light into a craft of some type. He made a guess as to what the altitude of the object might have been at. The witness told me it may have been traveling at approx: 1000 feet.  He added that before the object changed from a ball of light into a strange craft, he noted that it started glistening and shinning brightly and then this is when it started taking on some kind of form of an unusual object. He reported no sound being heard, mind you he was in his vehicle at the time. I also asked if he might be able to determine the size of it, he said when it was in the distance it could have been approx: the size of his small fingers, fingernail. But when it headed in his direction and got very close,  in his words, ""it was huge.""  The object did come to a complete stop as the man passed close by. It sat stationary as he drove some 2 kilometers doing around 20 kilometers an hour. Finally other drivers started honking their horns to get his attention to have him speed up. The man said the reason why he was driving so slow was due to him looking over his shoulder and out the back window watching it. Finally due to his location from the object he lost sight of it.  Thank you to the witness for the report.   Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

And it was right in front of me, I could hit it with a rock if i had one. I stopped my car and stood in the road and was trying to comprehend what I was seeing. About 30  yards from the road, at about the height of a telephone pole, was a huge boomerang/trianglor shape craft, with alot of blicking lights on the bottom. Mostly red and white, but some other colors as well. I stood somewhat under it for about a minute and just looked at it. I could not hear any sound and no air was moving. I was still trying to comprehend this. It just sat their blinking and motionless for about a minute. Then it tilted and slowly moved accross the road I was stopped on, and dropped low below a tree line. It came within 25 yards of my head. After about 10 seconds, it rose from the tree line, repositioned itself directly over the 2 lane road I was stopped on,and slowly proceeded down the road at about 5mph at first, at about 100 feet above the road. At this time I could see that it's width was about 3 - 4 times the width of the road. I got back in my car to attempt to follow it. I was able to follow it for about 30 yards when in an instant, it was a mile down the road. I could still see it, and cars were passing under it. But I could not understand how it can be directly in front of me, and then in a flash be a mile away. The next morning I went back to the field it was hovering over, but could find no evidence of anything. I got a very very close look at this thing that day. Since that day, I believe I saw it 2 more times, in the same general area. These 2 additional sightings were at more of a distance and shorter duration. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I had a telephone call from a gentleman from St. Laurent, Manitoba on September 22, 2003. The area where this event took place is mainly a Matee community. The fellow I talked to said he and his wife bought a business  and have lived in the community for thirteen years and know many of the area residents.  In the last week of August, 2003 four youths were driving south of St. Laurent towards the golf course on golf course road (as many folks there call it). The road runs by Francis Lake and the golf course is on the left hand side of the road when traveling south. As they drove along they noticed an abandoned vehicle off to the side of the road across from the golf course. At this point they all saw flashing lights over and above one of the buildings on the course. The lights seemed to be sitting stationary in one spot and low over the sheds. They assumed, after seeing the car pulled off to the side of the road and the lights flashing,  that someone may have been breaking into the sheds. Two of the young men decided to sneak in to see if they might catch someone causing damage, the other two  went back home to get their parents and have them come down to the area where all this was taking place.  As the two youths were approximately half way into the course and as they approached a small road which passed by one of the dugouts, they heard a very loud, piercing scream. As they kept walking for approx: another 100 feet, all of a sudden this ""thing"" was right in front of them and screaming out this loud screeching noise. A three foot high creature ran in front of them and it was only about 25 feet away. Both witnesses were taken totally by surprise and very frightened as they had no idea what this thing was. It didn't help that it was dark outside. Both of them ran back towards the road where they had been dropped off, but seeing they did not have a vehicle they cowered in the ditch which ran along side the road hoping that whatever it was they saw would not find them. Finally their two friends returned with a couple of the parents and when the vehicle stopped the two guys who witnessed the creature, hurridly  jumped  into the vehicle. ""Let's get out of here"" they said .... however the parents did go and check the buildings and found nothing had been disturbed.   They all talked about the event on their way home.  The lights which were seen hovering over the buildings were a red, greenish and white colour.  The witnesses  mentioned that not a sound could be heard coming from where the lights were seen. Also they  claimed seeing another light hovering over Francis Lake which was totally red.  Again not a sound could be heard.  On the same night, shortly after the above sighting ......another man, driving his van, had to slam on his brakes to avoid hitting  a similar creature. He claimed that it was about 10 feet in front of him when he finally came to a complete stop. It moved to the driver's side of the van and squatted down, bending slightly to one side, looked up at the frightened driver.  The man described the creature as being small and having a protruding jaw filled with a number of teeth. He put the truck into reverse and headed out of there as fast as he could.  After thinking about what just happened, and what he saw, he broke down and started to cry.  Another series of events have taken place in the same general area.  A local resident who had some 27 chickens well penned up in a ""heavy steel wired"" area, found on the following day, that 20 of his poultry had disappeared.  A large hole had been ripped in the strong wire fence. The resident looked around the area and found one chicken still partly alive in the bushes behind their home  and it had two puncture holes at the base of its neck.  No other chickens were found.  Strangely, also there has been a large number of domestic cats which have gone missing just over the same time period, which is definitely not normal and there does not seem to be any explanation for their disappearance.  The fellow claims that there is a lot of history of unknown objects being seen in and around the community. He also said that the creature had been spotted on other occasions throughout the St. Laurent area.  The lights were strange, the creature was strange...  what they were and whether or not they were connected is anyone's guess.   There does seem to be something very weird happening in this particular part of Canada.   I will continue to look into this and see what, if anything more , I can discover about it.  Due to the community being tight lipped about such strange events its not going to be an easy task.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

I saw a light straight ahead while driving down Rt. 49.  It did not blink and did not leave any trails.  It was small and bright and at first I thought it was a plane.  It appeared to ""be right"" with the apparent height, brightness, and speed.  But it appeared to be going from S to N and so I thought it strange that I saw no blinking lights.  It then began to speed up.  (All of this took place in probably less than 90 degrees of sky and for the most part was at or below about 45 degrees.  I'm no scientist or astronomer, but have made these guestimates by thinking back and ""slicing"" the sky into pie pieces.)  Within a few seconds of it speeding up to the point where I thought no plane could go that fast, be seen, and not make a noise, it began a gradual, then steep sloping pattern. By this time I had pulled into a parking lot to a gas station/store that was very busy.  I had also convinced myself that it must be a meteor.  The way it changed speeds still confounded me, but the sharp downward turn that was almost a straight decent down reminded me of a falling star.  I still saw no wavering of the light and as much as I tried to see lights blinking, there were none.  If I had to compare it's brightness to a star I would say Regulus, but smaller in size.  It then began to slow down as it decended.  It made a swooping turn very low in the sky and then went back the way it came at at slower rate than when I had first noticed it.  There were some trees very low down and to the left which made it hard to see it much beyond the point I had first noticed it.  Even though I had probably made a nuisance of myself by pulling in slowing to the parking lot and parking at the edge near the road, no one seemed to pay any heed to what I was looking at.  All of this probably lasted no longer than a minute.  I was in the store a couple minutes and while I was standing in line I looked at the clock at it said 8:00 exactly.

I am not even sure if what I saw wasn't a plane.  That is the explanation for everything....""it must have been a plane""  Of course I live where there are a lot of tall trees obstructing my vision so who knows, but in my gut I don't think it was a plane. There were too many red and blue lights.  This thing was bigger than any plane I have ever seen, and it was moving faster than I have ever seen a plane fly.  I don't know what it was. I do know that it frightened me a little, and I still feel a little funny about it.  This was only last night.  I am almost a little scared to go to sleep tonight...lol.  If anyone else has seen anything weird in the sky they should definatly post it.

Observers were myself, husband and our 11yr old twins. While heading to the on ramp to I-5 south at the Chamber Way ramp at 18:47 I noticed a bright light in the sky just to the east of the freeway.  It was high enough up in the sky to later be obliterated from sight by some low rain clouds.  It was just getting dark outside.  I asked my daughter [in the back seat directly behind me] to look at the light.  She did and we talked about what it could be because we often see planes flying high on their way to SeaTac. This was different because the entire time we watched it [13 minutes] we never saw one of the usual blinking red or blue lights.  The light did not move hardly at all.  It never seemed to get closer, nor further away.  At one point the light was visible to my husband [driving], and our son sitting directly behind him.  We all were stumped as to what it could be.  The light was much brighter than any light I have ever seen in the sky, with the exception of a helicopter spotlighting the ground.  This did not appear to be directing light anywhere.  We all agreed the light was a different kind of light. A 'glittery' king of light.  When compared to the moon it was like comparing regular car headlights to the new bright halogens.  Seeing as it was east of I-5 my daughter and I both watched it until it was blotted out by dark rain clouds.  We all watched it for a moment at a traffic light before entering the freeway and it was not moving.  My husband believes it was quite high.  I think it was much lower as it was about a minimum of 5X larger than the lights we commonly see on commercial planes.  There is a small plane airport east of the freeway, but this light was not moving.  It appeared to me to be about 6-8 miles east of the freeway and much lower altitude than commercial planes fly at.  I never took my eyes off it while on the freeway, hoping to see a familar blinking light to explain it away, but I have no idea what it was, or where it went.  The light didn't 'twinkle' like sta! rs do. It was a constant light, bright enough to keep me from making out any shape behind it.  It was covered by clouds at 19:00.

It soon became apparent what they were: The lights which illuminate Spaceship Earth shine up from the ground, and portions of the beams miss the building and continue into the sky. This light is impossible to see, unless something in the sky enters a beam and is illuminated by it. For reasons I still don't understand, sea gulls and bats make a habit of flying around this area after dark, entering and leaving the light beams continuously. From a distance it appears as if small, brightly lit objects are performing impossible acrobatic maneuvers in the sky.

I am not sure of the exact date of my sighting, but it was about 22:30 on a summer evening and it was very possibly 1999.   While standing on the beach (very dark) at Golden Beach Campground with my father, (we were viewing shooting stars and had on a different visit witnessed a very bright flare, or flash from a iridium satellite, now defunct) we were able to see a airplane with lights making repeated large oblong circles over the mountains.  The plane was south of the lake, in the general direction of Sagamore, or Cedar River Flow to Moose River Plains, but probably was only a few miles from Raquette Lake.  This activity made us very curious and we watched very closely as the plane continued the loops.  Finally, a similar plane entered from the east and closed the distance on the initial plane.  The second plane was now trailing the first one by a very short distance and was following an identical pattern.  This remained the situation for quite a while, only now they flew off into the distance. (Subsequent conversations and internet searches have led me to believe that they were military planes that were practicing refueling maneuvers over the desolate and isolated Adirondack Park)  An hour or so later, one of the planes flew extremely low over the the main street of the campground (and it contiued west over the lake) as I stood in the street between campsite 13 and 18 and the plane did not appear again.
