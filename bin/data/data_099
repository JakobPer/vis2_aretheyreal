Third party account: Grandpa kept telling us about this time where he was outside (with his kids, who were too young to remember) in eastern Pittsburgh.  It was in the 1960s.   In the sky, a large orange sphere floated into view slightly south in the sky.  It loitered for a minute or so, and then rocketed off into the eastern sky.  No noise, consistent acceleration.  Within 5 minutes fighter jets flew past following the path of the orb.   He promptly called the Air Force, and got on his HAM radio.   Do not recall what the explanation was. I've seen a couple similar reports here.  No mention of the fighters, though. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I remember it well.  One of those silent peaceful nights’s when everything is still.  You can hear the engines running out in the channel from the shrimp boats and the people talking along the shore who are getting ready to go flounder gigging.    I rocked on the front porch of my grandmother's house, looking across the road at my home.  I could hear the clear call of the whippoorwill, in the woods behind my home.  A sound that is rare to hear.  “O” how so lonesome that sound makes you.  A sound that stir the soul of a man. There had been sightings of strange lights in the sky over the outer banks by the local people of Carteret County, NC.  People had gather at Radio Island and were on top of the sand dome with their cameras and binocular.  Seen mostly by the night fishermen. People would say some things about it at the local grocery store, but just laugh it off.  They knew down deep it was best to be silence. One night, I and another guy were taking a ride over in Gloucester, NC, on the Straits Road. Yes!  There is was over the road a bright white light with a round shape at the fork of the road.   The passenger began losing the radio signal and was adjusting the radio station before he had looked up.  He began complaining about the radio signal.  I said with a loud voice, “radio” Look!  Then the auto wanted to cut off and I was doing all I could frantically trying to keep it running by pumping the excellator.  She is going to cut–off.   The engine in auto had cut off, we where rolling toward it.  It was very bright white light round shape about 38 to 40 feet diameter and above the ground about 30 feet.  Yes!  Time had lapsed.  It was there in the sky and went up some.  Then I could hear the loud sound of jets engines getting closer as they approach.  The UFO took off, fast away.  I then saw the after burners kick in and the loud sound from the jet engines as they took off after it.  They were just above the tree tops, they were so low.  I started the car and though to myself.  I had to put the car in park to start it.  No conversation were said, to one another until the passenger said put me out at home. So I did. I also went home.  My mother said where have you been.  I just had a phone call from the USAF who wanted to talk to you.  For you to call them.  I said, I’m not, because I haven’t done anything wrong.   I left and went back and stop to a little service station called Fake’s Store.  I went in and asked Fake if he heard anything.  He said, know. I said, you didn’t hear the jets.  He said was that what that was.  I thought they were going to take the roof off the building but that was about 2 hour ago.  I said, no, it was about 15 minutes ago.  Well, he said, I’m getting ready to close.  You are closing early.  He said, there nothing wrong with my clock.  I step outside and looked at my watch and it was 2 hour behind.  I then began to get worried.  Could I have been abducted and have lost 2 hours of time.   I then went home again. My mother said the USAF called again and I told them what you said.  They told me to tell you that you better keep your mouth shut if you knew what was good for you. Yes!  I had to go back to the area of the sighting, me and the passenger.  We saw a farmer feeding his cows at a Troff.  We slow down and asked him if he saw anything.  He said I have seen you boys riding by here a lot.  Did you see anyone messing with my cows.  We said no.  The farmer said it was the most ungodly thing done to them cows.  Well, they paid me for them and I’m not supposed to talk about it.  As he was looking around to see if anyone was looking. At that farmer's yield he moved his cows out and let the growth of woods grow up around it.  There is now a tower at the corner of the field and the government moved all the, cows, and animals off the outer banks. A few days later the passenger said.  You know if we talk about this, people will mark us and it might make it hard for us down the road.  I think it would be best just to be silent.",2015-01-16T00:00:00,34.7423,-76.5345

We were on Hwy 126 about 10 miles east of Ventura when I saw a white fireball streak across the sky in front of the car slightly to our left.  That would have put it to the South of us toward Oxnard, likely out over the ocean.     It was traveling left to right, meaning it was heading pretty much due South.  It seemed to turn slightly green and left a long trail behind it.  It was low in the sky, I'd estimate 10 degrees, was obscured by some trees, then reappeared on the other side of them, then we lost sight of it.  I'd estimate we saw it for 5 seconds.   Since in the report below they were looking south I think this was the same object.

On December 29, 2014, at approximately 19:42 hours, my dog had to go out, so I headed to my back yard.  As I stood along the fenceline of the yard, which runs parallel with I-84, I noticed a massive and extremely bright-lit reflection in my neighbors 2cd.  Story window.  It was so bright, that it illuminated the area around the window pane as well.   At this point, I looked up in an easterly direction to figure out what could create such a glow and that is when I saw a very bright and very large white in color fireball with a pink-ish white in color tail like shape appear to be fixed in the sky however, within seconds of noticing it hovering, it shot across the sky with such a high rate of speed it blew my mind.  It literally appeared as though it hovered for a second and then completely darted into oblivion, it literally disappeared.   Now my first thought was a shooting star or meteor however, it didnt fly away or in a downward motion like when stars die out. It lit! erally disappeared, like it shut its lights out.   I am a retired firefighter with respectful credibility who is a ""show me the evidence"" kind of guy, so I chalked it up to some weird shooting star.  Yes that's what I did, of course, that was until I went outside again for my break (I work 3rd. Shift) and what I saw blew my mind!   It was approximately 1:02 AM (now on 12/30/14) and I was standing up against my employer's building, which ironically is about 1 mile down the street from my home (north), when I witnessed 2 of the same shaped fireballs that I saw earlier in the night appear out of nowhere in the sky above my employer.  They were literally identical to the first sightings object, but this time they appeared different in color (again, the 1st. object was white/pink-ish in color).  They were a very bright red-ish orange in color (and again, this time there were 2).  They appeared completely out of nowhere as if someone turned on a light.  They were side-by-side and then within a few seconds of appearing (in which they were all so simply hovering), they completely darted again across the sky so fast that if I blinked I would have not seen them.   I have NEVER been a believer in UFO's nor the paranormal, but one thing is clear, certain and for sure, what I witnessed both times was NOT a shooting star, they were not regular aircrafts and nothing about them was ""normal"" by any means.  This time I called my wife, whom was in bed sleeping, to tell her because I simply could NOT wrap my mind around what I saw.   Now I am not an expert, I am not an astronomer nor anything else in the related field, but this my friends was NOTHING from earth nor was it the standard meteor-type incident. This was certainly paranomal!",2015-01-07T00:00:00,41.6005,-72.8764

I live in Sanford, FL, just around the corner of the Sanford airport.  Last night, I saw 4 orange/red glowing orbs above my house starting around 10:00pm.  The first one I saw while I was driving home.  It was hovering over a commercial building.   As soon as I stopped my car to see it better, it started moving north.  I got back in my car and drove home (about 4 blocks away).  I was watching it the whole time.  It eventually just vanished in an area that it didn't make sense for it to vanish.   As soon as I got home, I had to change the windshield wipers on my car.  I was telling my husband about what I just saw because it reminded me of a story our neighbor told us when we lived in Casselberry, FL, last year.  She had seen 3 orange lights flying above our house.  I had also seen similar lights when I lived in Pompano Beach, FL, about 2 years ago. As soon as I was done telling him what I’d just seen, another orange light came from over the horizon.  It flew in the same flight path as the first one I saw.  We sat there and watched it the whole time (roughly 5-7 minutes).  It flew right over our heads and did not make a sound. It seemed to be the size of a small car about 1,000 feet off the ground.  It disappeared right as we heard a jet from the airport taking off.   About 20 minutes later, as we were finishing replacing my windshield wipers, another orange light appeared, again in the same flight path as the other 2.  We watched that one appear over the horizon, and when it was about halfway through the path the other 2 had taken, yet another one appeared and flew the same path.  Right around the same place that the other 2 disappeared, so did these two.  It almost seems like they were going into an invisible mothership or something.  Because they weren't high enough to be hidden by clouds, and they weren't far enough to fall out of our range of sight. They were a dull orange (similar to metal halide street lights) around the front and sides.  The rear had red lights and some type of glowing red “antenna” could be visible form the back.  When they were directly above us, you could see a very faint white light alternating flashes from the front and back.  A couple hours later, helicopters flew nearby, you could hear them and see their flashing lights distinctly. Whatever the orange/red lights are, they are definitely not planes or helicopters. I've checked the box at the bottom about being contacted by an investigator.  These lights seem to be coming up near us for the last 3 years.  Coincidentally, that's how long I've known my husband.   Last year, after the neighbor told us she saw lights over our street, my husband told me about how he feels like he's been abducted when he was a kid.  He showed me a place on his foot that appeared after his apparent abduction (I think he said it was about 20 years ago).  Anyway, this spot on his foot looks like a drill hole and has not healed since he got it.   I'm wondering if there may be some correlation between his alleged abduction and the fact that it seems like I'm seeing UFOs all the time now. Please contact me by email.

I got up and looked out expecting to see an animal and was surprised to see a white dome shaped half sphere to the Northeast protruding up from behind a ridgeline over the ocean. She said she had been watching it for a few minutes already thinking that her eyes were playing tricks on her. The dome was about the size of a saucer held at arm’s length in the sky. It appeared to be a moon halo, however there was no moon that morning since it was a new moon. It was a very bright white ring that was very pronounced. It appeared stationary but then I realized it was moving in the direction of her house on Mariner’s Ridge in Hawaii Kai from the northeast to the southwest. It appeared to be moving the same speed as the few clouds that were in the sky so I thought maybe it w! as some kind of weird reflection from the small clouds. When it got closer I realized it was a perfect circle and was very large. I would say it appeared to cover half the distance of the sky. There was no noise and I didn’t see any light source that could create a halo like that. It was generally clear except for a few small clouds, so it wasn’t something reflecting off of the ground onto clouds or anything like that. We watched it for about 5 minutes until it went over the house. We have no idea what it was and the best way to describe it was a very pronounced large white moon halo, minus the moon and moving at about 10 miles an hour.",2014-10-03T00:00:00,,

As I walked outside  around 7:47 (PM), I saw my neighbors pointing at the sky above my house.  There were four lights in the sky.  They didn’t have form or a craft shape.  It certainly was not flares or lanterns.  The lights bounced back and forth meeting each other in the center than bounced back away from each other at times they moved in a semi circle went back away and bounced to the center almost meeting each other. They stayed the same distance in the sky the duration, about the height of a landing airplane. I am so happy there were other witness’s! I don’t have a video camera I tried FaceTime to my daughter to see if she could also verify seeing them but she couldn’t see it through my I Phone camera. I kept wondering if it was some sort of spotlight or human device but I could not trace anything from the ground that appeared to be shining light towards the sky or any light source. I continued to go outside to see if it stopped, the event happened for over an hour stopping around 8:56 PM. At times, the lights would slightly separate and turn into two lights each but there was no pattern or count to it. Because only two would separate at a time and turn into two lights then back to one and bounce again towards the center- at times slightly traveling in a circle turning back and then bouncing in the center but the pattern was random. I did not feel fear; more mesmerized wondering what it was. The most irritating thing about it was to have no way to record it. Moreover, my Nikon doesn’t have a night vision.  I am familiar with astronomy, aircrafts, satellites, etc it was nothing I could explain. I actually worried it could be orbs that are spotted before an earthquake or something. I think many would term it ghosts, because it was not a bright light it was more cloudy (transparent) grayish looking.  The circles of light were not perfect in shape were round but not exact in size in relation to one another. I continue to try to find a logical explanation for the lights, I cannot find one. I watched the sky last night September 26, 2014 to see if it happened again (they didn’t come back last night), and will continue to watch nightly to see if it comes back. I drew diagrams of how the mystery lights traveled but am sad to report I don’t have a picture or video to prove it.  I DID take notes on the event in my journal.

I cannot remember the exact date but it was during the summer of ’98 or ’99, at the Canadian Forces Base in Trenton, Ontario.  I was a military Air Traffic Controller with the rank of Captain at the time of this event. The first event was while I was home in bed, around 01:00 in the morning, and I awoke and looked up and there was a green coloured circle on the ceiling about 1cm in diameter and moving slowly across the ceiling for about 1 meter.  I sat up to take a closer look but it disappeared.  I thought perhaps I was imagining it or dreamt it and thought nothing of it and laid back down.   About half an hour to an hour later I awoke again and looked up and saw the same light again, in a different spot, slowly moving across the ceiling.  My wife at the time also noticed it and asked me about it but like the last time, it only lasted a couple seconds.  It almost appeared to be a laser pointer but in green and a wider diameter.  I checked under the bed, in the closet, out the window, just in case someone was playing a prank, but all the children were asleep, and I could not find anyway a light could get displayed on the ceiling without us being aware.  I thought it very strange but could not explain it, so I didn’t think much of it. The second event happened about a week later, while I was working a midnight shift in the control tower.  It was again about 01:00 in the morning when I saw a green sphere in the east near the vicinity of Belleville.  It was hard to judge the distance but it was about perhaps 10 km away and roughly the daimeter of the main body of a C-130 Hercules aircraft, not the newer stretched version.  The green colour looked the same as the light on my bedroom ceiling.   I was stunned by what I saw and asked the radar terminal if they had anything on their scope 10 east but they replied negative.  I asked the meteorological section if there was anything that could create a ball of green light that could hover, perhaps ball lightning, but again, Met replied negative.   One of the ground crew on the ramp called up to the tower asking me if I saw the light, and so I knew it was not just myself seeing it.  I was too stunned to think of recording it, which is a shame and I truly regret not having done that.   After about 10 seconds of just hovering in one spot, about 1,000 AGL, it disappeared to the north.  It did not disappear in that it suddenly wasn’t visible, but it accelerated with such speed that it disappeared out of sight in less than a second.   I have witnessed many modern fighter jets at full acceleration with their afterburners going and that would be magnitude of orders slower than what that ball of green light moved at. No human would be able to withstand the G-force that would have generated accelerating so quickly. I had not told anyone this story since at least half the people ridiculed me and accused me of being on drugs or making it up.  I searched to see if there were any other reports of such an event at that time but never did find any. Not sure if you accept reports dating this far back but while I cannot remember the exact date, I will always remember the details and it gives me the chills sometimes when I recall the event.",2014-09-18T00:00:00,44.09245652173913,-77.57383695652175

Military?!) would've liked to know if it was seen?! Didn't know what to think of this or what to do?! (Maybe the pilot pushed the wrong button & accidentally made them visible?!) don't understand the flame part?!  (Unless it's part of the test?!)   I haven't read that many other sightings- but so far I've never heard of or read anyone seeing this exact type of craft.  So I thought, after finding this site, I should report it. This sighting was several years ago (around Sept- Oct 2000, it's now 9-15-2014.) we didn't know what to think of what we saw or who to possibly report it to- so just now reporting it, partly since I found this website.",2014-09-18T00:00:00,37.6312,-98.7678
Round probe which appeared to be emiting sparks.,Brooklyn,MI,1998-06-30T21:30:00,oval,15 minutes,"Occurred : 6/30/1998 21:30  (Entered as : 1998 9:30) Reported: 9/10/2014 1:14:48 PM 13:14 Posted: 9/18/2014 Location: Brooklyn, MI Shape: Oval Duration:15 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113439.html,"Round probe which appeared to be emiting sparks. Yesterday (September 9, 2014) I was watching a bunch of UFO shows on direct TV and they mentioned your organization.  Up to this point I did not know there was a place to report UFO sightings. My wife and I lived in Manitou Beach, Michigan between June 1998 and July 2002.  I believe it was the fall of 1998 when I had an experience with an unidentified flying object.   I drove from my house on Devils Lake Hwy to Brooklyn, Michigan, in the evening to pick up some Chinese food for supper.  Returning home, I drove south out of Brooklyn and drove down Brooklyn Rd., which runs next to MIS (Michigan International Speedway).  When I arrived at the corner of Brooklyn Road and US12 I saw an object in the night sky which appeared to be approximately above Round Lake Highway.   I pulled off the road at the corner and sat in my car watching the object.  The object appeared to be the size of a basketball, it changed colors from yellow, to orange, to blue on the perimeter and appeared to be emitting sparks.  The object moved extremely slow and ran parallel to US 12, moving from the west to the east, and the object was approximately 100 feet above the tree line.  I watched this object for approximately 15 minutes and it maintained the same height, never changing its altitude. I served in the United States Navy and US Army National Guard.  The object had characteristics of a flare with some notable differences.  Flares do not maintain their altitude and fall to the ground diagonally unless there is a strong wind - and there was no wind.   I thought about a meteor but the item moved much to slow.  I tried to put a rational explanation as to what I was seeing in the night sky but came up empty.   At this point, I had worked for the Michigan Department of Corrections in Parole/Probation for over 10 years, and believe I’m a confident observer.  I watched the item from the time it was over Round Lake Highway until it had moved on its easterly course until it had probable passed over M50, at which time I decided to head for home, but the object continued on an easterly course at the same height and continued to follow US 12. The though crossed my mind that I was witnessing an Unidentified Flying Object, which alarmed me to some degree, but I thought the item was small to be a flying saucer and, unless they have a shrink ray, there would be no way for the object to abduct me or beam me aboard.   I thought the object might be a probe, but the only significant land mark in the area is Michigan International Speedway.  I should also note there are no military installations in the area and there was no events taking place at Michigan International Speedway, so there was no reasons for a flare to be in the night sky.   I’m extremely confident that what I saw was not a flare of any type and that’s why I’m writing to you to report an unidentified flying object.  If we had cell phones with cameras back then, I would have loved to have taken a photograph of the object because it was really interesting.  This is the first time I’ve told anyone of the incident with the exception of my wife and kids. Throughout the shows that I watched I did not see any reports of UFO’s matching the description of the item that I saw but found the vast array and variety of spacecraft reported which makes me wonder if we’re not being visited by various entities, and then that brings up the logical question - why?  DNA samples, intelligence gathering, mapping, scientific studies by entities visiting our planet lead me to the question of intention.  While I was in the National Guard I served as an intelligence analyst for awhile and it was my job to evaluate potential threats and create counter measures.  Time after time I have seen on the shows about UFO’s visiting earth where the spacecraft have been around military installations and other vital infrastructure around the world.  Often we hear a comparison between technological differences and how earthlings are new to the cosmic scope and how entities visiting earth are so much more advanced - but then there are reports of so many cra! shed space ships.  Even in our infancy we have gps, collision alarms for aircraft (and cars now), and a host of other technological devices - so it seems rational to believe any advanced entity would also have these items so I’m not sure why there would be so many crashed spaceships. In closing:  I believe in what I see with my own eyes.  I cannot put a rational explanation to what I saw (which does not mean there is not a rational explanation).  Even if I had not experienced an unidentified flying object I believe there is life beyond earth just as a matter of chance - as a gambler you play the odds and if you look into the heavens you would have to be ignorant to believe we are alone.  I think it is shameful UFO sighting are not taken seriously by governments around the world because as an intelligence analyst you need data in order to reach conclusions and to come up with logical responses.  I graduated from Western Michigan University with a double major - Criminal Justice/Sociology, which means I like to collect evidence, look at it and draw my own conclusions.  I also like to study people and societies and cannot help but wonder why some societies seem to have more experiences with other entities then others and wonder what significance this ph! enomenon has in the larger picture.

THE COMPLETE SAUCER STORY:  WHAT WE SAW AND HOW WE SAW 						IT TWICE!  It was the middle of the week.,Smith Mountain Lake,VA,1976-10-06T20:30:00,disk,20 minutes,"Occurred : 10/6/1976 20:30  (Entered as : 100676 20:30) Reported: 10/6/2014 12:06:30 PM 12:06 Posted: 10/10/2014 Location: Smith Mountain Lake (near Gretna and Penhook), VA Shape: Disk Duration:20 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114279.html,"It was the middle of the week.  My cousin knew what he was doing.  On a clear, comfortably cool late September afternoon, he'd arranged for all four to meet at my store, at around 5:00 p.m.  Knowing that schools were in session and that families that spent summers at Smith Mountain Lake had left until the next spring, we were excited by the prospect of having the lake all to ourselves. We were eager for the camaraderie and fun that would follow. In a very real sense, the rest of us trusted him to make that happen.  He had the big car, his dad's hand-me-down Oldsmobile, a luxury car in every respect.  He also had the key to his dad's boat, a zippy outboard that had plenty of room for all of us and our usually useless fishing poles.  On similar excursions, we'd used the same gear.  On that clear, cool late afternoon, we welcomed the chance to feel the fresh lake air as we zoomed through it. But that wasn't all. My cousin also had the key to his parents' lake house. In fact, the boat was waiting for us at his family's dock. From the house, the back yard sloped down to the dock; it jutted out about fourteen feet into the small cove. When my cousin slowed to turn right onto a black top that would wind down  to the front of his parents' home, we saw no others cars were there.  My cousin hurried into the house, turned on the lights, and grabbed the keys to the boat as the rest of us walked down to the waiting topless craft. We took our seats. A minute later, my cousin untied the boat and hopped in; he slipped into the captain's seat and started the outboard. Carefully, without a wake, he guided us out of the quiet cove and onto the lake. To our left, on the western side of the lake, we spotted a few homes; they were no where close to us.  Beyond the bank of the lake, we saw what we knew to be the outskirts of Roanoke, VA, about fifty miles away.  The evening sky was that clear.   We didn't talk much; the outboard engine made anything less than a scream impossible to hear. But we weren't on the lake to chat and reminisce. That would come later, after we'd returned the boat to its dock. After fishing, my cousin announced it was time to raid the fridge. As he led us there, he tossed the boat keys into a dish atop a buffet next to what was a casual space that was part dining room and part kitchen. Waiting for us was a table big enough for six. Although the other three men wanted to sit and and schmooze about the lake and our fishing and whatever gossip that needed discussing, I wanted to see more of the night sky and the dark, glassy lake. They didn't seem to notice that I reached for the sliding glass door just behind the chair at the head of the table.  It was that close; the door opened onto a small balcony, no bigger than four by seven feet. I sat with my back against the sliding glass door. Now and then, I'd stand.  Behind me were muffled sounds of laughter; I preferred the less noisy evening and its clear black sky. No one seemed to miss me.  On that peaceful night, the lights of distant Roanoke were easy to see.  In fact, as I scanned the horizon, then looked up at the myriad of stars, I was struck by something I could not explain. That's why I stared for a while, perhaps eight to ten minutes, at a dot of light that seemed out of place. When I looked at the lights of Roanoke to compare it, I noticed it didn't have the same soft radiance. Also, it was much higher than the city's lights. Looking up at the stars, I saw that it was too low to be a star; it didn't shine like a star's light. It was constant, almost like the dot from an off-white laser beam. Puzzled as I was, I wasn't alarmed.  Indeed, I couldn't tell whether it was moving. But it must have been moving, I reasoned.  Otherwise, why did I not see it when I first studied the sky? It had come into view out of nowhere.  At the time, I didn't know why.  Now I do.  IT WAS MOVING THAT FAST, TOO FAST FOR ME TO SEE IT.  So I just sat there as I watched and waited. Although it seemed stationery, I believed there was an explanation that I hadn't discovered.  Not wanting to disturb the other three guys inside, I sat alone, completely focused on the beam. Whatever they were discussing inside couldn't have been as fascinating. As much as I believed that, I couldn't have and didn't anticipate what happened next because I had not understood the reason why I noticed it in the first place. IT WAS TRAVELING AT A SPEED BEYOND ANYTHING I HAD EVER SEEN. Well beyond Roanoke, the dot seemed to shake. In less than a second, I saw what it was. As I mentioned, in less than a second, it transformed from a mere dot to a dot that moved to a recognizable object.  That object never made a sound.  It never displayed any exhaust; they was no indication of propulsion that blew against the surface of the lake or that stirred the trees. LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET AWAY FROM ME, I SAW A FLYING SAUCER! IT HAD STOPPED INSTANTLY AT A SPOT ABOUT 75 FEET IN THE AIR! Alarms went off inside me; I was absolutely afraid and absolutely amazed at the same time. For a few moments, I could not move. Since there was no place to hide, I just sat still and stared. The spacecraft hovered without a sound and without moving. Although I felt exposed and completely vulnerable, I calmed myself enough to reach behind me and open the sliding glass door.  Without screaming, I insisted that all of the guys come out and take a look. I tried not to sound terrified. All of them came to see what I had seen. They were speechless. Probably as fearful as I had been, they didn't say much. It could have been that they didn't want to be noticed. Chances are they didn't want to believe what they saw. As I watched them, I moved to give them more room. My fear subsided. Instead of feeling like I had to hide or make myself unseeable, I felt the crisp night air and I studied the silent but hovering saucer. Curiosity had overtaken my fear.                              DESCRIPTION OF THE FLYING SAUCER When I saw the shape of the saucer, I wasn't as surprised as I might have been. It wasn't a massive, lumbering craft that was gigantic and overwhelming. It didn't look like a flying city. Instead, it  had a form I recognized, one I had seen many times since having first watched the Flintstones. In the back of my mind, I wondered how it could have been described so accurately IF NO ONE HAD EVER SEEN ONE BEFORE! As it seemed to rest just above the treetops, it seemed to be on a surveillance mission. For a few minutes, it seemed to be sitting and it seemed to be watching us! The flying saucer did look like a saucer with a cup on top of it in the proportion that resembled a coffee cup upside down on its plate. Amazed that it hovered or moved without as much as a whoosh and without any sign of a jet's propulsion, I studied the top of the cup. It was ringed by what appeared to be square windows filled with alternating red and white light. It was clear that some energy source was radiating that bright light. What puzzled me was why one window of light was white and the next red and the next white and so on. I had no idea what that pattern meant unless there was some kind of alternating polarity that controlled and balanced and propelled the craft. As I studied it, I found it remarkable that most drawings I'd seen of flying saucers resembled the one that was visiting us. Because time was so different for those who were able to travel at warp speed, I thought about other sightings. Strange as this may sound, it could be, to the aliens who piloted the space ships, that the Roswell incident had occurred  only seconds or minutes before. My mind was in overdrive. Guessing at the dimensions, I figured the bottom of the craft, the saucer, perfectly circular, was about 40-50 feet wide. The cup on top appeared to be a little more than half that size; it appeared to be about 15 feet tall.  The entire ship looked to be absolutely symmetrical. Because the sky was so dark, I couldn't tell the color of the ship.  Although I had assumed it was silvery and metallic, it appeared to be a darker gray.  As we watched the saucer seem to watch us, I didn't ask anyone about its color.  That didn't seem important then.  For about three minutes, it appeared to allow us to study it.  Of course, I wondered whether it was also studying us. If so, I'm sure we looked to be awkward and quite ordinary. But that night, as I watched the craft, I also felt very special.  That's why, when it finally moved, I said ""Wow!""  It left the same way it had come, without any sign of movement. It didn't shake or rev its engine or send blasts of air that caused it to move.  Rather than any of that, it zipped up, then zagged at a 90 degree angle at a speed that caused it to disappear the same way it had come, in a second, maybe less. By that time, I felt like waving goodbye since I had watched it travel from a great distance to us. Having lost all my fear, I would have thanked its pilots for having made a short visit. Actually, by that time, I felt as if their visit had been too short. As the other men went through the sliding glass door to return to their seats at the table, I said something to my cousin that seemed most important. ""I wish I'd had a pair of binoculars,"" I said. ""The saucer was so close that I might have been able to look inside its windows."" Because I knew my cousin's father was an avid photographer who loved Leica cameras, I wondered whether he might have had a pair of Leica quality binoculars also. He did! Less than a minute later, he handed them to me. Then he closed the sliding glass door. I slipped the binoculars' strap over my head and returned to my station on the balcony. Although I'd never heard of a flying saucer making a return visit, I wasn't about to leave my perch in case it did. Of course, I didn't tell the others that I was waiting for it to come back. They had opened a bag of Nachos and were probably trying to make sense of what they'd just seen. Unlike the three of them, I felt like a Civil Air Patrol cadet as I scoured the sky for signs of now familiar aliens. If I'd been given one wish at that moment in time, it would have been that the flying saucer would return. To my joyful surprise, less than ten minutes later, it did!                 THE SAUCER'S SECOND VISIT! With the Zeiss binoculars, I knew I could focus on the craft if it returned.  I couldn't tell whether the guys inside thought I was crazy to return to the  balcony with binoculars. Chances are they were comparing me to a comic book character. If so, I didn't care because there was too much to think about. Overwhelmed by the first observation, I was sloughing off old ideas and creating new ones. What I pondered most was this concern: who could I talk to about what I had seen? Who could help me understand?  Who would know how important it was? What if I could never explain or understand what had happened? In other words, the visit was like a gift that, once unwrapped, brought with it its own problems. Had cell phones been available then, I could have taken a selfie with the flying saucer in the background! But without a picture, who would have believed me? Despite all of those troublesome aspects, I did want to see the craft again. So I waited a little less than ten minutes. No one from the inside bothered to check on me; there was no tap on the glass door followed by a wave. There was just me and my wishful thinking. When the saucer surprised me by returning, I almost waved hello. No longer was I afraid or apprehensive. Immediately, I aimed the binoculars at the spacecraft and I saw what I'd wanted to see. Filling up each lens was one of the saucer's windows. I saw the light streaming out so intensely that it was opaque. I couldn't see into or through the light, not at all. Since it was resting at the exact spot as before, I pulled open the sliding glass door and didn't whisper. ""You gotta see this,"" I insisted. One by one, they came onto the balcony and looked at the saucer using the binoculars. When they finished, they marched back inside; I could tell the three men were much quieter than the time before. I was too. What had made the craft return? Had the alien crew decided I was friendly? Did they want to stop and chat? I didn't know what to expect. For a few minutes, I just stared. At the time, I had no idea how rare a sighting we'd had. As the others went back inside, I took one last look through the binoculars; the windows of the cup part of the ship were so clear and so close as to seem to be within reach. I put down the Zeiss and its powerful lenses. Although I knew what was coming, I didn't want to see it go before I'd make some kind of contact. Entertaining the thought that I could communicate with the aliens and their craft amused me. Who was I to think I was more to them than a minor blip of energy waves on a monitoring screen? They were the sentient beings; I was just a guy on a tiny balcony dressed in jeans and a t-shirt waving at a craft so powerful yet so slight that it may have come from a different universe. Awed by that thought, I saluted. Seconds passed. I stood there, no taller than a fragile young pine; I sought to memorize the night and its stillness, uninterrupted by the silent spacecraft, so much more remarkable than any night I'd ever seen.  One last time, it zigged and it zagged as if that signature motion was all that was required to ramp up its speed to much faster than light. In a split second, as it sped away, it disappeared. The first time, its departure had been breathtaking; this time, I was reminded of a friend leaving or of a western movie where a hero rides off toward a distant horizon. Then, as now, I had no idea where it was going. All that I knew was that I wasn't the one to follow. Reluctantly, I returned to the group inside. They were ready to leave. I looked back at the balcony, then returned returned the binoculars to my cousin. ""Thanks,"" I said. Although I didn't add that I was thanking him for a night I'd never forget, I think he sensed that. For years after that, almost until the time he died, we'd reflect on our memories of that night on the lake. Indeed, he was willing to discuss the enormity of our sighting, the profound changes it had brought to our perspectives. As we talked the last time, I had no idea I'd never again discuss our special night with him. That's why this short book is dedicated to Andy and the memories we shared on Smith Mountain Lake.         REFLECTIONS ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A THIRD SIGHTING Playful as our drive to Smith Mountain Lake had been, our trip home was quiet and uneventful. Although each of us had seen the flying saucer twice, not one  of us could explain why. Nor did we have a clue as to what caused it to meet us at Smith Mountain. Were they attempting to connect with or contact us? But if they'd wanted to talk about an upended cosmology, they could have talked to me. At least that's what I was telling myself. After all, if they were smart enough to pilot a craft all the way from wherever they came from, they were probably able to analyze and translate our language in seconds. I do remember trying to speak to the craft in order to get the beings in it to say hello. But they didn't respond. Instead, they took off and sped away in an instant without saying goodbye. Of course, I could be wrong about that. Their first visit could have been their hello. Their second could have been their way of saying goodbye. If so, it's been one that's lasted more than 35 years. Now that the weather is cooling and children have returned to school, it's time for me to return to the Lake. This time, I'll go by myself, and I'll take a camera. In case anyone asks why, I'll tell them I'm on an adventure. As for the camera, I'll tell them I never know what I might see, the images I don't want to miss...this time.",2014-10-10T00:00:00,,

A few years after that I had the weirdest mark on my leg, it was a triangle that was made by 3 dots except each dot was a triangle and it was deep red like a bruise red.  Perfectly spaced out, perfect triangles. This is a true story as I'm getting to old for made up drama.  I just really want to know what we seen.

There was one set of bleachers that faced the football field, and behind the football field was a forest.  It was early evening, and there was still plenty of sunlight, not a cloud in the sky.  Out of nowhere a greenish ball of bright light appeared just above the tree line and was perfectly still. It was a solid light, not blinking or anything.  After approx. 10–15 seconds, the ball of light shot off to the right faster than I have ever seen anything move.  It moved faster than anything man made could even come close to matching.

So, this happened 50 years ago, but the memory is as clear as yesterday.  I was 14 yrs. old at a camp on the Delaware River, working as a nature counselor.  A large field there was perfect for astronomy and on good viewing nights, I would be out trying to locate constellations.   On the incident night I started about 2300 and continued to 0100, the date was about 20 Aug., '64, but may have been a few days before.  There was no moon, the sky was ink black with brilliant stars, at this time.  I was looking south.  I saw what appeared to be some shooting stars, not uncommon, but then a star moving as fast as a shooting star caught my eye. A light, as a bright star just to the left of the center of the sky moved from left to right, stopped then turned south moved about a quarter distance of the sky stopped turned back to the left recrossed turned again a returned to the starting point.  The path was rectangular and did not look like an aircraft in a holding pattern, as the turn points was sharp right angles.  I had started studying for flight training and had 10-12 hours by age 16, expensive, worked pumping gas at an airport. But, in 1964 was just a dream with books. The item that just was unnatural was the exact, clean, crisp 90 degree turn with no change in speed.  You could have used a right angle to draw the event.  I recognised then that for the turn to appear that crisp the object would have to be very far away but I had no comparison for distance, however the velocity was so high that it covered over 1/2 of the sky in 3 seconds.  So, see object point of light, high speed 3 seconds, stop acute turn, 2 seconds down, stop acute turn, 3 second flight, stop acute turn flight 2 seconds return to start point. This flight plath consisted of 3 cycles, then slight deviation out of pattern north for a second then gone, looked like acceleration then gone, not visisble. Since then I graduated college, an infantry officer, medical school, and a instrument rated pilot and an AME. I knew at the time this was not a conventional aircraft.  The size of the flight path would require and extremely fast aircraft at distance flying squares.  On the other hand the aircraft would be much closer 10-15 miles, but then aircraft navigation lights, landing lights would be see and the turns would be gentle banking. This was what illuminated, no twinkle, high speed, sharp 90 turns, then just disappeared. There it is, what it is.  I'm seen a lot of aircraft from the ground and from the cockpit.  Never since have seen anything like this event. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",,,

Very little traffic at that time, which we were driving it, 11 at night on a week day. I notice what I thought was nothing more than an plane about five minutes into the twenty minute drive.  Then this plane just started jumping around in the sky still a long distant from where we were..  I brought this to the attention to my buddy and we kept driving toward it, About to our destination, this damn thing jumped right above us.  All I can remember is a bright  white light.  The stereo was blasting before then the light and silence. The next thing I recall was sitting in my car off the road, nothing  worked.  Luck would have it, my buddy had an aunt that was very close  to where we were. We knocked on her door for ever before she finely opened it up.  The first thing out of her mouth was I thought you were the UFO’s.  She then let us in she offered ed us a coup of coffee, we sat down and said nothing for about an hour. just sat there drank out coffee. Pretty soon her husband got home and asked what was up. I  told him my car won’t start. we then got to my car and it fired right up.  It wasn’t until then I notice that i was almost light out. We had lost at least four hours. We were so shook up got home and loaded all out firearms as if that would do any good. sat there until the air force started flying the area not normal.  OK thin in 1990 I was sitting home thinking about space travel, lets just say my life was impacted by that encounter even though time had passed I still thought about it a lot. All of a sudden I got what I would describe as a download of information so intense that it rendered my parallelized for about four hours.  I begged for it to stop and it did.

I am sure of the date and time, as it was the 4th of July, and my brother and I were living in Phoenix at the time.  We had decided to go to a small desert park near Camelback Mountain, climb some rocks and watch the fireworks in the city below.   We parked at a dead end street and were walking toward the desert when I noticed an odd thing in the sky, moving rather slowly.  It was nearing dusk and the sky was cloudless.  The item was dark and had an irregular shape.   I pointed it out to my brother and he quickly went back to his truck to get a pair of binoculars that he always carried with him.  We estimated that it was about 800 feet above the ground, and it was moving south to north, very smoothly, as if propelled in some manner (not moving erratically or intermittently as a balloon might do).  If it was at the estimated height of 800 feet then we guessed that it might have! been from 10 to 12 feet in diameter.   We each got a good look at it in the binoculars, and it appeared to be nothing so much as an uprooted tree with roots dangling below.  There was some kind of rotating platform on the upper portion of the “tree roots,” and some kind of a weird-looking appendage that stuck out of the top of the rotating platform.  The appendage was very thin and slightly curved, and appeared to be dangling something over the side of the rotating platform.   Astonished, we stopped two passers-by who were also heading into the rock formations and pointed out the bizarre thing in the sky.  They took a look at it through the binoculars as well, made a comment about how odd it was (I guess!) and then strolled off.   We stood and watched the thing disappear over the mountains into the darkening sky, total time of sighting was approximately 10 minutes.  There were no lights on it, and it made no sound.   Later that night my brother and I agreed to separately draw what we had seen and compare the pictures.  It was clear that we did see the same thing.  We have no idea what it was.  My brother has since passed on but he was an astronomy major in college, and I had spent six years in the military.  We were both over 40 years old at the time of the sighting.   We considered all possibilities, but could not even venture a guess as to how such a thing could be hoaxed.  Since that time, I’ve heard about the “jellyfish” UFOs and have wondered if that is what it was.   Since we expected to be spending time in the dark outside, we had no camera with us and this was long before the cell phone age, unfortunately.   I just wanted to mention this event which we did not report at the time, in case anyone else has seen something similar and would like to know if others have had the experience. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello Mr. Davenport,  thank you so much for noticing my report.  My brother who was with me at the time passed on in Florida in 2009 and many of his effects were boxed and given to friends, so I don't have his original drawing, and I have moved so many times since then, that I'm sure I have no idea where mine went.  I could certainly re-draw it, however.  It's not a thing I'm ever going to forget. I've been a Coast listener for many years, but it never occurred to me to report my sighting, until I recently heard you mention that you were interested in past reports, as well as new ones.   I was visiting your site for the first time this past weekend and reading mostly about the Washington reports since I live here now.  I went to Arizona's listings too and checked around the date of my sighting and saw there were some reports from that date in Arizona, but nothing very similar to mine.   Interesting that you mentioned Mars, by the way -- I've always been particularly fascinated by that planet and have been following Curiosity's progress toward Mt. Sharp over the last few years.  I also spend a lot of time on Google Mars just roaming around to see what they will allow us to see, and I never get tired of that.  I can't wait until we have Google Venus and Google Saturn, etc.!  I was impressed to find that the dates of your collected reports went back so far.  What a great resource for researchers.  Now that I'm familiar with your site, I'll check it often, and be sure to add my own sightings, should I have any more in the future.  Kudos for all the very hard work you must do to keep it organized and available to everybody. Again, I'll be glad to redraw the UFO I saw.  I do have a cell phone available so I can send a pic through email or as a phone message attachment, or I can just snail-mail it to you if you like.  Let me know how you'd prefer to receive it.

He was speaking to his friend who was standing next to him and when I looked over they were both looking up in the air pointing.   From where I was standing the trees were blocking by view so I quickly ran over and as soon as I could see the sky, I was blown away, as I initially saw a formation of aircraft moving through the sky; there were approximately 6-7.   I then looked further to the right and saw a second formation in the sky of 6-8 more.  They seemed to temporarily hover in the air and then continue to move sideways through the sky in formation.  They all looked just like a solid bright light and what caught everyone's attention is that they were all flying so close together, or at least closer than an normal aircraft would fly together.   Also, they appeared to be far higher in the air than I had ever seen any aircraft in my life, and that includes my time in the military and and as a civilian.  I have never seen even military aircraft moving in that type of formation.  They were extremely high in the air.  Higher than I believed normal aircraft could fly.   There were two aircraft that were not flying within the formations and were larger and brighter than the others in formations and it was amazing because they would be moving in one direction and then instantly change direction at like 45 degree angles unlike anything I had ever seen and s movement normal aircraft is not capable of doing.  It was not a turn it was an instantaneous pivot in the sky.  Those two appeared to be able to fly more freely but also seemed to be guiding the formations almost like how one man marches a formation of soldiers; he is not part of the formation but he is giving the orders on how they move.  And then there was one other aircraft that was flying out of both the formations, and was also brighter and bigger than the others. At this point I ran over to my house to inform my wife to get me the number for the local press and for the local police (who referred me to your call center).  While she did that I pulled out my ipod and began recording their movements through the sky and narrating the entire experience.  As I looked up I noticed three aircraft that were not in the formations could no longer be seen. I ran back to the two guys who were still there watching.  They explained that the three big and bright aircraft had all disappeared.  They said that two of them had shot up into the air making an X and then disappeared into the sky.  They said the third one simply moved upward quickly and then disappeared as well.   I again went back over to my house and by at this time I could no longer see any of the aircraft.  Then entire incident took what looked like directly over the Reno Airport.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I did did not know whether to be amazed or scared as I am not sure what they were doing there.   At this time I do not wish to include my video recording of the event due to the sensitivity of the content.",2014-10-03T00:00:00,39.50650741150443,-119.8174511061947

This event occurred after I had dropped off my girlfriend to her parents’ house on a night in January 2012.  ((sic.  2013)) 11:20 PM - After dropping off my girlfriend to her parents’ house, after having dinner and drinks at Novi’s Fountain Walk on a Thursday night (We were at Bar Louie), I pulled my car out of the drive way to head home, and began heading north 100 Yards on Elizabeth Ln in Novi, heading towards 10 Mile Road.  In the 100 yards to the exit of the subdivision, I could see a white light in the sky several miles away (less than 5 Miles).   The light was descending slowly, straight down.  As it was descending the light changed to a blue.  Thinking that it was a plane falling out of the sky possibly crashing I stopped my SUV 20 yards from 10 Mile Road (still Elizabeth Lane).  Watching the slow descent the light, that I could now see was spherical almost like a ball, it slowed just above the line of the trees that were in my line of vision.  It was clear, cold night, the air was crisp, and visibility was very clear.  There were no clouds in the sky, and stars could be seen.  The light was about 10 times larger than the stars.   When the light slowed and stopped, it descended, it started to change color to a green, then to white again, and then to a purple.  These were slow transitions and not flashing transitions.  The sphere then began moving up and then diagonal.  As it was rising I could see that, it was now changing to shades of red and orange.   I sat parked in my car for about 5 minutes.  I then opened my door of my car and stood outside.  I stood outside for a couple minutes hoping somebody would drive by so that I could point it out to somebody that came by.  Several cars went swiftly past on 10 Mile, but no one stopped, and no one came down Elizabeth Lane.   Not wanting to feel crazy, I called my girlfriend to step outside her house or look out a window to see this.  She refused to come outside as she had already changed for bed, and it was cold outside.  She tried to look out several windows, that faced the north, but all windows were blocked by trees and then next doo! r house.   As we talked, I watched as the ball/sphere began to circle back to where I originally saw it, all the time changing colors in a smooth transition from red, white, orange, white, blue, purple, white, green.  At times it seemed to glow larger and at times smaller.  The ball moved up and down in diagonal smooth patterns that I have never seen a plane or helicopter move like.   After 15-20 minutes, I gave up on waiting for someone to stop to witness, two cars entered the sub never giving notice to me, half in my car, half out of my car.  I final began my drive home, noticing the ball began to move east towards slightly.  I eventually lost sight of the light when I made a turn south and headed home down Taft Road. Before leaving, I did try to photograph the object, my camera on my iphone 4s would not focus on the object in the night sky, and the camera could not pick up the light.

There was clearly some kind of field or energy emanating from the object, my best description being an electric smoky haze.

This happened on 2 nights, one was the 19th or 26th of August and again in September, about 5 weeks later.  While I did not see a saucer,  it was strange that o could not locate what was creating the lighting effects. This is long but I am trying to get in the many details that were not the usual things I heard and saw almost every Tuesday night for the past 5 or 6 years that I have slept in my car by the river at East Fork, San Gabriel River, up from the city of Azusa, in Los Angeles County. The first years a lot of prospectors stayed there, but the last few years, most of the time I am completely alone.  I have some Google Earth photos of the spot if you want them by email. This is a river fork off Hwy 39, where the highway runs along the top of a steep edge with paths down to the water in the national forest.  I am so alone there most of the time the lst few years that, unless people have seen bears, I leave the car windows down and do not lock the doors or even display my forest pass. I park near a forest service rest room near the 4.96 mile marker on East Fork Road.  The right side seats on my Honda CR-V go down flat to make a bed thatis very comfortable. I always leave the radio on low playing coast 2 coast, and I usually fall asleep part of the time, and miss some of the program, then later wake up and hear the parts I missed. I also an doing research on subjects related to Sitchin’s work, and I almost always have a book that I read  if I wake up and can’t sleep, and I mark pages and sentences related to my work. I am so familiar with the noises, and often complete absence of any sounds at all, that any unusual noise wakes me up. Though people have reported UFO’s, the reports I have heard are not likely to relate to UFOs. I am quit familiar with UFO activity from being a volunteer at UFO and free energy conferences for over 20 years, and going on a lot of trips to spots considered active that few people go to. Several weeks before the first event, two men parked their trailer across the road from where I camp, and leave it to go prospecting in the evenings and during the night.  They leave one dollar store yard light stuck in the ground. Sometimes a truck was left hitched, other times just the trailer was there. Either way from where I park, it often looked like there was some light escaping from a covered window in front of the trailer.  The steep rock faces on both sides of the river seem to be covered with foliage, but when the moon is up the rock face reflects some spots that seem very bright, and you have to know the area to be sure if it is moon or headlights coming down the road to up on a higher road that winds up to connect with other roads.  The slope down the rock face to the river level is so steep and the rocks so solid that you never hear the flow of the river on top by the highway. You have to get out of the car and walk right to the edge to hear anything at all and the water level is so low this summer that you can hardly find a place deep enough to get your body all wet. I was in Army Intelligence, and pay attention to out of place things, and for some reason when I wake at night I always want to a analyze what woke me, and if there are lights, what the source of them is. Where I put the radio on the dash it sometimes needs to be angled to eliminate a buzz, but most of the time the reception is crystal clear.  It was the week before and the week after the first incident, that there was radio interference different from any I had ever heard. I changed to a different radio and still heard it. The night I think was September 14th, the radio was fine. Before  I went to sleep, I thought I saw a sort of very fast strobe light in the sky to the west, but it was so fast and the sky was still somewhat bright, so I could not be sure if I had seen it or  my eyes were playing tricks on me.  It was an extremely quiet night and I woke up later, turning over in bed, and I thought I saw the light again, this time from someplace by the drivers side  back fender.  You know when you have a light source you look at and then away, and you see a dark outline of the object, drifting away in a different place? And sometimes there are several overlapped images fanning out?  Well each time I saw the faint light strobes I saw 30-50 overlapping thin lines like part of a Japanese fan, with the lines going to someplace out of the frame where you assumed they were connected with a pin so the fan could fan out. But I could never see the bottom half of the fan segments, and it would move around! fast. Sometimes I did not hear the sound even though there was no sound at all outside.  I would turn off the radio for a few minutes so I could hear carefully. That first night, after the 4th or 5th time I woke to this, I began to think that the sound was caused by a source that reflected off of the metal parts of the trailer or other metal objects such as the large iron trash cans. And by then I was certain that there was a bluish tint to the strobing lights, as faintly as I could see them. It was the fact that the light always seemed bluish, when nothing else ever did, that made me think it was something real. The second night I saw and heard this,  was about 5-8 weeks later when I came out of sleep and realized that I was hearing a very low sound of electricity fizzling, like signs neon signs do in cheap horror movies, or arc welding when sparks fly around.  I realized then that the low sound was what woke me up, but if I was awake I saw them when there was no sound or it was too low to hear. The truck was not parked by the trailer, but I was almost certain I saw some pale blue light coming through a crack in that window.  Later when I looked over there, I was sure I still saw bluish light, but could not hear any sound. I  decided that the men must be inside the trailer working with some electrical device, and that bluish light was coming out the window where blinds did not meet exactly right. Late the next morning they arrived in the truck, so they had not been there during the night. That night when I used the restroom I did not see the faint strobe light or hear the sound.  But I did wake up a few times and hear the sound and see the faint light, and  tried to pinpoint the direction of the sound, thinking that would help to figure out the light source. I was not able to do it. The guy with the trailer had told me the week before that they (forest service or sheriffs?) told him he had to move it to the north fork for 14 days, then he could come back. But he never did come back, and neither did anyone else.   Many of the guys up there had no place to go, and the place the guy said he planned to move to, had a nightly use fee that the old prospectors could not pay.  Also, it is general knowledge that there is no gold on north fork, and the river is really far from the fee camp.   Usually when the old guys were told to get out, they hiked  past the paved road to three mile camp or just hid out in the camping places down by the river that were invisible to anyone looking from the top.  If they had done this, I would have seen them walking down the road at night to go down to Williams where they had friends at the trailer park. I think it was the next week that there was the bad buzz from the radio, and I became alarmed, which I almost never do.  When they tell people to leave, there is just no one there when I arrive Tuesday nights, and thinking everyone is gone, they do not drive by to check, also, it is the sheriffs that do this, when they do not have jurisdiction on forest land. Well this is a lot to read, but I want to stress again that it was it was your description of the lights that made me think i should report this. There have been odd things going on at East Fork for a long time, but I never associated them with UFO’s.",2014-10-10T00:00:00,34.1748,-117.8751

Early on Tuesday morning September 23, 2014, my husband and I drove to the summit of Haleakala National Park, on the island of Maui, to view the sunrise.  We arrived at the summit around 4:30 a.m.  It was cold and extremely windy.  There were already a few tour shuttles that had arrived, and approximately six or seven other cars that had arrived. I got out of the car to use the restroom at the visitor’s center and looked around a bit.  It was pitch dark, and, since it was way too early for the sunrise, I went back to the car to keep warm. Our car was parked approximately 15-20 yards from the visitor’s center and the accompanying railing constructed there, along which people stand, facing east, to view the sunrise. Once I was back in our car, I noticed a strange white glow emanating from the area of the visitor’s center or just beyond it (to the south/southeast). From my perspective, sitting in our vehicle, it looked like a half-circle or dome of white light illuminating the area of the mountain just on the other side of the viewing railing and extending above approximately two stories high. So, relatively close by. The defined outer edge of the “dome” was distinctly brighter than the interior. The interior was translucent but very white. The outer edge made a sharp, bright, distinct border. I wondered if it was some sort of pre-dawn phenomenon having to do with the moon, or the coming sun, and the clouds. I said to my husband, “Look at that dome of white light over by the visitor’s center. What is that?” But he was already dozing off, resting after the somewhat challenging drive to the summit in the pitch dark. I very much wanted to get out and take a closer look. It was like nothing I’d ever seen before. But my desire to stay out of the extreme wind and cold won over, and I continued to view it from inside the car. I nodded off, since we’d gotten up at 2am to make the drive from the Ka’anapali Beach area to the summit. I napped for about 45 minutes, after which time my husband and I got out of the car to position ourselves amongst the gathering crowd to view the sunrise.  I did not even remember seeing the white light…  …until, three days later, after boarding our flight home from Maui, we struck up a conversation with the man sitting next to me on the plane, and discovered that he and his wife had also gone to the summit of Haleakala on September 23rd to see the sunrise.  And he said to us, “Did you see a mysterious white light when you were there, while it was still dark?” To which I replied, “YES!” I’d forgotten all about it until he mentioned it. From his perspective, when he saw the light (I believe he said he was standing outside when he saw it), he observed a complete circle hovering in the air. I don’t recall him mentioning how nearby it seemed, or how high above ground he thought it was. His description matched mine in that he said it had a white translucent center and a bright, sharp, defined outside edge. He said he’d been searching the Internet for an explanation of what it could have been, but without much success, as he wasn’t sure what phrases to search on; it was so difficult! to describe. I finally got around to doing my own Internet search on this phenomenon last Friday (October 4). That’s when I found this web site.",2014-10-10T00:00:00,,

((NUFORC Note:  High-altitude balloon.  PD)) Every night for the last two weeks we have had some very strange lights in the sky.  They look somewhat like stars, but they were twinkling waaaaay too brightly.  I walked out of my house in Mimbres New Mexico around 830pm on the night of the 25th of September.  We had just had a good rain and the clouds had cleared off.  I looked up and saw at first 5 extremely bright and twinkling stars. As my eyes adjusted I noticed there were more like 30 or 40 of these lights strewn about all the way from the east side of my house through the south and to the east.  I went inside and got my wife to make sure I wasn’t just seeing things and I also grabbed a pair of Leupold 10x40 binoculars.  I looked at the closest “star” with the binos and saw that there was no way these things were stars.  They have extremely bright red, green, white, and blue lights that orbit around them at very high rate of speed.  The orbital pattern of the lights looks like the way an atom is portrayed.  The lights seem to rotate around the bright light at different angles, giving it the appearance that they  “twinkling” like stars but they are much too bright and the twinkling is much too obvious to be stars.  I didn’t tell anyone because I was trying to rationalize this in my head. On the following Saturday one of my neighbors approached and asked if we had seen the lights.  We confirmed the sightings to him.  We then proceeded to do a “group watch” of these lights over the next few nights.  Note that I took the position of the formation that was the most obvious in the sky on the first night so that I could rule out any type of atmospheric phenomena.  The objects were not in the same place the next night at the same time.  They had moved to completely different locations but were still there.  They are around every night but there are fewer each night.  We peaked around 50 objects.  They stay stationary wherever they are posted as you can actually watch the big dipper move past them.  They are NOT celestial objects.   I do not have any type of camera equipment that would capture them on a pic or video unfortunately.",2014-10-10T00:00:00,32.9967,-108.094

((NUFORC Note:  We are unable to certify that this is a serious-minded report.  PD)) KELOWNA, BRITISH COLUMBIA.   At 8:45 pm, I decided to go for a walk around the block for half hour to an hour.  I left my place and enjoyed a peaceful evening stroll.   I was walking through a dark alley that cut through two apt building ending up at a old school that is across the road from the high school which has several large football fields.   While in the alley heading home, I talked briefly too a group of guys who claimed to have seen a UFO in the sky and if I hurried over to the field I could still catch them.  He pointed me in the direction that they seen the UFO and said they have to leave.   I hurried over too the field and did not notice anything and thought for sure I had missed them, shortly after about a minute of observing the sky I observed some lights that seemed to come from nowhere, I saw five bright circular lights in the sky that were in a boomerang like V formation, the UFO was in the very bottom part of the cloud layer and the clouds around the UFO’s lights vanished all around for hundreds of feet.   I felt a feeling of fear and astonishment when I first seen the craft, the lights were in the east direction moving south climbing in altitude, I observed the lights as they began to get smaller, the light started to pulsate and grow brighter when the UFO disappeared in a streak of light much like what a shooting star looked like only the streak of light traveled into space instead of the ground.   I was still watching the sky and observed a light travel back from the direction in which it had shot away, the light was moving at super speeds because it traveled towards myself growing a bit brighter, the lights then slowed down and stayed stationary.   The sighting lasted for about ten minutes and occured just after 9 pm.  I could still make out the UFO when I left the school field.   I walked home very excited about what I had just observed and the first thing I was going to say to my room mate was if he wanted too come and take a look at a UFO in the sky near the high school, so I came upstairs gave his door a quick knock and entered his room.   I was instantly hit by a big gust of wind that made the curtains hit the roof and I almost blacked out, it felt like I had been drugged or was overcome by a deamonic dark presence,  I remember seeing a dark shadow creature come over me freezing me with fear. I thought  to myself oh my god I just had my room mate abducted and I went to the living room where I noticed that 20 minutes had elapsed in 40 seconds, I looked around the house for my room mate and finally found him outside when I told him the things that had just happened, he didn’t think it was crazy at all.  I was overcome by an energy and dreading feeling that I had too get out of the house, I thought for sure I was going to be abducted and I did not want to put anyone’s life in danger.   I left the house and walked for about an hour too a picnic table at a small creek that was still in the city but it was late and I barely observed a vehicle.   At this time I was starting to calm down and was beginning to accept what had recently happened to me, I was a little bit on edge because I jumped when something came out of the bushes, it turned out to be a dog that stopped to take a drink out of the creek and continued on his way.  It was starting to get late, approximately 1 am, I grabbed my backpack and was about to head to the road when I heard something in the bushes again and thought it was the dog having another drink at the creek so I walked down to the waters edge to see if I could pet him and make a friend, I was mistaken because I observed two short human like creatures, around 4&#8242; tall and a slender build, they had dark eyes that were larger then our own and no visible hair clothes to speak off. The creatures were dark In colour but not black, possibly a dark grey. I watched the ET’s run away from me running towards a carwash looking back at me for a glance, the one  jumped on top of a car with ease and ran over the top of it jumping down and continuing to follow the other  as they ran into the dark where I could not make them out.  I instantly thought” if they are running that way I am going this way” and I made my way to the brightly light highway that was nearby.  I was honestly scared of these things and all I wanted to do at this ! time was too feel safe.  I honestly don’t know what they were g! oing to do to me or why they ran away.  It has even crossed my mind that perhaps they were either coming to drink water from the creek or were stalking the stray dog that recently came from the path that the et’s were.

I stand and wait just to bide time, and was drawn to observe the usual nighttime activity of plane sightings.  Observing the smoke from the pipe, and even watching out for passing vehicles driving to and from their homes so as not to draw unwanted suspicion, I would resume from ducking down and proceed as usual.  Considering I was observant of regular vehicles, likewise I was somewhat inclined to turn around suddenly and witness a somewhat traditional shaped aircraft. First I must note that this was within a very short distance from where I was standing, in a sloped field near an incline roughly 10-15 feet deep, with clear observation of the surrounding area, and somewhat isolated/localized sound observation.  Clean and clear night with a bright moon, and perfect visibility, with or without corrective lenses.   Within the span of several seconds I was able to observe what immediately seemed out of place, was not only a craft that appeared to be propelled by an alternative (plasma?) energy compared to a jet engine, but seemed to have an audible and noticeable hum as it propelled itself, though seemingly akin to the light noise of a motorcycle's rotary engine.  It seemed stationary in the sky as I looked up, and very clearly seemed to speed off (""impossibly"" fast) upon first being noticed, only to very clearly disappear from sight.  No cloud coverage was present, and this craft could not have disappeared simply from having flown out of ! view, or behind coverage of a building or cloud. As far as the shape of the craft, I thought it seemed smooth bodied but perhaps similar to traditional aircraft; though I did not notice any wings on it.  Perhaps oval shaped, with engines that lit up but seemed to ""swirl"" with light, giving off a noticeable acceleration with greater illumination, and an almost purr-like quiet hum, seemingly difficult to notice if I wasn't already looking up at it (the sound did not draw my attention, and I honestly don't know why I turned around when I did.)  I stared up at the sky dumbfounded and asking myself ""what the F was that?"" over and over again.  It seemed to arch upwards at an angle and turned as it accelerated away from me, with what could have been an instantaneous 1000+ mph, as it disappeared. Noticing criteria for close encounters, I do tend to wonder if it could be possible such a thing was in progress; although I don't necessarily believe I have been a victim of such an event. Prior sighting I had was several years ago (apx 9/2012?) in nearly the same spot (I was driving home and had arrived around 10:15pm) and despite knowing what I was looking at, I wasn't startled.  It was a pitch dark triangle with three observable clean white lights on all three underside corners (similar to what has been described in the Aurora UFO project by USAF but without the central engine ""light"" in the middle.  It was an overcast of clouds and the ufo remained perfectly stationary below the cloud coverage.  I loop the vehicle around to park along the street to get out, and noticed it was gone.  Looking back I know I should have just stopped in the middle of the street and observed for awhile.",2014-12-05T00:00:00,32.99435574018127,-96.8931658610272

I was on my way to a college recitation and had volunteering to drop my boyfriend off near his place of employment before I left town.  After dropping him off and turning onto Queen Ave from a parking lot that crosses with SE Hill Street I noticed something extremely bright in the sky. As I was moving west down Queen, the object was moving from the north to south. 	At first glance, I thought the object I was looking at must be a plane.  The reasoning for this was because of a nearby airport, as well as how low the object seemed to be relative to the altitude that planes fly at when they have completed their ascent.  The object also appeared to be moving at a rate comparable to that of an airplane.  What compelled me to keep staring what the unbelievable brightness of the object.  Initially I thought that it may be reflecting the light from the clouds which were bright that morning.  The longer I stared at it, the stranger it seemed that there appeared no colored lights on the object.  I also began to notice that the object at first glance had appeared to be plane shape, but the longer I watched it move through the sky the more I was able to define that it appeared, in fact, as a crescent shape with its widest diameter parallel with the ground. 	Once I began to realize how out of sync this object was with what I am accustomed to seeing from a plane, I followed it's trajectory with my eyes as I continued to make my way west on Queen.  Next something very strange happened.  The object I had been watching moved in front of clouds that were much darker, gray color.  It was then I saw that the light didn't seem to be reflecting onto the object from the clouds, but coming from the object itself.  The best way to describe it, was that it appeared to be self-illuminated.  The color was a very bright white color. 	The object moved west from my perspective.  A few moments later object stopped moving entirely. It was suspended in the sky, and no longer appeared crescent like it had when it was closer to me, but appeared orb-shaped.  The only thing I can compare it to is a star.  It looked like a low hanging star in our atmosphere in the middle of the morning.  After a five to ten second stillness, the object moved at a much, much faster rate west, or backwards from where I was staring.  The movement of the object at this point was unfamiliar to me, and the best way I can describe it was like it had moved at warp speed and now was the size of a needle pinhead in the sky.  It was then that I turned north onto Pacific Avenue from Queen and was unable to further locate the object in the sky.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,44.63083692307693,-123.06774307692308

I pretty much paid no attention and figured it to be the usual aircraft with blinking lights.   After a moment I spotted another bright reddish light object below and to the left of the first one, just above the horizon, and continuing to follow the first object horizontally and then straight up into the sky.   I pulled the car over and observed them both for a few minutes.  The first one then accelerated a bit, and went straight up, thru, into and above the clouds..  I could see it all the way with light of the full moon above.  The second object followed the first one's course. I picked up my cellphone from the back seat, and tried to figure out who to call..shaking like a madman.  I then left the phone, went to the front of the car and 2 more objects appeared from behind a foreground hill-like mound, and they proceeded in a due line across, and just above, the horizon, from the  left to right.  At this time..with no luck.. I was pointing at the objects and trying to get vehicles passing to stop and observe. The third object followed the other 2 into the clouds, and he last one I watched, as it slowed to a complete stop and dimmed. All 4 of the red fireballs were moving on a Northeast to Northwest heading.  No sound, no smell; it was 17F degree according to my car gauge.  The night was clear and still below the cloud ceiling.  The objects were 1/10th to quarter mile away and were the size of a nickel held in hand at arm's length.  All of them were bright red/whitish in color with flame like streamers steamimg from the top and they had a revolving lighter red outer. I checked with the local TV  and newspaper media and no one else reported them,,as far as I know I am the only witness to the sighting.  I watched them for around 15 minutes.  This was on the old Jerome highway I mile west of the intersection where interstate 93 joins the old Jerome highway on the south side of road between there and the Snake River Canyon Rim.

I personally believe at times (THEY)  pick and choose who (THEY) want to see them...3 times if sighted something with wish of that.

I had previously posted about four lights in a triangular shape sometime in November.  This evenings sighting was much different than the last and much longer.   My husband began loading his car with laundry baskets, when I hear him call my name and come see ""them"" again.  I am sure it is highly unlikely to see UFO's more than once but it seems to be a re-occurring theme here in Clarksville.   I went outside and saw a slow moving fireball type aircraft in the sky with the occasional firework going up.  It seemed as if though during this time we saw this light everyone paused their fireworks.  After a minute or two the fireball type aircraft completely vanished in the night sky.  We thought that must be it this time but then another appeared from the western treeline moving towards Oak Grove, KY, (we are fairly close to Oak Grove, KY, and our house is situated northerly).  This second fireball type aircraft made no noise whatsoever as did the first.  We then saw a! plane flying towards into the direction of the UFO.  The plane made noises as a plane would but the UFO was completely silent.   The UFO rose into the sky in a eastern direction.  Then a third came from the exact spot as this one had and at this moment the second UFO vanished without a trace.  The third UFO did as the second had and followed the same flight path.   And just as the second had vanished when the third appeared so did this third when a fourth fireball aircraft appeared from the same exact spot.  The fourth UFO followed the same flight path as the previous three had.   It was during this time a plane had circled around into the direction of these UFO's.  All during this time you can clearly hear the sounds from the plane and still no sound from the UFO's.   Also, while the fourth had followed the same flight path as the previous, a helicopter coming from the eastern sky began flying towards the direction of where the UFO's were appearing in the western sky.  Unlike the plane, the helicopter did not reach in time before the fourth vanished.   We waited for a fifth UFO but that was it.  No more appeared.  It seemed so for our neighbors as well because after this ""show"" of UFO's ended, the neighbors began lighting their fireworks more so than during the appearance of the UFO's.   This is becoming more unsettling, here in Clarksville.  We do live near a military post, and everyday you can see small planes and helicopters flying over head.  We are used to it, of course.  We have lived here for 10 years but these occurrences are much different than seeing planes and helicopters flying over head.   If there are others here in town seeing these same objects, please don't be embarrassed to post because you are not alone in these experiences.

The two lights then moved slowly toward the center sky, and twisted Around each other somewhat erratically.  They were very high in altitude and faint compared to Sirius, Venus, and Alpha Centauri.  They then grew fainter and began to move much more quickly, then either disappeared due to speed or the lights being dimmed. Judging by their altitude as triangulated with the mountain range in the back ground. They were following the general direction of the train tracks, and moving from around 2 knots to around 870 knots from a near standstill.  They retained either a linear or somewhat triangular pattern, though the two rear lights have have been one reflecting off of frost in the atmosphere, or some other atmospheric disturbance.  This is not the first time I have seen these particular lights, and they are sometimes accompanied by infrasonic pitches of around 2-4 Hz or less, and sometimes a faint red center light.  The dogs in the neighborhood all get very loud when the infrasound begins, and if it flies at a lower altitude they all attempt to go inside or seek other shelter. I have detected very little radio static on any frequencies from the objects, and no noticeable sound. I have yet to try radar detection.",2015-01-26T00:00:00,35.605,-82.3132

It was probably 11:30pm.  We noticed these weird balls of light in the sky.  There was a light cloud cover and you could tell they were above the clouds.  At first, not knowing what we were seeing we thought maybe it was northern lights, but we were seeing weird balls of light zooming around because of the clouds??  So we got in our car and decided to drive down to a clearing, because we live in the woods, and see if we could see it better. So we drove about 2 miles down the road and parked at the clearing.  The lights were gone, and it was dead silent.  All of the sudden the lights appeared in front of our eyes and started moving around.  Sometimes they would blink, and sometimes seemed to move in a pattern together.  We thought someone was messing with us.  We could not believe what we were seeing!   Then all of the sudden.. one by one.. the balls formed into one big ball!. It sort of pulsed and just sat there in the sky for about 20 seconds. Then one by one the balls came out of the clouds and went down into the woods! NO JOKE!!! You could see a light beam coming down with each one of them, until they all went down into the woods, probably a quarter mile from our car.  I jumped in my car because I was terrified!  And sat there for a few seconds, then jumped back out and stood there and stared.  The whole time you couldn’t hear anything.   Then one by one the balls shot out of the woods back into the sky and sort of disa! ppeared.  I was so scared, and my husband was also, that we got in our car and started speeding home. We couldn’t believe what we saw.  On the way home they reappeared and almost followed us.  We got home, couldn’t see them, again everything was so still outside.  We went in, confused, and let the dogs back out.  They appeared again almost above our house. These lights, 5 of them, shooting around in the sky.  We took the dogs back in and went back out and just watched them.  They moved fast, sometimes together in weird ways, and blinked at times.  Finally I went in and came back out and they were gone. I have done tons of research and I see no natural ocurance that could explain this. There wasn’t any lightning that night.  What was weird also is that all the dogs out here in the woods were barking. You would hear them way off in the distance.  It was all just strange and mind boggling.  I did believe in UFO’s before this happened, but never in a million years did I expect to see something so strange. Well, I told the story to a few people, and then today, one of my friends I told messaged me and said there was a guy in the Kalispell, MT, yard sale, saying he had also saw something strange and was wondering if anyone else had seen anything weird in the sky. I’m tying to contact the guy now.   I know what I saw sounds completely unbelievable.  I don’t expect anyone to believe me!  I’d be willing to take a lie detector test on this!  It was no joke and my husband and I are still confused and have no explanation.  We tried to take video and pictures but couldn't capture what we were seeing.",2014-09-18T00:00:00,47.88739999999999,-113.8725

I decided to take a quick rest at the Mall of the World, which was underneath the Huacheng Square walkway.  Shortly after my rest I decided to go back outside into the warm, humid Guangzhou heat. I then made my way over to the end of the walkway and the end of the square, which was near the Guangzhou Asian Games Stadium and the Canton Tower, as well as near the side of the Pearl River.  As soon as I arrived near the end of the square, I noticed that there were lots of people.  It was very crowded that night, and I realized that it was the first day of Mid-Autumn Festival (aka Moon Cake Festival).  There were many street vendors and lots of people with their friends and family eating food, as well as taking pictures of the wonderfully lit ornaments and the quickly changing colorful lights of both the Canton Tower and the IFC (Four Seasons) building. I decided to walk ahead closer to near the river side, but the way there was blocked by barrier, as there was a large ornamental display bearing the shape of a traditional Chinese junk ship (without sails), and a led or neon-lit sign the posted Chinese characters, translated as Happy Mid-Autumn Festival and welcoming of happiness or such (since I’ve studied Chinese for four semesters in China before). Next, I made my way over to the barrier closest to the river, but was also near other people taking pictures.  I was gazing around the buildings and the night sky.  Occasionally I would see an airplane or two from the far distance to the East and the South of the Canton Tower, with ordinary flashing beacons and navigation lights. 	Once more, I then gazed across over to the north to see the wonderfully lit IFC building, as well as the construction of the Luk Fuk building. I then turned around to face the river side once more, but something caught the attention of the corner of my left eye. I then turned left towards the east to see a far away red light (brightness similar to an aircraft). It must’ve been at least half a mile out on the horizon, as far as I could see. The amber-red light appearing distant at first, then gradually brighter as it was making its way over towards me (heading west-ward). The night sky was clear, but there were some low-lying clouds and slight fog or mist closer to the ground and river. It was a also a little breezy near ground level. Gazing towards the red light, I thought at first it was just an ordinary aircraft, and thought that maybe the fog or possible city pollution caused the aircraft’s lights to appear redder instead of a typical incandescent yellow-white. But as the red light drew nearer, I realized it maintained a constant color, and it was coming at a slight decline angle. Then as it drew even nearer to me, it quickly disappeared into the nearby low-lying clouds. Curious, I still kept my eyes open for any other activity. To my surprise the red light came out of the clouds and continued westward, and finally made its way over the festival square. As it passed over me (about a 75-85 degree angle above my head to the north of me), I noticed an unusual shape. Although it was dark, I was able to make out a round, almost oval-like shape.  It was neither perfectly circle nor perfectly oval. To my eye, it appeared to be roughly between the size of an aspirin pill and a penny (or a Chinese wu jiao coin). The color appeared to be a grayish, slightly white-blue color, and there was a slight reflection on the object from the surrounding city lights. As it passed over me, I noticed that the object made no sound (no motor or engine noise), from what I can recall, except for a faint ‘cutting through the wind’.  Gauging the craft’s distance up above the ground, the object must’ve been at least 500-600 feet above the ground, but no more than 1000 feet, I reckoned. It was about as high as the lowest flying domestic aircraft flying over the city, but a bit lower. As it continued over me (over the festival square), it quickly fluttered some violet, blue, blue-green, red-pink, and a bit of green lights. Sort of like temporary beacons or special kind of navigation signals, I suspected. It must’ve done this signaling at least twice or thrice, but very rapidly, in a glimmering, sequential and reverse-sequential fashion. By the time I realized that this was no “ordinary” object or “craft”, I decided to pull out my Smartphone to take a pictures. By the time I got my phone camera ready, the object then sped up quickly towards the west, towards the direction of the Guangzhou Opera House and past other buildings in that direction (i.e. the Baoli Center Building), then quickly ascended and faded away.  A bit curious, I still had my phone out of my pocket. Some people (two couples, and a small group of two to three people) nearest to me noticed me attempting to take pictures of something in the sky, but they must’ve thought nothing of it at first. About two to three minutes later, I notice the exact same amber-red light (as the object had when entering from the east), but this time appearing to the southwest of the Canton Tower. It must’ve been several hundred feet above the large high-rise apartments directly on the other side of the Pearl River. It was hovering for at least half a minute, then slowly ascended, paused and hovered for a few more seconds, then gradually continued westward and “disappeared”. By this time I had already taken a few snapshots from my phone. About a less than a minute later, I notice the exact same amber-red light near and above a large building the west of the Guangzhou Opera house. It was hovering for at least half a minute, then ascended slowly again, but this time, the amber-red light began to pulsate (almost undulating). It must’ve done this for a few seconds at a time, within one to two minutes max, then ascended higher, and gradually disappeared. At this time, I had already had taken a few more snapshots from my phone, and there were at least three to five other people that pointed to the object, and took some snapshots, but they appeared to not be surprised, but rather amused (as if it was nothing very special).  Unfortunately, my phone’s camera resolution and quality wasn’t the best, the object appeared dimmer in the pictures than in real life. About a few seconds later, the amber-red light appeared again near the direction I last seen it (toward the west of the Guangzhou Opera house and neighboring buildings). About a few minutes more it hovered and ascended gradually on and off, occasionally with a pulsation, then it slowly made its way southward towards the Pearl River, and disappeared again. During this time I had taking more pictures of it. I had also noticed that another couple near me had pointed to the object discretely, and took a quick snapshot from their Smartphone, showing some interest. I did not bother to ask them as I was afraid I would ‘sound’ or ‘look’ like a fool. About another minute later, I noticed the same amber-red light, but this time, further in the east, even further east of the Liede Avenue Bridge. It was a little higher in the sky, and was more distant, and was less visible because of the low lying clouds and fog. It must’ve hovered in place for a least another one to two minutes, then disappeared again for another few minutes. I was able to take a picture of this period of time. As you will see in the related photograph, one can barely notice it with the naked eye, but if one was to open the photo, one can zoom-in closely and notice the slight color in the midst of the clouds. Shortly after that period of time, it again appeared to the slight southwest of the Canton Tower and towards the high rise apartments directly across the Pearl River.  Again, the object, hovered, and moved slowly toward the west, and slowly ascended, then changed direction in the opposite direction and hovered another few seconds more, and disappeared again. To my wonderment and disbelief, I had realized by this time that there was something strange about this object. It could’ve not been any ordinary aircraft. It was not in any perceivable way, identifiable, and the only two things I could suspect were that object was either of terrestrial or was non-terrestrial origin. Military flares? I’m not familiar with any flares that fly and behave the way that object did. Whether the object was of terrestrial (military-government or non military-government) origin, or non-terrestrial origin, it was indeed unusual in its appearance and behavior. What it was not was any conventional aircraft. Again, I can neither conclusively prove nor disprove that this object was either terrestrial or non-terrestrial, but what I can conclude was that I experienced seeing something out of the ordinary, and without any recollection of the unknown.  Shall anyone choose to believe or disbelieve my experience; it is their choice, with rightful reasons to their own thinking and opinions.  But I hereby declare that I stand true and clear to my words, to the best of my knowledge and experience.  I know what I know, and I know what I’ve witnessed.

Orange glow center At about 22:15 at night, on Saturday, September 27, 2014, my daughter looked up in the sky while she was getting into our car.  Not high enough to be an airplane, but almost like at the height a model airplane would fly.  7 or 8 rounded rectangular shaped objects, with an orange glowing light at their center, were flying in a single line but staggered, formation.   The horizontal flight path was going north to south, from the very southernmost and easternmost part of Edmonds southbound—southbound along Shoreline, just west of Interstate 5—through Shoreline. They were lit up with a big orange glow in the center.   We were thinking that maybe they were a cluster of drones or lanterns.  However, have never seen either in person so really unable to compare to anything. They didn’t make any distinguishing types of noises—like an airplane or helicopter… or any loud noise for that matter.  The noise I did hear, was a very soft, hum/whistle that maybe a sophisticated, high tech, model airplane--engineered specifically for low noise.  We lost sight of them as they headed down past Shoreline.  By the time we called out a houseguest and my son to come witness these items, only two were visible for them to see as they were above Shoreline (central) along and above the I-5 corridor.

Its movement was slow, smooth, steady, and yet at certain times it would change, dipping down and then to one side or the other, never changing its orientation or “facing” direction. There was one section that did protrude further than the rest and it was this section that was always facing the direction of travel. There were no sounds from this object and due to the calm weather it would’ve been easy, at that small distance, to hear any sounds.  The total time of observation wasn’t more than 15-20 seconds.

((NUFORC Note:  This report was submitted by a party, who is well known in the UFO field, but who, for the sake of his wife's anonymity, prefers not to be identified.  We extend our gratitude to both parties for their having shared the information, and the photo, with our Center.  PD)) The relative of mine who took the photo departed for Abu Dhabi on November 10.  The attached photo was probably taken the morning of November 11th but I will try to confirm that.  Possibly (but less likely) it was Nov 11.  She returned to the U.S. on Nov. 14. She took it from her hotel room in a high-rise building.  Judging by the shadows of the buildings I think it's a morning shot so I have written down 11:00 but will try to confirm this later.  She was clicking off photos at the rate of about one every few seconds and the UFO's are not in any of the other shots so I listed the duration of event as 3-5 seconds. What I see in this photo is this:  1.  Three elliptical objects, saucer shaped.  They seem to have some detail within each elipse - these do not seem to be solid metal objects with totally uniform surface texture.  2.  When you blow up the photo on your desktop screen, to the right of the left-most object you will see perhaps as many as 5 of what seem to be distant groupings of 2 or 3 UFO's in each group.  So there may be 13 or 14 UFO's in this image in all, but I listed it as a 3-UFO event because there are 3 that are seen most clearly.  Clearly something cause the seemingly more distant and smaller UFO images in the photo too so it would seem there must have been more than the 3 very apparent objects.  3.  There is not a cloud in the sky - these are certainly not clouds based on their shape and the rest of the sky - they do not have any bird-like shape (and birds would have appeared in the other photos she took also) - and this does not have a characteristic of lens flare at all. Of course one has to ask, because this was taken from a hotel room, and therefore through a window (glass), could they be reflections, for instance of lights in the room?  Seems impossible because there is no trace of any other characteristic of reflection, no hint of any other object ""in the room"".  Also unlikely lights were on in the room with this much daylight streaming in, and if these were reflections of lamps then they should have shown up in the other photos also. The anomalies were not seen by the person who took the photo while she took it.  It was noticed later while looking at the photos. ((NUFORC Note:  ANALYSIS--At first glance, our suspicion was that the oval-shaped objects might have been reflections of ceiling lights in the room behind the photographer, who took the photo through the window of a hotel room.  However, the source does not believe that to be the case, given that the other photos do not show the same images.  PD))",2014-12-05T00:00:00,,

At that time directly east there were 3  white ""stars"" of about 1st magnitude arranged in a straight line and evenly spaced and equal brightness.  The axis of the lineup stood vertically above the E horizon just above a neighbor's house, or on an E-W axis.  I had never seen a formation of stars with a pattern like this and thought it was unusual.   The stars did not move or change brightness exactly like normal stars except that there are no stars  that even remotely resemble that configuration and brightness in that part of the sky at that time.  My husband is an amatuer astronomer and MUFON field investigator and checked the star charts and Stellarium planetarium software.  Whatever they were, they were not stars.   After viewing them for a few minutes, I looked at the sky straight up, and to my surprise another IDENTICAL equidistant straight-line pattern of 3 stars were visible.  They were exactly the same, except they were dimmer at about magnitude 2, but still easy to see. Again, there are no stars known that meet the observation.  During the approximate 5 minutes of observation, both of the configuations just appeared stationary.  But that's not all.  The SAME CONFIGURATION of three 1st magnitude ""psuedo-stars"" made another appearance just this morning (12-3-14).  Exactly the same phenomena.  During 5 minutes of observation (clear sky & other stars visible) they just stood there just like stars of magnitude 1 or so.  Tried taking a picture with my cell phone but it didn't come out.

The ""flock"" of orbs moved similar to the parade of crows that flies North to South or South to North here--random, linear, fluid.

While standing outside with a friend of mine discussing current events we noticed a light traveling from West to East at a fairly slow pace which I would compare to that of a light aircraft. We were able to watch this object move into our view field which was blocked by a tree line to the west, go overhead and over another tree line to the east. This light was a white light that at one point had gotten bright, and then dimmed back down to its ""normal"" bright glow.  This caught my eye because I see aircraft nightly when I go outside and look at the stars and this object did not have any strobe lights. This was a solid light which I exclaimed to my friend was a rare event that I had never seen before. My friend was telling me how he thought that this vehicle was an airplane 747 or some object that had a bright light on it. Moments later while giving my viewpoints on how that couldn't be a 747, we watched as a second craft flew towards us from the sam! e western direction. I quickly pointed to the craft and said ""Look"" another one. We watched as this craft started approaching from the west and without a gradual turn the object changed direction without missing a beat or stopping and started heading South West. This second object was starting to head southwest out of our view field so my buddy and I walked towards the street that I live on so I could get a better view of where the craft was going and what it was. This craft traveled South West for maybe 10-15 seconds maximum and then seamlessly changed directions to moving in a South Eastern direction. The light continued to move Southeast until we lose site of the object over houses that blocked the horizon. At this point in time our eyes are plastered to the sky and we are comparing this light we witnessed with other obvious aircraft lights in the sky. By now we are searching for another object to appear from the west when directly above us another light pops i! nto view not coming from any direction but seemingly coming &q! uot;Down "" into view and then starts heading what I would call directly South. This 3rd object we could only keep in our view for 30 seconds or so max before it was behind a treeline. All three of these objects were simply bright white lights that I would estimate to have been approx 10-15x the size of the North Star for perspective. I would estimate that the first two objects flew way under planes we were watching in the sky while the 3rd object was obviously much higher and a slightly smaller light. While this was happening the dogs in the area were very amp'd up and going nuts barking and when they passed a good distance from being directly overhead the dogs stopped barking. This happened on the first two craft while the third craft I do not recall if this happened.  All three of these separate sighting happened within 15 minutes of eachother and I must say that I really do feel honored to get to have seen this. The third craft was really the one that got my buddy because his airplane theory went out the window when it appeared out of nowhere directly above the top of us and I mean directly.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,31.652585714285713,-94.56937802197803

Looking through the lenses, I was shocked to see Venus, Mercury looking small and dim below and to the right of Venus, and in the same line formed by Venus and Mercury, another object that I perceived as another planet, below and to the right of Mercury. It was this object that I initially mistook for Mercury while driving up to the pier.  Looking through the binoculars, it looked very much like a planet under magnification, revealing what, to me, looked like a planetary disk and having a distinct, yellowish color.  The size of the disk and the yellowish color put in my mind that I was looking at Jupiter, which really baffled me as Jupiter was not suppose to be there!   As I was trying to figure out what planet this was, I noticed that it was not in the same place as it was when I first started observing the three objects (2 planets and this whatever-it-was). In the approx. 3 or 4 minutes that I had been looking at it, it had moved directly under Venus, from my perspective!  It did not change in elevation, but just moved to the left.  The movement was very slow, I could not perceive it moving by looking at it, only by looking away and then looking back, and using Venus and Mercury as reference points, could I see that it was indeed moving.  As it moved to the left, it became more orange and started approaching red when, after moving well to the left of Venus, it started an upward and to the left movement, again at the same, almost glacial speed.  By this time the sun had set, and although Venus and Mercury were becoming brighter and brighter in the darkening sky, this object was becoming dimer and whiter, having gone from almost red when it started its upward motion to orange to yellow and finally to white, at which time it finally disappeared from my view (by the time it turned white, it was only visible in my binoculars). I would say that the time frame that I observed it was approx. 8 to 10 minutes. I have been around aviation all my life, and have owned a telescope since I was just a kid, and I have never seen anything like this object before.  It was definitely not an aircraft, as it had no anti-collision lights, navigation lights, or any type of beacon.  Blimps and drones also operate in the area, I have observed plenty of those, as well, and I can say that it was neither.  A balloon?  Possibly, but unlike any balloon I have ever seen, changing color the way it did and shining with at least the same visible magnitude as Venus before the sun fully set.  I would way the it was spherical, but cannot be 100% certain of that as I only perceived it as a disk.  Conditions at the time were relatively clear, with a slight haze over the ocean and twilight lighting.  This did all take place over the ocean in the direction of Catalina Island.",2015-01-16T00:00:00,33.7576,-118.0777

PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, So here goes.  My wife and I were sitting in our backyard in the Jacuzzi (as we do every night) watching the planes come in to land at LAX.  Have lived here for 18 years and sit outside at night often.   Well, she was talking to me and I was staring up at the sky cause I saw a bright light that didn't look familiar and it was moving slow, going away from us, stopping on a dime and then slowly coming back.  Its flight pattern was irregular.  I thought perhaps it was a helicopter (I am a helicopter pilot) doing a circular holding pattern over a traffic accident as sometime they do.  The only thing that didn't make sense was how bright it was and not being able to see any flashing lights...at least not yet.  And then of course how it was moving.  It was southeast of our house and proceeded to move all over the sky.  Not super-fast, but faster than anything else at that altitude which is what also made it stand out.  So I jumped out of the Jacuzzi (we had been watching it for about 2 minutes by then) and I ran in and grabbed my phone. At one point it looked like it turned (without moving in the sky) and we saw red blinking or flashing lights for about 5 seconds.  It moved all over the sky in a random fashion. It was not a helicopter or plane.  I went on a site and tracked the aircraft in the areas at around 6:45-6:55 pm and did not see any helicopters.  Of course with all UFO video, sometimes it is hard to see what is going on.  I backed out on one of the videos so you could see the palm trees in my back yard as a reference for how it was moving.  There are street lights in the picture, but I think you will get a good picture from the video.  It went beyond the horizon of our backyard and that's when we lost it.  Could it have been a drone?  Sure, but since I don't know what drones with lights look like and have never in all the time I have lived here seen what I saw last night, I decided to report it to you guys based on the recommendation of a friend that is familiar with ya and after he had seen the videos.  They are on my facebook.   ((address deleted))  There are two of them. ((name deleted)) Glad I could help in any way.  Not saying it was extraterrestrial, just that I have never seen anything like that.  You will see a jet coming into land at LAX and I wondered if they saw it.",2015-01-16T00:00:00,33.9958,-117.8189

I have literally seen UFOs probably at least a dozen times, but I had never seen one of these triangular objects until last night. I live in a 2nd floor apartment that faces east toward Hartford.  I get a nice unobstructed view of the sky and I constantly see planes coming from Bradley Airport about 20 miles away, or I see planes going in for a landing there.  So, I am VERY familiar with airliners. But tonight I just happened to look out and saw this BEAUTIFUL perfect triangle object.  It had many very bright white lights on it and was flying very slowly. I don't know how high it was, maybe 3-5000 feet at most.  It looked quite large, I got the impression it was probably twice the size of an average airliner.  I wish I would have had time to count the lights, but I am sure I saw probably 7 or 8 large white lights, and one very small blinking red light near the center.  But the entire craft was outlined by the white lights and was a perfect equilateral triangle 60/60/60.  It was really a very pretty sight.  It seemed to be going quite slow, much slower than the airliners I see every night.  If I had to guess, I would say it was going maybe 200 mph at most.  It was flying from northeast toward the southeast, which is the regular path many planes from Bradley follow. Anyway, I was only able to see it for about 10 seconds before it flew over my building, but I had time to put on a coat, grab a pair of binoculars and run downstairs which probably took about 15-20 seconds.  It was going so slow that it was still there and I got to look at it for about another 15 seconds before it went behind another building and I lost sight of it.  I am not completely sure, but I think I MIGHT have heard it, if so, it sounded like a normal airliner, but I might have been hearing another plane that I saw in the same part of the sky. That's it, very simple sighting, but a very beautiful object.  It was probably one of ours, but I don't care, I have always wanted to see one of these triangular objects, and now I have.",2015-01-16T00:00:00,41.8394,-73.1255

At approximately 7pm on January 9, 2015, I was traveling west bound on Woodson-Franklin Road towards Woodson, IL, returning to Jacksonville, IL.  Temperature was around 10 degrees and sky was very clear and stars were very bright.  As I passed the new water tower and I looked out the drive side window &lt;to my left&gt;. I noticed a Very bright orange sphere in the distance.  The sphere was about 30 degrees above the ground to my left.  I would feel comfortable stating the object was miles away at least.   I kept glancing over at the object as I was approaching the last 2 corners on the road before the straight away into the Town of Woodson.  I looked away from the object and had to watch the road since there was a oncoming vehicle coming around the first corner at Walsh Road.  The road jogs north for about 1/4 to 1/2 mile, then turns back west into Woodson.   As I came around the 2nd corner into the straight stretch to Woodson, I glanced over to the south again and saw the original object still approximately at the same location.  However, I also saw a second object, much closer, and slightly lower, traveling east thru the empty corm field.  I would put that object at 1/2 mile south of the roadway, approx. 150-200 feet off the ground.  It was also a solid orange sphere.  It was visibly moving East.   When I first saw it It looked to 2/3rds of the way down the straight stretch towards Woodson from the corner I had just rounded.  I was traveling at 55 mph to start and noticed it was moving east at a decent speed.   I slowed down to about 30mph while watching it, and confirmed that it was moving east, and it passsed between my vehicle and the distant orange object.  It was at a lower angle and closer to the ground than the distant one.  I sped back up to 55, and entered Woodson, crossing the train tracks, and continuing to the highway towards Jacksonville.   Just prior to leaving home, I was visiting and my vehicle was warming up.  I had been looking at the sky looking for the new comet that would have been just past Orion's Belt.   At that time, I did not see anything unusual in the sky or in the western sky.  I am very familiar with star gazing, astronomy, and Chinese lanterns.  I can confirm these were not meteors.  These were not Iridium Flares.  These were not the space station.  I can confirm these were not lanterns.  They were solid orange, no flickering, perfectly round.   I did not take any pictures of the objects.  Without a tripod and time exposure, or a very high ISO camera, it would have been moot to even attempt a photo.",2015-01-16T00:00:00,,

I would estimate the clouds at around 5,000 feet.  As I walked up a rocky driveway to get a higher perspective and prepared my phone to capture some video, the object suddenly changed direction from west to east, rose above the thin cloud cover and shot out of sight.  The object was so bright it would have been easily seen through the thin, see-through clouds, but once it changed direction and elevated it was simply gone.

I'm now a believer after what I've witnessed a few days ago. It just started getting dark in the sky, I don't remember the time though.  But I'm driving towards the high way to go under the over pass for the high way, when I see 2 VERY bright yellowish lights in the sky.  They looked almost like car head lights but a lot brighter.  They appear stationary for awhile so I start thinking it's a cell phone tower or those tall street lamps we have in that area.  But as I drive closer, it vanished.   So I look forward and continue driving maybe about 10 seconds, and then this huge ship appears right over the tree line, and slowly moves over my car. It was going maybe 10-30mph but I couldn't tell because it was so large and so low to the ground.   When it flew over I couldn't really make out the shape, the bottom of the ship was so dark that I couldn't make out any type of patterns or designs under it as it appeared to be a reflective black paint or something.  But when it flew over it had 2 bluish lights under it. It looked like they were on the tip of each wing thing, and the lights were coming from a square window-like enclosure.  The blue lights did flash, but not in any type of pattern, it was almost like looking at metal in a microwave, but with all blue sparks.   It made no noise which confused me the most, there was also no rumbling or shaking.  I could see some of the wing where the lights would flash.  The lights that lit up around the wing did let me see some of the wing shape though and color.  From the little I saw, the ship's shape looked similar to that atlantis space shuttle.  The ship looked like it was following the highway, but next to it.   I'll provide a picture/map of the course I saw it flying on.  Sadly I do not own a cell phone, and the other people in the car were too in shock to respond quick enough to record it.

Looked to be travelling at a high rate of speed and not manoeuvering like a commercial aircraft. Object continued moving somewhat level until appearing to enter  another, more gentle turn while still climbing steeply (trail was more of an arc than another right angle).  Object was actually turning closer to me.  As it started to get closer, it became even more apparent that it was travelling extremely fast. The really curious part came as the aircraft travelled directly overhead.  It looked to be very high up, flying above the wispy cloud cover, and as it flew over, coincidentally, there was a commercial airliner passing underneath it.  Based on those observations, it looked to be too big to be a fighter.  As well, its shape (and coloring) did not really match any aircraft I am familiar with.  More flying wedge than plane with wings.  It looked more SpaceX than F-22 or F-35 (or any other active/inactive US military aircraft).  Most assuredly man made, but very unusual all the same.

Again, I really wish I had recored a video, but would probably not have gotten anything usable as it passed overhead anyways due to the awkward angle of trying to blindly aim a camera almost straight up and out my window as it flew over.

This one however was the only red one and was blinking on and off quickly.   At first I would have disregarded it as a satellite or a plane however what caught my eye was the trail or perhaps tails attached to the object.  Behind it I could see two trails much like that of an airplane which were curved.  The trails however were like nothing I have ever seen before.  I will do my best to describe it but it is difficult without a physical drawing.   Behind the dot two curved lines making it look like a semicircle was forming behind the craft.   Both me and my friend saw the object as it quickly traveled across the sky but vanished in an instant.  My friend was at a better angle and said it did not fade but seemed to disappear.

UFO June 25, 1965, Philadelphia, PA.  The UFO report I am making took place in Philadelphia on June 25, 1965. At the time I was eleven years old.  I am a retired Air Force Intelligence Officer (Major), and Veteran of The Gulf War. I was sitting looking out a window when I saw a large bright object descending at a fast rate of speed.  It was coming down at a 45% angle at perhaps fifty miles per hour.  I thought it was a rocket, because of its shape, a cylinder with rounded ends.  I ran and hid behind the couch away from the window.  I expected an explosion but heard nothing, so I looked out.  I saw the UFO hovering a block down the street over roof tops. The UFO had descended at 22nd Street, descending at the intersection of 22nd and Mount Vernon Street, moving North then stopping at 22nd and Wallace Street.  I was viewing the object from my Grandmother and Grandfather's 3rd floor apartment window at 643 North 22nd Street, Philadelphia, Pa, on June 25th, 1968. The UFO followed the outline of all the homes and buildings-opposite my side of the street, including a church.  It flew just feet above the roof tops. It would pause, descend, and rise, hovering about ten feet above all the roof tops.  It was as if it was viewing inside the homes.  It moved slowly traveling at walking pace. The UFO was the length of a city bus, with rounded ends, but wider in circumference.  It was a large cylinder, it had no markings of any kind, no wings, no visible engines, no windows. The entire surface was made up of a plasma field, like a close up image of the Sun.  These gases or ions spun and disappeared under the surface, diving and rising like a gas.  The brightness was intense.  It was composed of several colors, white, yellow and orange.  It reminded me of someone mixing giant cans of paint.  It was very beautiful but hard on the eyes because of its brilliance. At this point in my life I think what I saw then was a fusion powered ship. At one point I turned around looking behind me into the apartment and noticed the patterns of light also produced shadows on my Grandmothers walls.  The patterns it produced on the walls were dark with light edges.  The patterns matched the moving patterns of the vessel's surface.  The only thing I've ever seen similar are close up films of the Sun.  In addition to the swirling patterns of light I noticed it was layered in a dimple pattern that covered its entire surface.  The dimples appeared to vibrate but stayed in place like those on a basketball while plumes of gas rose and fell like filaments of a magnet.  This was truly amazing to see!  At times I used my hands to shield my eyes.  It was the brightest light I've ever seen and today I'm sixty years old, as of November 2014.  I was alone viewing the object.  My Grandfather was at work and my Grandmother went downstairs to another apartment for a short time. It approached my location stopping directly in front of me. I did not feel any heat.  At this point it was about 80 feet away, close enough to throw a ball to it!  I was able to observe this object for perhaps five minutes, in total, which seemed then to be a long time.  As I said it paused several times over apartments, then would move and stop again several times. Just before the UFO changed direction (descending, or rising, stopping or starting to move forward) it emitted a loud sound.  The sound always preceded its change in movement by about two seconds each time.  So I knew when it was going to move again.  The sound reminded me of a loud hiss from an old steam train.  I'm not saying there was steam just that the sound was similar to that or when a large truck makes releasing air brakes. Once the UFO got to the last building at the intersection of 22nd and Fairmont Streets it angled at 45 degrees, with its front end pointing up, it rose about fifty feet. I ran to another window on the side facing Wallace Street, so was able to watch it again.  It leveled off, then flew over the walls of the Eastern State Penitentiary, it picked up speed at about 35 miles per hour flying North.  It continued flying North at a level constant speed until I lost view of it.  This craft was definitely controlled by an intelligence. When my Grandmother came in I told her what I had witnessed.  We were both very religious, she had difficulty believing my story and asked me to swear by placing my hand on The Bible, which I did.  She was convinced and saddened that she had missed this wonderful sight by just minutes. That evening or perhaps the next night we watched a TV program that highlighted the vessel I had seen and their closer encounter with it.  The program was ""The Arthur Godfrey Show"", or one of his ""Specials.""  Arthur Godfrey was a respected pilot, and was a colonel in the Air Force Reserve.  Arthur Godfrey and Frank Munciello another experienced pilot were flying in a small aircraft from New York to Washington, DC.  Their flight path took them over or near Philadelphia on the same day of my encounter.  Live on national TV Author Godfrey described that a brilliantly lit vessel followed and maneuvered around his aircraft.  He said it matched his course and speed.  He admitted he was scared of the vessel's close maneuvers until it finally veered off.  Arthur Godfrey was a well know TV producer and TV host.  His TV program was viewed by millions of Americans.  My grandparents and I knew he was describing the same vessel I had seen.  An account of Arthur Godfrey's story c! an be read on Ufodocarchiv.org. Later as an Intelligence Officer I often gave my squadron current intelligence briefings.  I was an Intelligence Officer of the 732nd Military Airlift Squadron at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey.  I served in this position for approximately ten years, including during the Gulf War.  During one briefing an Aircrew explained to me they encountered a Ball Lightening Encounter, also called Saint Elmo's Fire.  A sphere of charged particles entered the airframe of their aircraft while cruising at 40,000 feet.  The aircraft was a C-141 Starlifter.  The sphere about three feet in diameter entered the cockpit then floated inside the aircraft to the cargo bay where it hovered for a time then vanished.  They asked of I entered the airframe of their aircraft while cruising at 40,000 feet.  The aircraft was a C-141 Starlifter.  The sphere about three feet in diameter entered the cockpit then floated inside the aircraft to the cargo bay where it hovered for a time then vanished.  The entire crew witnesses the sphere and actually enjoyed the event.  They asked if I knew of any UFO sightings.  I then told them my story.  This upset my Squadron Training Officer who verbally reprimanded me, I was ordered to never speak about UFO's again.",,39.99063505273804,-75.14580121369744

Houses were on long, narrow ten acre lots - about two tenths of a mile up a hill on the edge of the woods.   I was fifteen years old and regularly sneaking out - no fear!   I was walking home alone at 1 am.  Fifty feet from my driveway, up to my left, out of the north sky came a large lighted object..  It stopped in mid air just past the edge of the woods.  Scared, I hid behind a large oak tree peeking, not knowing what to do.  It made no noise - no movement. I knew ""they"" knew I was there, so I ran up the driveway stopping in front of my house.  Approx one- two hundred feet away at tree top level was a saucer shaped aircraft with pale colored, rectangular lights around the bottom.  The lights were white, red, blue, and glowing.  Maybe an acre in size - it just stayed there. I didn't dare move - it came to me ""they"" wouldn't hurt me.  Who were ""! they""?  It finally moved at the same level slowly south parallel to I71, with a slight up and down motion.  On top of the hill, I could see it for maybe a few miles and it made three loud, high pitched, whirling noises and went straight down.  I had left my friends house at 1am, when I next looked at the time it was 3 am.  A short time later I saw headlines in the Columbus dispatch where an airforce pilot reported a UFO sighting.  I had my proof.  Now I always wonder.. where did 2 hours go during the time I was outside with the ufo?  Could I have been upducted?  I've had a bump behind my ear the I always pick at, it's bothersome.. and I don't remember always having it.  And since this day, I have been obssessed with UFO's.

I wasn't alone my friend was with me, Mundelein, IL. I'm now 60 years old and followed some link on a UFO story and thought back to my own experience which I have never written about, and then found this site.  I never reported this or wrote about it because frankly I did not want to be thought of as a crackpot.  I don't feel so funny about reporting it because I realize that lots of people have made reports.  In 1973/194 it was pre-internet so your only option was to report it to the police, which I figured they would think you were a crackpot so I never reported it.  And after reading maybe 50 different reports on this website, I realize I had a very close encounter.  My story is a bit different than most I have read. My girlfriend and I graduated High School 1972 and then we did everything together, worked at the same places rented apartments together etc. and mostly we liked boys, LOL now that I think back on it.  So we were driving I would say about 2:30 am, it was after the bars closed, but we were not real big drinkers in any event we were not like plastered, just had a little buzz on.  I'll never forget the road, it was a little country road (paved) and the road made a very sharp left turn, a hard left curve I should say, and where it made that sharp left, straight ahead was a corn field, and when you made the left you were then driving parallel to the corn field, we both knew this road very well and the dangerous sharp left curve. We were maybe 75 ft to 100 ft before the curve, now looking straight into the cornfield and had slowed down for the upcoming curve, and this huge (I don't know any other words to use so I am going to go ahead and use the much over-hyped description) this huge flying saucer came zooming in from the right, it then literally stopped on a dime, (no way could any normal human craft come in that fast and then simply STOP) and then it slowly lowered itself straight down until it was only about maybe 15ft above the corn field.  The thing I remember the very most was the unnatural bright bright bright white light.   I stopped the car and we both put our hands up to shield our eyes, it was that bright.  There we were stopped in my car, my headlights shining into the cornfield and before us was this super bright white light, all-lit-up flying saucer, maybe 150ft in front of us.  It just sat there hovering above the corn field for maybe 10 or 15 seconds, then it went up a little bit, not much mayb! e 100ft and then it just zoomed off to the right very very very fast in an upward trajectory. It was like out of there so fast it was unbelievable.  To the right was east, Lake Michigan. Both my girlfriend and I were literally in shock, we kept asking each other, ""Did you see that?"" Things were different back then, there was no internet to get information and so the next day we just verified with each other that in fact we had seen it and then we never talked about it again. About a year later I got married and moved out of State and lost touch with my childhood friend. But while visiting my parents recently I tracked her down & we met up. It was so strange but she is the one who brought it up and asked me, ""Do you remember when we saw that UFO?"" All these years later but both of us remember the main details like it was yesterday. it is not the kind of thing you forget. I don't remember if it was spinning, I don't remember any other color lights just the incredibly BRIGHT white light, it was big I would say the diameter was a good 75ft to 100ft. I am estimating that using the width of the road, and remember I was up very close to it. I realized after reading various reports here that I have a very unique experience, most people see flashing lights or if they see a craft it is farther away.  This is the reason all these years later I am filing the report. I didn't see something in a distance, or simply lights I saw a real flying saucer and I saw it up close, so I'm filling in the report.  I think it was probably in the fall because I do remember that the corn had been harvested but it was not yet snowing out, so my guess would be in September or October and the year would have been either 1973 or 1974.  Oh I almost forgot to add, there was no noise.",2014-11-14T00:00:00,42.2667,-88.0508

While on duty as the Tower Chief at Luke Air Force Base in 1974 we in the tower received a call from Command Post over the ""Hot Line"" at which time the Col. on the other end said that a resident of a nearby community called Sun City believes she see a UFO and ask us to speak with her. I a Staff Sargent and the senior NCO in the tower took the call.  Immediately the lady started directing us to look West just above the White Tank Mountain range at which time she pointed out a rather bright glowing object located approximately 15-20 degrees above the peak of the White Tanks.  At first glance it looked somewhat like a star.  She kept asking us over and over ""do you see it, do you see it?"" to which we answered, ""no"".  I wish to point out at this time that we lied to the lady.  We saw the object all too well.  But, due to the extremely heavy amount of paperwork we would have to undergo not to mention a psychological assessment we answered her, no and that was a lie.  To this day I regret lying to this lady.  The actual incident was as follows.  The UFO was real and clearly visible.  It glowed orange to red and seem to move all about at approx 2-10 degrees each time it moved.  We observed this object for over a 45 minute period and suddenly, and literally in the blink of an eye it shot up and off to the right (North)at about a 15 degree angle off vertical and suddenly it was gone.  The object departed in what I call ""the speed of thought"".  To this day my greatest regret is not validating the ladies comments who called us as she asked them and let her know her eyes were not lying to her but were real.  I at 66 years old that the UFO was as real as I am.  I record this incident at this time to support the truth movement in UFOs and promise to support the movement from this time forward as I have for the past 20+ years.

I am reporting an event I witnessed in 1994, twenty years ago.  A lot of time has passed, but it was one of those moments that get seared into one's mind forever.  I would like to give some background information and describe my experience as best as I can recall it. On a summer evening in late August, my friend, mother and I were laying outside in our yard on our trampoline.  It may have been around 11 to midnight as it was most definitely dark, and the sun would not have set until 9:15pm that time of year.  We were idly stargazing and chatting as we often did.  We lived near rural Ida, Michigan, (an agricultural community in southeast Michigan, about an hour south of Detroit, near the Ohio border) and did not have a lot of light pollution so stargazing was a normal summer evening past time. I would often track commercial airlines and  watch  the horizons because where we lived is defined by very flat, treeless farmland and uninterrupted views could be see in any direction.  Plane spotting was easy as we seemed to live under the flight path of the Detroit Metro Airport, and would very often view low flying commercial aircraft circling over our house.  So I am very familiar with viewing planes at night. On that evening, however, I recall quietly talking, and not really paying attention to anything particular in the sky.  However, I remember all at once immediately realizing that I could not see the stars up above me.  It was a clear night.  I recall sitting up in the trampoline, looking up and seeing a mass in the air above our yard that was large enough to seem to sit over the entire property as it passed, which was around ¾ of an acre.  I could tell it was a triangular mass only by lights on three points.  I generally recall that they were not too bright, yet also illuminated the ground around us below.  It was low, seemingly floating just barely over the top of our barn and farmhouse, however, since I did regularly experience those low flying planes that were waiting to land, I knew it only seemed to be that low.  What was most eerie about the encounter that the flying mass seemed to make little or no noise.  It glided almost over like a helium float, but in a controlled and steady fashion.  I recall there being something like a low pulse hum, but I don't remember it being loud, like if I had been in the house or if there was traffic noise etc, I may not have noticed it at all. The mass headed in a southern direction.  However, I did not watch it to see where it went.  To be honest, my friend and I were scared out of our minds and as soon as it directly overhead us, I remember fleeing to our house in sheer terror, dragging my mother along, who was laying tummy down and didn't notice it right away (which tells you how quiet it was).  I was very freaked out, as the 90's was hooked on X-Files and crop signs, but I don't ever remember feeling it was alien.  It's hard to explain, but even though I couldn't explain it, and I feared it, I felt it was military or something. The only thing I can't quite remember is, is if there was a center light.  I feel like I remember there being a cooler light in the center of the mass, but I am not entirely sure as I only acutely remember the three lights making the triangular shape. I never again saw an object like that fly in the skies where we lived.  Although, I did note lights that would seem like satellites in the sky, (bright, no twinkle) but would stop and start movement in the sky in unpredictable patterns.  And when they move, I would get light interference in radio signals.  (I would often wear headphones and listen to fm radio on my Walkman if I was stargazing alone).  I noted these most often in western skies and off and on over several years.  I don't know if this was related.",2014-11-14T00:00:00,41.8891,-83.578

One evening while driving westbound on I-40 through Arizona with my wife by my side and two other trucks (one with husband and wife team, the other a solo driver) driving together and staying in communication with each other via CB radios.  I noticed the glow of lights on the horizon as the sun had set. I didn't think anything of them at first as I chocked them up to street lights.  Three of the lights however did catch my attention, then my wifes, then the others behind us.  They seemed different than the other lights as they seemed liquid ( they didn't share the glare that the other lights had) and they seemed to be moving in our direction between the interstate and the parallel mountain range on the northern side ( to our right).  They looked like a triangle in shape (considering the angle as it approached).  I used the CB to communicate with the others and they concurred that we were all seeing the same object. As! they got closer, the size became more apparent.  There was a mountain about 3/4 of a mile to the north of the hiway.  The forward light (front) was directly over the mountain, the left over the hiway, and the right now out of view as the mountain became dwarfed in the foreground.  We all pulled to the shoulder of the hiway as we noticed that 3-4 cars on the Eastbound side had pulled over and were standing in the hiway.  We did the same. We looked up at a huge triangular object that made no sound as it hovered on by darkening the sky from the stars.  Then in an instant, shot south toward Phoenix without creating a slight breaze. It has been a life changer for all of us.  Thank you for being available to share or document this. ((ADDENDUM FROM PRESUMED WITNESS)) I posted the wrong month, it was in March not August.  Sorry.

I was driving home from work after making my delivery and when I got about 2 miles outside of Asheboro, NC on I-73, I-74, I saw something I hadn’t seen before and I make this trip every day.  I looked to my left about 2 or 3 miles ahead (it was dark) and there are some power poles/towers  together that have some white lights going up the sides of them.  They are not the tallest towers around, because there are a bunch of them around the few mile stretch of road, but those two are the closet two that are together.  As I got closer I noticed the color turquoise was illuminating from between the two towers.  The closer I got the more distinguished it became and at 1st I thought it had to be a blimp.  But then I realized it wasn’t big enough. It was about half the size of a blimp.  I kept looking for some kind of support under it like posts or metal legs holding it up and then I thought it must be a water tower they just put up, but I saw none when I got closer and it actually moved just a bit.  I noticed as I got closer it had a string red lights all the way around it protruding like Saturn’s halo but I think was attached.  When I got as close as I could, which was about probably a ¼- ½ mile to my left off through the woods, I saw it the best I could. It was the shape of a sphere.  Almost like you would see in a cheesy sci fi movie form the 50’s.  Illuminated in turquoise with the red lights going around it. It was actually chaos on the road as others saw it and were struggling to continues to drive straight as they tried to make out what they saw.  I thought I’d be side swiped,  The only thing that saved it from happening was there wasn’t very many cars on the road…I saw 2 cars pull over, but I was afraid to, because I feared someone would ass end me looking at the site as opposed to seeing me on the shoulder, so I reached for my iPhone to take a pic/video and struggled to get it on and just as I held it up, the damn trees blocked my view.  So I drove real slow for the next mile, hoping to get a break in the trees as everybody else did as well.  The speed limit is 65 there and everybody was doing 40.  I took my exit about a mile later to go off on the split where I-74 leaves I-73 and hoped to get to an elevated spot where I could still see it.  Finally as I began to give up I looked back and turned my neck as far as I could and I saw it! It had taken off and was headed due west (I was! headed north) and it had climbed high in a short amount of time, and it looked like a green airliner disappearing in the night sky.   In about 3 minutes or so approx, I saw what appeared to be an air force jet go by high in the sky in that direction. I also saw about 10 NC State police doing about 100 mph headed south toward where I just came from.",2014-09-18T00:00:00,35.68614224137931,-79.81482500000001

There was one in the center which appeared stationary.  To its left, there was another object/set of lights moving towards it.  To the right of the center object, there was another object/set of lights that was moving towards the center.

It's brighter than Venus by comparison, glowing a dull yet vibrant orange.   Fireworks dissipate over time while this unidentified light glimmers behind.  We stare in some mild form of disbelief.  Tears are coming out of my eyes for no particular reason I can fathom.  The light sits, unwavering. 	My first thought was that it might be a paper lantern.  Being a holiday it seemed likely that someone might light off a few.  It's possible that a paper lantern could have been caught in an inversion current leaving it in a point of temporary stasis.  From experience we know what paper lanterns look like however, regardless of distance.  The light being emitted was far to bright to be a little ball of fire in a bag.

By the time I make it to my neighbors front door, the object has vanished.   While it's very plausible that this was something mundane, we can only go with the emotions during the event.  The feeling was grandiose, like witnessing a miracle.  Hearts were racing, not with fear, but a feeling of tranquility and unrequited joy.

The night sky was clear of haze or clouds, which is unusual for our area this time of year.  High in the sky (much higher than the city fireworks displays), I saw a bright orange round ‘fireball’.   The object looked unusual to me, so I grabbed my 50x binoculars to get a closer look. Watching through the binoculars, I could see that the fireball was slowly moving from east to west.   After a few minutes, a commercial airplane flew from west to east, lower in the sky than the object, perhaps originating from SeaTac airport.  As the airplane neared the fireball vertically, the orange fireball light went out, but I could see the faint circular or oval shape of the object since I had been tracking it through the binoculars.   After a minute or two the outline became fainter and I lost visual track of the object even through my binoculars. The orange object reappeared after a few minutes moving lower in the sky from west to east.  I had the other witness look through the window and by then we observed two orange objects moving from west to east.  We lost view of the objects as they past our local tree line after a few minutes. I have never seen this type of flying object.

So you could use Bryn Mawr as the neighborhood online if you would like to be more specific. I was intrerested to see that you seem to have received quite a few orange fire ball type sightings from across the country.  Thanks for your reporting database.

As soon as I noticed the red orb (bigger than a helicopter, equivalent size to a small turbo-prop plane), I immediately realized it wasn’t a satellite, aircraft, or helicopter (it made no sound).  This orb seemed to notice me back (this was my initial gut-feeling), stopping dead in the sky at that moment.  Then it started quickly flashing a green light, then a red light, and then a green light at me, consecutively, around 6-8 times and then stopped, while remaining stationary in the sky above.  The colors reminded me of that popular electronic game in the 70’s, called Simon (best example of what the red/green lights looked like) with musical tones corresponding to it’s 4 large colored buttons when pushed; or the red and green colors of a traffic light.  However, there was absolutely no sound related to my sighting of this hovering red orb, it was completely silent. It felt as if a message was being communicated to me directly, although I didn’t understand it. I mentally thought back to the object, “I don’t understand the message, what does it mean?”  As the orb still remained motionless in the sky above me, nothing more flashed towards me, nor did I get any other communication (gut-feelings/thoughts) from this object.  Next, I told the object mentally, “I believe you’re friendly, at least I think you are, but I’m not sure what it is you want.  I will tell you anything you want to know, you can ask me, but I don’t want to be abducted & examined,” (laughing to myself now, knowing this sounds absurd as I stood in the dark staring at this sphere for around 5 minutes), although I was serious at the time this happened, and this was the dialogue running through my mind. Shortly thereafter my neighbor came down the path, I instinctively knew I wasn’t going to share this with him (I don’t think he would’ve believed me anyhow), so I mentally said goodbye to the red orb, still remaining stationary in the sky above me at that time. Before I walked up my stairs, I greeted my neighbor who was unaware of the object.  As I walked up the stairs, I wondered if the red orb was still there. I called a close friend as soon as I walked in my place.  This friend said she believed my story, however I’ll never know for sure.  About a half hour later I did go back outside to see if the red orb was still there…it wasn’t.  I regretted leaving the encounter so soon.",2015-01-30T00:00:00,21.4116,-158.0183

I opened the window to let the warm ocean breeze in and was very surprised to see what I at first thought was a very beautiful moon in the clear, dark sky!   I stood at the window, watching the object-- it was a very large circle that was emitting bright orange light.  I realized quickly that it couldn't be the moon for several reasons: it was much bigger (about twice the size of a full moon), it was a full circle (the moon was a waxing gibbous at the time), and it made no sense for the moon to be positioned there at this time (my bedroom faces in the direction in which the moon rises-- at 3AM, the moon would not be so close to that part of the horizon.)   It began moving downwards at a steady pace (faster than I've ever seen the moon move) so I reached for my phone to take a picture before it was hidden behind the mountains.  I did take a photo and it is visible there, although it's terrible quality because I took it with an iPhone 5 at nighttime.  I wanted to see if I could get a better picture, so I went to grab my mom's professional camera.   I stepped away for maybe 3 minutes tops, and when I came back, the object was completely gone. I didn't think too much of it past a curious, ""I wonder what that was!"" and didn't talk about I again until I mentioned it casually to a friend 2 days later and they informed me that that's not an uncommon description for UFO sightings.

Over the tree line, in the direction of Plum High School, we saw two bright orange lights moving along the tree line -- one following the other.  My wife wondered if they were planes or jetliners, and I thought they were two close together.  Just then, two more orange lights appeared behind the first two but they were in a different pattern, not following one another but stacked.  It should be noted there was no sound, and a smooth motion as they moved across the tree line and eventually faded away.  Maybe a meteor breaking up? It was weird!

At the time I was eleven years old.  I am a retired Air Force Intelligence Officer (Major), and Veteran of The Gulf War. I was sitting looking out a window when I saw a large bright object descending at a fast rate of speed. It was coming down at a 45% angle at perhaps fifty miles per hour. I thought it was a rocket, because of its shape, a cylinder with rounded ends. I ran and hid behind the couch away from the window.  I expected an explosion but heard nothing, so I looked out. I saw the UFO hovering a block down the street over roof tops. The UFO had descended at 22nd Street, descending at the intersection of 22nd and Mount Vernon Street, moving North then stopping at 22nd and Wallace Street.  I was viewing the object from my Grandmother and Grandfather's 3rd floor apartment window at 643 North 22nd Street, Philadelphia Pa on June 25th 1968. The UFO followed the outline of all the homes and buildings-opposite my side of the street, including a church.  It flew just feet above the roof tops. It would pause, descend, and rise, hovering about ten feet above all the roof tops. It was as if it was viewing inside the homes.  It moved slowly traveling at walking pace. The UFO was the length of a city bus, with rounded ends, but wider in circumference.  It was a large cylinder, it had no markings of any kind, no wings, no visible engines, no windows. The entire surface was made up of a plasma field, like a close up image of the Sun. These gases or ions spun and disappeared under the surface, diving and rising like a gas. The brightness was intense.  It was composed of several colors, white, yellow and orange. It reminded me of someone mixing giant cans of paint.  It was very beautiful but hard on the eyes because of its brilliance. At this point in my life I think what I saw then was a fusion powered ship.  I'm also glad it did not damage my eyesight.  They sky was clear, it was a hot summer's day. At one point I turned around looking behind me into the apartment and noticed the patterns of light also produced shadows on my Grandmothers walls.  The patterns it produced on the walls were dark with light edges.  The patterns matched the moving patterns of the vessel's surface.  The only thing I've ever seen similar are close up films of The Sun. In addition to the swirling patterns of light I noticed it was layered in a raised dimple pattern that covered it's entire surface.  The dimples appeared to vibrate but stayed in place like those on a basketball while plumes of gas rose and fell like filaments of a magnet.  This was truly amazing to see!  At times I used my hands to shield my eyes. It was the brightest light I've ever seen and today I'm sixty years old, as of November 2014. I was alone viewing the object.  My Grandfather was at work and my Grandmother went downstairs to another apartment for a short time. It approached my location stopping directly in front of me.  I was in the third floor apartment. I did not feel any heat.  At this point it was about 80 feet away, close enough to throw a ball to it! I was able to observe this object for perhaps five minutes in total, which seemed then to be a long time.  As I said it paused several times over apartments, then would move and stop again several times.  It flew over the bell tower of The Olivet Covenant Presbyterian church (current name) at 22nd and Wallace Streets, just across from my location. Just before the UFO changed direction (descending, or rising, stopping or starting to move forward) it emitted a loud sound.  The sound always preceded its change in movement by about two seconds each time.  So I knew when it was going to move again.  The sound reminded me of a loud hiss from an old steam train.  I'm not saying there was steam just that the sound was similar to that or when a large truck makes releasing air brakes. It was strange hearing an anachronistic sound and seeing an advanced flying vehicle!  Once the UFO got to the last building at the intersection of 22nd and Fairmont Streets it angled at 45 degrees, with its front end pointing up, it rose about fifty feet. I ran to another window on the side facing Wallace Street, so was able to watch it again.  It leveled off, then flew over the walls of the Eastern State Penitentiary, (This spooky relic is now open to the public for tours) it picked up speed at about 35 miles per hour flying North. It continued flying North at a level constant speed until I lost view of it.  This craft was definitely controlled by some form of intelligence.  It was not a blimp,  I had seen these vessels before for the Philadelphia Army Navy games traditionally held in Philadelphia in those years. When my Grandmother came in I told her what I had witnessed.  We were both very religious, she had difficulty believing my story and asked me to swear by placing my hand on The Bible, which I did.  She was convinced and saddened that she had missed this wonderful sight by just minutes. That evening or perhaps the next night we watched a TV program that highlighted the vessel I had seen and their close encounter with it.  The program was ""The Arthur Godfrey Show"", or one of his ""Specials"".  Arthur Godfrey was a respected pilot, and was a Colonel in the Air Force Reserve.  Arthur Godfrey and Frank Munciello another experienced pilot were flying in a small aircraft from New York to the Washington DC area.  Their flight path took them over or near Philadelphia on the same day of my encounter.  Live on national TV Author Godfrey described that a brilliantly lit vessel followed and maneuvered around his aircraft. He said it matched his course and speed.  He admitted he was scared of the vessel's close maneuvers until it finally veered off.  Arthur Godfrey was a well know TV producer and TV host.   His TV program was viewed by millions of Americans.  My grandparents and I knew he was describing the same vessel I had seen. An account of Arthur Godfrey's! story can be read on Ufodocarchiv.org. In 1993 I happened across a book, ""The UFO Encyclopedia"" by John Spencer. On page 129 I read the account by Arthur Godfrey validating my sighting. Later accounts of Arthur Godfrey's story have been muddied. Some report the incident online as 1964, 1965 and 1966, some report it was during the evening, or say he was reporting an event he witnessed years earlier. The actual date he saw the vessel was June 25 1965, then he reported it in the evening. He was not in both places at the same time. As I viewed his broadcast myself, I was stunned at his anger and asking for an explanation as to what had happened. He was mad because this event had just happened, and was not years prior as some recent reports are now saying. I hope someone can track down a recording of that broadcast. I can recall to this day my Grandparents discussing me and what to do about the sighting. My Grandmother wanted to call Mr Arthur Godfrey who had just reported the sighting on national TV.  My Grandfather opposed it saying I would be tagged as the Flying Saucer Boy or some other bad thing that would only cause me harm. I remember my Grandmother wanting to talk to someone at The Franklin Institute Planetarium in Philadelphia. She wanted to know if others had reported seeing the vessel.  I stayed several weeks with my Grandparents, finally they told me not to mention it to anyone.  Years later, as an Intelligence Officer, I often gave my Air Force squadron current intelligence briefings.  I was an Intelligence Officer in the 732nd Military Airlift Squadron at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey,  I served in this position for approximately ten years, including during The Gulf War. During one briefing an Aircrew explained to me they encountered a Ball Lightening Encounter, also called Saint Elmo's Fire.  A sphere of charged particles entered the airframe of their aircraft while cruising at 40,000 feet.  The aircraft was a C-141 Starlifter.  The sphere about three feet in diameter entered the cockpit then floated inside the aircraft to the cargo bay where it hovered for a time then vanished. The entire crew witnesses the sphere and actually enjoyed the event.  They asked if I knew of any UFO sightings.  I then told them my story.  This upset my Squadron Training Officer who verbally reprimanded me, I was ordered to never speak about UFO's again.  I eventually retired from the military as a Major in 1997",,39.99063505273804,-75.14580121369744

The show location was at the Ford Development Center/proving ground in Dearborn Mi.  The weather that night was exceptional.  Clear skies, low humidity, mid 70's in temperature. It is important to note that the show consisted of two musical acts.  They were country musicians Deanna Carter, and Alan Jackson.  There was no light show, no laser stage lights. Nothing of that nature at all.  That is important for me to mention due to the fact I have had several people attempt to tell me what I saw, when in fact they were not in attendance.  More then one person has said that what I saw was due to stage lights.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Between acts all the stage lights were turned off and no lights at all were directed at or coming from the stage while the equipment change was made for the next act.  Most people at this point were standing around talking and waiting for Alan Jackson, the main act, to take the stage.  My girlfriend and I had brought a blanket to sit on.  During the equipment change on stage we had both laid back and were relaxing in silence while we both looked up into the night sky. It was at this point, while laying on the blanket looking up into the night sky I noticed something off to my left in my peripheral vision moving slowly across the sky.  The first impression I had was that a flock of birds were flying over the crowd.  As I watched further I realized that these were not birds but a group of what I can only describe as dull white orbs moving in what I would call a random pattern.  I do not know the exact number but I would put it at about a dozen or so orbs of dull whitish light.  They were not bright, but more of a dull luminescence is the way I can best describe them. As I watched the group of lights move over the crowd, my best estimate is that they were at about 100-200 feet or so above ground level. All of the sudden the lights broke from their random looking pattern. They all began to move in what I can only describe as an amazingly fluid, aerodynamically impossible manner. This is the part that is like trying to describe a vivid dream to someone. No matter how I try I cannot convey how absolutely strange and otherworldly their movements were. The only thing I can think of that might describe their movements would be dolphins swimming underwater. It was such a smooth, fluid, acrobatically impossible way of movement I was stunned. What happened next was even more amazing. At the exact same time the orbs broke from their amazingly fluid movements and formed a perfect looking circle. They held that pattern for perhaps a half minute or so. Then they broke from that pattern and resumed their fluid looking aerial acrobatic display. Then as suddenly they resumed the random pattern I had first saw them in. From there they continued in the same direction I had first saw them. I watched them as they proceeded to move at their original slow pace until they vanished down the horizon. At this point I looked to my right to see if my girlfriend had observed what I had. She was looking from the sky to me and she asked me something to the effect of ""WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?"" My girlfriend was a person who did not believe in anything that couldn't be explained logically. She was an atheist, and as far as UFO's were concerned they were the for looney people. Later that night when we returned to my house I told my sister and her boyfriend who were staying at my place what we had seen. They listened and I got the feeling that they were not impressed with my description of this otherworldly sight I was describing. Well the next morning when my sister got to her job at Ford Motor company she met one of her coworkers in the elevator.  The first thing out of my sisters coworkers mouth was ""I went to that concert last night and I saw the most amazing lights in the sky I have ever seen""  She proceeded to tell my sister what she had seen and it was obviously the exact same thing I had seen. I have over the years been looking for anybody online who was from this area who may have seen something like this that same night.  One of your reports is from a man in Westland Mi, not far from where I saw what I did.  He reports that he saw something on 9/22/1998 at 12:10 AM.  Which in fact would place it on the same night I saw what I did on 9/21/1998 at about 9:00 PM or so.  So it seems that in SE Michigan on the night of 9/21/1998, and the morning of 9/22/1998 there was some very serious activity in this area.",2014-11-14T00:00:00,42.317738992042436,-83.21002201591511

This was not a plane or helicopter or any sort of craft that we had ever seen before.  It was about 150'-200' above the water and about 300' away from us or off the shore.

In the summer of 2006, my then girlfriend and I were staying with my cousin.  Oddly enough, I used to live with him during my teen years, and being that he was in the military and then a city police officer, he had high powered lasers for his rifles etc. I can recall many nights sitting outside around 2002 and pointing this laser into the vast sky and thinking what if?  During this get together my cousin had there were many balloons but none with helium and definitely not any that would fit what I am about to tell you. I was outside smoking a ciggerette, we were not allowed to smoke in his house.  I glance over cause i see the still existing patch of woods swaying back and forth.  This was odd cause it was a dry and calm night with almost no wind. I walk toward the road and look to my right and up from the tops of the trees an almost colorless or reflective sphere seemingly floats out of the center of this wooded area. As I see this I immediately am drawn to it.  Saying to myself where did this balloon come from.  As I am watching, I realize this is no balloon. The sphere makes no sound, shows no propulsion mechanism and seems to actively reflect the color of the street light directly it and myself (orangeish/red).  As I keep trying to convince myself this is something earthly, I instantly felt connected with it as if it was intelligent or being controlled by some form of intelligence. I thought to myself, I have to get my girlfriend no one will believe this if I dont, then it moved in a hovering fashion about ten feet higher from where it was stationary above the power lines.  I mean this thing was like 35-40 feet above me and at one point as close as 20-30ft.  So I went over all the movie lines in my head about aliena once I sensed some sort of intelligent control from this object, like we come in peace and me thinking.  to it I will not hurt you what are you and in a sense, I swear it made me feel safe, empowered, watched over and took off literally in the blink of an eye. When it left from a hovering state it flew away ratjer slowly as if gaining.  Momentum but then it hit hyperdrive and cleared one end of the horizon to the other in milliseconds. The object up close was just noticeably 12-18 ft in diameter had no sound no lights and could.travel at beyond or near light speed. There is more what felt like dialogue during thus encounter and it would take an interview to really explain how amazing it was. Since my encounter, My knowledge has increased to a considerably higher status and I have survived a fatal car accident in which I bled out entirely and was helivacced to a specialised trauma unit.  I also have noticed what seems to be increased empathy or maybe a development of telepathy.  I really feel like I hear when someone is thinking, specifically in connection with them thinking of me and only in close proximity.  I swear this sounds crazy but I swear on the lives of my children I am telling you the truth. It's like I sense the things a person does not want to tell me, like I can hear their thoughts about me literally. I feel whatever it was it was other worldly and was visiting due to a signal that was an.accident on my part and took four and a half almost five years to get a reply for (me shining lasers with the aspiration of reaching e.t.)  It's like it knew or could hear me telepathically communicating the memory of me trying to send that signal cause i felt like its visit was my answer.  Yes we are here and Yea we hear your desire to communicate, obviously I had considered throwing things at it while it was hovering above me to see what it was.  Not movement no words just the thought of doing it made it move further away and then it flew away when I THOUGHT of getting someone else. There is so much more to this than I have time to type on my cell but I did want to report this. Also noted where I lived was next to an abandoned airport in my town that was right next my highschool. THE OBJECT BECAME THE SIZE OF A REGULAR STAR IN THE NIGHT SKY BEFORE I COULD EVEN BLINK. The distances it covered and way it traveled is unlike anything known to physically exist on earth.  Atleast publically but from there in cookeville it traveled north north east toward and obviously over livingston, tn and albany, ky direction. Also noted timeframe is fuzzy I would.have to ask my cousin what day he sold his.house and him and i do not speak. so this sighting/encounter may be related.to.others during that year. I'd like to think since then that I kind of have a guardian or witnessed a recon mission lol   Live long and prosper friends.",2014-11-14T00:00:00,36.22579261083744,-85.51567832512315

In the last couple of days (I'm writing this in November, 2014) I was listening to a podcast where Peter Davenport was interviewed; in the interview, Mr. Davenport encouraged anyone who had ever had a sighting at any time, no matter how much time had passed, to please write and submit their report.  That is why I am submitting this report at this time. I do believe that this incident was quite significant and should be documented. In 1996 I was 18 years old.  I grew up and had lived in the same house in rural Michigan my entire life at that time, my parents still live there to this day.  Our house was located on a small lake, it was and still is the only house on the lake.  There is a trail from our house around the lake which leads to a small public access area.  I knew this trail very well and I would often take walks around the lake. On this particular evening (unfortunately I don't know the exact date, but I do remember that it was late spring of 1996, and for some reason I believe this happened on a Monday) I wasn't tired and I decided to go for a walk around the lake.  I remember thinking about the fact that I was about to graduate high school and that soon I would be moving to Chicago for college.  I remember looking at the lake and the sky and thinking about the fact that I wouldn't have access to this beautiful piece of land for very much longer and I was trying to absorb the location as much as possible.  I mention this only to try to give further verification that although this happened almost 20 years ago, I still remember very minute  details, even down to what I was thinking about at the time. I took the trail around the lake and although I carried a flashlight with me,  I didn't turn it on as I knew the trail so well.  It was a very clear night and there was a moon in the sky which illuminated the area enough to where I could see quite well.  The trail to the primitive public access site was approximately 3/4 of a mile from our house.  Not surprisingly, I was the only person there at the time. I stood on the shore of the lake and looked up at the sky.  On a clear night, the stars are very bright in that area because there is no light pollution to diminish their radiance. I was looking north over the lake at the sky for several minutes when I noticed what I thought was a satellite moving across the sky slowly from east to west. There was nothing spectacular about this, it looked like a small, white, illuminated satellite light that I had seen countless times before, it emitted no sound at all. I thought at the time that this was a satellite because it was just a solid, slow moving white light with no blinking red or green lights that would indicate that it was an airplane. I watched this light move, really just because it was something to look at when, out of the corner of my eye I noticed another ""satellite"" moving from the exact opposite direction, from west to east at the same slow rate of speed, also emitting no sound. This seemed odd to me because, normally satellites only move in one direction, not two in opposite directions. As I watched these two objects slowly move across the sky and as they moved closer to each other, I realized that they were moving on exactly the same, but opposite course. As they moved closer to each other, it appeared that at some point they would either crash (I didn't think that would happen) or they would totally eclipse each other to where, for a split second, it might appear that there was only one light. They got to where they were almost going to meet, then they both suddenly came to a complete stop very close to each other. Both objects were now almost directly overhead of my position, approximately at a 70 degree angle from my point of reference. I had never seen any moving object in the sky come to a complete stop, much less two of them, that's when it happened. The first object shot slightly to the north, while the second object, in perfect synchronicity, shot directly to the south, they then turned and one suddenly moved east while the other moved west, then south,north, east, west etc... in opposite motions, making a perfect square pattern. It's hard to judge the size of this ""square"" that they were making because although I do believe they were outside of the earth's atmosphere (I'll explain why later) I really have no idea how big they were, how far away they were, or how large this square pattern was. The only reference point I can give is if you were to take any two of the stars on Orion's Belt as you stare at it from our vantage point on earth, and if you were to ""draw a line"" between these stars, you would have the approximate size of one of the ""sides"" of this square. The description of this square pattern is easier to convey in terms of a two dimensional surface like a chalk board rather then the three dimensional universe that we see. If you were to imagine two independently moving pieces of chalk on a chalk board representing the two flying lights, if one moved north or ""up"" the other moved south or ""down,"" one ""left"" the other ""right,"" over and over again and in such a fast rate of speed that it created a perfect geometric square with precise 90 degree angle turns. I watched these two lights making a perfect square pattern for about a minute or so. I couldn't believe that I was actually witnessing this, so much so in fact that I literally didn't believe my eyes. At this point I actually looked away to try to confirm that I wasn't imagining the whole thing. I remember touching my tow into the water and watching the ripples emanate from my foot. I grabbed a piece of bark from the tree directly behind my, I smelled the bark and I took it and rubbed it briskly on my arm, I felt it scrape along my skin. I did this as sort of a ""systems check"" mostly just to confirm that I wasn't dreaming and that I was in fact in complete control of my body and my senses. I then looked back up into the sky, the square pattern was still happening. At this point I became so overwhelmingly excited. I couldn't believe what I was seeing but I knew I was seeing it. The two objects creating the square pattern were moving so fast and it was mesmerizing. I began to feel, actually to realize, that this was something that was happening for my benefit, or at the very least for my entertainment. I knew at that moment that I was as aware of ""them"" as they were of me. I can't quite describe how I knew that they were aware of me other than that I just knew that they were. It's sort of like if you were to look across a crowded room and make eye contact with a random and complete stranger, your eyes meet and then you both smile or perhaps even wave at each other, you don't need to be telepathic to know that you are both aware of each other; that's how this moment felt. I have since wondered if there was something telepathic going on there and I can't honestly say for sure. All I can say is that I know I was aware of a living presence and it felt overwhelmingly positive. It could simply be that this was the most amazing thing I've ever seen before (or since) and I felt so fortunate to be seeing it. I didn't feel that there was any underlying message being given to me other than at least two very advanced beings, with capability beyond anything humans could create just wanted to say, ""hi, we're here and look how cool this is!"" I remember smiling from ear to ear. This went on for at least four or five more minutes. It went on for so long in fact that I remember thinking that no one would believe this, I wished that I had a way to bring everyone I knew into this situation, or to somehow document it with a camera, but unfortunately I couldn't do that, so the only thing I could do would be to enjoy it and to remember every detail as best I could. After what felt like a very long time (again, I'd say four or five minutes, it felt so long that I began to wonder when it would end) the two objects then stopped and rested in the same position where they first came to a stop in the sky originally. Then, just as they came in, they both departed at the same slow rate of speed that they first emerged, but in opposite directions. One object departed towards the east, the other towards the west. As they moved farther apart, suddenly the object moving to the west seemed to emit something, a gigantic fireball. This looked like a meteor entering our atmosphere (this is why I believe these objects were just outside of our atmosphere) but probably ten times the size of any ""shooting star"" that I had ever seen. It took up an enormous part of the sky, it was larger than almost any Fourth of July firework that I'd ever seen. It dropped out of the sky and appeared to come almost straight down across the lake to the north. It was a brilliant flash of light that lasted for only a second or so but it was so big and so bright that it made me yell out with excitement. I didn't see any object dropping other than the fireball itself and I have no idea if it ""landed,"" burned up in the atmosphere, traveled for miles or just came straight down. Like the other two objects, the fireball made no noise. The object that appeared to emit it, as well as the other object, ! continued on their course until they were out of range. I was left standing there trying to comprehend what I had just witnessed. I began walking back around the lake, my mind reeling with what I had just experienced. I had walked about 1/4 of a mile and was just on the other side of the lake from where I had seen everything, still about 1/2 a mile from home, when I began to hear something. I sometimes hesitate to tell this part of the story, because I honestly have no idea if this is at all related to what I had just witnessed, but in the interest of full disclosure, I feel it is important to document this. Something in the woods just behind me and over my left shoulder, began moving and walking towards me, I didn't see it, but I could hear it. It is important to remember that I had grown up in these woods and that I was very familiar with the sounds that animals make. If I hear a bluejay, I don't need to see it to know it's there, the same with the scampering sound of a squirrel, the waddling of a raccoon, the soft step and startled ""snort"" of a deer etc... The sound that I was hearing was unmistakably the sound of footsteps on the leaves. The footsteps approaching directly behind me and over my left shoulder. The only sound that I can compare this to is the somewhat heavy, bipedal sound of human footsteps, in a very rhythmic, ""crunch, crunch, crunch,"" pattern. It sounded distant at first but it slowly began moving closer. Very few animals move around at night, unless perhaps they are injured or sick. Nocturnal ground animals like racoons don't sound anything like this. There are no bears or wolves in that area that I've ever seen, and although I've heard many animals walking through the woods,! I've never once had one follow me. Obviously this was terrifying, especially considering what I had just seen. I got to a fork in the trail where I stayed to the left to get home. After taking this part of the trail, this thing was still following me and moving closer. I stopped. It took a few more steps then stopped. I started walking again and it started walking again. It slowly kept getting closer. My heart was beating through my chest at this point and my mind was racing, not just because I didn't know what this was but also because of everything that had happened to me so recently. I remember being very scared, by now I would estimate that whatever this was had to be about 15 feet or less away from me. Scared or not, I needed to know what this was. I wasn't going to walk the entire way home with something following me, and the idea of running away from it actually seemed worse because for all I knew, it might start chasing me. I stopped again. I turned on my flashlight. I quickly spun around and ran as fast as I could in the direction that I could hear this thing. My adrenaline was working overtime and as I started to sprint. I think I heard the sound of  leaves scattering, but I can't say for certain as the sound of my own feet were now the loudest thing in the area. As fast as this happened, I didn't see anything. I ran off the trail and into the woods, my flashlight now brightening the woods. Branches were whipping across my face but I didn't care, I needed to see what this was. I zigzagged back and forth, back onto the trail and off again looking on the ground, into the trees, everywhere that I could see, but I saw nothing. If this were an animal, you'd think I would have seen a tail, or legs, or something scampering up a tree, but I saw nothing. To this day I have no idea what that was. For all I know this could have been an animal behaving strangely that got away from me very quickly, perhap! s it was something else entirely, I really can't say for sure. I don't exactly remember what happened after that. I'm quite sure I remember walking home along the trail and going up into my room and directly to bed, but this now feels like a distant memory. I sincerely regret not writing this down immediately after it happened, or at the very least taking note of the time and date that it occurred, but I guess I just assumed that I would remember all of those details forever. Obviously I know now that is not the case. The only other strange thing about this story is that I really have no memory of telling anyone about this until years after it happened.  I have a great relationship with my parents and I'm sure I must have told them, my high school girlfriend or any of my other friends, but I don't remember doing that.  I remember telling one of my roommates this story about six or seven years later.  I remember when I told him that I had already told some other people about it but I really didn't think about it that much since that night.  To this day, even when I try to talk to someone like my parents, who know that I wouldn't make something like this up, they believe that I saw something, but they definitley don't believe the details that I absolutely know are true.  I used to get very angry when I told people this story and they didn't believe me. I've received a lot of ridicule from other people who trust me and are very close to me as well; perhaps that's why I didn't and still don't tell! this story very often. Probably because of this incident, I've become very intrigued with Ufology over the years. I've read many books and watched many videos. I've of coursed wondered if I may have been abducted that night, but after revisiting this incident many, many times and given it much objectionable thought, I really don't believe that I was. As I've stated, aside from that brief scare in the woods, this was an overwhelmingly positive experience for me. Over the years I've learned not to get angry about the fact that it seems like only a small handful of people take this story at face value, basically that it happened and I don't really know much more than that. I've accepted the fact that many people don't know how to deal with something like this, and also that I have no idea who or what this really was, where they came from or why I got to see this when so few other people haven't had an experience like this. What I've learned to take away from this over the years is that I'm extremely grateful that it happened. Aside from the few terrifying moments in the woods, this was an overwhelmingly positive experience, filled with wonder and hope that there is something greater than us. I have no idea if these things are from other planets, other dimensions or perhaps right here on earth from something other than human origins. All I know for certain as that this happened and I was fortunate enough to be in the right time and in the right place to experience it. For that I am grateful. Thank you very much for all of your tireless efforts into this field of collecting data and for providing a place to submit this report like this.",2014-11-21T00:00:00,43.6797,-85.5619

Multiple sightings between November 2013 and January 2015 (when this report was filed)  Multiple sightings of a confirmed hoax craft;  And a single sighting of one possible test craft from Area 51 or Nellis AFB   Location:  State Route 318 from Lund to Hiko and continuing south along US 93 to just south of Alamo.     Observer:  Individual who frequently (sometimes weekly) travels back and forth between northern and southern Nevada along US 93 and SR 318. Object #1:  Multiple nighttime sightings of what I have since learned is a cool, but not hugely secret (to locals, anyway) hoax ""UFO"" - a small aircraft with a custom (perhaps programmable) array of animated red lights that is flown at low altitude through the White River Valley between Lund (at the north end) and Hiko (at the south end) along State Route 318, and then continuing into the Pahranagat Valley down to Ash Springs and Alamo, just south of where 318 dead ends into 93. For uninformed nighttime travelers, this craft would easily be a startling sight, as the operators activate the lights intermittently along a meandering flight route.  I have seen the craft most often in the vicinity of White River Narrows, a short stretch of canyon through which 318 winds just north of Hiko.  During the most recent sighting (in December 2014, I believe), I was concerned that the craft was being flown in hazardous weather conditions - high winds and rain/snow, a risky venture for the operators if they were in it ... or for the craft if it's just a remote.  The craft appears to have no fixed or flashing running lights (FAA violation?), so until the red light array is activated, it is basically invisible.  The effect is rather striking, though, because the light pattern is different each time - reminds me of the animated light patterns on the side of some blimps, but appears to be on the underside/underwing of the craft. Didn't get details of why this craft is being flown (I've only seen it at night), but it could just be for fun or publicity to spice up interest in the mystique of the area with its adjacency to Area 51, which lies west of here off State Route 375 going toward Rachel.  There are a few Area 51-themed tourist attractions and businesses in this area, including E.T. Beef Jerky (right at the junction of 318 and 93), The Alien Research Center (just a short distance up 375 after it splits off from 318), which is more a gimmicky Sci-Fi memorabilia shop than any genuine ""research center.""  Also up 375 is the Little A-lé-inn (spelling?) in Rachel, which is a good ways north of the famous/infamous ""Black Mailbox"" and main turnoff to get to Area 51 (there are actually several ... but not necessarily passenger-car-friendly ... access roads and backways into the property that comprises Area 51 - travel along them is highly inadvisable).  Maybe the operators of this craf! t are just playing into the lingering appeal of this area to UFO seekers from afar.  Pretty clever, but risky.  This report is just an explanation of this particular object to any ""newbies"" who see it for the first time and wonder if it might be extraterrestrial.  This one is not. Object #2: Some type of craft (likely a high-performance jet) performing dizzying maneuvers above the Hiko/Ash Springs/Alamo area near where SR 318 and US 93 intersect. I witnessed this craft on a cold winter day in early 2014, when the sky was crystal clear ... other than the (perhaps unintended?) contrail that made it possible for me to track the movement of the craft, if not actually see it (it was either at very high altitude or very small and at low altitude). The contrail appeared intermittently, as though the craft was hitting pockets of very cold air along its path (much like one might see from a jetliner passing high overhead through variable air masses). Cannot say if this was a manned or remotely controlled craft, but it was making some very sharp, sudden turns and loops that were far beyond what I believe to be the envelope of most known fighter planes, including those I have observed at air shows or conducting military practice maneuvers.  Possible sources:  Area 51, which is not far from here, or Nellis AFB, which lies about 80 - 90 miles south of here.  Pretty sure it was not just the Thunderbirds, whose home base is Nellis.  They usually stick close to Vegas and in a group.  This was an individual craft.  Wondering if anyone else has seen this type of craft executing similar aerobatics in this area.

I slowed down while driving to get a better look at them, thinking that since it was the 4th of July they might be wish candles.  Neither of them appeared to be moving however and it was then I noticed two more further south.  All four of the lights seemed to be in a perfectly straight line extending about 30 miles or so to the southwest of town. I called my wife to let her know I was off work as I kept driving into town.  As I was about parallel to the furthest north light, I mentioned the lights to her and she said they were probably the wish candles.  About that time, I saw lights on the northern object start blinking like an aircraft. I hung up the phone and sped through town to get a better vantage point on a high butte.  By the time I got up there though, I was unable to see any of the lights.

After about 3 seconds of steady movement, the light turned in an arc and slowed down. I thought that was strange.  Then, over the course of about 15 more seconds total, it proceeded to halt, dart up/down/left/right with extreme precision and speed.  Finally, it halted for half a second before suddenly speeding away as suddenly as it had appeared.  It completely disappeared within 1 second.  It had sped so far away so quickly, that I lost sight of it within a perfectly clear night sky. At first, I was dumbfounded by what I had seen. I hadn't even had time to blink during the whole entire time I witnessed it. It was not a shooting star (which would have been white-yellow in color, and follow a more brief and linear path before disappearing).  However, I would describe the speed of its travel similar to how fast a shooting star would move – “blink, and you’ll miss it!”  The precision of the halts and turns is what really astounded me. No shooting star, comet, or plane could move with that sort of instantaneous, precise movement, or come to a dead halt that effectively. It was very eerie, yet very interesting.  I immediately texted my best friend to let her know because I was so excited!

UFO Sighting:  Tarrytown, July 4, 2014.    On the evening of July 4, 2014, I was watching the fireworks display over the Hudson River from a friend’s balcony in Tarrytown, just north of the Tappan Zee Bridge.  The river was to my left, and the town was to my right.  There were many fireworks displays up and down the river and many planes over the river, both large commercial jets at higher altitudes as well as many small private planes at lower altitudes.  There were 8 people in our group, including small kids, and as many as 100 people lining the streets near the building where I was watching from.  The Tarrytown Fire Department had many members present. At 10:51 pm, as there was a pause in the show in preparation for the “Grand Finale,” I happened to glance at the sky to my right, away from the river.  I saw a bright blue light streaking across the sky at low altitude, perhaps a few hundred feet up.  It seemed destined to streak into the river until it skidded to a halt and jumped back away from the river, taking a stationary position near the shoreline.  The movement of the object instantly struck me as bizarre, as it covered an incredible amount of distance in a few seconds and made a sharp 180 degree move.  It also seemed to disappear for a few instants, or “skip” as it moved into position.   I took out my cell phone and took one photo and a 1 minute 47 second video.  Even though the fireworks finale was going on behind me I couldn’t take my eyes off the object.  It was an extremely bright blue light, it appeared to be round or orb shaped, and perhaps 5 to 10 feet in diameter, though the exact size was hard to tell.  When the fi! reworks display ended the object instantly vanished. A few others in my party saw the object after it moved into its stationary position, but nobody saw it move into position but me.  It was unclear to all of us what it might be.  I do not know if anyone on the ground saw it although I am pretty sure I saw members of the Tarrytown Fire Department pointing at the object.",2014-11-14T00:00:00,41.0837,-73.8397

Then my sister arrived with her baby girl from our get together.  She took out her baby girl out of the car and came inside the house.  She was trying to put her baby to sleep. Afterwards, my sister went outside to get something from her car.  Then she said, she saw an orange circle down the street do south of my house.  My sister said it was really low and then it went up to the sky.  She got scared.  The orange circle past up my drive way and headed to the mountains. Then, my sister came inside the house and told me to come outside.  She can barely speak. She said it was urgent!   At first it was me and my sister that went outside.  When I saw that orange light of circle in the sky, I told my sister that its just a plane.  But as I started to focus more on the flying object, it did not look like anything I've ever seen before.  I was very shocked.   My dad came out of the house to see what was going on.  This was around twelve thirty something cause I didn't check the time. I told my dad  to go get my tablet. When I got the tablet, I started to take pictures.  Then video. As i was recording, my dad     yelled  out to me, theirs another one coming from the south! I aimed my tablet to capture them on video.  Then another one was coming from the same direction.  Then I starded taking video again cause to more were coming from the same direction. They all headed to where the other flying objects were.  I capture at least 4 flying objects coming from the south and headed towards the mountains.  I got 2 pictures, and 3 videos on my tablet. Then I told my sister to go get her camera so she can record the flying objects. We stayed outside for a couple of minutes to capture them on video. Then we went inside our house. Finally, when everyone was asleep, at 3:26 a.m., I went outside to see if they were still there. They were, and still in the same position that we saw them.

The sightings have become more and more frequent.  I am starting to see two on the same night.  I have entered only my latest above because the form only accommodates one sighting.   Here is my log:  I reported the first one I saw this year to MUFON (case #55584).  I saw it in the early morning hours of March 7.  I did not send the report until April because it took me that long to work through it in my head.  I had a similar sighting several years prior at my previous home ten miles to the east of my present location but did not know where to report it.  I have been keeping a log of the sightings since March (dates, time, shape and direction of travel) and just found your site.  Last night I saw two within 3 minute of each other and want to see if anyone else is reporting the same activity.  My husband saw one in August and is convinced that they are military drones. Here is my log.  Please note that each of sightings are silent, high altitude, and fast. By fast, I mean seconds to cross the sky.  March 7, 2014 12:45am – 1:15 am (Original report to MUFON case # 55584) I was facing south on a clear night with no moon, looking to the southeast when a very large, high altitude vessel blocked my view of the stars.  If I had not been looking where I was, I don’t think I would have seen it.  It was dark, no visible lights and almost seemed transparent or as if it was reflecting the starlight, almost invisible.  It was a large, triangular/boomerang shape that had rounded corners and the back was indented (not a typical straight lined triangle, but not a typical boomerang either).  It was completely silent and was moving faster than the high altitude planes I see all the time.  It passed just slightly to the east of me, moving south to north.

We are in a direct path for Detroit Metroit Airport.  At first, i thought it was a jet coming in.  But the rate of which the sound approached and dissipated was far too fast for a commercial jet.  Not to mention so loud, it would have been at a much lower altitude. Ive witnessed large meteorites witnessed over multiple states. I've also witnessed jets breaking the sound barrier.  This did not sound like that at all.  No impact, shockwave or sonic boom was heard.  The third witness, approximately 1.5 miles west, and outside during this event, heard it, but did not notice any lights either. Strangely, this past winter, we heard what sounded like pulse jets on occasion.  Usually at night, once during the day.  Think Nazi V1 buzz bombs.

I turned and looked at where he was pointing and at about 1500 ft. altitude over Glendale, about two miles to the south of where we were standing, we saw two teardrop shaped craft.  They looked like red flames with dark yellow center.  They were hovering for approximately two to three minutes then one of them started to move upward and south. The red light started to change intensity as it traveled, then it suddenly picked up speed, still heading south on an upward trajectory and within 30 seconds of acceleration, suddenly disappeared. The second craft had remained in its original position, and continued to hover and was bright red with yellow center. After the other craft disappeared, it started to head north towards us maintaining the same altitude. Movement caused its lights to vary in intensity just as it had the other. It continued north for about a minute, then rapidly reversed direction, increasing speed, then started an upward trajectory as the lights became more dim then suddenly, at an altitude where it would still have been easily visible, it disappeared; like someone turned a light switch off. There were no other aircraft in the vicinity during or within an hour before this event. There have been none since, and it is now 45 min. past the event. I have all manner of aircraft flying over, around, and nearby my location. I am well acquainted with the different sounds and know how far away they can be heard. I am also a former pilot.  At a distance where any known aircraft would have been easily and loudly recognizable, THESE OBJECTS WERE SOUNDLESS.  They were shaped distinctly like a teardrop, with the pointed end facing earth.  They looked like traveling ""red candle flames"", with a yellow center. This sighting is remarkable for, 1) soundless craft, 2) rapid in-line change of direction, 3) rapid acceleration from hovering, 4) complete disappearance in an instant, 5) shape of craft inconsistent with known aircraft, 6) colored light completely surrounding the craft, 7) variation in intensity of lights between hover and movement (light grew brighter when it hovered or slowed). This report was also phoned in. (near end of conversation, call became disrupted then suddenly dropped) ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sober-minded and eloquent.  We suspect she is an excellent, and reliable, witness.  PD))",2014-12-05T00:00:00,34.1593126984127,-118.25281964285715

It was 5:40 Toronto time, although I later wondered if it was 4:40.   I did record this immediately, although I have edited it for better clarification from my original.  We were about 35,000’, and above the clouds.  I was on the right side of the plane looking west, possibly towards Texas or just north?  I obviously thought that I saw a plane, or an object similar, as my first thought was one of alarm, why was a plane flying so close to us?  There is no doubt as to what I saw.  It was not a reflection from the window of our plane’s lights, markings etc.  I took a video out of the window at the end.   The sighting may have lasted around 20 seconds.  I took many still photos just after the sighting of both outside, and the window.  The UFO was relative to the clouds we were flying above, which is how I best guessed the distance of being approximately 10 miles away parallel, or just ahead of the nose of the plane.  But then it started to fly away, and I was relieved - it instantaneously soared away.  It was incredible!  It became a bright oval ball (light) that was actually larger than a plane, as if encompassing a plane, or a craft.  It became close to being a triangle a bit as it flew away, not too much though.  As if its speed stretched the light around it.  I felt better as it started to fly away.  It was flying sideways to us, and back a bit.  Anyway, it suddenly veered back towards our plane, and once again I became concered.  Then halfway back it stopped in midair!  Just like that.  It then went away from the plane again, zig-zagging twice sharply as it did so, and again just stopped in mid-air.   By the time I got my cell and iPad out of my bag, it was leaving from view, back and behind from my seat – from our wing.  I just jammed the iPad against the window and got this brief video.   As I was not looking through my jammed iPad perhaps what I videoed was a light reflection, though I don’t know how that would be possible as it was pressed firmly against the window.  Speculation?  I am obviously open too what I saw – military, unknown? Whatever it was I know what I saw. PS As soon as it happened I took photos from my cell of my iPad photos so I would have them in 2 locations &#61514;    PPS if given an email address I could forward/attach photos",2014-12-18T00:00:00,,

Then animals in the house became terrified.  I felt this weird feeling in my body, I wasn't afraid I was expecting them, but something was in her house.   We called the police thinking maybe were crazy and someone waist had broken in, the police found no evidence, all if the cabinets were open, all of her art supplies were open in the cabinets, the bar downstairs fridge open.  Then the sound stopped right when the police came.  Twenty minutes after they left we got in the car, drove around..

Looking out towards the East (Towards Ottawa), I noticed a bright orange light. At first I didn't think much of it, because a plane was also flying very close by this light as well.  As we continued our drive along the highway, I kept watching this object, and soon relized it wasn't moving. It stayed perfectly still in that same location. After a couple minutes had passed, it suddenly changed colour to an extremely bright white light, which seemed to grow even more intense as the seconds past.  Then, as if it had never even been there, it was gone.  Didn't move in any direction, just vanished.  It's hard to say exactly how far out towards the East it was, but my best guess would be over the country farm areas between Carleton Place & Ottawa.  So perhaps roughly 10 minutes or so outside of town. It should also be noted, that roughly this far outside of town, in the South-East direction, is a military base that ""no one is suppose to know about"", but everyone does.  Could it have been something from there?  Possibly.  Do I think that's what it was?  Absolutely not. Over the years, I have seen many bright objects such as this, over roughly the same area. But it has always been late at night, on my way home from Ottawa.  And they almost always, disappear as if they weren't there.",2014-12-18T00:00:00,45.13810384615385,-76.15424615384616

My daughter was also standing on the porch with me, and we had watched several planes in the few minutes we were outside.   I called her attention to the light being a single clear light with none of the normal aircraft lights.  The light then turned from its seeming northward trajectory and began moving quickly away to the east.  It only remained visible for another 3-4 seconds however before being gone.   There were other planes clearly visible in the same area including one that came from the exact easterly direction immediately after the light had gone, however that plane suddenly turned back and went back to the east again, a highly unusual thing for aircraft that we normally witness in the skies above NE Tn.

On December 7, 2014, I saw an object gliding across the sky, but it was as small as a star & I couldn't see anything on the video recorder at all.  Oh well. Since I saw this Sunday night, I decided to go out the following night Monday, Dec. 8, 2014.  I propped up the tripod, opened the lens cover, then unfolded the view screen on the video recorder & already had the settings at the extra zoom.  The second I finished this, I looked straight up & there was a bright, white round object headed in the direction of Mission Viejo. (it could have turned after it was out of my view though)  As soon as I realized it wasn't a plane or helicopter, I immediately started capturing the object.  It was tough keeping the recorder still. Probably because it was moving so quickly.  For a moment as it passed by a star, I stopped to view that star (duh) then corrected by returning to the UFO & before it was out of view I held my breath & zoomed in to the maximum level & captured some amazing detail.  I'm guessing this could be the very first video capture of these bright round objects, showing the propulsion it uses, I haven't seen one photo or video on all of the internet of this same detail.  Also, I have several daytime captures showing what I believe is a match to what this thing looked like up close.  If anyone else saw this please post up a video!  When I zoomed out a little, it looked a bit purple-ish & brilliant white when I zoomed a bit closer.  The interesting part isn't even the bright round object itself since there are a gazillion all over the internet on video, but rather what I captured in the zoom.  It was flying low enough to see it was NOT a plane or helicopter.  The close zoom also confirms it's not a plane or heli. either.  It's  pretty amazing.  Seems we're getting a wave of these objects all over California right now.  I just got really lucky where I had my finger right next to the record button the second I saw it.  I could kick myself for not starting the capture right away but I only lost a few seconds.  I'd sure have loved to get that super-zoom when it was right over my head.  Sure would have been nice if it was moving slower to pose for my video (lol)   It's possible when they are moving slowly, they aren't transparent or can decide when they are.

It was extremely clear and very cold (around 15 degrees).  The stars were very bright.  I was looking to the southeast, and just below a familiar, sideways V-shaped formation of stars I saw three stars of equal brightness forming a perfect equilateral triangle.  They caught my eye and within a second or two I realized they were moving.  I had to stare very hard at them to be sure they were in fact moving because they were moving so slowly.   As soon as I was certain of this, they began to fade away.  I would guess that between 5-10 seconds had elapsed when they began to fade out. It was like someone turned them off with a dimmer switch.  They just faded out perfectly synchronously and were gone in about two seconds.  I continued to stare at that area of the sky for about five minutes, but saw nothing else.  It all happened so fast, and my! eyes were still adjusting to looking at the dark of the sky, so I cannot say whether there was a form connecting the lights, though I did not see any stars within the triangular area encompassed by these three lights. They were the brightness of the average star until they faded.  Then there was nothing but the night sky.  I have no idea of any distance to whatever I saw. It could have been 100 feet from me, or miles away.  This is the first time I have ever been unable to easily verify something I have seen in the sky.  The lights weren’t blinking.

We both could tell it was low in the sky because we had ran outside to watch.

We watched the thing as it got farther away and it stopped and slowly faded, but did not disappear.  It then started to blink green and red light.   After the shock of first seeing this thing come over us, we saw 2 other odd objects in the sky.  It was a very large triangle formation they had all made and all 3 were doing the same blinking.  One was way to the northeast; the one we saw flying was souteast, and a third almost directly east, but higher in the sky to make the tip of the triangle....  Shortly after watching and then noticing the formation, a plane began approaching, and looked to be heading directly for it, but ended up below/south, but kept going past.

I listened to it for a couple minutes, then got up to go to the bathroom...giggled to myself, thinking I was just hearing my bladder rumble. No, that wasn't it... I could hear it in the bathroom... And all throughout the house !!  After leaving the loo, I went into every room, and looked out the windows, and UP. But the sky was very overcast, and I couldn't see anything. As much as I wanted to go outside and look, there was “something” that told me not to do so...this morning was not a cool time to do so...and I have to admit, the sound was a bit eerie. The most intense aspect of it was NOT just the noise itself...but HOW it seemed to be... The best way I can described it would be that it seemed to “encapsulate” our house...as if a bowl had been put over us, upside down. And yes, to me, this noise was LOUD...quite a bit louder than the HUM I regularly hear when I really listen. So I went back to bed, and lay still and listened. All the while this was happening, the cats were glued to me. Not freaking out and running around the house, but trying to stay as close to me as they could. And when I came back to bed, and lay on my right side, 3 of them lay on the top of my left side...3 more lay right next to me as close as they could get...and several more were on the dressers  After about 45 minutes more, it stopped...as if someone had flipped a switch. It didn't “fade away”...it was just suddenly GONE. The silence was very intense...made the hairs on my arms and neck stand on end... Several of the cats came slowly over to the bedroom window to look out...and yes, they looked UP. And for the life of me, I could NOT get back to sleep. My husband, ((name deleted)), woke up to go to the bathroom around 8AM, and I asked him if he had any weird dreams or such...he said NO, but felt that the house was creepily quiet. And no, I did NOT wake him up during the NOISE... I had wanted to, but couldn't figure out HOW to do so without planting the suggestion of “hearing something weird” in his head...THAT would have affected his experience. So now I must investigate this, to see if anyone has reported such an experience to MUFON and NUFORC. Everything I learn, I will write down, for my own records. ((NUFORC Note:  If anyone in the Orlando area was witness to the sound, we would like to invite them to submit a written report, to supplement the report above.

Electrical/Mechanical sound. Treetop to head high level then over the trees. ((name deleted)) to me 0 minutes ago  Details: January ???, 2015, approx. 1:30 am in the morning, while driving North on I-95, somewhere south of St. Augustine exit to U.S. 1. I remember slowing down quickly to a stop in the emergency lane. I cannot remember why I did this. I thought of getting my IPhone ready to take pics but I reasoned that time was of the essence and I would not be able to enter the Passcode, find camera app, open it, then shoot. I then remember getting out and moving to the other side of my car and looking up.  I saw what appeared to be a silent rectangular shaped object with a long blue light underneath, a very long tube shaped light; I am not sure how high it was but I believe it was tree top level; my side of the trees that lined the roadway. I am not sure but I think it had turned off  its lights as it passed me ( because I did not see it clearly while being only feet from me) being head high above the ground.  There was only ambient light available.  I heard the craft as it passed me (approx. 20-30 mph);  It made a combination of an electrical/mechanical sound (mechanical being the possible result of a pulse like a droning ping against the metal or craft material encasing the propulsion system) … not very loud.  No prop sounds or conventional  engine sounds when it had passed me; not sure how far, it went to become silent again but a good guess would be 20-30 feet. The next time I actually saw the craft (not in detail but possible shape; rectangular at best, it was tree top level with possible red, blue, and white lights on before it turned left with ease out of sight. I don’t remember getting back into my car or anything else that morning (as I usually go to bed around 3 am) except making a mental note of the St. Augustine exit and saying to myself that it wasn’t far behind me where I encountered the craft. My wife told me that I had told her every day of the encounter never altering my story once.  The thing is she tells me that I had been telling her for weeks when I realized so much time had passed while I was still thinking that it had just happened. My mind has not revealed anything else of the encounter; I believe that I suffered some sort of emotional shock or trauma from the experience.

My friend, his girlfriend and I stopped and began watching it as it sped up, before stopping again after moving from my 12 to 4.   That's when I noticed it wasn't 1 light but 3 long lights.  Then as it began moving again, I noticed a second one off in the distance.  These objects where probably at around 8000 ft if I was to guess.  It didn't make any soumd.   Whatever it was seemed large, and moved a lot like a similar object I seen around 2009.   I have seen something similar 3 times within 1 mile of each other.  All orange, but until I saw this one I never noticed the three bars of light and always thought they where 1 light.

At first I thought they might be military planes in close formation but as they got closer I realized there was absolutely no sound and they were traveling - more like gliding - much slower than conventional aircraft.  The weather was perfectly clear and the night seemed remarkably quiet. After about 1 minute, the formation passed directly over my driveway at an estimated altitude of 250 feet and each craft appeared to be the same size or a little larger than the wingspan of small private planes at that height. I observed 3 dark triangle-shaped objects with red nose lights and smaller green & white lights on the side points.  The shape of the objects was like a flattened triangle or boomerang as the distance between the green/white lights was very wide and approx. twice the span from the front to side.  The red lights seemed unusually large and remained constant; the green & white lights blinked alternately.   I could not make out any detail on the bottom of the craft. I ran into the house and grabbed my primitive camera phone, but could not capture anything but dark night sky.  I watched the formation move off to the northeast, then jumped in my car and followed it for another 4-5 minutes until it eventually went out of view over Myrtle Beach.   It seemed to be following along the Highway 17 Bypass, and maintained the same steady speed for the entire sighting, which lasted 7-8 minutes.",2015-01-30T00:00:00,33.5603,-79.0441

The winter before last, maybe January sometime, at around 11pm, my wife and I were in our hot tub on our deck at the back of our home here in the pacific northwest.  There was snow on the ground but it was a very dark night with a little mist in the air.  Our house is adjacent to some small hills, maybe several hundred vertical feet higher. Our tub is located on the south side of the house.  I noticed two lights, if you want to call them that, approximately 800 feet away to the west of us, travelling along the hillside at a pace which would be a sprint for a decent runner.  The elevation of these lights was maybe 100 feet up from the ground.  They were probably 30 feet apart, one front and one back, perfectly parallel to the terrain, and moving at a constant speed, slow, with no deviation.   The hillside there is virtually straight up and straight down, no trails and a person couldn’t walk along it at this level these lights were. About the lights…both were solid and the front one never could figure out whether it was blue or white, as you looked at it, it seemed to be in constant change, constant motion within itself, and it was blue and white at the same time.  The rear light was more of a green color and didn’t change.  These so-called lights never reflected or illuminated the sage brush and hillside they were travelling next to the way any regular light would have and I guess this object was no more than 30 feet from the hillside. It wasn’t on a wire, no variation in trajectory with absolute constant pace.  There was something in between these lights that we could not see, namely a vessel, had to be. It travelled up to the top of a little hill westbound and stopped and most likely rotated slightly counter-clockwise because the light were closer together.  I went upstairs and got out my binos and observed it for a few minutes. It projected out to the northwest an intermittent light that looked like a pattern of corregated roofing metal, red in color and brilliant and I could see it at various distances away from this craft due to the intermittent mist in the area.  This went on for only a minute or so then the lights went out and that was it. I know what we saw and it obviously wasn’t man made. I expect this was a little mapping expedition or something with a crazy reddish light report sent out.  There’s a few more minor details I’m sure I’ve left out but that’s the gist of it.

My stepson filmed these first lights with his mobile phone.  As they faded, I ran back to the apartment to get my camera.  When I came back there two of the lights remained, after about a couple of minutes another light appeared again with them, this time together they all formed a huge triangle in the sky.

Both me and my stepson then ran back indoors to grab our coats, and warm clothes, and I got my tripod.  We went back out.  We waited until about 10 pm when one light appeared, it hovered in place for quite a while, then a second light appeared, and after that a third, again forming the same triangle formation as before.  It was amazing to see, they stayed like that for about 10 mins, and we both captured it on film again.  The lights were more of an orange light.  Then as one of the lights faded out, I saw a very bright white light to the far right of the remaining two.  Also on film.  Then after a short while that started to moved away.  The lights then all gradually faded out and moved westwards. We sat outside until 10:30pm but no more appeared so we went back indoors as it was bitterly cold.  The distance of them is hard to say, but Dyes Inlet is between where we are and where these lights are appearing, so they could be above the body of water, or above the properties on the other side of the inlet.

Dear Mr. Davenport,   	I am writing to report several UFO sightings I have witnessed over the past 4 years.  I am 33 years old, and have never seen a UFO before until 2010.  I am a mother of two children (10 and 8 years old) and do not use drugs or alcohol.  I am a stay at home mom who homeschools.  Along with myself, my husband and two children have been co-witnesses to the sightings.  One of my neighbors was also present during one of the sightings. 	In October 2010, I moved to Goldendale, Washington.  We had just bought our 5 acre property and were living in a fifth wheel while developing the property for a home.  Our property is 15 miles outside of town and is in the woods.  We had a small campfire and it was about 8pm at night.  My husband and I were standing outside around the campfire and the children were there as well.  It was a clear and cold October night sky.  My husband and I looked up, and right above the 70ft pine trees about 100 yards away, appeared a bright yellow light about the size of a washing machine and round in shape.  It was noiseless and moving towards us fairly slowly.  As it got above the trees that were right around us, it shot up straight into the sky as fast as you could blink and disappeared.  There was no noise.  We both saw this and the encounter lasted about 10-15 seconds.  My children did not see this one. 	The second sighting was in the winter of 2012/2013.  I got up in the middle of the night and went into my living room and looked out my windows.  Across the road, was a ploughed wheat field about 80 acres in size with pine trees flanking the sides and back of the field.   I witnessed another yellow orb hovering above the trees in the back of the wheat field.  It hovered for several minutes, and then it shot up in the air and disappeared.  I did not know if there was noise, as I was inside.  The orb was the size of a basketball from where I was.   The next day my neighbor, who lives about 15 acres down the road from me, came over and asked if I had seen the orb the night before at the back of the wheat field.  I verified that I had, and his description was the same as mine. 	The third sighting was the same time, winter of 2012/2013 and I was driving home from town with my two children. It was about 9pm.  To the north of town, there is a small mountain range called the Simcoe Mountains.  The children and I saw a huge neon green fireball shoot across the top of the mountain range and disappear.  The light was very bright and noticeable and lasted about 3 seconds.  It started out bright green, then turned a brilliant orange.  I do not know if anyone else from town saw this, but there were at this time, several places around the world on the news reporting fireballs in the sky. In the summer of 2013, my children were playing outside in the middle of the afternoon. They came bursting inside the house and said they saw a UFO and wanted me to come and look.  I went outside, and to my amazement, there was a metal, cigar or blimp shaped craft hovering above the woods.  It was not directly above us, but aways off and hovering about as high as a low flying helicopter.  It looked about the size of a washing machine from where we were but cigar or blimp shaped.  The sighting lasted 10 minutes and it just dissolved away before our very eyes.  It made no noise, and it hovered in place the whole time.  The children and I saw this same craft about 3 more times this summer.  At the last sighting, my neighbor was over talking with me in my backyard. The children who saw it first, pointed it out to us in the sky.  We all stood and watched it for about 10 minutes and it too dissolved and disappeared. 	The recent sightings were June of 2014.  The weather was warm and the children and I decided to camp outside on our trampoline for the night in our backyard.  There were clear skies that night. The stars were brilliant as we lay on the trampoline. The children and I witnessed about 100, what appeared to be 'stars,' moving about the skies.  They moved sporadically and they would get brighter and then appear to burn out and disappear after moving around the skies for several seconds.  There was one after another.  They would appear and carry on in the same fashion.  We called them 'bobbles'.  This went on about an hour and a half, in which we then decided to sleep in the house instead.  This was the week before the war in Israel started with Hamas. 	October 2014, on the night of the blood moon, I decided to stay up all night to see the moon eclipse.  At 3:30am, at the height of the eclipse, I woke my family up to come outside and see it.  My daughter and I walked out our back door first onto our back deck with my son and husband following behind.  As soon as my daughter and I reached the edge of the deck, we turned back towards our house to look at the moon which was above the house. At the ridgeline of the roof, a bright, white light appeared and flew along the entire roofline of the home.  It was an orb, very bright, brilliant white, and kind of had an appearance of a 'sparkler.'  The kind I used to play with on the fourth of July as a kid.  It was not more than a foot above the roof, and was about the size of a cantalope.  It lasted 3 seconds and my daughter and I gasped in amazement having both seen it.  My husband and son had not looked up in time, having therefore missed it. 	We marveled at the moon and described the orb we saw for several minutes, and at that point, my husband went back inside.  As the children and I walked off the deck and into the yard, we saw another orb just like the one a few minutes prior. It appeared  20 ft above us, flew for 3 seconds and fizzled out.  It too looked like a sparkler and was the same size.  All three of us saw this one.  There was no noise with either one. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We live in the country and it's very wooded in this area with BLM land surrounding us.   I am always on the alert for wildlife while outside.  It was very quiet outside that night.  The sky was pretty dark, I could see stars, but mostly it was cloudy.   As I was scanning the property, I was looking in the sky as well.  I noticed a white light low in the sky behind my house it had an appearance like a white star, but it seemed odd to be so low in this area to me for some reason it seemed out of place.  We do have neighbors behind us two houses.  The one house directly behind us is roughly  250 feet away.  The other neighbor along side them is even further from us.    As I kept an eye on this white light for several seconds it just disappeared.  It wasn't because of cloud cover that I could see.  Seconds went by and another  white light showed up in the same area, but this time it appeared closer an! d even lower in the sky.  It was so low I saw it between the trees on the properties behind our home, but as if it was still in the sky.   Now I am certain this is not a star.  As I am watching this white light it disappears once again.  I thought that was it.   Then seconds later a white light appears again this time  on the road that runs along side my property that the neighbors behind me share.  This light is moving fast towards my direction.  I watch this light coming down the road it's going really fast and it seems higher than where I would think the car lights would be.  What I noticed next is the light appears to be crossing from the road into the trees and towards my direction then it disappears for the third time about 50 or 60 feet from where I am standing.  I waited to see if it was going to reappear again while thinking this may not be a good idea.   My dog was done doing her business, and she never appeared to notice anything that transpired.  I had a really ! bad migraine and I wanted to take a hot bath.  I did not notic! ed any s ounds coming from the light.  Not sure about the light shape appearing to be the same shape or not, it happened so fast.   The size of the light when it got the closest I would say about the size of a car headlight.   I heard no cars, I saw no cars on the road, I heard and saw no neighbors walking the road with flash lights.  Which I don't think they could match the speed it was coming down the road though a steep grade I don't think a human could even run that fast in my opinion.   Even if it was a car with no engine running, I would have heard the gravel sounds from under the tires. No usual smells.   SO it's a mystery.",2014-11-21T00:00:00,42.3476,-123.3334

We went there to spend time with my mother and sisters who came together to enjoy a much needed get-a-way and they invited us to come join in.   My younger sister and wife and I were walking along a popular strand of beach there at the end of the island on the 4th which was a Saturday.  It was getting late in the day so we decided to go in order to avoid the rising tide and the darkness.  Just as the sun set, we approached the public parking lot.  Then we all spotted a peculiar orange orb just appearing there in the night sky and it was very out of place to the natural order of things.  As we were watching this “UFO” for several minutes suddenly a barrage of “Chinese Lanterns” were being released over the ocean.   We were quite startled at first.  We realized this had nothing to do with the actual unknown orange orb situated in the skyline to the left of these “Chinese Lanterns” releases.  At the time, we did not know that the party patrons had launched off the “Chinese Lanterns” but my younger sister had proclaimed they were in fact just that as she was familiar with the way they appear when launched off.  My older sister who was bringing us our supper from a restaurant trip also came upon the “Chinese Lanterns” display as she was driving up to were we were staying and verified to us it was from the occupants of a beach house two lots down from the beach house we were at. Later that night I was really startled by a bright object that lit up the dark starry skies but both my sisters explained to me that it was just “The Space Station” as they see it all the time.  However they all agreed that the first orange orb was what has been a horrific ordeal for years at the Ocean Isle/Southport NC area. They began to tell me of their own multiple encounters of these orbs and other related stories, particularly a sinister revelation from a woman friend along the end of island who tells of huge cigar shaped UFO with smaller craft that appear there on a constant schedule all year round!  I was reluctant to report this but after speaking to someone who explained to me the importance of revealing this information, I now relay to you this report and hope it helps shed some light on something going on in this region.  I think that this place needs proper investigators to look into these activities. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I would estimated I first saw it falling at probably 20,000 feet.  It looked to be approximately the same height as a jetliner that was flying at about the same altitude but many miles away from the blue ball.

I was visiting in Austin, TX.  The night of the lunar eclipse I couldn’t sleep so I went out side for a walk.  I wanted to see the eclipse, and it was a perfectly clear sky.  I sat in a chair on front lawn and watched and took pictures. I could see the planes going into Austin airport, very specific flight patterns. I saw a large disc form come from above left of the moon.  It came down and then around to the right of the moon, seemed to stay to the right for a moment or two and then took off at an angle to the left and up. When it paused near the right side of the moon it looked to be about 20% the size of the moon itself.  This was as the moon was finishing the eclipse at 5:55 AM, I put my camera on long exposure, but I shook a bit for that. I have been given what this was through communication with them, immediately upon looking at my camera that night/morning. My background:  I AM in communication with various ET’s.  I have been most of my life, but never made this public before.  My parents, husband, daughter and extremely close friends know of this and have been present various times when this has happened. I have seen several ships in my lifetime.  Some recent dramatic sightings:  3 years ago at Enchanted Rock, TX, when we made it to the top and were resting,  I lay down on the summit and they (several) appeared for me.  It was late afternoon.  My husband was there and saw them as well.  There were no others around on the summit. 3 yrs ago in Galveston, I was sitting at poolside I was speaking on my cell to my friend back east, 2 AM, and a golden-brownish color ship flew over.  It was very low, just above the buildings.  I projected my thought to it … “wait” and it stopped, hovered, so I could get a good look at it, and then it flew on out over the ocean.  The friend I was speaking to also has communicated with ET’s. 2 years ago and last year I was interacting with some Beings from the inner Earth.  There were 12, and they followed me when we went into the caves outside Austin.  I have pictures of that communication underground.  They came back above ground when I was outside one night at my daughter’s house, very interesting. I attended and assisted for the entire week, the Paradigm Research Group at the Citizens Hearing on Disclosure, April/May 2013 at the National Press Club in DC.  I fully believe in the fact there are benevolent ET’s close around Earth and in our immediate Solar System.",2014-11-14T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

I am a retired (30 yr) Met Police Officer (UK).  My wife and 2 friends were walking along the river in Lisbon, on the north side, (approx opposite the huge Statue to Christ).  An elderly man who was clearly fishing was pointing at the sky excitedly. saying ""the Portuguese airforce just went that way, they are bombing Syria"".   We all laughed at him.  I noted that a few other strangers had stopped because he was so exciteable, and I said to them (they were Dutch or German), ""He has had a bit too much aguadente"".  Then 5 minutes later, after we had moved on about 50 yards, I saw something I wish I had never seen.  I would rather not have seen it.  About 1000 to 2000 feet up, and maybe 3 to 5 thousand feet away, were about 40 ""craft"" (my friend thinks 60) .. diamond shaped with white lights around the edges.  They were ""flying"" no noise, from my right to left. I saw purple and green in the! middle of one or two of them.  The others say they cannot recall that.  Our two friends are responsible adults who live in the USA (details supplied if requested).  Some of the craft hovered in one position. Others jerked down and upwards. I joked to my friend, ""are we being invaded"". But truthfully,we cannot think of an explanation.  We thought maybe they were some kind of ""projection"" by a prangster, but there was too much up and down movenent of some of these, while others remained on course, and the area covered was too big for a projection.  I know you are going to think I have been drinking! (any lie detector would show that this is a true account).  Like I said, I wish I had never seen it.  And we watched them all fly over the river and disappear into clouds.  I swear I saw the rear of the craft.. there was a double dimension to this.  How big were they?  Because of the distance, I would say, maybe as large as an estate car.  If you have any questions for me, please contact me.  I will tell you more, and who we are, if you wish.  We did have phones/cameras with us.. but each one of us was awe struck, and didn't talk to each other about taking a photograph, so we didn't photograph this, which I now regret.  And because of that fact, we may not be believed.  I have googled ""UFOs over Lisbon"", and this appears not to have been reported.  There was a young couple standing just a couple of feet behind us, and they did not photograph it either.. they seemed equally bemused.  I am open to any logical suggestion as to what this was ... ""please"".  My friend's wife said, ""It must have been drones"".. but there was ""no noise"", they were all illuminated. And besides, doesn't one ""drone"" cost millions... so 60 of them... in close proximity... I do not think so. I saw an aircraft approaching Lisbon airport travelling from left to right...  These things did not move like any aircraft I ever saw.... It is all bizarre !!!! The night was clear and crisp. I looked at my w! atch.. it was 2230 hrs. I have just realized that your centre is in the USA... (does that matter??).. Our two friends, are US citizens, and later, perhaps you could speak to them... e mail me if you wish .. and perhaps I can respond with my contact details.  I cannot see any UFO society in Portugal, although there possibly is.. and if there is, we are happy to speak with them. I did email one of my ex colleagues a day or so later .... to tell him about it. (he probably thinks I am mad!!)",2014-10-10T00:00:00,,

At about 7:45pm CDT, leaving my niece’s home after a family Thanksgiving dinner in Gurnee, Illinois, as I reached my car parked on the street, I noticed two very bright yellow-orange lights in the sky.  Not sure of their altitude, probably something between that of a low-flying plane but higher than a helicopter would fly, if that makes sense.  The lights were in a horizontal configuration, one a good distance (maybe an inch at arm’s length) higher than the other, with the lower object slightly ahead of the other as they moved slowly from east to west.  They weren’t big, maybe like BBs, but very bright. I was standing northwest of them, and they could have been a couple miles or so south of my position.  Though two very distinct lights, they moved in tandem and seemed in fixed positions in relation to each other, as though connected.  I didn’t see anything connecting them, nor any stars between them, but the night sky was overcast and not many stars were visible.  No sound, but at that distance, unless they were jets or helicopters, I probably wouldn’t have heard any engine noise. Must admit, I’m fascinated by UFOs, but have never seen one before.  However, I know enough to look for the green and red lights required for aircraft, and there was no other color in these objects except for the very bright yellow-orange color, like polished gold.  As they moved west, each of the orbs seemed to have some shadow on its rear side, so they looked almost like tightly curled commas.  Traveling a little farther west, the top light looked like it had a separate, smaller light following immediately behind it, possibly part of it.  The color was so bright and so consistent otherwise that they looked like shiny metal structures.  But whatever light they had must have come from them because there is nothing in the area to illuminate them at that height, and the crescent moon was behind them. My first thought was, “Darn, I don’t have my camera with me.”  Then my niece came out of the house to bring me something I’d left behind, and we both stood there for a couple minutes watching these lights and trying to figure out what they possibly could be.  She is not at all interested in UFOs, and probably thought I was little nuts being so fixated on these objects. The closest familiar object they resembled would be Chinese lanterns, but the bright color was stable, not flickering. Flares?  They moved together at a level altitude straight west and I assume flares might drop or lose altitude.  They didn’t have a “fuzzy” glow, even in the overcast, but were bright, hard lights. I watched these for approximately five minutes, and they moved slowly but at a perfectly steady rate across the sky, covering a distance of about eight inches at arm’s length.  Then they disappeared without changing shape or size, without falling to the ground or anything. They just went out. My location would be about 30 miles north of O’Hare Airport, and the lights I saw would have been coming from Lake Michigan, possibly 10-15 miles east of O’Hare.  And again, they didn’t have the FFA lights, nor anything resembling the configuration of lights that I’ve ever seen on commercial aircraft.  There’s a smaller airport, Waukegan Regional Airport, about 10 miles north of Gurnee, but the lights were heading west, not north.  I drove by Waukegan Airport a few minutes later, and don’t think it was even open. Have no idea what they were.  Just very curious.",2014-12-05T00:00:00,42.3738,-87.944

We were talking outside when we noticed an orange orb fly above us.  We stared at it because it looked like nothing we have ever seen before.  It flew from the north to the south until it disappeared into the night horizon.  We were puzzled because it definitely was not a helicopter, or a plane.   Immediately after it disappeared, and during our discussion of what it could be, another orange orb originated from the same place.  We watched the first one come from and it took the same exact flight route immediately above us.   For this orb I quickly reached for my cell phone and began snapping away pictures (I will follow up with an email including all pictures I took).   Again, as soon as the 2nd orb disappeared, the 3rd orange orb began its trip.  It also took the same route as the first two orbs and disappeared into the night's horizon.  I also took a few pictures of the 3rd orb.  My parents and I s! tayed for a few minutes outside searching the sky for more, but did not see any more. Curiously enough, the pictures do not all reflect what we saw with the naked eye.  Also note that some of the pictures I tried using the zoom feature.  And lastly, the orbs made absolutely no noise as they passed directly above us. The other two witnesses were my retired parents.  I happened to have my cat on a leash with us, but he did not see it nor did he act unusual. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Addendum to Miami 11/27/14 10:35 pm Event-- NO LONGER A UFO. ADDENDUM to UFO Sighting on Thanksgiving Night In MIami 11/27/14.  I am the person who filed this report originally. I am letting you know that we have discovered what the UFO's were, so they are no longer UFO's.  I wonder if similar reports like mine could possibly be the same as what our UFO's turned out to be.

It followed the tree line, floating majestically over it, banked and then descended into a field on the other side of the tree line.

There is an area to the left of the road outside of Mount Rainier Park in the Mowich Lake area, where they are logging.  This area is about three to four miles from the park boundary.  The area is bare of trees, so visiblity was unobstructed. I looked to my left, and saw a set of dark black clouds out in the middle of nowhere. One was cigar shape, level with the terrain and the other was disc shaped directly above the other touching on the right side(from my point of view).  The left side of the disc shape was approximately 20 degrees above the other, at an angle, and was much larger.  Inside this strange set of black clouds is a clear outline of what looked like a disc, which was completely black. The average person may say this is just unusual cloud formations, but the problem I have with this is that through the opening on the upper left side, the clouds were rolling into the interior while the rest of the formation remained stationary.  In fact, anything else that got close to the opening, got fed into the upper outer edge of the disc shaped cloud.  It reminded me of the result of intake motion. I can just make a good guess of the size of the disc to be 2,000 feet wide and 40 to 50 feet high at the highest point.  It is smaller in height towards the outer edge.  There was a definite outline visible.  It could have been even large than that, it was big.  It was hard to tell how much of it was cloud cover.  From my point of view, it was high in the sky, at an angle of about 120 degrees from me, almost directly above the logged area. I snapped a photo with my cell phone, which unfortunatly had a poor camera and it almost completely takes up the whole frame.  I watched for about 4-5 minutes and watched the clouds continue to roll into the edge as I described, and remember thinking how weird this was. I drove home, not thinking too much about it because I was really hungry.   Time passed by, and I watched a tv show where they mentioned that UFOS hide in dark clouds, and so I found the old phone to look at the picture I had taken that day.  I can still see outline of the disk and the shape in the interior, but it is hard to see the rolling of the clouds on the outer edge.  I put a name on this as the cloud eater, because that is what it looks like; a big mouth eating any cloud that gets close to it. Now that I am afraid of what this might be, I have a phobia of returning to that area.  I have had several nightmares because of this, which have now subsided.   If this was an encounter, I would like to know what it was that I saw that day.",2014-09-05T00:00:00,,

I was wondering that morning if it would rain and kept looking at the sky to see if I spotted rain clouds but the sky was clear and I managed to see an aircraft in the distance coming from an east direction.   All of a sudden right above to my right and almost in front of the road at a height which I calculated visually to be between 15,000 feet or maybe less a combination of lights traveling in unison appeared.   The lights appeared to be part of a structured or craft that had some sort of magnetic field that appeared to make half of it invisible to the eye or was blending with the sky and the rear part of it was visible and the lights were white bright, green, blue, celeste and other effects that I would say are not made by no known human technology.   I would have to admit this was a shocking as well as a life changing event as I have been secretly a skeptic with this type of phenomenon.  The lights from this craft were absolutely beautiful and something I have never seen in my life.   It took me a moment to register what I had witnessed and I had dangerously lost focused of the road I was driving on and calculate I slowed my vehicle from 65 mph to about 30 to 35 mph in a 70 mph road.  Afraid I would cause a traffic accident, I gradually brought the vehicle to an appropriate speed and looked to my right to see if the object or craft would reappear again, but it was gone, and I decided to continue my journey home from work.   I work the overnight shift at a correctional institution as a correctional officer and I was glad as I thought about this incident that it did not happen during Halloween night or the hours of 12 midnight and 5 am with no sun about to appear it would have been a terrifying experience.

I quickly raised my eyes over my binoculars and could see the light was all around the tree I'm in too and its 80 yards from my deer feeder. My immediate reaction was getting mad thinking someone must be driving up spot lighting ruining my hunt, but there was no noise plus the way the shadows were falling I realized the light was coming from above me.  That’s when I quickly look up and saw the 3 bright white lights moving West to East, and thought Wow! 3 shooting stars! EXCEPT that can't be either; they’re way too close and not moving fast. I watched the lights drifting, cruising, in a triangular formation over the woods for a few seconds and then they started banking a turn to the South East moving away from me.  For a few seconds I could see a dim amber glowing ring of light surrounding the 3 bright white lights and then it just disappeared; like someone turned off all the lights at once. After it disappeared, I kept looking into the dark star lit sky hoping to see its silhouette as it moved on, but saw nothing... Just stars and none of them were moving.  I never saw a profile of an aircraft, but when it turned the configuration of lights appeared to be aligned on the bottom of something round maneuvering like an aircraft banking a turn less than 100 yards from me. This all happened within a span of about 10 to 15 seconds, and I could hear my dog start barking in the distance at this same time, but no other sounds. I don't know what it was, but it happened & I saw it from my tree stand at a time & setting when I was wide awake with my senses tuned-in to every sound & movement in the woods.

((NUFORC Note:  Atlas V missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at 19:19 hrs. (PST)  PD)) At 19:21 - according to my phone's call log - I received a call from my best friend, (who lives just over ten miles away in Norco, CA.), telling me that she was startled and amazed to be looking at 'something really weird' in the night skies over her home. As I headed out my own door (to see if I could spot anything), I realized that it was unlikely I'd be able to even see the sky at all - due to massive rains all day and low, thick, stormy clouds not to mention our distance from one another. However, as I stepped out from between the houses and into the open, I found it to be largely clearing above and to the west. As I scanned the dark, patchy skies, I immediately spotted several aircraft tracking and blinking as on any normal, Friday evening. As she continued trying to relate to me in excited bewilderment what she was seeing, I was just beginning to scan the night sky above my own house when she suddenly cursed that it had vanished; it had abruptly just 'winked out'. As she started-in bitterly about its sudden absence, off to my west (toward Norco) - something odd suddenly DID catch my eye and I had to stop her. It was something odd and it was tracking southward. Whatever it was, it was clearly and definitely NOT an airplane. I was confused by its appearance. I initially considered a meteor, but no ...then a comet... but also no. It appeared to be a small, solid, red light, shaped rather oblong lengthwise - like a thick grain of rice - with a comparatively huge, translucent 'bloom' behind it; kind of like the ones that envelop the rear halves of fighter jets as they pierce the sound barrier. But that's not what this was. It was utterly soundless and appeared to be moving more at the pace of a Cessna or helicopter, rather than any sort of jet. Gobsmacked, I focused and strained and squinted to get as good of a look as possible as I mumbled into my cellphone what I was seeing as she excitedly confirmed that it was exactly what she had just been observing. I was able to clearly see it for a good six seconds, as it moseyed slowly along, due south - directly (and maddeningly) toward one of the many low, pink, angry clouds around the area. It then moved behind the cloud from whence I never saw it emerge. I checked the 'color-change' box because although to me the object shone in an unblinking, unchanging 'stoplight red', my friend swears that it appeared as a bright white, to her. But what we both DID clearly see was the huge 'plume' at the trailing end. It was in fact this odd feature that first drew the eye. It looked like the top of an open, translucent 'umbrella' curved back and emanating directly from the rear of the object. Again, there were typical, nighttime aviation activities ongoing in the skies above me - flickering jetliners and local flights headed this way and that at their various flight levels. I spotted about five or six flashing lights immediately and easily identifiable as normal, evening air traffic - but they all seemed oblivious to the object, which - in fairness - was more or less in a patch of sky sort of off to itself - and fairly equidistant from any other traffic. Sadly, I've been unable to find any local (nor anywhere) mention of this phenomenon on the internet. SURELY she and I COULDN'T have been the only ones in Southern California to have seen this amazing object.",2014-12-18T00:00:00,33.93964338565022,-117.4001158071749

The distance between the two lights was about four times the distance of the length of a helicopter.  As I watched, a third red light came on next to the second red light making a shape of a triangle. The first thing I noticed was how huge the object was. I had never seen anything even close to this size; it was enormous.  I also noticed there was no sound at all.  The object was extremely low so it was odd that it was completely silent.  As soon as I realized this was no ordinary object, I called for my son who also came running outside and witnessed this as well.  I had the binoculars at the time so I watched the object through the binoculars for the remainder of the sighting. I could see that the three lights were large red spheres on the bottom of the craft and there were much smaller rectangular white lights along the side of the craft that flashed on in a sequence.  As I watched through the binoculars all three red lights stayed on at once for a short time and then one of them turned off but I could still see the sphere, it was dark grey or black.  All of a sudden all of the spheres turned white at the same time for a couple seconds and then two of the lights turned off while only one white light remained.  I could still see the spheres with the binoculars, but when I looked at the object without the binoculars I could only see the white light.

I then noticed a craft of sorts that was at about the 11 o'clock position from where my car was (that is to say it was on my upper left). I was in disbelief what I saw! A car behind me was driving very close to me, annoyed that I was going slow, not realizing what was in the sky. The lights on this aircraft were not too bright, about the same brightness as the lamps on the Connector. There were four lights all together- one on top and three on the bottom. The one on top was a little bigger than the other three. I was seeing this in the dark, but I could make out a pitch black background of the aircraft- it was a triangular shape.

The formation made almost no sound.  on the left-hand side (as i looked up) i counted around 13 lights.  flying right next to that craft to my right hand side was what appeared to be a regular run of the mill airplane.  I watched them fly directly over head and i was very shocked that i had not heard anyone else talk about it. It must have been around 2100 hours because it was dark... the craft were flying rather low, i couldn't even really estimate a 'normal' height for a commercial airplane.  I got the impression that the craft was being escorted and that maybe it was air force 1.  As stated above i often see military craft fly that same route back and forth daily, but I know of no airbase in the direction they fly that is in America.

I often go out to do sky watches at a BLM Bocco Mtn. recreation site Lat.39*46'29.35N Long. 106*42'21.14W. Over the years I have received numerous reports from locals who have had good UFO sightings in the area, which is dominated by Castle Peak to the west. There are power lines that run north and south over the parking area, and there is no lights visible at this location. Tonight the sky was mostly clear and I parked with my pick-up truck facing due east. At about 22:50 hours I observed a bright light rise over the ridgeline to the east over the Muddy Creek area.  The ridgeline is 9-10 miles away and reaches over 8900 feet. At first I thought it could be landing lights of a plane on approach to the Eagle County airport which is about 15 miles west, as I had gotten use to seeing aircraft coming through this area at night before. Actually the airport was closes for flight operations after dark. Still thinking it was an aircraft I was surprised to see a second light rise up over the ridgeline. I thought this was unusual to see two aircraft on approach and watched as the two lights ascended when suddenly the first light switched off. I got out of the truck with my binoculars and I-phone, of which I took four photos. I scanned the sky where the first light disappeared with 7x50 binoculars but could not see any standard aircraft flashing lights. I viewed the second light with the binoculars and also saw no flashing lights. Shortly thereafter the second light switched off. Again no flashing lights were seen. I probably had these in view for 3-4 minutes. About 10-12 minutes later a third light appeared to my left and viewed through the drivers side window, which was up. This light was larger and closer than the first two, and I watched it for a few seconds while reaching for my I-phone and binoculars, and was preparing to get out of the vehicle when this light switched off. I got out and as before there was nothing there. This area of the sky was totally clear there was a bright moon that night which illuminated any clouds. Around 23:20 a fourth light appeared over the ridgeline to the east again, ascended for about a minute, and like the first three, switched off. I stayed out there till midnight but saw nothing else this night. Eagle County and the area around Castle Peak has had numerous report of UFOs, orbs, and cattle mutilations over the years, and I have talked to dozens of locals who have had sightings up here, many of them in the Castle Peak area. Incidentally, when I mentioned this sighting to a co-worker he told me that he saw a pulsating red light moving across the sky while en-route to work the morning of the 15th. He was on I-70 coming down Vail Pass around MM 181-182 at 0530. He saw no flashing aircraft lights, just the pulsating red light.",2014-09-25T00:00:00,,

I was on vacation with my brother, (55), my sister-in-law, (51), my niece and nephew and 2 of their friends.  My niece, nephew and their 2 friends are in there mid-twenties. On the date above we were all sitting on the beach having a bonfire and roasting marshmallows. We were facing east, towards the Atlantic Ocean. Suddenly, at approximately 11pm, my sister-in-law saw an orange glowing ball in the sky to the north above the land were the fishing pier meets the land.  She yelled out: “Look at that!”, “What is it?”  We all turned in the direction she was pointing and watched the orange, glowing ball move silently towards us and then out over the ocean, on a southeast trajectory.  It grew brighter (larger), as it moved towards us.   After about 1 minute another glowing ball, (exactly the same in appearance), appeared from the same location, (above where the pier touches the land) and began following the first ball’s trajectory, exactly.  Meanwhile the first ball moved out to a location over the sea and simply grew fainter until it disappeared totally.  The second ball did the same thing and then a third, fourth, etc., until we had seen a total of 7 orange fireballs move along the exact same trajectory and disappear over the ocean in the exact same location.  Each ball was visible for about 45–60 seconds.  These ball were exactly equidistance apart, as they arrived and disappeared. All seven of us witnesses were in awe.  We tried to capture the glowing balls on cell phone cameras and video, but they just look like specks on a black night sky as it was so dark there are no reference points in the images. Some of the witnesses had had a few beers with dinner, but were not intoxicated.  My sister-in-law and I were 100% sober as we don’t drink alcohol. I should mention later that night, I believe around 2am, (technically Sept. 4), my nephew and his 2 friends report seeing blue neon-type streaks of light flashing before them on the beach, at lighting speed and then going into the ocean, towards the same location the fireballs had headed.  They said when they ran towards the ocean to get a closer look the blue neon lights, now under the water, they slowly disappeared.  I personally did not witness these blue neon colored lights. I should also mention that earlier on the same day, Sept 3, 2014, at 9:30 in the morning we heard an incredible “sonic boom” type sound that was so loud and caused such a vibration everyone on the beach jumped up and was looking around in panic.

The dates and times are mere supposition, as the memory is still very vague. I was attending NIU and driving back to school from my Mt Prospect home, at some point around 10:00 pm.  After passing the Curtiss Candy factory, off the 294 Hwy (heading South and looking off into the West), I noticed some strange lights that resembled the Aurora Borealis.  I recall stopping and discussing the lights with another woman who had also pulled over to the side of the highway (there were others, but I don't recall interacting with any one else). The next memory I have that evening is being in the car miles away on the 5 Highway (now the 88) and driving back towards school, with approximately 2 1/2 hours unaccounted for. However, the strangest aspect of this memory is that I didn't recall this incident AT ALL until over 20 years after it happened-and this is how the memory was sparked.  As a struggling writer in Hollywood, I use to make pitch meetings all the time, and from time to time I would see my ideas being produced.  I would laugh it off saying, ""Aliens are sucking my brain,"" and on one occasion, I said that same phrase that I had used literally dozens of times—and the memory (though cloudy and with the missing 2 1/2 hr gap) came streaming back and actually scared me. I know this is an extreme longshot, but Ive been hoping that someone might recall seeing those lights and help me at least put a day and time on the event itself.",2014-09-25T00:00:00,,

On our way home on I-65 around the exit that leads to the old Saturn plant, we saw two lights in the sky.  I have an Aerospace degree and make a living in technology and design which puts me in some interesting experiences.  I am naturally visual spatial and am usually very aware of my surroundings and notice a lot of details.   We drove for about 4 miles from the time that I first noticed the lights before finally stopping on the side of the interstate to watch them almost directly overhead.  At first the two lights were in close proximity to each other and seemed to rotate slowly at about a 20 degree angle from horizontal as we were initially driving along.  I say that it looked that way but of course from our vantage point in a moving vehicle it can look like rotation but not actually be that. the most interesting thing was what we saw when we came to a stop and rolled the windows down.  The two lights were at about 1000 feet altitude from our position.  We had an overcast sky with a ceiling of about 1200 to 1500 feet I guess without checking.   These two objects seemed from my vantage point to be about as large as a car each in size judging from the size of the light they were emitting. initially from the first view we had of them, they seemed to alternate between brighter and darker in the intensity of their light which initially led me to believe that they were two airplanes that were in a holding pattern waiting for their turn at final approach into Nashville airport.  I knew that air traffic control would not have placed two planes this close together so I figured that they must be much farther apart yet my vantage point just makes them look closer.  I also thought they were much farther away than they actually were.   As we pulled over and stopped the car, I could see that they were not airplanes, helicopters, drones, balloons, light from a ground source, etc.  We had about 30 seconds of clear visual from the time we stopped and tried to video to the time that the first object on the left phased out like turning off a light with a dimmer.   About 10 seconds later the second one on the right phased out the same way.  Now they did not fly into the clouds, they were below them.  The light they emitted was an orange glow like a torch.  I am familiar with most everything that flies and many FAA regs.  I also am able to use logic and reason to determine what I might be seeing.   All I know is that with my experience both educationally, professionally, and Spiritually, I was not able to determine what I saw but I am convinced that it was not something man made.  I have never seen anything like it before and am very aware of what it takes to make something fly and these two things did not match that knowledge.  They did not emit any sound that we were able to single out from the mild interstate traffic.  We would have heard a helicopter or possibly even a drone in my estimation.  Even if it had been something like! a drone then from the size it was, we would still have seen the object against the cloud ceiling via the ambient light emitted from the nearby urban infrastructure when the light it emitted phased out.   Again the light was a orange glow times two, fixed hovering in the sky about 1000 feet above the ground  with a constant fixed distance between the two.  The left one phased out first, then 5 to 10 seconds later, the second one phased out the same way leaving no trace or sound.   Again, I reiterate, I would know if they were airplanes, helicopters, drones, balloons, flairs, ground emitted light, etc and they were none of those.",2015-01-07T00:00:00,36.13170004240882,-86.7768134860051

The third time was on 1-19-15 around 19:00 hours. I let my dogs out and lit up a smoke and looked towards the east off my deck towards the lake and there it was at first it was just hovering sitting still then it dropped and moved forward and returned to its original position, it did this a couple times and I went back in the house for my phone and a camera and my spotting scope, got in the ruck and headed a block to the edge  of the hill where I could get a better view, by this time it had moved north east quite  ways and had gained altitude, I took some more photos and some with my spotting scope it quickly moved off to the north end of the lake and out of sight.

This is what I saw:  On Saturday, September 27, 2014, at around 8:50pm, I saw two circular red lights moving slowly in the sky of Martinsburg, West Virginia.  The lights were far enough apart, and were moving slowly enough to lead me to believe they belonged to an aircraft preparing to land.  There is a military air base around here, so I was accustomed to seeing slow-moving aircraft move in in this fashion.  However, I did think it a bit odd that a) I did not actually see the plane, which I should have seen at the distance (the objects were not very high, and practically over my head); and b) I did not hear the drone of the engine.  As I watched the lights slowly approach I expected to hear the drone of the engines at a! ny minute.  Instead suddenly the lights dimmed, one at a time, and then disappeared; and in their place I saw what looked like two stars twinkle brightly, and then it was over.

We were approximately 100-150 yards away from the bridge where the Waterfire festival ends, near the pavilion next to the river that marks the place where the Gaspee was burned by RI colonists in the early 1770s.  I looked up and noticed a large commercial airliner flying overhead, perhaps approaching TF Green airport in Warwick which was flying fairly low, but that quickly disappeared over the bay and we continued on our walk.  As we were walking north towards the bridge, a group of three younger guys were walking towards us and one said “What is that?  UFOs?”  The other guys laughed, but we turned our heads and saw 3 bright orange lights in the sky in a triangular pattern…approx 100-150m high (but could be higher…hard to tell).  They made no noise and as we watched another guy (older who was walking his dog) came along behind us and saw we were looking at something and looked up and said something like “What the heck is that?”  We said we had no idea.  Slowly, the color faded from bright orange, almost flamelike to white and the first two dots continued down the river towards the harbor/Narraganset Bay while one stayed suspended for a minute or to (I took a quick video with my iPhone of that one) and then it slowly faded away.  I wanted to blame the appearance on Waterfire, thinking that perhaps they were large embers suspended in the sky but there was no major breeze that would blow these downriver 100-150 yards and they all turned white at the same time.  Finally the one light in the sky faded out and we turned and walked away. This was the 3rd UFO I’ve seen in my life BTW….but was very strange as it was seen in such a cosmopolitan area, by so many people (the young college aged guys, the dog walker and us), but we were literally only 300-450 feet away from hundreds, perhaps thousands of people.",2014-10-03T00:00:00,41.826189756944444,-71.42050572916666

After spending the day hours in downtown Palm Springs we returned to our rental in La Quinta, Ca.  We changed and headed for the pool.  We rode our bikes from our home to a pool located near the main gate of the community.  We swam in the pool and then moved to the hot tub. While in the hot tub, we relaxed and stargazed, as we often do while we are there.  I began looking west towards the Santa Rosa Mountains admiring the numerous stars in the night sky.  We talked about how dark it was compared with home for same time of evening, it was around 1815 to 1840 hours.  We chatted about how many stars were visible and how pleasant it was out. A movement in the sky next to a 2 palm trees which line the interior SW corner of the pool landscaping caught my eye.  I thought at first it must be the shadow of a large bird flapping its wings.  It took a second for me to realize it was not bird in flight.  The object was not just behind the palm tree but in the sky beyond it.  It occupied the airspace between my location and the mountain.  As it moved across the sky from behind the palm tree I saw it was large. Its size made it difficult to judge its actual dimensions (I would guess as large as a commercial airliner) or its altitude in the sky.  Frankly, its appearance confused me so could only base my observations by comparing it to the mountain and palm trees. From my vantage point it was as large as the top of the palm tree fronds (not its actual size but the object was in the distance and still looked about the size palm tree top)  This palm tree is about 40 feet tall and the object was about the same size in the sky.  Its altitude seemed to be no more than the height of the mountain that runs adjacent to the community on the far west side. When I first noticed the object it seemed blurry. (I use the term blurry only because I can not properly describe what was happened to the surface on the triangle for the first moments until it became clear/focused).  It moved into a clearing passed the palm trees at an angle just in front and above me.  There were no obstructions between myself and the object.  It was literally right in front of me. The night sky was my backdrop as it moved across the sky.  It was a large equilateral triangle. Its height was far less in comparison to its length of its sides.  (I could not see the top and saw nothing protruding above it)  The outside of it was darker than the night sky but it blended into the sky above it.  The object itself was black and seemed shiny when it was at its most focused point (meaning the shape was blurry and then came into focus).  I could make out the outer edges of the triangle and also the whole body as it blocked the stars in the sky it passed in front of.  I could not make out any surface details. Each corner of the triangle housed a round light. The lights were not small beacon lights but quite large. The round lights were not extremely bright and seemed a muted yellow even dim. The lights did not pulsate or flash like airplane beacons either.  It also appeared clearer to me the more directly in front of me it was.  It continued across the sky until it was NE of me.  It passed behind more palm trees at which point I lost it in the sky and could no longer locate it.  The object made no noise and seemed completely silent. The aircraft moved from the SW towards the NE across the sky.  It moved slowly but never stopped, slower than a C130 at an airshow slow.  The entire aircraft slowly rotated on its axis. I believe it rotated counter clockwise.  It did not change direction or altitude.  Its movement across the sky seemed effortless.  It seemed to float in the air like a raft would float on the water but light like cottonwood seed fuzz.  A smooth movement like a ball bearing rolling across a glass top table.  Its movement was very different than any plane, helicopter or balloon I have ever seen. Smooth, slow, light and effortless. During the time I was watching the object, I attempted to point it out to my wife and young son.  Neither were able to see it and they told me I was quite excited while pointing toward it and not making much sense to them.  I described to them what I saw; ""a large triangle with three round lights in the corners slowly rotating as it moved across the sky.""  Important things about this siting.  This was a calm night with little to no breeze.  This particular community proximity to mountain makes flying a plane, helicopter too dangerous/not possible especially at night without lights.  The community has only ground lighting. The community is far away from city lights.  The community is flanked by the Santa Rosa Mountains to the west blocking all light pollution from the west.  The community is also far away from urban areas and is quite quiet, especially in the evenings.  The object was much lower than any plane I have witnessed above the property.  Most planes I have seen are flying at cruising altitudes far above the mountains.  The helicopters I have seen are military and also fly well above the mountains.  I believe we had a full moon on the 8th but the moon starts low at the horizon line until it moves upwards into the sky later in the evening.

One of the ""orbs"" shot across the entire sky until no longer visible, followed by the remaining anomalies at an alarming rate of speed.  They were there, and then they were just gone.  No sound, no reflection , no nothing, just gone.   Ok, so no big deal right?  Unless I were to take you back to my childhood, in which I saw the exact same type of anomaly, but not yet old enough to understand the difference.  I would not have even thought to much about it, had it not been for a Youtube.com video I recently viewed, depicting the exact same experience I have mentioned here.",2014-11-21T00:00:00,,

My wife and I live between Allentown and Emmaus, Pa., in a residential area. Last evening, Nov.14, 2014, at 5:45 PM, while departing our house to dine with another couple, we spotted approx. 10 white lights in an up-side down ""V"" formation which were moving slowly towards us (Northern direction) in the Southern sky. After several minutes they stopped movement.  The formation consisted of three lights on the left leg, one light on the point and six lights on the right leg.  All were  bright white/red.  My wife remembers them as being red.  I believe they were white with red in the central area.  They did become almost all red.  They appeared as very slightly flickering but that might've been due to the  atmospheric conditions. I'd guess the brightness was that of a car's headlight from two miles away.  Altitude was unknown and we estimated their location above as between Emmaus and Hellertown, Pa., and several miles from us. they were brighter than any star or planet. Shortly after stopping the three lights on the left leg started an upward movement and faded becoming mostly red in color.  They might have went into a cloud but I could not see (the cloud). I thought they might be helicopters however we didn't detect any sound.  After the three faded away we heard and saw a one engine light aircraft  to our right coming out of the East and heading in a Westerly direction on an intersecting pattern with the lights.  I'd estimate the aircraft's altitude was approx. 2,000 ft.  There is a small airport less than two miles from our house.  At the same time three very bright white lights appeared below and farther out (South).  They appeared to be moving to meet the lights that were stationary.  They could've been the three lights that were in the left leg that climbed and faded away and were returning.  The skies were clear with few spotty clouds that were illuminated by ground lights. Meanwhile each light took turns becoming brighter as a landing light would appear.  No distinct pattern was seen.  The two leading lights in the right leg came closer together almost touching and their color  became more red than white. The aircraft appeared to be very close to the unidentified lights and crossed in front of them.  By then the engine sound of the light aircraft faded away. The four lights remained stationary so we entered our car and drove in a Southernly direction to meet our friends who were about three miles from our house.  A Norfolk Southern freight train passed us 150 ft. to our left (Lehigh Line to Reading and Harrisburg).  The track elevation rises as the line enters Emmaus,Pa. After stopping for a series of signal lights, I saw four lights appear just above but farther out than the train.  This would be in my 10 o'clock position.  While noticing they were yellow, three additional lights appeared to their right (my left).  These were a bright and deeper amber color.  All the lights were considerably larger than our first sighting but could've been the same lights.   I'm a military veteran and they resembled flares but no smoke emitting from them and they were stationary. Our road dropped in elevation and between that and the moving freight train we could no longer see the lights.  The time was about 6: 10 PM. I am retired and have excellent eye sight with glasses used for reading and have been a lifetime aviation enthusiast.  The lights were not any type of aircraft or flares. Today I stopped at our small airport and they indicated they have not heard about the sighting and they close around 6 PM. Lehigh Valley Airport (ABE) is about 8 to 10 miles from our house and I'm sure they would've warned that light aircraft about the light objects if in fact they appeared on their radar.  We were very surprised the aircraft headed directly towards the lights and came very close. Well over 100,000 people live in this very spread out area, which includes Allentown, Emmaus, Bethlehem and other small towns. Pa. Rt. 309 joins with Interstate 78 and both are very heavily traveled plus it was Friday night at rush hour.   The lights had to be seen by many people.",2014-11-21T00:00:00,40.60203012295082,-75.50084323770493

I did not have a chance to pull over and study it very closely because I was waiting to turn left at a red light.  From inside my car it appeared to be about 1 to 2 feet in length and it was vertical. I was about to turn left (west) on the I-10 freeway when I noticed the object in the North sky sitting low and motionless above oncoming traffic.  It was definitely not a balloon.  It was low enough to tell there were no strings attached and the object looked really solid.  That is, it wasn’t bobbing or weaving like a balloon. At first I thought it might have been a drone but there were no propellers or wings.  There were no lights on it that I could see.  I couldn’t tell if it was making any kind of sound because I was in the car.  There were no streetlights or power lines near it so it couldn’t have been attached to anything.  However, there was a street light about 20 yards in front of it and it appeared to be hovering at about the same height, maybe a little higher.   No one else seemed to notice it.  That is, no one pulled over to take a closer look.  Was this a drone? Has anyone seen something similar or am I going crazy? I’ll check again tomorrow on my way home from work to see if it’s still there. Although I doubt it, I drive the same route every day and this was the first time I’ve ever seen something like this.  P.S. My mom has had multiple UFO encounters over the years. I’m in my 30’s and this is the first experience I have ever had. I’m usually the smug skeptic that rolls her eyes at these sorts of stories. Maybe I should change my tune. &#61514;",2014-11-21T00:00:00,33.29885793871866,-111.86506392757661

I turned back to look at my friend and he slammed the door, and I ran home as fast as I could.   The next day we went behind the church but saw nothing, no impressions in the ground.   I told my parents, but they would have none of it. ((",,,

Heavily cloudy day with low hanging clouds, and they were moving in the direction as all witnessed aircraft.  The size of the craft was well seen, it was bright out, and was no more than one and a half ""medium to large"" oak trees tall.  Thus, the craft was off the ground no more than five stories. The aircraft itself was silent, and had a few lights.  While I forget the colors (I want to say blue and red) and their exact placement.  The aircraft was absolutely silent and had a black exterior which was probably its material and not paint.  The aircraft had no markings of any country.  The only company that has the ability to use the airspace within this area is Northrop.  They do not mark test aircraft. At its front end this craft had large, red hued dome protruding from its bottom, similar to a UAV camera dome.  This may have housed a IR camera that was testing therm-imaging designed for use through cloud cover (see DARPA current special projects' webpage).   There may have been antenna housed therein, as other aircraft designs has such domes as containing communication/monitoring antenna.  It did not appear to have any heat trails, but the fast moving clouds around it that day made it hard to observe and distinguish (if any).  There were around four to eight rectangles in the back of the craft, and was probably of a rotatory motor design.  While there was certainly enough room for a person to potentially be inside, from my vantage point it did not seem like there was even standing room in the mid-area of the plane.  I did not get to view the top of the craft, nor did it had have anything like tail-end rudders. The craft was shockingly low to the ground and had zero to nearly zero sound.  If it was not for a cloud break, myself looking up, it would have remained unnoticed.  The craft's wingspan was around the size of four to five standard street lanes.  It was moving rather quickly compared to ground cars that preceded it, maybe around 40-60 miles per hour?  There were no cars on the ground, and it was traversing the streets above homes, rather than flying along main streets.  The direction was headed toward Baltimore Washington Airport.

Last year when I did this I did not see what I saw this time.

The spot had a tail that appears to be about 1.5 miles long at first glance.

May have gone further, but Google Earth plotted area for just a short period. Further investigation of the bright object was difficult as Google Earth pixilates as I zoom in, however, I was able to estimate the size of the bright object.  It was the about 160 feet wide by 180 feet long with a path signature about 150 feet wide.

It happened while I was on duty and preparing to do my last patrol of the shift before ending. At approximately 0025hrs(12:25am), I observed a blue and red light flying over the Ko'olau Mountains near Tantalus/roundtop drive.  My first thought was that it was a plane coming over the mountain, but I quickly ruled that out when it changed course, moving slightly to my left.  It was much to sudden to be a plane, so the next thing I thought was a helicopter, which was quickly ruled out soon after when I observed the lights make a sudden change and begun to fly in a zig zagging kind of path in the sky, and not to mention that there was no sound of helicopter blades chopping through the air at all. Upon that sudden course of action it conducted I was most certainly interested now.  I continued to monitor the lights and even repositioned myself on the property to try to get a better view and continue to observe it's strange and erratic movements.  It then proceeded to appear to descend towards the ground where I could no longer observe as my vision was obstructed by trees and structures.  It's movements were like someone pointing a laser pointer and moving it all over the place except much more controlled and not as fast, but faster and able to do things that a plane or helicopter could do. Shortly there after it's descent out of my view, my Supervisor shows up at my site to check up on me as usual during my shift, and almost soon after he arrived the thing shot back into the air and proceeded to fly erratically as before, I quickly pointed it out and even he was baffled by it and we both continued to watch it until it descended again to the ground where we couldn't see.  My Supervisor is a former U.S. Marine and he said he had never seen any aircraft do things like that, not even a remote controlled device. I know what I was thinking when we watched it, but I waited to hear him say it first. ""I think we just observed an Unidentified Flying Object"".  We ruled out cars that might have been on the road on the mountain as we both saw the object fly high enough that we could see there was space between the outline of the mountain and the lights, so it was definitely in the air. We saw it shoot straight up suddenly and we thought it was gonna zip away, but it hovered for about 5 seconds before shooting back down towards the ground where we couldn't see it.  And that was the last we saw it. Immediately after my shift at 0100hrs I got in my car and drove up to the Military Cemetary at Punch bowl to try to get a better view. Once up there I saw a group of 4 young people hanging out overlooking the area where my workplace is and so I asked them if they saw it, if they saw the lights. One of them, a girl, admitted to seeing a red light shoot up from the corner of her eye not long before I arrived.

The pulse is almost exactly one per second, rhythmically, like a dimmer being turned all the way up and then all the way off.  The pulsating light was quite a bit larger than a blinking red wing light on a jet, at least three times as large.  As best I can judge the distance, it appeared to be within five to ten miles of my house. The object was moving — slowly and without variance in speed — pretty nearly due west, at maybe a third or a fourth the speed of a low-flying light aircraft. The experience lasted twenty minutes.  The object gradually moved out of sight to the west, never changing course or speed, never altering the rate of pulsation for its light, never changing size or growing dimmer except insofar as distance altered its visibility.

Then pharmacy to pick up meds, call dad, he is too sick to talk, and eventually drive back home. I am one block from my house though and see this disc in the sky. It is a white disc, oval shaped.  At first I just thought, ""what a weird shaped cloud"", but then I realized it was moving.  I passed my house and continued down the street to catch a better glimpse of this thing.

It stood out to me because I had never noticed the lights before.  As I continued driving I saw it was hovering over the OTC.   When I stopped driving it quickly shot out to the North.  It had no sound and I could not see any shape to it.  I watched it move off into the distance as far as I could see, it until it disappeared.",2014-12-05T00:00:00,38.861478298238076,-104.78039776536313

On Saturday, November 29, 2014, at approximately 11AM (est), while driving NW on Lee Chapel Rd in Burke, VA, I saw what looked like a Learjet flying ahead of me appearing from the right at a very fast speed heading to my left.  With tall trees on both sides of the street along my pathway, I had a clear view for about 3 to 5 seconds. What made this unusual were a couple of things:  1)	  The object was flying very low and going down in what I would describe as about 10,000 feet when first coming into view from the right and at about 7,500 feet when going out of view to my left. 2)	  The nose of the object was at about a 170 degree angle up and the tail equally down as it went by, descending. 3)  	I immediately rolled down my window and did not hear a thing.  I drove slowly half expecting to hear an explosion but heard nothing. As I continued on the road I looked at other drivers to see if anyone else was acting like they saw what I saw.  I started to wonder if perhaps it may have been a radio controlled kit, but the field of vision would have made the object out of visible range from any natural place to fly one (residential area, crossing fairly busy road). I turned on my radio to the local all news station expecting another 9-11 or plane crash ‘happening now’ breaking story but heard nothing. I Googled when I got home to see if anyone else posted about it but found nothing. After thinking about it some more an hour or so later, I decided it was way to obvious that I saw something out of the ordinary and decided to check online for where to report it.  This lead me to the National UFO Reporting website. I am also sending an illustration I am putting together to clearly visualize what I saw.",2014-12-05T00:00:00,38.7851,-77.2866

I was about 3 or 4 miles west of the sth 12/14 interchange in Middleton, WI, when I noticed a red flashing orb at about the 5 o’clock position.  The orb caught my eye because my first thought was when did they put up a new TV tower and gosh it must be tall.   After a few seconds I realized it was moving rather quickly, and obviously not stationary.  Due to the color it was emitting, I noted it couldn’t be an airplane, as the size of the object would be way to large to be an aircraft’s strobe lights and there was no green or white light either.  I would guess it was also traveling 2 or 3 times faster than your standard jet based on how quickly it was moving away from me.   Then when it was starting to near the end of my visible horizon it took a hard left heading northerly with a slight downward trajectory while also to remarkably double its original speed and quickly went out of view.   I would like to stress this light was definitely not a reflection from within the cab of my vehicle nor a light somehow reflecting off my windshield.   I would estimate this light was originally flying several thousand feet off the ground, maybe 2 or 3 in my best estimation before making its turn and descent.   The light it emitted was rather unusual, as it appeared to have a slightly foggy characteristic about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.
