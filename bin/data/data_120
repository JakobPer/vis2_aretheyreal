I looked at the sky and saw the last remnants of light on the horizon and there were already a few stars popping out.   So at that point, as I was noticing the few stars making their appearance, something very odd happened.  One of the tiny dots of light (?stars) starting rotating in a circular(or elliptical) pattern, then directly across from it(to the left to be exact and the distance was probably something like if I held my arms spread open to the sky, one would have been at my right fingertip and the other at my left fingertip).   Things get stranger still, the next thing to happen was an airplane flew between the ""stars"", then another plane flew through them directly after it.   In my retelling I like to say the planes seemed to ""escort"" the alternative craft.   At that point the, saucer-shaped craft flew or hoovered into view.  It was metallic in color, I read someone else that mentioned liquid mercury and that seems a perfect description.  It was moving seemingly very slow.  But then it was over our heads suddenly and it stopped.  I remember it seemed so very near us.  There were more lights(there had originally only been one in the center) that started to shine from the bottom of the craft around it's perimeter, they encompassed it's circumference.  They were bright and I can't remember clearly if they were colored or blinked or if the bottom of the craft moved, but the lights did not remain in a constant position.  Maybe it was spinning?  After that, all I can remember is that two more planes flew by.  I don't think the ""stars"" were even spinning anymore and it was completely dark.

Around sunset, I was taking a walk with my dog on the northwest edge of Fort Collins, behind Lincoln Middle School, on the far north edge of the athletic fields.  Just beyond here, the terrain drops down abruptly to the north into the Cache la Poudre River valley, thus providing an unobstructed view to the north and northeast.  I was preoccupied with some beautiful orange sunlit clouds over the mountains to the west, taking a couple pictures of these clouds on my iphone at 17:46 and 17:47, and thinking about sending one of these pictures and a text to a friend.  I could have first noticed the strange lights before I took the first picture, between the two pictures, or perhaps just after the second picture. The ""UFO"" I'm reporting didn't look as if it was ""flying"" at all, but rather appeared as an array of about 50-60 ""unidentified"" bright white circular lights to my north-northeast.  The array consisted of 5 vertical strings of about 10-12 lights evenly spaced on each string.  The 5 strings of vertically arranged lights were evenly spaced horizontally and apparently extended to the ground, giving the appearance of 50-60 spotlights mounted on 5 towers.  The lights looked uniform in their size, white color, and brightness. I think all lights were on when I first noticed them.  Then over a period of perhaps 1-2 minutes, the lights on a given tower would all turn off and quickly back on, in a repeated pattern where the rightmost tower of lights would flash off-on, followed sequentially by next tower's lights flashing off-on, continuing to the left-most tower, and with that sequence repeating several times (like some kind of stadium lighting light show).  With this right-to-left off-on sequencing continuing, the ""off"" period of each tower's lights began to progressively get a little longer before coming back on, with 2 then 3 towers being off simultaneously, until finally all lights remained off.  It had the appearance of a 2-3 minute ""shutdown"" sequence from all lights being on.  It was too dark to see any kind of towers that the lights may have been mounted on. I noted that it was 17:50 shortly after the lights remained off.  I think official sunset was 17:40, several minutes after the sun had set over the mountains. The reason I didn't immediately pay attention to these lights is I was preoccupied with my cloud pictures and subconsciously assumed the lights were on the NIST WWVB phased array towers north of Fort Collins (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWVB).  These towers were 5-6 miles north-northeast of my location, in the same general direction as I saw the lights.  However, as I began noticing the strange sequencing of off-on light patterns, I realized that these didn't look like the NIST towers, which as I remembered and confirmed as they appeared more clearly as it got darker after the unidentified lights remained off, don't look evenly spaced from afar and which have only 1 or 2 red lights on each tower.  After the unidentified lights remained off, the impression I had of the 5 ""towers of lights"" is that they were closer and extended to a higher angular height than the NIST towers, were a little to the right of where the NIST towers were, were evenly spaced as opposed to! the unevenly spaced (when viewed from my vantage) NIST towers, and the unidentified white lights were bigger and much brighter than the red NIST lights.  I've lived in Fort Collins for 37 years and have never noticed the NIST towers with bright white lights.",2018-02-22T00:00:00,40.55069822812846,-105.07729501661129

It crossed between the two stars in Ursa Major that point towards Polaris and Polaris itself, somewhat closer to Polaris.  Object appeared to be at significantly greater altitude than commercial airliners, though possibly attainable by military aircraft.  It reminded me somewhat of early satellites which did not follow the earth's rotation in terms of brightness, but speed was greater.  The object was too distant to determine size or shape.  The sky was cloudless and dark. What caught my attention was that it appeared to consistently move at what I surmised to be several times the speed of sound, yet several times instantly “jump ahead” some distance.  Distance “jumped” was hard to estimate due to altitude, but I would say in the tens of miles each time.  Twice, the object “jumped” laterally as well, though I would estimate a shorter distance.

First seen at altitude about 15 degrees above horizon.  Object attracted attention due to unusual flashing lights from red to white along the whole body of the object which didn’t look like any airplane observed previously in the night sky.  It was hard to tell whether the change of lights color was flashing type or turning in circle from side to side.   The most interesting thing was that the sky was 100% clear without any clouds, so after observing for about two minutes, the object simply disappeared in the clear sky, and then reappeared again with the same characteristics. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Peter, good day! Thank you for your prompt reply! Unfortunately, there were no any pictures taken.  The object appeared to be quite far.  After it attracted my attention, I continued to observe it by using the binocular.  Otherwise I couldn’t see at least those details that I have seen. I mean, when on the ship during the long ocean passages, it’s quite interesting to look at the night sky, stars etc.  I’m quite sure I can make a difference between airplane, and what I’ve seen last night.  What’s the most interesting is that it disappeared completely for some time, even though I’m sure the sky was clear of any clouds.   There was one more witness though, the guy who was keeping watch with me, he’s Filipino. And he agreed with me that he saw the same thing.   But there’s one more thing.  Approximately in  an hour after I submitted this report, I’ve seen exact same object heading in the same direction, but it appeared to be quite further away, again I was observing it with binocular.  They both were heading towards NE direction.  From our position this could lead them somewhere to Thai or Chinese coast.  ((END ADDENDUM))",2018-04-05T00:00:00,,

The saucer looked to be moving extremely slowly towards the North or Northwest approximately 2,000 Ft above the Albuquerque valley and approximately 4 miles West from my location.  At first, I put it off as an odd colored military aircraft taking off the same direction I was going, but the sky around the saucer became a lighter blue color in a perfect geometrical shape of a parallelogram.

We also have lots of air traffic from the major airports, but they are a good bit away and like many, I know what a jet liner looks like vs. other things.  I’m also very familiar with iridium flares and what they look like.  This did not resemble those.  It should also be noted, this was definitely star level (if that makes sense) and the color of the flash and light was a very bright white light.. Stargazing is my thing, so it’s no surprise that I was looking up while I had to take my puppy out to do her business.  It was around midnight and extremely cold.  I had my flashlight with me so I could see if she went, or not.  As I flashed it towards her, I caught a flash out of the “top of my eye” so to speak.  It immediately made me look up because the source of the light was from above.   At first, I thought maybe my flashlight was reflecting off of my glasses, but as I was looking up at the Big Dipper, I immediately saw a bright flashing light in the lower handle area of the constellation.  It was stationary, not moving and was just flashing, but like a slow fade flash.  Then, a few seconds later to the left, another light appeared..it almost appeared as if they were talking to one another in sequence.  All the while, I’m standing there in disbelief, freezing and thinking, “I’ve gotta go get someone to see this or they’ll never believe me!”  Not to mention the puppy is freezing too!   So, I keep my eyes on these lights, and the second light begins to move towards the east, slowly fading in and out, meanwhile the first original light flashes bright again.  Then, a third light appears slightly above the other two forming a triangular pattern.  Now I’m really in shock and amazement because these are definitely NOT satellites the way they are moving and definitely NOT any normal aircraft that I’ve ever seen.  I quickly yell for my anyone in my household to get outside ASAP and the first one to appear is my 14 year old daughter.  She then witnesses the movements of the lights with me.   All three lights are now flashing with one moving slowly eastward.  The first initial light that appeared flashed extremely bright, moved directly to the left and then directly east, in a zigzag pattern.  My daughter’s exact words were, “Whoa!  That one was bright!”  I told her to run in and grab my husband and my phone so I could try to video them and as soon as he opened the door they all went out!  Go figure!!

He was often gone for up to two months at a time, and I felt quite at ease being alone.  It was late fall, but the temperature outside was nice enough for me to be able to go outside in my shorts.  The ""Tonight Show"" with Johnny Carson was just going off the air and I was sitting down to watch the ""Tomorrow Show"" with Tom Snyder.  I remember this night because it was the premiere episode.  October 15th, 1973.   I could hear a beeping noise coming from outside and thought that it might have been one of the electrical transformers, so I went outside to see if I could find it.  There was not a hint of a breeze in the night air and it was fairly cool out.  There seemed to be no noise except the beeping.  I stood in the yard for a couple of minutes just listening, and then I heard a police siren coming my direction from the main road.  I went to the north side of the house to try to see what was happening but was blocked by all the pine trees.   Then I heard a helicopter coming from a distance and that was when I noticed strange lights fairly low to the ground to my east.  There should have been no lights in that direction because there was nothing that way except ten to fifteen miles of forest.   I walked down the street about 4 houses to see the main road behind the house and watched as something zoomed by.  It was just above the tree line, about 40 feet in the air, and was traveling so fast I couldn’t tell anything specific about it other than it was very well lit.  The 2 police cars zoomed by headed south following whatever was flying in front of them.  Then came the helicopter.  They stopped about a mile down the road, turned off their lights and returned in the direction of Ft. Bragg.  I turned around to see the lights in the forest and they were still in the same spot.  That was when they lifted to just above tree height and then blinked out.  I had no re! ason to be frightened but ran back in to the house anyway.  That was when I noticed that the television station had gone off the air.  The ""Tomorrow Show"" should have still been on because I had only been outside for maybe five minutes.  I checked the clock and it was now nearly two in the morning.  The show came on at 12:30 and went off at 1:30.  What had happened to that hour and a half?",2018-05-31T00:00:00,35.03683522123894,-78.92246247787611

To his amazement he saw four cylinders in a row, each was higher in the air next to one another.  They also had lights that went left to right in the center of the craft.  The lights flashed up in the air, but when one went down behind the trees it would turn its lights off and land the craft.  His father told him that they were back at the stripper pit where their was water.  All four were higher in succession from left to right.  Later, when the ship on the right came up out of the trees, it would turn its lights back on.  Then the next ship on the left center went down and turn its light out.  This went on for about an hour. They observed this in the telescope and got a good look at the craft.  There was still some light in the horizon so they could make out the shapes of the craft, which were cigar shape or saucer shape.  Later, the craft that was high in the air just rose up and headed west at the same time until it was out of sight.  Later all four left in like manner.

What do you do with a guy from another planet?,Somerville,NJ,1970-11-15T22:00:00,disk,2 hours,"Occurred : 11/15/1970 22:00  (Entered as : 11/15/1970 22:00) Reported: 4/14/2018 9:17:27 PM 21:17 Posted: 4/19/2018 Location: Somerville, NJ Shape: Disk Duration:2 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/139/S139449.html,"What do you do with a guy from another planet? This my UFO story.  I’ve told it through the years usually starting with:  had I had a camera I could have made a movie. It started with my best friend ((male name deleted)) and I returning to his house, after having worked at his stepfather’s gas station.  I was 15, and it was November of 1970, I believe.   Upon exiting the car with ((male name deleted) and his family (step-father, mother, sister and brother) we were all startled by a flash of light.  Like a photo being taken.  We each thought it had come from a different direction. Not thinking too much of it, ((male name deleted)) and I decided to go to a nearby middle school to swing on the flagpole rope just for something to do.  After a few turns we both stopped to rest at the base of the flagpole which was directly in the front of the school that was facing a busy two way road.  Sitting back to back parallel to the school front, we both saw an arching blue light over the tops of the trees showing above the school from behind it.  We both immediately said the same thing, “What was that”. So we decided to investigate, making our way around the right side of the school via a blacktop road that went to the back playground area.  As we started around the rear corner we were met with a loud, radio-like sound that grew very loud.  We backed up to the front of the school until it faded away.  We then again made our way around to the back, positioning ourselves against the brick wall at the rear. The back of the schoolyard was situated with an expanse of green grass that extended about 150 yards to the edge of the woods.  The blacktop we were on went about 20 yards to the lawns edge, with a basketball hoop and a streetlight at the edge.  This was occurring at night so the streetlight made seeing the treeline a little difficult.  But as we watched we could see a figure moving from the path in the woods to the left.  When we yelled to ask who it was, it stopped, didn’t say anything and then continued on.  We then saw the figure move back to the right and go back into the path.  Then at one point we saw two figures moving in opposite directions along the treeline.  Both stopping when we yelled, and then moving again. At this point we were wondering who was going through the woods when we saw a UFO come from our right, above the woods, stopping to the left side of the wooded area at the back of the field.  It stopped and hovered above the wood and then moved silently towards our left rear.  Then we saw another follow the same route.  When I looked to my 2:00, which was in the direction of downtown Somerville, I could see a distinct “ceiling” of clouds that were reflecting the light from the downtown business area.  It lit the bottom of the clouds creating a clear line of site below them.  I could then see one and then two of the UFOs moving between these clouds and the below skyline.  They moved slowly and silently towards us and the woods.  They would each stop briefly and then again circle back and to our left.  While watching this sequence, counting four or five UFOs (unless we double counted them) one of the UFOs, after stopping above the wooded area and at which point it should have moved ou! t to our left/rear, moved slowly and directly toward ((male name deleted)) and me.  All the while ((male name deleted)) and I were confirming that we were both witnessing the same things as they occurred.  The UFO made its way toward us, not making a sound, until it stopped just above us.  It was approximately 40 to 50 feet above us and to our front.  It stopped there.  We could make out the webbing on the portals or windows and with confirming with ((male name deleted)), we both realized it was observing us.  It stayed there for what seemed like a full minute or so and then slowly moved up and again to our rear left shoulder, continuing on its pattern. At this point, having been frightened out of our wits, it occurred to me that we should get other witnesses.  We saw the house to the West (our right) just beyond the gate at that side of the blacktop.  We went to the door and knocked, prepared to request that the residents come out and see what was going on.  No one answered.  At that we decided to go to ((male name deleted)) house, about six blocks from there and get a camera.  We decided to take the chance that they would be gone when we got back. When we arrived at ((male name deleted)) house, we searched for a camera and couldn’t find one that ((male name deleted)) said they had.  Instead all we could find was a pair of binoculars that happened to be there.  It was cold (November) and I needed to borrow a jacket so ((male name deleted)) lent me his father’s biker leather jacket. We made our way back and put ourselves again with our backs against the brick wall of the school and waited to see what was still happening.  We were there for a few minutes and didn’t see anything.  So we decided to move forward toward the grass field and get closer to the treeline 150 yards or so from the edge of the blacktop.  As we moved forward, ((male name deleted)) let out a shout, “Did you see that?!”  I nearly jumped out of my skin.   I ask him about what he’d seen and he said, “That guy was running and he stopped as soon as I shouted.”  Apparently whatever it was had been running inside the thin woods to the East and our left, and had come into view as we cleared the L-shaped part of the school building. At first when I looked I didn’t see any movement. As we moved toward the object it appeared to me, and I said to ((male name deleted)), to be light from a window shining though the wooded area. It was a light Orange/White color with thin saplings and tall grass in front of it.  ((male name deleted)) insisted that it had been running right up to the second he shouted.  So we moved up to about 15 feet from it and I could make out a figure. It appeared to be a tall, thin man with a large head, a black stripe where the nose was and a black slit for a mouth.  He appeared to be crouched as if to leap in any direction.  I tried to discern if what I was seeing was my imagination and still just light from a window. We then remember the binoculars we had.  So looking up directly at him with the binoculars, it was as if someone had punched me in the eyes.  I looked directly into his face! He wasn’t looking directly at me.  I looked him over and saw that he had a square black something on his chest.  He appeared to be wearing s! omething with a collar similar to our astronaut’s suits.  After a half a minute I decided to try and get his attention.  I yelled out. “Hey” loudly. He very quickly turned his face and looked directly at me!  Again it was as if someone had punched me in the eyes.  ((male name deleted)) asked to look and as he raised the glasses to his eyes he let out a “oohh” sound and pulled the binoculars from his eyes.  ((male name deleted)) gave the glasses back to me and we watched for a few minutes.  I then said something that embarrassed me, “We mean you no harm.”  I felt silly after saying that and didn’t try to communicate again. After a time we started hearing a coughing sound coming from him.  I suggested that he might be having trouble breathing.  As I watched him, he slowly started to move away from us when a dog from the other side of the wood started barking.  He returned to his crouching middle position.  I don’t know why at that point but I suggested to Glen that we leave him alone.   ((Male name deleted)) agreed. So we turned and started back to our position on the schoolhouse wall.  As we made our way around the L and the Alien was out of view, like a B-grade movie, a police car pulled around the corner of the school and drove up to us.  There were two officers in the car.  Of course they wanted to know what we were doing in the back of the school at night.  We tried to tell them that there was a “guy from another planet” (again feeling ridiculous) around the corner but they decided to check out our pockets.  Unknown to me was that in ((male name deleted)) father’s jacket, which had very deep pockets, were many books of matches.  Great, now we looked like we were up to something with fire.  But they believed me when I told them it was a borrowed jacket.  They then wanted to know what we were talking about. We said we’d show them.  So they followed us in their car as we walked back around the L-shaped wing to the East (left) and as we did I said to ((male name deleted)), “Now you KNOW he’s not going to be there.” It just felt like that would be in keeping with the impossibility of everything else that had occurred.  Sure enough he was gone.  The officers got out of their car and I described to them what happened.  One scoffed and said we were high or something but the one next to me swallowed in the classic gulping way you do when you’re scared. They got back in their car, drove into the field shining their light on the thin wooded area briefly and turned around and yelled for us to get out of the area and drove off.  We then left as told. To this day I often think of what may have happened had we lingered for no more than two minutes more with the alien.  The police would have continued to our position and been witnesses with us.  No telling what would have happened at that point.  It truly haunts me to this very day. ((male name deleted)) died last year. In the very infrequent contact we had over the years we always included our memory of that night. For a time right afterwards I experienced what I now know as PTSD.  ((male name deleted)) was a good drawer and drew the alien in school one day and it sent me back into a brief shock.  Later that year, to make legitimacy even more strained, the National Enquirer was offering $10,000 for photographic proof of UFOs.  On the cover of one of their issues, taking up the right edge top to bottom, was our guy.  Perfectly him.  I have since tried to get a copy of it but can’t find it.  I think it may be in the Library of Congress, but it isn’t available online as yet. I hope to get a copy and frame it and hang it in my office.  He was apparently at the time the most often seen alien. ((male name deleted)) and I at the time knew that as time went on we would ourselves start to doubt what happened.  But it did.  I often wish I could write it off to imagination or something else.  But it happened.  That’s my story. Not many people I know have had an alien trapped (or at least restricted) and then inexplicably let him go.  I would have done things differently today but perhaps that wouldn’t work out as well as it did.  But had I understood the gravity of what was happening I certainly would have tried something differently.  Just another thing that haunts me. By the way, I’ve since gone on to earn a B.A. in Psychology and I am a devout Christian. I have neither the desire to deceive or mislead anyone. This is the absolute truth. Thanks for letting me share this.",2018-04-19T00:00:00,40.5918,-74.705

We assumed it was a plane, so we stopped to look at the sky, and the light went out.  When it came back, it was dilating and continued to move.  We thought it was funny, so we kept watching it, and it started to change and move in the opposite direction.  It went sideways and hovered in place, which was when we became pretty certain that it wasn't a plane or a satellite.   Two other people walked up to us and confirmed that the light was moving weirdly...

At one point, it started to move again, and then stopped several feet higher than it had been.

Second night in a row. I am a semi-retired finance professional with an advanced degree.  I rarely drink and do not do any drugs.  I am also an amateur astronomer with a small scope, and because the airport is fairly close, a plane watcher with binocs on the outside table at all times.  The point is that I am intelligent, sober, rational, skeptical, and I can recognize planes, man-made satellites (have seen 3), and stars/planets.  What I saw was not one of these. On 4/12, at 10:30 PM, took dogs outside for the normal business.  As usual I looked at the stars.  Visibility was good – a bit hazy at about 20 degrees and below from a dust storm earlier in the day but generally clear directly overhead with major constellations visible.   Saw a bright flash (about as bright as landing lights turning on but much farther away and not in the flight pattern) due west at about a 70 degree elevation.  The light was flashing at 15 second intervals (I measured it) which is too infrequent even for a plane at cruising altitude.  It was moving south for about 3 minutes but moving too slow for an aircraft and much much too slow for a satellite.  It also did not seem to be moving in a straight line (somewhat difficult to tell due to infrequency of flashes).  Over this time the light gradually dimmed and took-on a slight reddish hue before it became too dim to see. On 4/13 at 8:30 PM went outside for some fresh air.  Looked up and saw the identical scene with these changes:  I did not see initial flash and the direction was south/southeast.  The sky was much clearer tonight. Also, about 8 weeks ago I was up very early 3:00AM to catch a flight.  Outside with the dogs.  Looked up and saw a moving, steady light (no flashing or colored lights) about the size and magnitude of a typical star.  It was moving slower than satellites I have seen before, and seemed much too high for an aircraft (my first thought was that it was a private jet a high altitude).  The light moved straight south covering about a 20 degree arc and then quickly faded at about Orion’s shoulders. The third sighting in the list very well could have been a satellite, but the other two were definitely neither planes, satellites, nor meteorites.",2018-04-19T00:00:00,33.56413757440476,-111.9050830357143

Approximately 8:30 pm Saturday, April 14th, 2018. At approximately 8:30 pm Saturday, April 14th, 2018 I arrived at my home, parked my car and stepped to the backyard. I am in a neighborhood that is dark, does not have streetlights and the properties are all close to 1 acre plus in size, the night is clear, still has some suspended dust particles in the lower atmosphere/sky that can affect the color like a filter. I unplugged the lights that illuminate a Paolo Verde tree in my backyard.  I looked to the South West and saw the “Belt of Orion” the significantly identifiable constellation that I recall my children always pointing out to me.  I was alone and enjoying the dark sky and the stars straight up and to the north. After seeing the “North Star” as directed by the “Big Dipper’s” outer ladle stars I turned back to view towards the South East and saw a magenta colored object with sequential lights, like a 1970 Ford Thunderbird with its right turn signal on, observed rolling from my left to right moving at a steady swift speed in a Southern and lower trajectory; maybe below 10,000 to 15,000 feet. The object seemed to stay on the same altitude in my field of vision. The lights were red and then bright white and the background of the lights lit up in magenta (magenta, somewhere midway between blue and red); it was very pretty and very different.  The lights where arranged in similarity to a shallow bowl, curving upwards and at an apex point above there was a point that was not lit but visible with some opaque connection from the curved lit zone upward to that apex point. The sequential movement of the light created a visual image that made the object seem to be spinning, however it was very quick and this was unlike anything I have seen in the sky before. I witnessed the sighting for about 5 to 10 seconds, then ran into my house and gathered my binoculars which were very close to the screen door to view.  I was excited to view the same outline however, the sequential movement of the lights changed to an “all on” or all illuminated pattern but, the apex point (at the top of the curved bowl shape) and the outline of a structure was more evident. I quickly went back into my house to grab my camera that can zoom and potentially capture an image.  At first because the screen is very small and aligning the camera in the night with a moving object in the sky I didn’t think I captured the image. However, I do have something on the camera. It is very small and only visible for about less than 1.5 seconds.  The camera shows a more blue in color but, I do not have a good way to review the video yet.  On the counter between 6 and 8 seconds, the small spot in the field of view on the top half of the screen shows, what I believe is the moving object described above.  It is very quick and very poor, the larger light was unfortunately one of my solar powered lawn lights.  I am willing to share the video, the sighting in the video is on the higher side of the field of view than the garden light I ended up targeting instead for the remainder of the shoot.",2018-04-19T00:00:00,33.56413757440476,-111.9050830357143

I joked about 'alien implants' and ufos.  I asked him if he'd ever seen a ufo. There was an audiology intern with him when I asked him.  He laughed and said 'no.'  But, after the intern left the room, he confided to me about witnessing over a dozen ufos, the size of a penny held at arm's length, silent, in the evening sky as he left the university and headed home.  He said they were clustered together at first, but as he watched them from his car he said they dispersed quickly in different directions while changing color. My point here is that there are many more ufo witnesses out there who are not inclined to discuss their observations because of fear of ridicule.  Even as this observation/sighting left a lasting impression on the doctor he had kept it to himself until I coaxed it out of him.  He felt comfortable sharing with me as I initially shared a very close encounter with him that happened  not far from where he observed his.  I have also casually asked folks with whom I've come in contact with, like contractors working at my house (one of them had an extraordinary encounter close up with a huge triangular ship) or a nurse in an office who shyly divulged her sighting with a black triangle ship in Vermont while on vacation, to an acquaintance at the nearby beach who told me of a large bright light that descended suddenly upon them from above while at an outdoor birthday party.  Another man I met and did not know well told me of a strange 'cloud of bees' he encountered while walking in a ! nature management area near me that solidified into a solid ball upon 'seeing' him and flew off into the trees. I would encourage people, just as an experiment, to casually ask anyone to whom they feel comfortable with and vise versa, to just ask if they've 'seen anything unusual' in their lives.  You  would be very surprised at the number of people who have stories, but have remained quiet only because no one bothered to ask. My last example is of a young woman whom I met one summer several years ago at my local beach who was from upper peninsula in Michigan (I remarked to her that I knew she was not from Rhode Island because she was too friendly and nice lol). She told me that her brother, who lived in Alpine, Michigan, one sunny winter day as he was driving his car to work, came across a disk shaped UFO, 30 or so feet in diameter, metallic, sitting in the road ahead of him.  He stopped his car and in shock sat there until it lifted off and flew off at great speed.  She said her brother was a serious and sober man and would never lie about something..especially something he felt uncomfortable relating even to his sister.  Her brother, she said, was still 'shook up' from the incident and to my reckoning only she and I even know about her brother's encounter.  So, don't be shy about casually inquiring strangers in a comfortable setting about what they may have seen.  You'll be surprised at how common ufo sightings and encounters of every kind are.",2018-02-16T00:00:00,41.42817246376812,-71.5353884057971

It was odd because there were no other clouds in that part of the sky.  This was just a lone circle cloud, very faint, sitting above the mountains to the east of me.  So faint that it would not have been noticeable to someone unless they were doing some observing of the sky that morning. When I first noticed it I'm guessing it was approximately 30 degrees from horizon. Because it was so faint to see I wasn't able to take video of it.  Instead, I used my Nikon D90 to shoot long exposures at high ISO.  I used the built-in sequencer to shoot 9 shots in a row for each sequence and I adjusted the exposure time somewhat between sequences. Because I was finished shooting the moonset and was walking a few miles to get back to my car I wasn't very interested in exploring this very faint puff in the sky.  But I decided to shoot a few shots and then look more closely at them when I got home.  So, after the first 20 or so shots I started walking back to the car again.  I walked for another 13 minutes before I paused to review the picture that I took on the screen on my camera.  When I zoomed into my shots I noticed the three distinct puffs and then realized that this was something unusual. https://flic.kr/s/aHsmafaWoN   I then set up to shoot as many shots as I could before the sun came up.  This is why the latter shots look like the object has scattered more until the sun came up and washed it out completely. You'll notice that the object seems to move at about the same speed as the stars around it which suggests that it must be a considerable distance from the earth. I have no idea what this thing was.  I admit, it doesn't look very much like a flying object but more like some kind of space weather anomaly.  Not sure what to make of it.",2018-02-16T00:00:00,40.9957,-111.86229999999999

I got up and went to the window where it continued to hover for 30-45 additional seconds. The orb, which was slightly larger than a full moon, glowed with a golden light.  While it hovered there I thought, ""What is this, a drone?""  I tried to see an outline within the glowing orb, but couldn't detect any image whatsoever. It hovered for at least thirty seconds then slowly moved from east to west then northwest.  As it moved away it seemed to be on a level altitude.  I watched until it was blocked by a neighboring building from view.  A helicopter followed the orb a minute later, following between the two buildings!  As I live close to three airports, and live in a densely populated city, I see airplanes, large and small, and helicopters (traffic and others) regularly.  All follow the same flight paths.

It was a continuous glow. 3.	  When the orb moved away, it did so slowly and steadily and proceeded to maintain the same speed as it moved east to west and then northwest until it was obscured from view by a building.  The distance traveled that I could see of approximately 2 miles.  I know this because it is the distance I travel daily on my route to work. Thank you.

I sighted an unidentified moving object from the shore of Ocean Beach San Diego California at about 2 pm October 27 2017.  Duration of sighting was between 5 and 10 minutes. On this day the weather was very hot and dry as Santa Ana weather condition gave way to clear unlimited visibility and a cloudless bright blue sky.  I was laying on my back on the sandy beach so naturally I was looking skyward.  My feet were pointed straight to the surf so my body was aligned northwesterly looking out to sea.  The sun was about 40 degrees to my left. As I watched an airliner pass by at mid altitude (approx. 10,000 feet) I noticed it pass by a small white spot in the sky.  The spot was roundish, stationary, and had the washed out white color the moon has on a sunny day.  This led me to think I was looking at Venus or some other celestial object though I was skeptical as I have never seen any celestial object in the bright day sky other than the moon. For the next several minutes I stared at the spot for a short while and then looked away for a moment and looked back up again still puzzled at what I was looking at.  After looking away, relocating it took a few moments as the small spot was difficult to see against the bright blue sky so I pointed straight at it so I could better relocate it.  From a perpendicular skyward view I pointed about 20 degrees to my right and about 20 degrees forward. Again I looked away for a short while and looked back up to relocate the spot, but I did not see it.  I pointed my finger in the direction I had just pointed a moment ago but the spot was gone.  I scanned the sky for a few seconds and I relocated the spot.  The spot had moved about 15 degrees to my left and was stationary.  Now my attention was peaked. I could rule out Venus or any other celestial object.  I stared intently at the spot for about 10 or 15 seconds when suddenly it appeared to move very slightly in a circular motion.  The movement was hard to tell against the bright blue sky so I extended and steadied my left hand and finger to try and gauge movement.  In the next few seconds I confirmed the spot was moving slightly in a circular motion, grew in brightness, then dimmed and vanished.  End of story. As an observer of credibility I want to note that I am a middle aged adult with fine far vision (no glasses). I had sunglasses and viewed the object with and without my sun glasses. I was not under the influence of any drug, alcohol, or medication.  Since childhood I have been an avid sky watcher.  I am sure what I saw that day was not of this Earth.

We then noticed that there was one off to the right, and one off to the left.  The one on the left had THREE yellow lights that would turn on one at a time, one right after the next, going from left to right.  Then it would move its position in the sky and do it again.

Always laughed at people who claimed to have seen but now it just got real!   My sighting happened in the middle of the afternoon on a cold but clear day.  Snow and ice was still on the ground from the light dusting of snow the night before. I had made a short trip to the grocery store to pick up a few items and on my way home I had to cut through a suburban neighborhood in order to avoid a minor traffic accident.  I came to a 4 way stop sign in the middle of the neighborhood close to mine and noticed something in the middle of the street slightly to the left  floating about 5 feet off the ground.  The object was unclear at first until it moved directly in front of my car.  At this point It was less than 6 feet from my face almost touching the hood of my car.  Its movement was very aquatic like and it seemed to float like a jelly fish.  It moved horizontally and vertically twice without tilting or pitching then returned back to center.  It moved without effort, it had no propellers, props or blades; it had neither propulsion nor exhaust that I could see.  This was not a drone!  This looked biological with some type of energy about it. I can see EVERY DETAIL about it now! The entire object was between 8 to 10 inches long and maybe 5 inches wide.  It protruded hair like fibers (thicker than hair) that held a type of energy that flowed through each fiber.  It looked like a deep sea Jelly Benthocodon but more like a caterpillar.  Both the top and the bottom were identical. (Hours of googling pics to no avail!).  As it moved the fibers moved in slow motion.  Everything seemed to move in slow motion at this point and I felt frozen in time. I was in shock and I couldn’t understand what I was seeing.  I kept asking myself “what the hell am I seeing” As I moved to unbuckle my seat-belt it reacted to my movement in the car. Its movement was like a posturing movement of fright of flight.  As I begin to open my car door it did a nose dive towards the ground then shot strait up towards the tops of the pine trees between 100 feet & 125 feet in less than 3 seconds.  I could see it clear against the blue sky! It moved horizontally with the tree line for about 50 yards then moved straight up until out of sight. It moved out of sight in less than 3 seconds.  At no point did it make any noise. Against the sunlight it had a metallic or sliver color about it. I stood in the middle of the street like an idiot yelling “I just saw an Alien”.  I walked around the 4 way stop for 10 mins looking for any type of evidence of the encounter but came up empty handed.  I looked around hoping someone else witnessed this but I'm sure I looked a little weird from a distance.  I returned later that day to see if any surrounding homes had security cameras but no luck.  Every day on my way home I cut through the same neighborhood hoping to see my caterpillar/jelly Benthocodon friend but no luck yet.  This time I’ll have my phone!",2018-02-16T00:00:00,34.04023923444976,-84.34734832535885

However, I immediately noticed the movement of the object was different from that of an aircraft; it moved like an object seen in low Earth orbit (as one might observe the international space station traversing the sky). The movement was smooth and consistent; very similar to the way the space station or a satellite would move across the sky but this object was much lower.  I estimate the altitude was between 3000 and 5000 feet. I observed the white light for approximately 2 seconds when suddenly the light completely extinguished. The object went completely dark; however I could see the dark shape of the craft continuing across the sky.  The night sky was sufficiently illuminated by the stars and I could clearly see the dark object continuing across the sky from the north to the south (right to left from my position) with absolutely no lights. The lights of the craft blinked out instantly.  This was not a conventional aircraft, there were no red or green directional lights on the craft, nor were there any strobe lights. There was no sound admitted from the craft.  The entire sighting lasted approximately 6 seconds before I lost sight of the object behind the house. Just after the sighting I became rather nervous that I had possibly seen something I shouldn’t have seen.  I was actually thinking that I might come in contact with an alien being.  This thought terrified me and I immediately went inside the house.  There were no additional occurrences after this.

The lights looked like two separate objects it seemed as if the lights were spinning and almost communicating with each other.

Again, there were two huge objects rotating with two lights apiece.  The lights in the rotation in both objects lasted 30 seconds.  The lights were yellow and white.  Separately on both objects, and both objects were BIG, had to be over Kite Georgia.  There in no doubt there were two objects.  There was no noise at all but the radio in the background.

They were flying over the I-5 Freeway (either just before the Wilsonville exit or just past it about a mile).  At first I saw a pulsating large red light, and next to it were 2 solid very bright green lights.  At first, when I saw the red pulsating light, I thought it was a stationary cell phone tower light that illuminated so planes would be able to see the tower, but then I realized this was a trail of three lights (one red larger pulsating light and 2 stationary green lights) and they began moving across the I-5 Freeway, ever so slowly traveling from east to west.   I was driving southbound along the I-5 Freeway at about 55 mph, and as I was driving, I was gradually moving closer to this object that was traveling across the freeway from east to west.  As I got much closer, I was practically driving directly underneath it and I could see that all three lights were very well defined and that they were part of a triangular shaped object.  I witnessed this for approximately 10 seconds as it sailed very slowly across the freeway going from east to west.  I knew that a conventional aircraft could never move this slowly without crashing.  Plus, this flying object had one very large pulsing red light (which planes do not have).  And I could see it was a black or very dark gray triangle shaped object.  Planes have flashing lights not the way this light pulsated.  It reminded me of a heart beating for some reason.  The two green lights on the other two corners of the triangle were green and florescent in color and much brighter than anything I have ever seen on conventional aircraft at night.  I have never in my life seen anything like this!  The speed that this triangular object traveled was like a hot air balloon or a blimp, which moved so slowly that it just seemed to float or drift above the freeway.  Then the moment that this first object moved out of my field of vision (behind some trees) a second one that looked identical to the first one began moving across the freeway, appearing almost exactly the same distance away from me as when I saw the first object.  It drifted at what seemed to be the exact same speed and made its way just directly over my van just like the first object.  It was like a mirror replica of what I just saw and I was so excited that I got to see this again!  And so I saw two triangular UFO's that looked exactly the same as the other, one flying slightly behind the other but near the first object as they both traveled over I-5 highway going east to west.  It was really beautiful to witness this. I was close enough under the objects to see that they were triangular shaped and not just 3 lights.  The three lights (one red and two green) were on each corner of the triangular object.  Sorry I didn't take a picture or video record what I saw.  I was unable to pull over on the I-5 freeway and it was dark at 11:49pm so unfortunately, I was unable to capture this magnificent event and such a very close view of these crafts made this the most spectacular sighting I have seen.",2018-05-31T00:00:00,45.3084,-122.7799

We first noticed a strange craft with a very bright light on it travelling faster than is possible for any known commercial or private plane about 15 miles from home.  It would be hovering close to mountain to our left and then it would zoom off out over the Great Salt Lake and back (a distant of close to 10 miles) in what seemed to be only two seconds. It then suddenly split into two objects that were both flying in the same erratic way.  After a few minutes of this we saw it merge back into one object.  After this it almost seemed to be following us.  This sparked our interest so instead of driving straight home we decided to continue driving for longer so we could investigate a bit more.

At first I thought it was military craft that flies overhead, from time to time, but there was no Doppler change in the roar. I looked outside to see several bright lights approaching from the west. I am located at about a 2400 ft altitude, and my guess these craft were about 5000 or 6000 ft AGL.  It was a partially cloudy night, no moon.  A large jet probably C17 was in front. Behind it was the classic TR3B I had read about. Bright specular steady white lights at each or the three points on the delta. A very large circular red disk in the center of it slowly pulsating from dim red to full off at about a 1.5 second periodicity. I could barely make out it’s silhouette. The “C17 (?)” had a four-engine sound with Doppler and nav lights.The steady non-Doppler roar was from the giant triangle behind it. It’s wing span was about four times that of the 4-engine jet in front.  Flanking each of the triangle’s side tips were jets with steady white lights. I could not make those out. All four craft were black. The red disk was a uniform light across its surface when it glowed. The red disk diameter was about 1/5 the breadth of the span of the triangle back tip to back tip.

Initially I saw no reason for the dogs disturbance as I stepped through my gate and into the center of the street and began looking in all directions for the cause, then glanced down the street and looking up into the northwest sky I saw an  object perhaps 1 mile off in the distance and appeared to be about 700 to 1000 meters high, slowly approaching as if it was going to land on my street. I initially thought that it was an unusually shaped hot air balloon, so I ran into the house and quickly grabbed my cell phone  as my camera was not readily available. By this time the object was overhead but behind my house as I stood facing to the East, and the object was gradually gaining altitude as it moved to the south towards Manila. I began to get a creepy feeling as all the animals suddenly became very quiet even the roosters stopped crowing,  and I snapped a couple quick pictures. I was able to discern several portal type windows and a peculiar type of landing gear, then I realized that it was definitely not a hot air balloon as this craft made absolutely no sound. It was nothing I had ever seen before and as I'm a U.S. Marine scout, I am first and foremost a trained observer. The object appeared as a non-reflective flat gray color, and had no lights of any kind, and given the distance from me it was not quite bright enough at that time to see any pilot or passengers.

As I was observing the saucer I saw two lights coming towards it from opposite sides, and thinking they might be airplanes, I thought a collision was going to happen.  But the two lights seemingly merged,or entered the larger saucer, and the craft hovered there for about 10 more minutes.   Then a large cloud obscured the craft, and I could no longer see it.  I would s! ay the saucer was about twice the size of a commercial blimp roughly, and whether the craft was physical or etherean I could not say, because the craft was a steady glowing orange color, and it appeared that the light it emitted was internal,glowing outward.  So, I would speculate that perhaps it wasn't a physical craft but of light only.   It had definite defined features, I did'nt see windows, but the strobe revolved at a consistent speed, and it obviously wasn't man made.  The two smaller lights that merged with it I presume were probes or some sort.  The whole sighting lasted about 15 or 20 minutes.

I was driving home sometime between 6:30 pm and 7:30 pm local time.  My step father was on the phone in the passenger seat, my step aunt was in the backseat, passenger-side.  We were heading East while I was driving and several lights come to my attention at about my 11 o’clock position and approximately 15-20 degrees above the horizon.  I witnessed a weird formation of lights I have not witnessed before.  The duration of the lights was brief, maybe 2-4 seconds duration in total.  But it was the formation that stood out to me, it was like a WV, W\, or possibly a M/\, or M/.  But it appeared that it was either 1 craft or a tightly-formed flying fleet. The thing that I remember is typically when I view the Cassiopeia constellation, it’s in the ‘W’ formation from my reference and during the brief encounter I had, it seemed like it was a ‘WV’ formation with the lights (it was in that same W formation, but with a few more lights,  I was tempted to select the Chevron shape for this report, but that would indicate I saw multiple crafts). I recall it being similar in the form of the Cassiopeia constellation, but the lights were as bright as incoming planes.  Initially I thought they were incoming planes, but the fact that I saw 1 of the lights dim and then disappear, while the others quickly followed in-sync with each other; this made me want to find out if anyone else saw those lights. I do know that there are homes in that direction and the possibility of drones with lights on them could be entirely possible, which would explain their low altitude.  But it was a quick encounter with strange lights in a formation, that I can’t explain. Another thing I should add, while it’s fresh in my mind is that the lights appeared to be the same color and the same distance away, though at night I’m sure that’s hard to tell.  They had like a regular airplane color, not one of the fancy white/blue colored lights (like a halogen color).  Each light also appeared to be symmetrical, in terms of the spacing and angles between each other. It was weird.

It slightly rolled and yawed in jerky motions. It was not a hovering propellor drone. But it appeared to be a fake somehow, about 1/2 to 2/3’s the size a commercial jet should be.

The object remained shrouded in this vaporous cloud the entire time .  A spherical light could be seen within the cloud, the light lit the desert as if daylight.  At the first sight it was about a mile or two out, under 1000 ft AGL, traveling at an estimated speed between 50-75 mph (timed). I pulled over to the side and exited the car and stood just off the road, the object proceeded toward me in an ever lower trajectory until it was below and between two mesa' in a ravine but still coming to me.It decended to 300-500 feet AGL and came within 500 feet proximity and 500 ft altitude.   I stood and watched as it stopped motionless in front of me.  The cloud was slightly swirling in front of the object, there was no sound whatsoever. It remained there, in a hover for 5 minits, at which time it made several erratic and very bright flashes then Retraced its path back into the desert to the east (toward groom lake) at the same speed it came and ascended back to the 1000 ft AGL gradually, then slowly disappeared around a tall mesa. The light disappeared and it was gone.  I started back to my car and another driver pulled over and yelled out his window ""  Did you see that thing?""  I responded, ""Yes"" then he said ""WHAT WAS IT?"" I respond with ""I DON'T KNOW"" and he sped off as quickly as he had stopped.  Within seconds, a man in a uniform (i assumed police but cant remember the emblem on the vehicle or the designations on his uniform but, i do remember there was no name tag! , as i w as looking for one.)  He said, ""What you doing parked in the emergency lane?  Take off or I'm going to write you up, this lane is for emergency ONLY.""So I say"" did you see that thing?""  And he responded ""No."".... ( not, ""what thing?"" or some other response, just ""No."" seemed odd to me at the time.)

I was working in a small semi-open woodworking shop near by the log house I was finishing.  There was a neighbor close but we did not associate with each other.  My wife and young child were on a 6 week holiday.  This was probably the only time in my life where a lengthy disappearance would not be noticed. Around noon I had a sudden and irresistible urge to walk 50 ft over to the lake (“I should go to the lake” popped into my head). I remember walking, then nothing. The next thing I knew I was appearing as if out of a fog.  The time was about 8:30 in the morning, I was wearing the same clothes, standing in the house, and it seemed dusty and unlived in; like when you come home from a holiday.  I was very confused and disoriented.  My brain felt fuzzy, like I had just had an electric shock. I could not figure out what day it was, what I was supposed to be doing that day etc..  I turned on the radio and it was Friday morning.  I looked at my day-timer that I kept my hours and descriptions of my work in.  The book (curiously) was open to that Friday.  I started flipping back through the days and nothing had been written since the previous Friday.  I had never (in 2 months being there) gone more than 1 day without logging my hours and what was done.  Each blank day seemed to hit me harder. From looking around and cross referencing in my book, I could see that no work had been done since Monday.  I looked outside at my shop and everything was as it appeared the previous Monday noon.  No further work had occurred.  There was snow on the ground, so I could see any and all tracks.  My truck was where I had parked it the previous Sunday night and the bit of fresh snow since showed that no one had driven in or out since Sunday.  Examining myself, I was wearing the same clothes as Monday and they were dry and not smelly or dirty ()like they would if I had been wearing them for 5 days straight.  The house had wood heat and I could see that the firewood from Monday morning was still there. The food purchased on Sunday for the work week was all in the fridge and nothing had been eaten since Monday morning.  I checked myself in the bathroom and I was not dehydrated or hungry, nor coincidentally were there any marks on me.  (I am not sure why I examined myself.)  I tried and figure out what I had been doing for almost 4 days.  I had complete amnesia and could not remember the slightest detail.  When I look at my memory that memory is just solid white like a thick fog. An overriding thought kept repeating in my head;  “I must have been here working.  I must have been here working. I ...”This seemed like a post hypnotic suggestion (or in this case command). As if in a trance, I took my day-timer and filled in the missing time with imaginary work-even though it was a complete lie!  The work I was doing was log house trim/finishing.  The rooms were so uneven that I would measure up only part of one room and mill materials just for that part, install then move forward to the next part.  It was completely obvious that no work was done, yet I filled in fictitious work.  This bothered me immensely. was completely out of character yet I still did it.  This is the only time in my life that I have cheated an employer. The fictitious work was so well written, that even a few months later I could not figure out exactly what week this occurred. About 6 months later I dreamt about the start of this experience.  As the dream started I immediately knew it was the day the missing time started. I was in my shop, the suggestion to walk to the lake came and over I immediately shut off my thickness planer and went over to the lake.  I looked up to the sky and it was a bright overcast day.  There was a seeming saucer-shaped hole in the clouds.  It seemed I could see through the hole into space.  The saucer shaped hole was on a 30 degree angle with the right side higher. It did not appear to be a solid object.  The inside of the hole was jet black and full of bright shining stars.  There were too many “stars” to be actual space but this was the closest description I could come up with.  It appeared to be about a thousand feet up and about three fingers width (holding my arm extended). I stared at this for about 10-15 seconds and I could not figure out what it was, since it seemed to be the opposite of a solid object.  I then thought “I’m actually seeing a UFO!”. I was very excited since I have been fascinated by them most of my life, but had never seen one (or did not recall seeing one). As soon as the thought came to me, I had an electric shock zap me-from my head to my toes and I was completely awake sitting upright in bed.  The thought of a UFO, the shock and sitting up in bed seemed to happen instantaneously.  As soon as I was awake I felt I had solved the mystery of what happened to me the previous spring. I have tried to dream more about this and have had only snippets in my dreams. One time I was aboard a craft with another person in front of large golden balls that had something to do with propulsion. Another time I saw a silver craft (just landed on the ground in front of me 20 ft away).  There were about 12 smiling very attractive people sitting behind a window in the UFO facing me, men and women in shiny suits.  The people were very attractive. The window changed from clear to mirrored (like 70s sunglasses) just below eye level, so I could see all of them, but their eyes and the tops of their heads. Other times, my dreams have discs flying about and occasionally landing.  Whenever I have the dreams I am after tired and disoriented (in my dreams).  I have never felt any fear or apprehension about my experience or during dream recollections. I would like to have some hypnotic regression sessions since I have never regained any memory of the lost time.  Since there were close to 4 days I feel there could be some interesting details of other worlds and life forms etc.",2018-03-23T00:00:00,,

Late night at Mansfield Dam near Austin Texas.  Me and my friend saw strange orange lights, maybe orbs, directly behind a tree line, they were moving very slowly and silent.  Within 10 seconds a massive array of 3 huge, spinning searchlights blasted down and lit up the park.  The way they moved was like a gigantic spirograph.  This intrusion emanated from a massive floating object at least 150 feet above us. Each of the 3 lights spun in a tight circle, (seemingly to cover more ground surface area?) a larger rotating system allowed the three spinning lights to rotate on a larger wheel, making the ground search even more efficient.  We ran from the lights but they lit us up and chased us under some trees.  We were absolutely terrified until all the beams were disengaged. We stepped out from under the tree, the sky was blocked out by a massive black triangle. It created the lowest frequency I’ve ever felt, It sounded like the engine of a massive ocean tanker coming in to dock.  It was totally silent otherwise.  We watched it drift out over the water looking at the 5 flashing amber diamond shaped lights.  They flashed in sequence from left to right, one by one.  We just stared until it went over Apache Trail off lake Travis.  We forgot what had happened for about 20 minutes but began talking about it later. Hypnosis?

Maybe five years ago or so I reported this, but I forget where, and I’m not even sure it was a legit site.  So this time I wanted to again record and submit this to a site centre where I knew it would be logged. In about 2003, when I was 12 years old, I’m speculating on the exact date, but I lived in a two story house out in the country, about a 5 minute drive from Lake Erie, 1.5hrs south of Toronto.  My bedroom was in an upstairs room, next to my brothers room, on one side of the upstairs.  I went to bed at approximately 930 of so, and I had an alarm clock radio next to my bed which had green numbers to tell the time.  I would always hit this one button on my radio which would play music for 59 minutes and then shut off, and in that time I would be asleep. On this particular night I was listening to the radio trying to fall asleep.  I remember it was a Kelly Clarkson song that was playing, and I suddenly, with my eyes being open, found myself “flipped” on my bed.  So that my head was now where my feet were, and I could see my alarm clock on my bedside table next to my feet.  I was still facing he same way in bed, which was north.  My bed was in an East-West direction.  I laid down with my head on the east side of my bed, looking North, and now my head was on the west side of the bed lookin North.  This whole “flip” lasted about 5 seconds or so.  I could still hear the song playing on the radio. I then remember being outside my house, hovering over the roof, I would say, maybe 200ft above the roof of the house.  I don’t remember being sucked up and out of the roof, just remember being there.  I could see the countryside around me.  We lived close to several forests and there were many open fields of agriculture in the area.  My grandparents also lived around the corner from us, which I could get to by walking or riding alongside the fields.  All of this landscape was discernible to me as I hovered.  I would say I looked around for 2-5 seconds while hovering in the air.  I was still laid on my side while hovering, and could not move my body, just was able to turn my head 45 degrees or so.  Looking up towards the sky, there was a bright light shining down towards me.  I don’t recall seeing any craft, nothing I could make out. Just a very bright yellow/white light.  I would estimate the light was maybe 100ft away from me.  Still paralyzed from my neck down, and still looking up at the light,  I spoke.  I’m pretty sure it was just my thought that was saying this, i didn’t actually say this out loud. I said “Please, don’t take me. Leave me here.  Take someone else”.  After that, I was placed back on my bed in the position that I was initially flipped to, with my head on the west side of my bed and my feet next to my nightstand with the radio on it. I don’t recall being moved back to my bed, just remembere being back on my bed after the incident. I would say the whole encounter lasted maybe 20 seconds or so. When I was placed back on my bed, the same jelly clarkson aong was still playing. While it was still early in the evening, I got up and went to my mother, who was awake downstairs.  I told her what had just happened to me.  She told me I must have had an out of body experience.  The two of us never spoke of it again until maybe 3 or 4 years ago. At the time of the incident I was just a regular kid, in the sense that I knew what a UFO was, but was never fascinated or intrigued by th or gave them any thought. I’ve told my wife what happened a few years ago. Not really sure if she believed me or not but other than those two occasions with my mother and with my wife, I’ve never spoken about it with anyone. I just think it is a crazy thing to happen and to keep it to myself without reporting it to a credible organization would be doing a disservice to many people out there. Since then, I would say I’ve had two other encounters, one where I was frozen through my apartment window by bright lights, and the second I observed some suspicious lights flying over the road I was driving on. I think the encounter where I was frozen by lights outside my window could be related to my first experience, but obviously I’m not sure.  I’ve never told anyone about these other two occurrences, and have not reported them either. Hope this helps you guys. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was outside working in my front yard when I stood up and movement caught my eye.  My first thought was that I was seeing a hawk diving towards its prey, but as I focused on the object, I knew it was nothing of the sort.  I can't be absolutely sure if it was a disc or sphere, but if I had to guess I would go with sphere. It was traveling from the NW to the SE, a few degrees North from directly overhead as it passed over.  It was brown, the color of an old penny, with seven evenly-spaced yellow or gold spots.  I have described it to others as kind of looking like a soccer ball.  Hold a pencil at arm's length looking at the end and that's approximately how big it appeared, maybe 1/4 the size of a full moon.  There was no smoke or vapor trail and no sound or sonic boom.  When I first caught sight of it, it was about half way between the horizon and overhead and I watched it until it faded into the distance like a high-altitude jet.  It traversed over 90 degrees of the sky in just a few seconds, almost as fast as a meteorite. After it was gone I stood there in my yard for a couple of minutes trying to make sense of what I had just seen, then called my sister to tell her about it.  I was still just a tad excited.

LATER AN INVISIBILITY AND MENTAL CONTROL INCIDENT. Date:  April 5, 2017.   LOCATION:  Sevilla, city (Spain)   INCIDENT:  Casual and direct encounter with a homomorph being.  Firstly one hour of my observation with binoculars, I could see him launching a javeline through 350 meters distance (1150 feet), effortless, without carrera, without parabole and one hour later face to face (50 meters of separation or less).  The being walked 400 meters for obstructing my path, and I think he approached in complete invisibility, then he materialized. in front of me.  After this, I lost my memory for three days. APPEARANCE: human, white, caucasian, 1.80-2.00 m tall, athletic. tight black pants, integrated black shoes, bare torso. BEHAVIOUR: calm, indifferent to the environment, ritual or automated movements, repetition of movements. Face to face event: he proved to be hostile but not aggressive. PERSONAL OBJECTS:  1.- Jabeline/Pole (not spear) of 2.50 meters and 5 cm diameter.  Weight unknown.  Color light brown, wood-like. 2. Black high-end car with tinted glasses without license plate and unidentified model. OBSERVED ACTIVITY:  Throwing  a large javeline  at 350 m distance with his right hand as if it were a dart without effort (beyond the human capabilities), only possible with an antigravity effect.  Repeat without stopping 24 hours in a row. 00 - 24 hours 4/5/2017. NOTE:  object in antigravity without any mechanism, perhaps an unknown coating or painting that shielded the gravity.  Possible associated invisibility when the pole was in motion, flying.  This was confirmed with his aproximation to me one hour later. JOKE OR FAKE POSSIBILITY:  not possible. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) 1.- For God's sake, it was absolutely real.  I'm a 57-year-old engineer and I'm not about to lose my time or my prestige in invented nonsenses. 2.- I consider that this damn fortuitous case goes beyond the credible, but it was true from the first to the last detail described.  I insist and I continue insisting that someone looks for the satellite photos of those GPS coordinates that I sent you because that homomorph was there at least 13 hours.  The recordings of the security cameras of the air base are restricted matter 3.- It is the first time in my life that I make an observation like that (and I hope it is the last) but I also consider this incredible case ""intangible heritage of humanity"" and therefore should be known.  I repeat that there was no UFO, no aliens, no triangles in the skies, no lights, no sounds, but a human-like doing non-human things. . 4.-I hope that the homomorph (or his team) have seen my description in Mufon's ""Live Ufo Map"" and act in some way or appear anywhere. 5.-Finally, I repeat the same again and again, and believe it or not, but the fact really existed.

Driving up Calle Tres, almost to Via Montana Vista, 7-9 identically-sized white lights, evenly spaced in a straight horizontal line, directly ahead of me, low in the sky. Notes:  *The lights alternated on/off in what looked like signaling, then all turned off.  I don't know if every single light turned on/off, or in what order they did so. *I'm not good at estimating size or distance, and it was dark, but my impression was that it was airliner size, maybe a 727's wingspan.  My first reaction was that it WAS an airliner, but that it was far too close to the ground.  Because I couldn’t see the mesquite ahead of me, I can’t guess how high up it was – it just felt “really close” to the ground for something so large. *I was driving home from work.  It was after sunset - 18:35 - and the sky was dark to the west. *I observed the UFO for approximately 1 minute, driving up Calle Tres.  As I stopped at the T intersection, the UFO had disappeared (lights all off).  It did not reappear, that I could see, after I'd turned south/left, although it now would have been on the passenger side of my car, so would have been difficult/impossible to see if it did. *The area over which the UFO was is State Land - no buildings of any sort.  There are recreation vehicle trails through this, but I don't believe there is land at the elevation at which I observed the UFO (upon which ATVs could have been gathered).  And, would ATVs be able to turn headlights on/off independently?  I did, definitely, see that lights next to each other were independent of each other in turning on/off.  I did not hear any ATV sounds. *Sierrita Mountains are west, and just north, of my location.  There is a lot of mining going on there, and a mining equipment sales area which shoots off fireworks when they make a sale.  This was not fireworks of any type I have ever seen: fireworks don't go on/off at each spot of light, nor are the spots identical and evenly spaced.  The known fireworks are shot off quite a distance from my location, but I can hear the reports; there was no sound. *There is a lot of activity from Davis-Monthan AFB over my area, and a lot of BP plane & helicopter activity, as well.  I'm used to these, but there was no mechanical noise of any sort.  There was no discernable movement, either - the line of lights was stationary the entire (albeit short) time I observed it. *I was playing music in the car, so might have missed fireworks reports, but would have heard an airplane/helicopter. *Coincidentally, a few nights later, I watched the Smithsonian documentary about the solar plane's flight around the world - there was a definite similarity to the night shots of that craft landing - the long row of lights.  However, on the UFO, there were no other lights typical of known aircraft - no smaller red or green wing/tail lights, no rhythmic blinking of the white lights.  And, again, a known aircraft would make noise, would not turn off all lights at once, would have exploded if it hit the ground. *I had an impression of a V shape, but that could've been subjective interpretation, since I couldn’t see any body shape, only the lights. *I don't know much about drones - are they quiet?  And, if drones, why would they all turn their lights off at once?  It would have to have been multiple drones, or one huge single drone.  Observer:  61-year-old female.

Orion always has been easy to spot and when I looked up just to see if perhaps my camera (basic dslr) could get a pic of Orion, the consellation was located nearly due south of my location about 60 degrees above the horizon (may give a more accurate time than the one I listed since am not sure of the time I saw this).  The night was very clear and decided to try to photograph Orion. But before I did I noticed something different about Sirius (I believe Sirius Major, the bright star just to the side of Orion).  The bright star that ""flashes"" seemed to be doubled, with a second Sirius-type object just above it.  But the lights ""flashed"" on the upper object more quickly and in greater number (red, green, blue, white) than those of the star.   I aimed my camera at Sirius and this ""twin"" and began taking photos. As I did, the ""twin"" began to move away from Sirius, initially going higher so a definite gap between the two existed; it then moved quickly out of my camera's previous focal area, darting west (to my right), pausing, then moving downward toward the horizon slightly (about 4 degrees), then more slowly moved east of Sirius while still lower in the sky, moved back to ""double"" the star again by aligning beneath it, only to move again. When it finally disappeared, it was from the original position in which I'd seen it. It didn't grow dim, it just vanished and Sirius was alone.  This actually happened twice, it showed again for about a minute, remaining stationary, before again vanishing.  I watched for another ten minutes but never saw it happen again. This object looked, to my eyes, very much like a slightly larger ""twin"" of Sirius, having a steady white light superimposed by lights which ""flashed"" at about the same pace at which those of Sirius seem to change.  The lights of the object were brighter than those of Sirius, and were red, green, blue, and white.  The white of the object itself may have been what I saw when the ""flashing light"" turned white, I'm not sure, but the other lights all coexisted with the overall white color. I had a clear view from about 15 degrees above the horizon to the southwest, south, and much of the southeast.  This object was at all times within about 4 degrees south or 2 degrees north of Sirius.  It moved quite a distance west and east of Sirius, however, mostly with movements so quick I could not see it move, though several times it was slow enough to follow it as it darted left or right; once or twice it moves more slowly in this lateral direction. Its up and downward motions were quite gradual. I watched for about ten minutes, taking photos, also, which appeared very different from what I saw through the naked eye.",2018-02-16T00:00:00,39.73540852059925,-84.16762780898877

On the evening of May 17, 2018, I was on my sailboat anchored in the Little Shark River in the Everglades of Florida.  The evening was very dark with a glow on the eastern horizon caused by light pollution from the Miami area of the southern tip of Florida.  The stars were out and bright and the sound of high flying planes was slightly audible along with the blinking lights of their flight overhead. At approximately 2145 I saw bright flashing lights approaching from the west and I said ""here comes the light show"".  I thought at the moment it was a helicopter, maybe up from the Keys doing a night training flight.  I quickly realized that was not the case.  The lights, which were flashing in a one-two strobe effect were very bright and materialized into a string of lights on what was probably 4 or 5 craft.  They were flying in a ""follow the leader"" pattern.  There was no sound.  Their altitude was hard to judge because of the blackness of the night and the brightness of the lights, but my guess would be under 5 thousand feet.  Their path was straight out of the west, then a sharp turn to the south, then a sharp turn to continue east and out of sight.  The whole passage was less than one minute.

At approximately 8:30 to 8:45 p.m. on Thursday May 17, 2018, I was in my backyard in Rio Rico, Arizona.  I was on the phone with a friend from San Diego.  I witnessed several strange anomalies in the western sky while I was on the phone with her.  Things like, what looked like silvery/white lights that at first I thought were airplanes but could not possibly have been because they were not blinking.  Solid light.  They were stationary for periods of time and then would move up, down, then move in a straight line then move diagonally and up and down then completely disappear like someone flipping a light switch.  This went on for around 30 minutes on and off. At around somewhere between 9:00 to 9:30 p.m., the unthinkable occurred.  I had my eyes fixated on the more North Western part of the sky, and it was very dark out because the new moon had already dipped below the horizon, but several stars were visible in the night sky, and in the EXACT location where my eyes were looking, a huge, I mean GARGANTUAN formation of lights appeared in a long BAND.  It just appeared as though, again, someone had flipped a light switch.  Like, it was not there and then suddenly THERE!  It seemed extremely close to me, like no more than a football field away up there.  It was stationary, did not move from its location, however, it did many odd things that will be difficult to describe, but I will try. The object was perfectly visible to me and the experience lasted, to the best of my recollection, for about 10, maybe 12 or so seconds.  A rather long time! During this time, the following occurred very quickly:  The band of lights looked somewhat like an engagement ring, with a big light in the center and three slightly smaller lights on either side for a total of 7 lights.  They were perfectly visible and SQUARE…but perhaps not entirely square, more on the rectangular side, yet almost square.  Then…the band of lights did a really odd “morphing” type of thing (for lack of a better way to describe it), where it seemed to become “one” long band of light for a split second and then when it returned to separate rectangles again, the object seemed CLOSER to me.  It did this 3 times and on the 3rd time, it seemed ever so much closer to me than when it appeared the first time and I CLEARLY saw a slight shadowy structure around the rectangular band of lights!  But it had no color…just a darkness that seemed to fill in the spaces and it looked very “saucer-like” in an obscure way.  THEN...I became acutely aware that it was aware me ME, all in a couple of seconds of time before it did the fol! lowing:  each of the lights blinked of and on in a nonsensical way, then all of the lights were back on and then in a flash, it completely disappeared. I used to listen to a lot of Linda Moulton Howe back in the day, so I immediately had the presence of mind to assess how large the object would be if I held something in between my thumb and index finger and stretched my arm out as far as it could go, up against the night sky.  So, if you had one of those clear plastic Bic Pens, with the blue cap on, and took the cap off, and held it in the aforementioned manner, THAT is how big this damn thing was!  It was HUGE. One more tidbit:  Last year, in 2017, at around the same time of year as I recall, my husband and I saw a LOT of anomalous activity in the very same sky where we lived then, and now.  I had another experience with the same kind of “engagement ring” band of light, but it was fully in the Western sky as opposed to the NW.  But, this band was only 5 lights and they were a fiery brilliant orange color.  The ones from last night were totally white.  And like last night, the experience from last year also caused me a strange feeling of “it is aware of me” because it was coming towards me, just like last nights experience. To conclude, I know a few people in this area, who have also seen many strange anomalies in our Rio Rico Arizona skies.  I did not report last years events.  But the one that happened last night was so huge and so blatant and so incredibly amazing that I felt I really needed to share it.  It is a couple of days later as I write this and it is still bothering me to know that I saw what I saw.  I feel very strange.  It made absolutely no sense at all.  It left me with the feeling that something had occurred on an inter-dimensional level.  There was no sound.  My mind does not know how to process this.  Thank you for your time and consideration. PS!  A side note I almost forgot to include! I tried to film it with my iPhone, but the video button portion was completely missing!  I tried to use the photo feature, but when I pressed it NOTHING HAPPENED! I quickly gave up because I did not want my eyes to miss anything.  After the event was over, and my poor friend on the other end of the line had to listen to me kind of freaking out and asking me a ton of questions about what was happening, the camera feature in my phone would still not work at all and the video button was still missing.  After I ended the call, I rebooted my phone and still, the video portion of my phone’s camera was NOT THERE…and nothing worked.  At bedtime, at around midnight, I plugged my phone into the charger and fell asleep.  I had a horrible nightmare about the event and when I woke up, it was the first thing on my mind.  When I unplugged my iPhone from the charger, the first thing I did was go straight to my camera and lo and behold, the video ! button had returned and everything worked as normal.

During this time, I observed the blue sphere moving around in the night sky (screen shot of pics on my phone shows various locations).  My attention was still focused on the round blue object. I went inside and downloaded the images on to my computer to review. After spending time on my computer, I went out to the backyard to take one last look.  To my surprise, the object was still visible in the night sky.  I took another photo at 22:27 of the blue sphere. When I later viewed my pictures and video I saw other objects, what appears to be flying metallic objects. Even though I was standing in the middle of the street taking pictures, as far as I know none of my neighbors saw anything. ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the still photos that have been forwarded to our Center by the witness.  The small, blue-green object in those photos seems to us to be strongly reminiscent of lens flares, caused by pointing a camera at a bright source of light.  However, if the witness did, in fact, see the object with her normal vision, the objects are not lens flares, which are caused by reflections off the surfaces of the lens elements in the objective lens of a camera.

It appeared to be literally in space.  It subtended probably 1 degree or less of the sky.  At first I thought it was a shooting star streak that sustained for a moment, however, it was perfectly straight and whitish perhaps tinted blue in color and seemed unnatural. As we all looked up (3 people saw it).  Two additional beams of light appeared, appearing to go from east to west.  These two beams were exactly parallel to each other and very close (let’s say 1/5 of the diameter of the moon apart).  These beams subtended more like 50 degrees of the sky starting from near the eastern horizon (but none of us were sure of where it started as we were focused on the top part) and extended all the way to where we saw the first beam (next to the star Bellatrix in the Orion constellation) near the top of the sky. The beams then rapidly wobbled (perhaps about 1/5th of the moon diameter) back and forth in unison and staying parallel to each other before fading away.  The total time was maybe 3-4 seconds for the second event.  I would say maybe 10 seconds for the whole event starting with the first small beam. A few other facts: •	It was a completely clear evening and the Milky Way was dimly visible. •	The moon was not above the horizon yet. •	The beams were very thin like a triple wide pencil line on a sheet of paper with a taper at the tip.  Imagine a very long, thin knitting needle appearing high in the sky. •	All 3 of us saw the exact same thing and described it to each other in detail which matched. •	The only airport is 30 miles away and I have never seen an airplane there (I have spent about 5 weeks or so in this area and viewed the sky many of these nights.  I am 100% sure it was not an airplane light, but point this out as it is the only rational explanation at first blush. o	The sighting was on a beach just south of the town of Tamarindo, Costa Rica on the Pacific Coast. •	The viewing was from a roof top condominium deck. •	There was nothing natural about the appearance.

Reason for report: Flight of an unknown craft sighted as I climbed up the pass near Mt. Ashland, OR, ~1045 hours PT, 04 Feb 18. Sky conditions:  It was a bright blue sky with a very thin altocumulus cloud layer, visibility unlimited.  Mt. Shasta was clearly visible to the south when I stopped to take a photo of the exhaust trail of the vehicle I observed. Narrative: On 04 February 2018, I was driving on I-5 southbound in steep and winding terrain in the mountain pass near Mt. Ashland.  I saw what appeared to be a missile launch rising straight into the sky above the terrain, distance unknown, at a high relative speed.  [One of my friends lives just a few miles north of the Modesto, CA, airport: judging from air traffic approaching the Modesto Airport (on the Bay Area DYAMD arrival), the vehicle or craft I observed was flying at approximately 4 times the speed of the aircraft approaching the Bay Area from the east.]  I observed a large smoke plume, semi-conical in shape, as the vehicle shot upward; there was a slight break in the exhaust trail, then another just below the vehicle.  The upward part of the vehicle was partially obscured by a cone-shaped cloud typical of a craft passing transonic speed.  See diagram #1.  It caught my eye because it was a straight climb upward, at a very high rate of climb and speed.  As I was driving in steep, winding terrain, I had no opportunity to photograph what I saw until a few minutes later, I began the descent into California.  I stopped my car and took a photo of the exhaust trail which was still visible though fading somewhat.  I do have an operating high definition dash camera with a f/1.4 lens which recorded the event.  (Please see the DVD enclosed.)  The vehicle itself (please refer to diagram #2) was highly reflective; the upper part was tapered, though not with a sharp point; the lower portion was cylindrical and seemed rounded at the base: the overall shape was cylindrical, somewhat like a gelatin capsule.  I observed the craft until it reached the thin, partially-broken cloud layer above me: though the layer was not very thick and afforded a clear view of the sky above, the vehicle disappeared.  I want to make this very clear: this was not a contrail of a high-altitude aircraft approaching me from the south.  Those contrails are seen well above the horizon: this craft was distinctly visible, climbing at a very high relative speed, unlike an aircraft approaching at a distance at high altitude with a thin contrail. The vehicle was climbing beneath the cloud layer upward at an incredible velocity, initially leaving a pillar of smoke or exhaust, and had a cone-shaped cloud surrounding the upper portion of the craft.  Other significant factors: Also visible were two high-speed flights of military aircraft, very small jets (from my perspective); there was a flight of two, flying in tight formation, and another group of three in a triangular formation, sighted when I stopped to photograph the exhaust trail of the vehicle.  These aircraft appeared to be flying at an altitude not more than 50% of Mt. Shasta’s elevation above the mountain (21,000-22,000 feet?) and no lower than the peak of Mt. Shasta.  What type of aircraft these were is unknown to me, but they were small, flying in formation, at high speed.",2018-02-16T00:00:00,,

I was observing the Orion Nebula with my 8"" telescope when I first noticed a reflection of an object rapidly flashing blue, red, green, white, and possibly other colors.  I looked up and saw the object – it was close enough to distinguish that the flashing lights were in different positions on the object, but I could not make out its shape. I thought it was an airplane at first, but instead of it flying on a particular heading it was traveling upward and outward with a rocket-like trajectory.  However, there was smoke trail it as one would expect with a rocket.  Additionally, it did not emit any sound. When I first looked up, the object was about 70 degrees above the south-south-west horizon in the Aries constellation (near the ""41 Arietus"" star).  The object traveled in an outward trajectory, heading south-south-east toward the Orion constellation, but curving downward toward the Eridanus and Lepus constellations.  I called my wife out to see it, and she saw it the last couple of minutes as it was leaving.  I tried to track it with my telescope, but it was moving too fast. As the multicolored flashing object was moving away it became smaller and fainter to see, until it disappeared completely between the ""54 Eridani"" and the ""Epsilon Leporis"" stars, near the Eridanus and Lepus IUA boundaries.  The only difference between this object's trajectory and a rocket's trajectory is that it never ""flattened"" out – in other words, the object continued on a semi-parabolic trajectory, as if it were heading into space.  Also, the object appeared to vary its speed, but seemed to continue at a fast and constant speed as it disappeared. It took around 4 minutes for it to traverse the arc described above, and it definitely was traveling faster than a rocket.  About 3 minutes after it disappeared, a passenger jet flying west to east flew at an unusually low and flat altitude of about 1,000' to 1,500' above the ground, and it flew right over our house.  It was close enough to see the passenger windows and its configuration (either a 737 or an Airbus A320).

I could observe that when the strong light was off, sometimes I could see two very weak points of light very close to each other and associated with the source of the flares.   The light was slightly yellowish and the flares of variable intensity were brighter than the alpha-centaur star that was nearby and one of the flares was much more brighter than the venus glow.  The speed of travel was very slow, with no noise whatsoever, it seemed to be at an altitude far superior to that of jet planes.   I followed the displacement of the source of the light until it disappeared definitively when arriving at the constellation of the Scorpion.  I have had dozens of years of observation as an amateur astronomer and have never seen anything like this with such peculiar behavior.  It was certainly not an airplane, not a helicopter, not a balloon and even less a drone.  All  the observation lasted about five minutes.

This being was very tall, close to 9 feet tall, and it's head was large and massive.  I could only see the entity from behind, but I will never forget it's head being so big.  The ET's arms and legs were very small, like looking at sticks.  I tried to communicate with this thing with no luck.  The ET and the short man just went on walking down my hallway and seemed to walk through the wall.  I was fully awake at the time, and it was no dream.

When they neared Caborn (6-7 miles east of Mt. Vernon), the conductor told the rear conductors by intercom that they had seen a real bright light behind them.  When they got near St. Phillips, the rear conductor reported that there now was a train following them, on the same track, and the RR blocking system showed something approaching them.

When the object behind the train backed away, the blocking system showed the object retreating.

There were alot of scattered rain clouds overhead as the sun was just about to go down, but the sky was still clearly visible we were heading south on the old 163 freeway just outside the Mira Mar Naval Air Station when I happened to look up out my passenger window and spotted a bright silver metallic round object coming out from behind a cloud it appeared as if it were spinning however the closer it came the more visible it appeared to have bright lights blinking all the way around it making it appear like the craft was spinning but it wasnt.  There was a midsize car approx. 2 car lengths in front of us and across the freeway on the other side there was a vehicle the craft came down hovered over the vehicle in front of us than hovered over the car on the north bound side came back and hovered again over the vehicle in front of us than rose up and shot across the freeway in an easterly direction losing site of it.  The craft was approx. 25 feet round and metallic in color with a cylinder shape that came out from underneath releasing a vapor of some type when it would raise back up after hovering.  The brightness of the lights encircling the craft were almost blinding they were so bright, and on the top of the craft was a small dome where perhaps an occupant was piloting the craft.  I saw no markings on the outside but because of the brightness of the lights that doesnt mean there wasnt any.  Just after it bolted across the freeway and flew out of sight we were approaching the MiraMar Naval Air Station.",2018-05-04T00:00:00,,

At that time I was young and suppressed a lot of stuff for fear of being criticized by friends.  This is not the case any longer.  I am an old man now, almost retiring, my memory is beginning to fade, and I feel I should tell the entire story the best I can, as it has important details. Let me fix the story where I suppressed the middle part of the 3rd paragraph.  Where it says “We noticed that the lights were splitting from half sides of the circle to meet at their opposite sides, going back and forth, I had a very, very strong feeling of being closely observed, tried to run back but felt suddenly weak, stumbled but continued to the car.  I found the girl trembling and, ridiculously enough, we both yelled at those lights to get off.”  Now, instead of “It took them a long time (10 minutes?) to leave”, replace with:  ====================== We started seeing small human-shaped shadows in front of the lights.  We first thought they were bike riders who were going to rob us or worse, so we locked the doors.  However, when they got closer, we could see small grayish beings without hair and big eyes, who began to touch the windows to get in.  Instead of keeping inside the car, the girl panicked, opened the door and tried to run away.  They grabbed her immediately, then entered the car by her door, and got me as well by the arms.  One gave me a chock in my neck, I felt very weak, and almost fainted. They carried us away in stretchers to the lights, which ended up being a round flying saucer, with a ramp leading to a big entry (and a sliding door), which they climbed to take us inside.  Once there they laid us in horizontal “beds”, and closed the door.  The disk took off, and accelerated to an extremely large mothership in orbit of the planet, which I could see from a lateral window.  I cannot remember well the shape of it at this point, but it was irregular, like a very big elongated ballon with towers distributed irregularly along it, and about 1.8 miles long (3 km). They got inside the mothership, and I was taken to a very bright room where taller beings with long blond hair measured my blood pressure, took out samples of my skin, hair, saliva, blood, and even sperm.  The last one was taken by an human-like alien woman taller than me, with blond hair and white skin, who gently stroke me until I came.  When she was collecting the sperm with a spoon, I felt she was going to be my last chance of getting out of there alive.  So, I kindly passed my hand on her face and said I wished God would bless her for her kindness, God would protect her and her family, and would make her happy in her entire life.  Her face suddenly irradiated with glow, and she immediately went to talk to other two tall human-like alien men.  They looked at me, put something on my head, and somehow now I could understand what they were saying.  Instead of taking us with them, they had decided to leave us on Earth. They said they came from the Pleiades and were surprised to know I was a “rare spiritualized human”.  Their trip was done using a dimensional device that “jumped” the time and space, allowed travel in time and above the speed of light (which I felt impossible).  He told me to call him “Paul”.  They took me to a large screen, and showed me how Earth had looked hundreds of thousands years ago.  I do not know if that was a real recording or a movie though, but there was lots of water, vapor and forests. They told me men had already had an advanced civilization but it destroyed it with a big nuclear war thousands of years ago.  This caused a continent to go under the sea, changed the climate and the atmosphere, which made a non-friendly alien species to go live inside the planet (where?) for some time, until they became extinct.  Because of this catastrophe, they told me their kind had landed a couple of times on Earth mountains, thousands of years ago, and tried to teach the people how they should treat each other and harvest the planet, to prosper in harmony. Then they showed me other civilized planets, other people, and then even showed how Earth would become if we did not change our bellicose ways.  I saw on the screen a devastated contaminated planet surface with no trees in the Northern hemisphere, people working on the ground to collect vegetables in protected plantations (“hothouses”) and put them in transports to “flying cities” that stayed in orbit, using solar energy.  The only ground cities were built under the surface or in artificial mountain caves.  There was still oceans and boats though. Next, they took me to a walk in the ship.  They showed me how they lived in “apartments” with no doors, located at the sides of the cylindrical hull, which made such an enormous curve that the ground appeared almost flat.  There were parks in the middle.  Little beings played with the kids, there were colored trees, small water creeks, and a different type of grass. At the end of the park was the academic-scientific-technical sector.  It contained schools, laboratories, and even a small zoo.  In this zoo I was introduced to many different alien species.  There were birds and fishes, a large intelligent and very strong monkey or gorilla with an awful smell, an enormous bear-like creature the size of an elephant, a large and dangerous mantis-like being, a snake-like being with piercing eyes, a fish being with human-like eyes and a lipless mouth, and even a couple of big and strong human-like intelligent reptile beings. They told me that these reptiles were our alien enemies on Earth, and once used to enslave our people in caves and even eat us.  I even “felt” that one of them was talking to me, that “he was a friendly prisoner I should set free”. Next, they showed me their big ship motor drive near the front, which used something I do not remember now.  They had robots that took care of navigation activities, and just stated where they wanted to go. Finally, they told me to “teach others what I had learned”, and that they would be back.  I was then reunited with the girl and sent back to the point where we had left the car, after being dozed again.  After being put into the car, I woke up and saw then leaving.  The girl finally sit, and yelled that her eyes were hurting a lot.  I decided to take her to a hospital.  ========= CONTINUING THE ORIGINAL TEXT ==========  It took them a long time (10 minutes?) to leave. Then, the cloud literally exploded in light, and slowly got high in the sky above us. It took a few seconds at uniform speed to reach the beginning of the 15-mile long beach stretch (we were near the middle), and then it propelled itself to the beginning and then upwards in the direction of the open sea with a tremendous acceleration to become just a point in the sky, and join two other points. Minutes later, the beach road lights went on again, I could start the engine in the first try, the radio was OK, and we could finally get home. I could never talk to the girl again. Her mother was really worried (read pissed off) since she had to go to the hospital because her right eye had been severely injured – her retina suffered burns and seemed to have “dripped” in the white sclera area. I myself had a very strong headache for almost two weeks but it went off. Months later however, I started having strong “surges of energy” throughout my body (I still do), have some odd dreams, premonitions and feel like floating at night (I still do sometimes). Strangely enough, for some reason (mental block, innocence ?) I can recollect fear but no panic at any moment, besides people made fun every time I tried to tell them what had occurred, so my mind repressed what happened as “unimportant,” and I did not made any effort to remember it clearly until fifteen years ago, during a spiritualist meeting. Spiritualists are a different kind of people who always look to expand the truth – like it or not. As strange is the fact that, thirty years later, I got acquainted with a good friend of my wife, ((male’s name deleted)), that has my own age and is also an engineer, and passed through a very similar experience in the very same week, in almost the same circumstances, and also suffered from similar after effects! He even told me the UFO had been detected by the Navy radars, Rio’s traffic air controllers, and even noted on the news. I can’t remember all these details, but later learned they were true. Anyway, by different paths, we both became spiritualists, and give “energy healing passes,” and are very good friends. One day I shall do a regression to dig more about this. I obviously think the governments know all about this kind of phenomena and there is a huge cover up, which makes me wonder how far from the whole truth is “The Great Conspiracy” of Ernesto Bono. It is clearly much exaggerated (sometimes a total fantasy), and is poorly documented, but if just half of it is true we are in deep trouble!  ----------- PS.  I used to have strong nightmares because of this when I was young.  It took me years to get rid of them.  The details are now foggy to me, but I feel I should tell this to someone.",2018-05-04T00:00:00,,

Prior to recalling abduction. ...I got out of work early and went the long way around when leaving mowhawk plastic.  I saw a disc floating as if it was pointing at me, at a parallel tilted angle.  I was taking off my jacket at the time while driving, so I kind of struggled for a second to get it off. I immediately starting bouncing my head up and down, just to see if i could throw it off, to assume it was some sort of ""controlled hallucination"" as Mr. Hilary Evans refers to it.  Only at the time, I had no idea of such notions, that this ufo could be a manifestation by the greys via implants... Anyway, I bounced my head up and down, thinking that maybe it was a projection on my window, I guess it seemed to real and since it was something no one ever sees 's, it was highly probable that I would question if it really existed.  Perhaps on a subconscious level, I could tell I was a pre-recorded overlaying image because the lighting didn't mesh? idk. At any rate, I saw a ufo in Auburn, right next to A street.  I was stunned that no one else could have seen it yet I suppose it was back far enough, and low enough to where no one could have seen it. Looking at it now, I know that I was suppose to see such a craft considering what happend next. So I hit the gas as I went around the closed building at mow how plastic (building b I think). At the time their was a row of pine trees, with a fence on the other side.  Anyway, the silent daytime disc slowly floated across the sky from right to left, and I was aware that it was going to be out of my visual path soon. I hit the gas and was going about 35 or 40 i want to say, blindly while hoping that someone else didnt decided to leave work.  I suppose if I would have smashed up my car i would have blamed the ufo, considering i was being reckless just so I could keep my eyes on the object. It was black metal, i could see the welding marks, like extensions. It was a full out disc just as everyone has been explaining, and it was, in fact, the size of a football field, yet a perfect circle.  There were even windows deep into the center of the vehicle, as it did not spin.  It was silent as if it was not really there at all. Anyway, I was going very fast, while hunched forward and looking at this daytime disc.  I think some poppy song was on the radio, like poker face or something, I remember 1077 was on at least. Anyway it was just barely out of my reach visually, for about 2 or three seconds.  I had to slow down considering it was a right angle, though really I went as fast as i possibly could. It was odd, because this clearly was their goal, to appear in a place where i could not see them disappear. Anyway, I turned the corner and it was gone.  As if nothing was ever there in the first place. just as many other victims of the greys have claimed, the ufo seemed to disappear the second I rounded the corner.  It was so silent as if it was really some sort of implant manipulation.   What Dr Karla Turner calls ""illusionary tacts"".   What Mr Hilary evans calls ""controlled hallucinations"". When I first saw the disc i told no one.  I felt like perhaps it was the military playing tricks on me.  Then about 2 years later…  I recalled my seventeen-year-old abduction.  A bunch of snippets of blacked out moments, as the greys seemed to somehow have endorphin control. I kid you not, this must have been a warning since they knew I would recall?  Then again, perhaps it was just some other human uploading images via implants?  All I know is, I saw a ufo in October of 2005, and I didn't quite think it was real.  I highly questioned it even though it didn't really look like a 3d graphic, though nowadays it hard to tell. If you asked me, what do you think the purpose of abduction is? I would tell you, I think the ""alien"" greys take our out of body, I call it close encounters of the eighth kind, to have your out of body takin as you as awake, ""associated with having your soul sucked out from you"" - mandrake1975   Anyway, Please visit my abduction music at Pyridoxine Oxide  If you wish. Thanks for giving me a chance to explain.  I know I told mufon but they are kind of a joke, I looked and it seems you don't even have my account.  Auburn 2005 Wa Black Metal Welded Disc, Disappeared conveniently as i rounded the corner, October 21st (I want to say it was the 21st) God bless, screw the greys. Thanks for giving me a chance to be heard, it really means a lot to me.  I hope you dont erase this post like the greys erased my memories involving the seventeen-year-old abduction.

On Saturday morning, May 19th, 2018, while driving my motorcycle North on I-75 in Ohio I observed an object moving from west-north-west to east-south-east at a very high speed. There was no jinking or other manoeuvre.  The flight path was completely straight. I did not note the mile mark, but it was at least an hour out of Piqua, and before the turn to US 30, where I would eventually link up with I-90. I was travelling about 75 mph, and the object moved so quickly, I felt I was standing still. My field of view was about 160 degrees and the object traversed that in about one second. There was no sound (although to be fair, there was a fair bit of wind noise despite the fairing and windshield). It was difficult to gauge height as the object’s shape was nothing with which I was familiar.  But to hazard a guess, probably less than 1000 feet.  But if I had been in my car, the roofline which not have let me see it. It was below the clouds (but it was not overcast – there was plenty of sunshine). There was no sonic boom, so I could conclude the object’s speed was less than Mach 1, but the speed with which it traversed my field of view meant to me that it was travelling between 250 to 400 mph. The object was all gray, similar to USAF aircraft colours, but darker. I could not see engines, nor any obvious wing shape.  There were no lights, there was no trail, it emitted nothing, it stayed the same shape.  The sketch of its outline below is from memory (a day-and-a-half old). (the sketch would not paste in this box - I will send the sketch to Mr. Davenport's e-mail address.)   My outline is poor - the front was a smooth curve (in other words, no implied cockpit – and I did not see one). A few minutes later I spotted an airplane making a turn off in the distance to the West a couple of miles at least. No idea what type – but it had wings and moved as an aircraft moves, and it appeared to be very low. The object I saw was definitely not a commercial aircraft, private propeller driven aircraft, business jet or a missile. It was not a helicopter, nor was it a civilian drone, nor was it a bird, nor a bug, nor an imperfection in my visor – it was up, nor a floater. I am ex-military (Canadian army officer) and I had just been to visit the USAF National Museum for the Memphis Belle exhibit – nothing there would look like what I saw, even the experimentals, when in the air.

Short (3.5'-4') grey skin tone, (2) to my right side (I was unable to move my head).  At least (1) to my left, as I will explain later. I was laying down in the truck at a Pilot truck stop about 9 miles south of Ashtabula, Ohio. I always cover my windows to keep all lights out and lock all the doors. I had backed in, so the front of my truck was facing the storefront. Typically, I'm out by 11:30 pm, but I kept getting a ringing sound in my right ear and was having trouble with my knee (previous injury, unrelated).  The last thing I remember is starting the truck around 12:30 am to let the heat run.  Then, it seemed almost instantly I'm floating on to a table.  The table felt high up, maybe 5-6'. I couldn't move anything.  My head was turned to my right shoulder.  It felt locked there.  I was overwhelmed with fear and could feel myself attempting to cry out for help.  Two very small 3.5-4' grey skinned creatures were to my right that I could see.  Everyone describes gray aliens different than these guys looked.  Their entire body was stubby their heads were almost too short for their eyes, which were very large like other people describe.  It was more over the shape of their face that look different than typical photos you see.  Where are the photos you typically see show them elongated in the face, these two look like it was almost smush down and like they were squinting with wrinkles between the eyes.  I couldn't speak or cry out, but I started to realize what was going on, so I thought in my head (best way to describe) for them to please help me relax.  I understood what was going on but I could not calm down.  Once I thought that, I could move my arms.  So I reached out towards one with my right arm and it held my hand. I did the same with my left arm and although I couldn't see it something grabbed my left hand.  Their hand was very soft warm but cold, and felt kind of like a toddler's hand feels (smooshy).  Once I was holding with both my hands I could not stop smiling. I was completely relaxed and all I could feel was happiness.  The one holding my hand on the right I believe is the one who was talking to me.  It asked if I was sure that I wanted to remember this time, and I told it I was not sure, but I was unsure of why it said this time.  It was then that I realized that I've been visited several times, I believe th! e first time was when I was five. I recalled a small devil like creature coming through the wall to my room.  I had a bunk bed with no bottom bed, and it just floated straight up to my face.  I immediately screamed, my dad came running in and found me in the far corner by my closet door. Being a kid, I told him the devil came for me. Now that I'm older I realize it wasn't a devil it was one of those creatures.  The next instance wasn't until I was 9 to 10 years old.  As I was going upstairs to bed I stopped at the Landing.  Outside of the window there was a saucer-shaped disc silver in color almost Gray with a large orange Dome on top of it. I thought that I had immediately went downstairs to get my dad.  But when I went to go get him to tell him what happened he asked what I was doing still up.  Apparently I had been upstairs for almost an hour, I thought it was only a matter of seconds. After telling my dad what had happened, he grabbed or old VCR camcorder went upstairs with me, and videotaped this craft which was still hovering outside the window!  After about 10 to 15 seconds, it shot off and was gone.  My dad went downstairs and called Airborne Express, which is the local DHL type company that was in business at the time.  He reported the incident to them as well as Wright-Patt Air Force Base.  No one reported seeing it they said that nothing was showing up on radars around that time and that it was probably a coincidence.  However the next morning when we woke up nothing was on the tape whatsoever.  On top of that we had a large pine tree outside of that window.  It was laying on the ground and completely black on one side like it immediately burnt partially and then died.  There was no other scaring to the ground anything like that. Enough of that back to the present.  So I'm laying on the table and I can feel other hands around me on my legs my arms my ear, and then I feel a hard pressure around my genitals.  Like a pump, but with pain like a heat/pain.  I'm completely distracted while all this is going on though because the creature to my left is now alone it's just me and him with my view.  He's telling me all kinds of things about meeting me in the past, but I can't recall what he was saying. I do recall him saying that I would forget things if I wasn't ready, and unfortunately he had no control over whether or not I would remember.  He could only allow me to remember what I wanted to remember.  About the time that I really calm down and stop feeling like I was going to have a heart attack, everyone was gone.  I woke up in the truck laying on my back on top of my blankets.  The truck was still running, but every light on the dash was lit up and alarms were going off on it, so I shut it off thinking it was overheating.  I turned it back on a couple seconds later and everything was fine.  The whole ordeal did not come to me until after I realize the truck was okay.  I immediately started freaking out, and then I heard the same voice again telling me everything was okay remember what I could he would see me soon. I feel like possibly over the years I have developed a friendship possibly with this creature, but I'm not sure of that.  Honestly I'm not really sure I even believe myself, however I can tell you that those other two instances definitely did occur when I was younger and I always wanted to know why they happened.  I've always had a interest in Aliens, but nothing more than any other young boy does.  I've never fantasized about being abducted I've honestly been freaked out about the thought of it, so I don't think that My Mind is Playing Tricks on Me or that I had a dream.  Another good note to add is I do not think that these creatures had a gender.  The only reason why I say that is the voice in my head that was talking to me did not appear to be male or female. I did wake up with a slight nose-bleed my right nostril, I had a headache and continued to have a headache all day. I had very irregular bowel movements and uncomfortable feeling inside my penis almost like pressure in! ternally. I do not drink alcohol. I do not do drugs. And to the best of my knowledge I have no mental illness from either side of my family that is known. I have never been a sleepwalker, and I don't tend to have very many nightmares. I wish I could remember more of what happened. Although I would definitely be terrified if this occurs again, I hope that I can be more open to it when it does though. I know they will be back because I recall the creature saying it would see me again soon. The beginning of the encounter was very intrusive and it felt embarrassing. They seem to just do what they needed to do, and then they comforted me. I will say that I agree with others about the whole pure love feeling. I definitely felt as though it possibly genuinely cared about me. I'm not entirely sure that it did, but it was a very comforting feeling. One other thing I do recall it asking me was if I remembered them fixing me when I ruined my ability to reproduce. I didn't answer then that I'm aware of but I think I know what they were talking about. When I was on a deployment to Iraq, we would restart the radars standing in range of them. We were warned if we did that we could become sterile. So I used to do it everyday joking that I did not need to have any more kids, as I had already had 3 at the time. I did wake up several nights with nosebleeds in Iraq, but in my opinion I believe at least most of those was due to the desert air. I hope my story has helped and some way shape or form, and I would love anyone can give me any information to help me understand what happened. If I have another encounter I will post it. These are not all of the details of this event I'm not very good at writing out things, and I only wanted to ride out what I was sure of.

I was gonna take my phone out to record but as soon as i was getting it out of my back pack, my car started shaking and a loud humming noise started to come from outside. I dropped my phone and the light was practically taking up the view from my windshield and i couldn't see anything so i stopped my car.  For a good 15 seconds my car was almost vibrating and the loud humming noise intensified.  I reached down to get my phone to record but when i looked up the humming stopped and the light was gone.  My car was farther up the street than where i originally thought i stopped my car when the light appeared, which left me confused but i assumed i might've let my foot off the brake and moved forward a bit, but my car couldn't have gone that far as slow as i was going, especially up hill.   At this time i was really confused as to what happened, i thought maybe a plane or trucker came too close to me and just shook my car.  But it lasted almost 20 seconds.

On the night of 3/10/2018, my husband and I were on our back porch and regarding the stars.  We were both looking up and commenting on how bright they were and looking for constellations we are familiar with.   Suddenly, we both zeroed in on what appeared to be a triangle of lights with the bottom missing moving across the sky.  There may have been about 7 or so lights per side, I did not count.  The lights looked about the same color and size as medium-large stars.  It moved north west at a relatively low altitude/speed and disappeared behind the trees.   I could not make out any specific body of a craft, we could just see the lights.  I have seen a lot of airplanes, I know what those look like.  I could see those this evening as well!   This 2/3 triangle could not be explained, and I have never in my life seen anything like it.  It was not normal.   Whatever it was, it was pretty remarkable to see and I am happy to have seen it.

A friend and I were returning home to the North Bend area around 4:15am, on March 11th. We were traveling eastbound on I-90, enjoying the drive with almost no traffic going eastbound. We had just passed the exit for Preston, and headed down the grade and were traveling up the rather long uphill grade of I-90, traveling in the number 3 lane. I had the cruise control on 70mph, as I almost always do when there is little or no traffic. I am a former County and Federal law enforcement officer and always cognizant of other vehicles in my vicinity of travel.  I check my rear view mirror very often for approaching traffic. There were no vehicles traveling eastbound from the time we passed through Issaquah and onto this stretch of I-90. Approximately half way up this rather long grade of I-90, and before exit #25, that exits onto I-18, I glanced in my rear view mirror and was shocked to see what appeared to be two rectangular headlights right on our tail.  I assumed this was a motor vehicle, and there was no noise. I quickly glanced to my right side mirror to make sure no other vehicles were approaching, and was planning on making a quick lane change to get out of the way of this vehicle, then quickly glanced in the rear view mirror, and the lights were gone. This happened so quickly, that I did not change lanes, but we did immediately slow down so I could look behind us to see if a vehicle had swerved off of the freeway on either side. There were no taillights or headlights that I could see on either side of the highway behind us. My passenger and I talked about this, and what had just happened, and I was in bewilderment.  I tried to reason things out as to what had just occurred.  Something in my mind was telling me that something else besides just the 'headlights' was strange, but I could not put my finger on it. Roughly 3 or so minutes later, while still traveling, I got a pounding headache in the center of my head, and this continued well into the following day, even after taking several Aleve tablets. The next day, this incident continued playing through my head, and this is when I realized that the headlights were not only rectangular in shape, but they did NOT emit a forward shining beam, that headlights are designed to do.  Both of these 'headlights' were just lights and did not actually shine into my rear view mirror, but were bright nonetheless, and the rectangular shape of both lights were defined in their shape. I have no explanation of what these lights were, and neither did my passenger. Two days later, I traveled this major highway into Bellevue, and on the way home to North Bend, I carefully checked out both sides of I-90 in the area of this incident to see if there was any indication of a vehicle going off the roadway, there was none. Just a little bit about my background, I was enlisted in the Air Force, and obtained my Commercial pilot license and instrument/seaplane ratings.  I have over 3600 hours in fixed wing aircraft.

At approximately 7:00 pm, Mountain Standard Time, my brother, sister-in-law, husband and myself had stepped out on our back porch to chat a bit.  It was a clear night for viewing the stars.  My brother was looking to the north from our backyard and stated ""what is that?""   We all then proceeded to look north and noticed one circlular shaped object moving very steady and slowly.  The object was engulfed in a steady white light.  We reasoned that it was approximately 5,000 feet high and approximately 5 to 10 miles away.  As we were observing the object we tried to reason that it was a traditional aircraft but my husband and brother (who had both served in the Airforce) knew it was not.  The light continued to glow steadily with no blinking at all.  Furthermore, it seemed to be gliding in a steady way, making no turns whatsoever.   We continued to watch this object fly from the west to the east (towards Boise, Idaho), for approximately 2 minutes and then it just disappeared.  It was there, and then it was not. It seemed to just fade out in front of our eyes.  Also, approximately 5-10 seconds later, after the object disappeared, we noticed an airplane with blinking lights headed in the direction we had last seen this craft.  Unlike the white glowing object, we knew the second craft was a tradional airplane as the lights were blinking.  Not sure exactly what this object was but we all believe that it was not a traditional airplane.  It was quite an experience to see this object.",2018-02-16T00:00:00,43.671729090909096,-116.69207818181818

It was an hour after sunset (17:28 PM) so the sky was dark.  There is a street light directly across the street plus an outside light that was on and the lights from inside.  From this position, close to the house and with those lights it was difficult to see any other objects in the sky or immediately determine the visibility conditions. I happened to look up over the roof of the house towards the south-southwest and I noticed a light which was brighter in the center and spread out to the sides.  It looked similar to moonlight shining through clouds.  My best guess at its exact initial azimuth position would be about 195-205 degrees and about 40-45 degrees above the horizon.   I didn't think it unusual at first and pay much attention to it since I wanted to finish working as quickly as possible.  A few minutes later I noticed that it was still in the same location.  Still I didn't think it unusual and without thinking it through assumed it to be the crescent moon or the planet Venus behind some haze or a thin layer of clouds.  Those are the only two objects that could be bright enough to shine through haze or light clouds anywhere near that part of the sky.  After a few more minutes of it being there I wanted a better look.  I walked around to the west side of the house.  The light was still in about the same part of the sky. This is when it really grabbed my attention since I better seeing conditions in a darker area.I was facing directly  south and realized that it wasn't the Moon  behind a cloud or haze.  It wasn't Venus either which is never in that part of the night sky.  I'm a long time amateur astronomer (40 years) and  know my way around the night sky well.  At times, Venus can be over 40 degrees above the horizon after sunset.  But it is never in that part of the sky where this light was.  The Moon is excluded also.  It was a week past full moon and now in the waning phase. Moonrise didn't occur until 00:09 the next day.  So what was it?  On my phone, I pulled up heavens-above.com sky chart for the current sky to see if somehow I had forgotten a bright star in that area.  This took a total of about 2 minutes.  That part of the sky, contains the constellation Eridanus which has no bright stars.  When I looked up again, the light had moved towards the south and was continuing to do so.  It was now about 20 degrees to the right of  Rigel, (0.18 mag.) the brightest star in Orion, and about its same distance above the horizon.  At that time Rigel was 42 degrees above the horizon.  The light was now clearly moving  but not what I would have called rapidly.  It had a white veil or a mist trailing it that covered 2-3 degrees.  It looked very much like what some call an orb and the veil trailing it much like that of a rocket's exhaust backlit by the sun as it ignites the 2nd stage. I knocked on the glass door but didn't see my parents.  I walked away from the back of the house into the backyard for a better look.  It was dark enough there to see other stars and only then was I able to see  that the sky was clear with excellent visibility.  The wind was calm.  The light continued moving slowly in SSE direction with the white veil trailing it at about the speed of a commercial jet nearing  cruising altitude.  I know that the size, altitude and speed of an object are difficult to determine against an open sky with no objects for comparison.  I won't attempt to do that here.  I recorded some video with my phone but by then it was too dim to show up.

The cloud was quite bright and appeared to be about 3 football stadiums in size, maybe 2000 to 3000 feet AGL.  The crowd appeared to be about 5 miles away due south from where I was. it appeared as though either the moon or an aircraft was behind the cloud and illuminating it.  The light source was behind the top of one tree,  I could see light through the branches, but not make out what exactly the light was. I continued to walk towards the wash and continued to look at the cloud. About 10 seconds later the cloud came into view better. I noticed that it had a fan shape and could start to see more of the light source through the branches. The cloud was a wispy light cloud that appeared to be in a kind of Japanese fan shape. Approximately 5 to 10 seconds later the entire cloud and light source came into view. The light was centered in the corner of the fan, however still obscured by the branches and the cloud. Approximately 5 seconds later, I came to the end of the road and could get a more clear look at the cloud.  The cloud had started to dissipate and the light dim. No more than 3-5 seconds later the cloud had shrunk to half of its size and the light dimmed considerable. No more than 3-5 seconds later than that there was nothing in the sky where I had been looking. It was a cold, clear, crisp light with no other fog, clouds or obscuration. The moon had not yet risen, I did not notice any helicopters, aircraft or weather balloons in the proximity that may of created the light source.

One day in the spring of 1983, in the month of May, I hiked due east of the small fishing village of Paleohora, on the southwest coast of the island of Crete in Greece. My destination was a remote, secluded beach that is located about a one hour hike from the village.  To the north of the beach there is a high, straight, cliff and a ravine running up into the mountains.  The ravine is a somewhat narrow gorge that is the location of an unusual stairway like ascent.  With widely spaced, large stair-like rock formations, leading up into the mountains.  The ravine itself is lined with numerous caves.  It bears a remarkable resemblance to a stairway that was created over the millennia by the flow of water from the mountains, but was now dry. I climbed up into one of the caves on the right side of the ravine that is a short hike up from the coast and fell asleep. I awoke around 3 in the morning, sat up in a cross-legged position, and as soon as I did, a somewhat large, white light, with a searchlight-like beam proceeding from the front of it, passed by slowly, heading downhill, towards the coast. It was as if something had woke me from a sound sleep so that I would see the unusual object.

Two F-18 Hornets alerted to UFO in Pacific that had been dogging the USS Princeton for two weeks. F-18's tried to intercept and object dove from 80,000 feet to 20,000' and hovered over ocean and either dropped out of radar range or shot straight back up.   The radio operator on the USS Princeton instructed Commander Fravor and Commander Slaight to investigate.  The two fighter planes headed toward the objects.  The Princeton alerted them as they closed in, but when they arrived at “merge plot” with the object, so close that the Princeton could not tell which were the objects and which were the fighter jets, neither Commander Fravor nor Commander Slaight could see anything at first.  There was nothing on their radars.    Then, Commander Fravor looked down to the sea. It was calm that day, but the waves were breaking over something that was just below the surface.  Whatever it was, it was big enough to cause the sea to churn. Hovering 50 feet above the churn was an aircraft of some kind, whitish, that was around 40 feet long and oval in shape.  The craft was jumping around erratically, staying over the wave disturbance but not moving in any specific direction, Commander Fravor said.  The disturbance looked like frothy waves and foam, as if the water were boiling.  Commander Fravor began a circular descent to get a closer look, but as he got nearer the object began ascending toward him.  It was almost as if it were coming to meet him halfway, he said.  Commander Fravor abandoned his slow circular descent and headed straight for the object.  But then the object peeled away. “It accelerated like nothing I’ve ever seen,” he said in the interview.  He was, he said, “pretty weirded out.”  The two fighter jets then conferred with the operations officer on the Princeton and were told to head to a rendezvous point 60 miles away, called the cap point, in aviation parlance.  They were en route and closing in when the Princeton radioed again.  Radar had again! picked up the strange aircraft.  “Sir, you won’t believe it,” the radio operator said, “but that thing is at your cap point.” “We were at least 40 miles away, and in less than a minute this thing was already at our cap point,” Commander Fravor, who has since retired from the Navy, said in the interview.  By the time the two fighter jets arrived at the rendezvous point, the object had disappeared.  The fighter jets returned to the Nimitz.

This sighting took place somewhere in North or Northeast Raleigh, North Carolina. I lived there with my girlfriend at the time for a short while and since I rarely ventured out of the house, I was unfamiliar with the area, so I'll try to give my best recollection involving where we might have been when I saw this UFO. We're traveling in my girlfriend's car on what I believe was Spring of 2012.  She was driving. I'm in the passenger seat and there was no one else besides us in the car.  As we're moving I was looking at all the scenery and it was a beautiful day.  In my peripheral vision, I noticed a large passenger jet somewhat high in the sky.  The jet wasn't low. I'd wager it was flying at roughly 10-20,000 feet. That's when I saw it. Just in front of the jet's path looked to what I can only describe as an Oil Drum or a dark, almost black-looking cylinder, upright like an oil drum.  Now it was hard to tell but it looked like it was up there really close to this jet which was heading towards it. The windows in the car were up so I heard no noise.  It just seemed to hang there, motionless in the sky.  I was excited so I told my girlfriend and she wanted to see it and asked where it was.  I said, ""It's up there, by that plane!""  Unfortunately, she couldn't look as she was driving.  I probably looked at this thing for about a minute, no more.  As we drove some trees blocked my view.  We pulled up to a traffic light and that's when I looked up again only this time all I could see was the jet and no cylinder. To give an idea of the sizes of this jet and cylinder, at arm's length, the jet would have been about the size of my thumb and the cylinder was about 1/3 that size.  I wish I could give more information but the sighting was brief. Just one last thing.  As I said, I was unfamiliar with the area, but I know we used to live a mile west of Route 1, a.k.a. (Capital Blvd).  We lived off of Durant road between Capital Blvd. and Falls of Neuse Rd.  The sighting was not too far from this area.  I wish I could tell you the name of the road we were on, but all I can tell you is we were no more than 5 miles from our house on our way to get a burger from this great little burger and hotdog place where you walk up to the window and they take your order.  When it's ready they call your number, go up to the window, get your food, and then we would just sit in our car and eat.  That's the best description I can give as, yet again, I can't remember the name of the place!",2018-04-26T00:00:00,35.81800885085575,-78.64441853300734

He made a quick turn right and raced up the street about a half mile maybe less to the Super America store.  He parked in f! ront and the craft went overhead and up in the sky. It took the appearance of a star.  He went inside and got something to drink and he told the cashier about something following him.  He went outside and looked up and it was still there. He got in his car and proceeded to make a right turn on US 127 South.  The craft went from being a star into being some type of ship.  It was within 30 yards from his passenger side window on the right.  It hovered for maybe 10 seconds and slowly proceeded south up the street.  He didn't remember anything until he pulled up at home to park his car.  He had lost 20 minutes somewhere.  The craft went to the western sky and took the appearance of a star again.  He ran inside for a few minutes and then came back out to see if it was still there.  It was and it looked like an orange star.  He got his phone and got about 49 seconds of video.

We hooked up with a lady who was selling UFO’s tours for $90.  So this lady and another couple and my wife and I got in a large SUV and travelled a short distance out of town so as to get away from ambient city lights. We then got out of the SUV just after dark and everyone grabbed a folding chair.  Our guide brought a suitcase with her.  We walked to the top of a hill and sat down in a straight line looking to the north. I should mention that my wife who is a Filipina misunderstood my intentions but she followed me obediently because of her culture.  She later revealed to me that she thought we were going to go for a ride in a UFO and she was really scared but she relaxed once we sat down. Now what happens next; our hostess gave each of us a 3rd generation night vision goggles and instruction on how to use them.  In addition one of us at all times had a high power green laser pointer that we used to direct our view so we could all see the same object at the same time. Over the next 90 minutes the five of us all observed the same UFO’s at the same time.   Therefore, we were validating our observations to each other. In total we each saw the same 36 UFO’s at the same time. When we got back home of course we had to tell everyone what we had seen.  So at the next party (her family has a lot of these parties) we told everyone what we had witnessed.   Not one of our family members or our friends who were there believed what we told them. I should also say that in addition we also saw one of the planets, maybe Mars, I am not sure and meteorites crashing thru the atmosphere and a couple of planes circling overhead, we were close to a small airport.  The night vision goggles are very powerful.",2018-05-04T00:00:00,,

Each sighting was the same reddish-orange color, with a duration of between two and ten seconds per sighting.  There were no booms or any other discernible sounds accompanying any of the sightings.  There was little movement observed – perhaps a slight drift but the lights seemed to be mostly stationary.  There were also no aircraft observed during the sightings, but several jets and helicopters were observed approximately 10-20 minutes after the last sighting. The first sighting was about 9:30 p.m.  My mom and I were on the hotel balcony and we witnessed several extremely bright “orbs” that lit up over the ocean for approximately two seconds.  They seemed to be fairly close to the shore.  I saw four, my mom saw three.  This was by far the brightest sighting of the orbs we had that night.  Unfortunately, I did not capture this sighting on video. The next two sightings occurred at 9:35 and 9:38.  I captured both of these on video.  Each of these two sightings were of what seemed to be a solitary orb ejecting another orb.  The original orb would fade out and the ejected orb would eject another orb before fading out.  These seemed to be much further out over the ocean – maybe as far out as a mile but difficult to say with certainty. At around 9:43 another appeared.  I was trying to mount my camera phone (iPhone 6s) to the tripod while filming and accidentally switched it from video mode to picture mode.  I ended up with several blurry pictures, but one that was somewhat clear.  I included this picture in the video.  I didn’t get a very good look at this orb as I was frantically trying to get my phone mounted. The last sighting was around 9:50 and it seemed to be very far out to sea.  It blinked out just before I had the chance to get any footage of it. My family has been vacationing at Myrtle Beach for years.  I had heard that this was a UFO hot spot and I had always hoped to see the strange light phenomenon the locals were talking about.  I never saw anything out of the ordinary in any of my previous vacations there.  I guess I just got lucky – because this time I did!

The flight that left O'Hare continued on without incident I continued to watch the object heading east and  coming towards me wanting to see what this object really was and realizing it was at a higher altitude. As it approach I could faintly see a solid object then a reflection of sun turning it into a bright pin point of light much like a star.  From my vantage point, I would say this object was a mile north of O'Hare at an altitude of seven to ten thousand feet when it stopped and stayed in place. I could not make out what I was looking at.  The weather was mostly clear with just a few small clouds around the area After minutes in place it moved south towards O'Hare about a mile then slowly climbed all the time looking like a bright star.  I have no idea what this object I witnessed was.  After this sighting, I noticed that departures to the north stopped.  I thought that air traffic control may be trying to figure this out.

There were no flashing or pulsing lights and no sound.  It just a bright solid white light a little bigger and brighter than the surrounding stationary stars and it steadily moved very slowly across the entire arc of the sky in a straight line from southwest to northeast in about two minutes.  After it was out of sight my experience of the chills ceased and it felt like 70 degrees Fahrenheit should.   Although I mysteriously developed the chills during the sighting, I can report zero feelings of apprehension or fear.  In fact it was as if I had no feelings about the sighting at all (and it is my fourth UFO sighting in my 43 years of life).",2018-05-31T00:00:00,40.215994779116464,-85.41153895582329

At first I thought it could be a satellite, (way up there,) but it slowly, gained speed. I then noticed a brighter and much bigger light, in front of the object.  They appeared to be moving in tandem, same heading, (East to North East,) same speed. I was at that time, gauging distance (Are these lights at as high of an altitude as I think?)  Then the two objects passed far above a very high, sparse cloud.  It was then that I was surprised as they gained speed, one following the other.  Their incredible speed was not consistent with my knowledge of military or civilian A/C capability.  Then the trailing object stopped and its light dimmed abruptly.  (I thought that it had disappeared, so my eyes followed the other object.)  The much brighter, larger object continued down the horizon. After following the path of the bigger light with my eyes, I looked back (up) at the area where the smaller object seemed to disappear.

As soon as my car was turned and going up the hill, I noticed two flickering bright white lights with a pale orange light in the middle, all in a horizontal row, moving super-fast towards my street above the bare tree branches.  It became so large so fast as it moved that I can’t even estimate how fast it was going to morph from the original size I saw to what it became. It moved in a smooth, forward, slightly descending south-east direction and then just abruptly stopped above the tree line between my house and the house next door.  It hovered there motionless and silent (my car window was down).  I’m not sure about its altitude but maybe about 200 to 400 feet.  The sky wasn’t too dark and had random thick clouds, but the object was immobile in plain sight and not in any cloud.  My stopped car was in the middle of the street in front of my house watching it move towards me right before the object stopped and hovered. I could clearly see a flat oval shape like an ellipse with three visible lights that had a weird quality…they weren’t like bright aircraft lights but had a more hazy flickering look and then became steady as it hovered.  I jumped out of the car and just stood in the street watching it for about three seconds and then it seemed to almost evaporate!  It literally became transparent in about 1-2 seconds as it suddenly moved in a sideways direction for a split second and then totally disappeared. I got back into my car and drove up the street to see if I could view it again above or behind other houses, but couldn’t find it.  I was out there for about another minute when I saw something glowing and moving in one of the thick clouds off to the east about twenty times the height where it had first hovered. It moved around in an odd manner in that huge cloud then disappeared again.  I ran into the house, put my groceries away which took about 2 minutes, and then ran back outside into the street looking in all directions.   About five to six minutes later, coming north-east from the Boston direction, I saw a helicopter moving fast towards where I was and going east toward the ocean where I last saw the glowing in the clouds. The helicopter moved into a cloud and I could see its distinct very bright white search light coming from its front, and the helicopter seemed to be looking for something as it moved along towards the east. Then I lost sight of it because of the trees and my location on the lower part of the hill. I waited for another ten minutes but didn’t see anything else.

I tried to go back to sleep but realized there was something lighting up my room.  Again, tried to ignore the light thinking it was a neighbor going to work or something, but 20 minutes later I am still trying to get to sleep and the light was so bright I could see it flashing even though my eyes were closed. I got out of bed and crept around the dark room looking outside for signs of someone messing with me, or a car, etc - nothing.

I realized the light was only on one side of the room, in the window , illuminating it in the same way a lightning bug would, except it illuminated the whole 5 feet of window space/frame.  I looked all around inside the room, in the windowsill, and what I could see from the window, nothing but the uphill sight of trees with so much snow I can see anything that moves out there, but saw nothing and heard nothing. At this point I got scared, because I realized the only place it could be coming from that I couldn’t see, was directly underneath the window: a place I couldn’t see unless I went outside and I was too scared.  The next day, though, I checked and there were no footsteps or marks in the snow so that wasn’t where the light was coming from. I have blue solar lights out there, but this light was green like christmas light green. The light was on steady for 10 seconds, off for 5, and it lasted so long that after not being able to find the cause I got into bed with a knife and just sat listening for sounds, to get up and react to, nothing but the light, and I fell asleep counting the seconds of the light pulses, strangely seeing it with my eyes closed.

We had been in the air for approximately 90 minutes (4:00 PM PDT) so we were at our cruising altitude of 36,000 to 40,000 ft and I would guess we were somewhere over Arizona in a NE direction.  We were sitting on the right side of the plane in row 5 or 6 and I was sitting in the window seat.   I looked out the window and I noticed a strange form that was flying alongside the plane and appeared to be looking at me.  It was dark/grayish (almost black) in color and while it had defined boundaries to it shape it appeared to be fluidlike in substance.  It was traveling alongside the plane and at the same time it was moving in an undulating fashion of up/down and side to side as a snake slithers but mixed in with that was the up/down of a roller coaster – moving in all directions at once. The form had facial like features and appeared to be looking at me.  Best guess is that it was less than 100 feet from the plane and there was no observable noise that was heard during this event.  The form gathered itself vertically and pulled itself from a length of seven feet into a form that was 12-18 inches in length.  It was in the shape of a cylinder much like a gallon of paint and the facial portion of it was still looking at me.  It maintained this form for approx. 2-3 seconds and then it turned southwest and disappeared at rocket speed in less than two seconds.  I was unable to snap any photos and had no knowledge than anyone else observed what I had observed.  I did tell my wife, who was sitting in the aisle seat that I had seen something strange out the window. My thought was that I would speak to the pilots when we landed at BWI and inquire as to whether they had seen what I had seen.  Upon landing @ BWI, I realized that the pilots had paperwork/reports to file and would be tied up for a while in the cockpit and that I couldn’t hold up the line of passengers who were ready to get off the plane after being inside it for almost five hours. As we stood up to leave the plane, I did tell my wife that I wish that I had gotten a picture of what I had seen.  At this time, the two ladies that were in the row behind my wife and I heard what I said about wishing that I had taken a picture and they excitedly said to me “You saw it too”!  I replied yes, I had, and we chatted briefly.  They agreed with what I described and saw the same phenomenon that I have detailed here.  Here is where I made another mistake by not getting the name of either one of them. I have a close friend who is a retired SWA pilot.  I spoke to him last night, 3/18/2018, and he is going to try to attempt to learn the names of the pilot and co-pilot of SWA Flight 612 on 3/12/2018.  If he is successful, he will contact them and hopefully give them my contact info or in a worst-case situation, detail to them what I have described here. Occurred approximately 4:05-4-15 PM PDT.  I wrote the below description in the notes of my phone within 10 minutes of the above described incident. ""Something strange/weird out plane window.  Looked like flock of martins (birds), or huge swarm of bugs.  Couldn’t get phone unlocked to get picture.  Was moving as big black blob, but suddenly swooped up & was gone in an instant the opposite direction that we are heading.  Was near our same altitude.  Women sitting behind us confirmed what I saw.

It would be something beyond my capabilities as a photographer to stage the photos using an editing program because of the snow that covers the image.  I've never taken drugs/used alcohol, but I was feeling a bit disoriented (I had accidentally taken the bus a stop past mine and had to backtrack a mile and a half to my destination).  I'm looking to keep my identity anonymous, so I have nothing to gain from reporting the experience, and I myself am not a believer in these sorts of things, but having a first hand experience that I can't rationalize perplexes me.   The only reason that I'm taking time to report the incident is that I feel it could be explained by someone more qualified, or else useful to the people that keep track of these strange occurrences.",2018-03-23T00:00:00,40.03326710353867,-76.30302319790302

My husband and I saw a large bright aircraft in the southern New Mexico sky near San Lorenzo tonight, traveling east at around 7:20 p.m..  It was bright enough to be moonlight, but the moon was not up yet.  It looked about the size of Saturn when it is closest to the earth, but it kept increasing in size, then we noticed two sections of lights on either side that looked like searchlights on a VERY high flying plane.  We continued watching, then suddenly it shifted into something that looked like a rocket that had separated from its fuel source, then it “bloomed” into a large gaseous cloud that had two distinct sections that emerged out of the areas where the “searchlights” had been.  The gaseous cloud grew to occupy a large section of the southern sky, then merged into one big balloon shape preceded by two distinct horizontal stripes of light as it reached the southeastern horizon.  As the gaseous cloud faded, two of our neighbors came up and said they had also seen the whole event, from the bright light with “searchlight” beams of light emitting from it, through the visual separation into two sections, to the “blooming of the gas cloud” and its subsequent disappearance in the east, preceded by two stripes of light. Did SpaceX fall out of the sky tonight????  My husband has been an astronomy professor for the past 30 years and has never seen anything like this in the night sky.  This is how he described it to his colleagues when he inquired if they had seen it:  There was a strange elongated bright light to the west (near Fomalhaut at about 7:30pm. As it got closer it drifted to the south and then fired(?) rockets for a few minutes then they shut off. At first the rocket plumes (reflected sunlight I assumed) were short and out to the side of its travel. I interpreted these as some sort of lateral thruster or azimuth control. Then the rear engines lit off and created a huge plume (20-30 deg) across the southern sky (in Eridanus mostly so pretty far south even from here). Very bright, fan shaped and very pretty. After a while the plume disconnected from the bright point at its apex and then faded slowly away. The bright point( : ) continued in a SE direction and was lost below the southern hills from our house. I assume it was trying for a safe place to land. I hope it did not hit anyone.

That part of the event lasted about 5 to 6 minutes.

Very bright, strong, v-shaped light beam.  Since it was much closer to me at that point and because it turned on a light, I was able to see the air disturbance.  The fog was almost phosphorescent, also flaring out in a dramatic v-shape.  Then all of it just kind of became indistinct (turned its lights down?) and disappeared completely.  The fog it left in its wake became distorted and from the pattern of the fog (there was a stream going downward) either the craft went down toward Earth or shot straight up. Then at 8:08pm, with still no substantial cloud build-up, there was a sudden flash of light.  At this point I was standing on my back patio, which faces East. The kicker is, I texted a friend who lives over by the foothills (about 11 miles west of me) and they had seen the craft as well.  Her neighbor was outside on her porch and had also seen what she thought was the flare of fireworks at the time I saw the ‘lightning’ flash. ((NUFORC Note:  Space X booster venting fuel??

Driving home from work at approximately 6:30 PM EST down highway 495 south in Bolton, MA, I saw some very bright white lights up over the highway ahead of me off to the left.  I thought they were landing lights from a plane coming toward me.  It was probably about 500' ft. up and moving very slow.  From left to right it looked like a about four lights strung together in a row, but were wider than what looked like a typical smaller aircraft at a low altitude.   As I got closer, the object kept moving off to the left, and then it seemed like there were three very bright lights moving together in a tight formation.  I tried to think if maybe they were helicopters or maybe military planes, but they were too low, slow and tight together.   Then, the light furthest to the left disappeared.  Thinking it may be moving behind a cloud, I waited for the other two lights to disappear too.  Not so.   By now I had pulled up parallel to object which was to my left.  The whole time I kept wai! ting to see the reveal of the flashing of the tell-tale FAA lights as I moved past the angle of the landing lights.  Now having seen this object from more than one angle there were absolutely no flashing FAA lights whatsoever.  I could now see that these three lights must have been something flying in formation.  Then I saw a red light appear between the three white lights.  Thinking this was now debunked I realized the red light in the middle wasn't flashing but slowly pulsing.  Dimming and getting brighter.  At this point I could see I was looking up underneath the craft.  The three white lights were in the shape of a perfect triangle with the red light smack in the middle.  I could make out from the backdrop in the sky that this was a solid, triangular craft.  It was hard to see but definitive.  The white lights on the corner of the triangle were rounded and not sharp.  I could also see underneath the craft it had sort of dim metallic shine but it was faint.  This object looked exactly like the photo of the Belgian wave black triangle seen in the 90's  There were NO flashing FAA lights on this craft anywhere.

I had enough time to notice the craft, process that they weren’t normal, retrieve my phone, access the camera, and take two pictures.  Yes, this story is corroborated with pictures.

Circular I had gone for a walk after dinner at my parent's cottage and headed towards an empty campsite, wherein they had been undergoing some renovations and recently built a basketball court, which I felt like shooting some hoops.  After a few shots, I looked up at the sky to notice a very bright light.  Thinking it to be a plane, I continued to watch it.  Although it left no contrails, no sound and did not appear to be moving.  It was at the altitude of a hobby craft but I could not discern a particular shape.  This was about 1850 in the evening, the sun was still up and not a cloud or star in the sky. I walked back to our cottage while keeping a close eye on the craft so not to lose sight of it.  Upon my return I prompted my father to take out his phone and open the ""Sky Map"" app so we could figure what this was, while I grabbed the telescope. Using a 26mm doubler I focused in on the craft and was shocked.  It was perfectly round, had a golden/purplish hue around it, while the center was almost transparent and had a shimmer of what looked to be ripples of light in the middle.  While with the naked eye, it did not seem to move, yet through the telescope, I would have to adjust it to follow it. My father and sister both looked through and were stumped as to what it could be, and offered suggestions such as the ISS or a weather balloon.  However, my fathers phone was not responding to any prompts and my battery was near dead; I had managed to take a photograph of it with my phone and could not get a clearer image through the telescope. Two neighbours further down the way came by and looked at it.  They were both somewhat drunk and almost nonplussed by it.  My dad, sister and I continued to watch it for another 20 minutes until we lost sight of it over the treeline.  We have some hobby crafts that fly to and from the lakes in the region, but this was certainly not one of them.  I noticed it in the West, and it flew South.  Over an area that would take a Cessna aircraft about 1 minute to fly over, this object took 25 minutes. The next day, still wondering what I had seen, I went for a walk past the campsite and along an ATV trail.  About 3km from where I had the original sighting, I stopped, heard a small sound and looked up to see a very fast, very black craft whoosh over me and turn abruptly.  It resmebled that of a goose, with a long neck and curved wings, but geese cannot glide.  I am willing to concede it may have been a drone, but we are nowhere near a military or airforce base, and the closest airport is some 80km away and mostly caters to hobby craft. About a month prior to this event(s), I was at the cottage by myself and looking out over the water when I had noticed a blinking red orb.  It ""blinked"" twice in a span of 5 minutes.   It could've been a flare but stayed and blinked in the same place and had no trail.  It was quite cloudy that night, and appeared over an area where there is an abandoned farm.",2018-04-26T00:00:00,,

It was a clear cold night in November of 1967.  I was living in the upstate New York town of Saratoga Springs.  My two older brothers and I were Boy Scouts and my father was our scout troop leader.  We were just returning home after a troop meeting in town.   As we came to a stop at the curb in front of our house, two lights in the sky over the house caught my eye - a red light and a green light.  They were small, appearing to be spaced a couple feet apart horizontally.  Immediately I thought to myself, “Piper Cub, Cessna; running lights, red starboard, green port side. (sic.  Red light is on port/left side; green is on starboard/right side)  Okay, wonder if there’s anything to snack on tonight?”   I exited my father’s station wagon, shut the door and looked up again to see the lights were still there, though a bit farther apart as if whatever it was had descended in altitude.  They were standing still hovering there.  My mind was rapidly abandoning the fixed wing aircraft narrative as I tried to reconcile the fact that the lights were hovering and there was no sound to be heard.  Were it an airplane, given the space between the lights, I’d have put it at no more than two hundred feet overhead.  All this mental processing was taking place rapidly and I called to my older brother who was coming around the front of the station wagon and told him to come look at this.  My father and our assistant scout master, ((male name deleted)), were already going through the front door into the house to sit down, have a smoke and shoot the breeze. My brother and I stared silently at the lights for a what may only been thirty to forty-five seconds.  The night sky was quite black, the stars bright, but I could not see anything discreet between the lights. In the next moment, those lights began to drift off to our right, which was to the south as we stood.  The lights moved in unison in a gentle sine wave, low amplitude, low frequency.  Then the lights accelerated gaining amplitude and frequency in a split second, merging into a single point of light, cutting a long trail of light as if on an oscilloscope, and disappeared all the way out to the vanishing point to the south. My brother and I burst into astonished excitement, neither of us able to believe what we’d just seen.  We ran into the house, both shouting to my father and the assistant scoutmaster, Roger, that we just saw a UFO.  While we were desperately trying to describe what we saw, my father pulled out his imaginary violin and in a mocking way, began playing us his “tell me another one” song.  ((male name deleted)) was sitting silent and motionless in an easy chair next to my father’s chair. ((male name deleted)) was an active duty Air Force ((senior)) sergeant in charge at the local radar tracking site on the southern edge of town at that time.  He sat there in the living room, silent, one elbow on the arm of the chair, head propped on his thumb and forefinger, cigarette in the other hand.  As I turned to look at him, he took a drag on his cigarette, narrowed his eyes and slowly nodded to me a silent “Yes.”   Note:  The pattern of flight this craft exhibited closely matches that of a UFO seen by Mr. Peter Davenport as a child.  His description is relayed in a podcast of a presentation he gave at an Ozark Mountain UFO Conference.  I just now watched that podcast and was compelled to offer this account.  I've heard only one other such description of this pattern of motion as a UFO departs a location. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",,43.0535,-73.7517

My mother woke me at one a.m. and we went outside to watch for meteors.   After an hour or so I was restless and walking from the front yard across the street to the field.  The time was in-between two and three in the morning I noticed something over the tree tops to the west and my mother told me it had to be a plane from toward the airport NW of us. But this thing kept moving toward us very slowly, I was one of those kids who knew all about airplanes and helicopters and all the things military a kid could read about, My mother even became concerned with it. She made me come back in my yard. It took about 40 minutes for this thing to appear to the west and disappear to the east. There was light traffic on I-35 but there was traffic. The only to the west was the water tower in the field. We watched the entire time, when it reached our place it was large enough to block out the tank of the water tower, it was between us and the tower. It made no noise, and it seemed to hover for a good five minutes blocking out the tower, The sounds of cars on gthe interstate was all we heard. There was no disturbance in the air like a helicopter would make. The craft was saucer shaped and had lights of many colors right in the middle. I don't know if the center was turning or the lights were just turning on and off and changing colors so rapidly it made it look like the center was rotating. It was the absolute quiet that actually scared my mother. The craft could not have been more than a hundred or so feet in the air. I had no film anywhere in the house so we could not take pictures. As it was directly across from our house I remember my mother hanging on to arm where I could not go out closer to it. I wanted to see underneath it. At this point she held on to me until it slowly and quietly traveled over I-35. We were so close it had to know we were there watching it.  The next day I went to all the neighbors for blocks and asked if they had heard or seen anything. My mother allowed me to report this to the K O M A radio station there in the then south part of Moore. I spoke with the station manager who commented on how precise and accurate my story was. when I finished I asked him if anyone else had reported this. He told me there were several others who reported this event that lived in the Moore area and even people who were on I-35 had called in passing through. Nothing ever came from this and no one ever came to speak with my mom and I. I see lots of reports of things in the sky around the Moore Oklahoma area even now.

It was a clear, sunny day and it wasn't windy.  I was not under the influence of drugs (including prescription drugs) or alcohol. I was approximately 14 years old. I was in my backyard shooting in an easterly direction at a target with a pellet rifle.  This was a highly powerful, break barrel .22 caliber model that was capable of tearing melons to shreds. In my peripheral vision I saw a bird flying from the east in to a cubic hedge in my backyard, which stood about 6 feet tall and was six feet long on every side.  I walked over to the hedge and saw that the bird was perched on a twig inside the hedge, beak pointing west, or directly toward me.  The bird was light grey and not particularly large.  This hedge wasn't in good condition and was hollowed out on the inside by animals so I had a clear view of the bird. Me being an unsupervised punk with a pellet rifle, I decided to shoot the bird. I realize it is wrong and illegal, and I would never do something like this again. I raised my rifle and shot the bird directly in the chest.  The bird recoiled, but remained perched on the twig, staring at me. Several seconds pass. I load another pellet in to the rifle and put the muzzle within two inches of the bird's chest.  A shot rings out and the bird remains perched on the twig unharmed and looking directly in to my eyes.  This awful process repeats itself over and over again. Finally, I load a seventh pellet in to the rifle.  The muzzle is touching the bird's body when the trigger is pulled.  The bird recoils but stands unfazed.  At this point I am overwhelmed with a sense of confusion, shame and astonishment.  I take a few steps back and the bird and I stare at each other for what felt like an eternity.  I walk away and the bird flies in to the western sky, having been shot 7 times in the chest with a high-powered pellet rifle. I never told anyone about this experience because I would have been punished for it.  For years I simply assumed this was a supernatural event that could never be explained.  However, one might assume:   1.)  The bird was not actually a natural bird at all, but a bird-like object under remote control. 2.)  It was armored. I never made these assumptions at the time, however. This happened not too far from Dyess AFB. Some days prior to this incident a radio alarm clock malfunctioned at night and received transmissions outside the ordinary FM/AM range, including air traffic and cellular phone communications.  The radio then made a loud hissing and screeching noise and blew out, and never functioned again.

My sighting occurred in a sparsely populated area approximately 12 miles southeast of Kanab, Utah, at about 9:45 p.m. on 9 January 2011.  My property had two small cabins, and at around 9:40 that evening I needed to get something from the second cabin, which was approximately 300 feet away.  The night was very dark and as I walked over to the second cabin on the dirt road that connected them I illuminated my path with a small flashlight.  I was accompanied by ten feral cats that lived on the property and walked with me whenever I went outside. When I reached the other cabin the cats waited for me by the front doorstep as I entered and searched for the item I wanted.  I was in the cabin between 2 and 3 minutes.  I then turned out the cabin lights, locked the door, and started walking around the cabin to the road, the ten cats preceding me.  I was looking at the ground where my small flashlight illuminated my path so I would not trip on anything.  As the cats went around the corner of the cabin I had just left they all suddenly halted, and perforce I had to stop too.  I glanced up and saw that the dirt road to the east of the cabin was brightly illuminated for an area about 60 feet by 25 feet.  Most of the illuminated area was empty dirt road, but it also encompassed my solar well pump and a pile of old lumber and fencing. My first thought was to worry that someone had trespassed onto the property, but I dismissed this thought almost immediately, for the property was well-fenced and the only road into it barred by two chained and locked gates.  I furthermore realized the tall sagebrush edging the illuminated road were not casting long shadows and that the illumination must be coming from above.  These thoughts took only a second or two to flash through my mind and I then looked up and saw an oval-shaped craft hovering above my property (I would estimate about 500 feet above ground).  It was very dark, but the outer edges of the craft were illuminated by soft white light, and about 2/3 of the way in there was a ring of about 8-10 unblinking red lights.  As far as I could tell given the darkness of the night the under-surface of the craft was smooth, although I had the impression the red lights were on a smaller portion of the craft that extended below the main part.  The craft made no sound whatsoev! er. I stood looking at the craft for about 45 seconds to a minute, the ten cats all standing stock-still in front of me.  Then suddenly the bright light on the road vanished, the craft rose straight up, accelerated to the north and was gone, making no sound at all.  The time that elapsed between the light on the road vanishing and the disappearance of the craft was between 2 and 3 seconds.  I have never seen anything move that fast.  The cats now walked forward and I followed them back to the main cabin.   I'm a trained scientist (biology), but I was unnerved enough by the experience that when I reached the main cabin I called a trusted friend, told her what had happened, and ended my account by saying, only half-facetiously, “If I vanish tonight you’ll know they came back for me.” ((NUFORC Note:  We have contacted a local major newspaper in Yakima, WA, in attempt to corroborate some of the claims made in the report.

I've filmed lanterns before and they will emit a swaying, flickering light from inside.  Also, lanterns will rise in altitude.  These red lights kept their same altitude; 40 to 50 feet above the ground. They were flying (west) close together for 5 blocks,  (They also kept up with my speed increase).   They started spreading out and heading North, when I came back out with my camera and filmed them, they were continuing North, then completely disappeared; lanterns don't do that.  That's when I drove to the other side of my addition to see if there were anymore.  I saw one in the sky and it disappeared as I started to film.   I've had several UFO/UAP  experiences and only reported two sightings, this one with y'all and one with MUFON that happened in 1970, (quite significant).  I've been filming since 2012 and have captured many anomalies with my camera and night vision.  In 2016 I started my own Meetup Group, OKC UFO.  It has been therapeutic for me and other members, as we need an outlet to share our experiences and try to understand the UFO phenomena.  Makes life interesting, defies logic and challenges our reality for sure! Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",2018-01-25T00:00:00,35.47186177914111,-97.52630349693251

At approximately 6:30 am on 3/13/18, I walked out to my front yard, after letting our dog outside, to close our gate that had been left open all night.  After closing the gate, I noticed a flash of bright light up in the sky, out of the corner of my eye.  I focused my attention to the area where I saw the light and saw it flash again.  Even though the object was very high in the sky (much higher than a passenger jet flies) it was almost like a very bright spotlight shining down on me.  It is probably the brightest light I have ever seen in the sky. After seeing it flash two or three times like that, on the third or fourth time it flashed it was three separate bright lights in the form of a triangle.  On the next flash it was back to one light only.  The object was generally moving from the west to the east and was moving much slower than any satellite that I have ever seen before.  At the same time there were several military aircraft in the sky, which is not unusual for our area, but none of them seemed to be paying any attention to the object as it kept moving towards the East. I was an air traffic controller in the United States Navy and know about aircraft and what they look like and how they behave in the sky and have never seen anything like this before.  The extremely bright light was flashing with the approximate interval of 15 to 20 seconds (way too long an interval for either commercial or military aircraft) and there were no green or red lights associated with it.  If the light had been considerably dimmer and if it was moving faster, I would have known that it was a satellite, but I don’t think this was the case.

I can't see anything out of the ordinary with the helicopter, and being that it's night I can't see what model of helicopter it is.  Just the usual distinctive sound of it's rotors and white and red flashing indicator lights.  On the third pass overheard I am able to see that the helicopter seems to be chasing a dim shape.  I can't be certain of the exact shape, but it may have been triangular and it was about the same size or maybe a little bigger than the helicopter.  The only illumination I can see coming from the object is dim white lights at each end.  The lights do not flash like a conventional aircraft's markers, they are constant.  The entire time I can hear the constant sound of as single rotor helicopter, but I can not heard anything distinctive from the object it was chasing.  One final note; I can't be sure of the altitude of either craft, but given the sound and relative distances I'm think both the helicopter and the object were no more than about 500 feet or so up.

High-speed metallic sphere shooting across Central Texas skies.,Cedar Park,TX,2018-03-16T12:00:00,sphere,2 minutes,"Occurred : 3/16/2018 12:00  (Entered as : 03/16/2018 12:00) Reported: 3/22/2018 10:50:01 AM 10:50 Posted: 3/23/2018 Location: Cedar Park, TX Shape: Sphere Duration:2 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/139/S139229.html,"High speed metallic sphere shooting across Central Texas skies. On Friday March 16, 2018, I was walking my dog along the greenbelt on the northern side of Veterans Memorial Park in Cedar Park, Texas.  The loop around the park is about 1 1/3 miles total.   An aviation buff and lifelong sky watcher, I noticed a white/silver metallic sphere moving at a high rate of speed tracking roughly south to north at an estimated 10-15,000 above ground level.  There was no exhaust or visible means of propulsion in a standard sense.   While holding my dog’s leash I grabbed my mobile phone out of my pocket to attempt to record some video before the sphere would be lost in my line of sight over the tree line.  The video is terrible since I was juggling the dog leash and fighting with the sun glare on my phone.  There are only a few frames of the object.   I have seen the same type of sphere moving at a fast speed a few years before, ironically, while walking my dog at the park.  It is only because of the following activities that I was prompted to get this event documented. After losing sight of the object, I continued around the trail, wondering whether what I witnessed was advanced human technology, or something otherworldly.   Minutes later, at approximately 12:07 while walking southbound on the western side of the greenbelt, I heard a low hum and looked left and up.  At an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet, I saw what I’m convinced was an Air Force C-17 Globemaster, a huge four engine cargo jet.  In nearly four years of living in Central Texas, I’ve never seen one before.  It was tracking the same south to north direction of the flying metallic sphere, but approximately two miles east.  I could only wonder if the C-17 was tracking the sphere, or it had released the sphere itself in some military test, or if seeing the two in the space of 7 minutes was coincidental. Two days later, on Sunday March 18, 2018, I was, again, walking my dog around the park. While walking northbound on the east side of the park, I began to hear a low rumble and recognized the sound of military helicopters.  Only occasionally do you see any military choppers over Cedar Park, even given that the US Army Base Fort Hood is only 45 air miles away north northeast.   I stopped and looked around for the choppers.  This was 11:22 a.m. Central.  What I believe were two Apache attack choppers were about one-half mile south from location, and traveling west at approximately 3,000 feet above ground level.  They were flying close together with the lead chopper staggered to the left of the other.  What happened next made my jaw dropped the lead chopper abruptly jerked the chopper right (north) over roughly the same track the metallic sphere had been flying two days earlier.  The lead chopper’s move must have come to a surprise to the back chopper, because there was nearly a mid-air collision.  The two choppers continued that course until I lost sight of them because of the tree line.  Just as I was getting to my car to load my dog and head home, I heard another low hum at 11:32 a.m.  Flying the same course west as the other two choppers was a lone Apache.  And it made the same move (but smoother) of heading north along the track of the other choppers and the metallic sphere two days earlier. I have no idea as to what these events mean.  I can only chalk them up to high strangeness at this time.",2018-03-23T00:00:00,30.499835064935066,-97.80827857142857

I could not detect a color except it was black.   At first, I just noticed a bright yellow colored light that I had never seen before in the sky.  I thought the object was a large triangular aircraft, or maybe 3 planes flying in formation, but then I noticed that all 3 lights stayed together when the object moved, and that's when I started to think it was a UFO.  All I could see was 3 yellow bright lights formed as the points of a triangle.  I did not see a craft, but it was the 3 lights that appeared to be on the points of a black object.   The object moved extremely fast, best way to describe it is when you're following an airplane, and it disappears behind a cloud, you expect to see the airplane again at an expected location when it reappears from behind a cloud, but this object did not act that way.  The object seemed to move more side to side instead of a straight line.   I saw it appear 3 times.  It appeared, then disappeared, and unlike the airplane, it reappeared where I did not expect to see it. It was like it was moving in 2 directions at once.  It was flying more of a southwesterly direction from my location.  I felt a state of awe.   I was driving and tried to follow it.  The object seemed to be heading in a southerly direction toward a small community called Board Camp or Nunley where there have been other recent sightings.

My wife and I went outside and looked up.   When I first stepped outside, I heard dogs barking at a distance to the west of us, which made me look up toward that direction.  I noticed that the stars were being blocked by something, then they reappeared.  I could tell the object was moving southwest because of the stars blocking out and reappearing.  I could not tell the shape of the object for sure, but the width was a good 100 foot.  I wonder if there were 2 objects because there were 2 stars toward the center of the width of the object, which seemed to black out and come back.  I asked my wife if she saw what I was seeing which was moving southwest.   I looked at my wife to see which direction she was looking and I asked her, “Did you see what I saw?” and that’s what we always do to! verify with each other.  By the time I looked back up, the object was heading into the treeline.

On the night of February 8, 2018, I was with a group of 3 other people outdoors on the grounds of the Board Camp Crystal Mine in the community of Board Camp, near Mena, Arkansas.  The group and I were investigating anomalies that have been occurring regularly at the site for nearly one year.  This is the same site investigated by MUFON nearly one year ago, and featured in the October 2017 issue of the MUFON Journal.  One person in the group was training us on how to use specialty equipment in our investigation, such as a night vision scope and radiation detection device.   At approximately 8:30 pm, I received a cell phone call from a friend who said, “Quick, run outside.  We are following a triangular ship from Ink and it’s heading your way.”  The community of Ink is located north of where I was located in the community of Board Camp, so we expected to see the object coming toward us from the north.  Although I could not see the actual object itself,  I could see the ! effect of the object as it approached and flew over.   The night sky was clear and full of stars, so I could see that a portion of the sky and stars was blacked out as it flew over.  It did not fly directly over my head but was more east of me.  I did not see any lights on the object, only the black out and reappearance of the stars as it flew over.   From the first time I began seeing the stars black out and reappear, the flyover lasted approximately 4-6 seconds and the object was approximately 1000 feet in elevation.  The group I was with had heard dogs and coyotes barking earlier, but all sound stopped during the flyover.  It was very quiet.  I saw it pass over and the estimated size was probably 150-200 feet long.  I was facing east and it was moving south.  After it passed over, I caught the quick glimpse of stars blinking out and coming back to my right, which led me to believe the anomaly changed course from south to a southwest direction.  After I received the phone call from my friend who first saw the anomaly in Ink, the people in my group and I were excited and immediately started scanning the skies.  I also quickly texted another friend of mine who lives between Ink and Board Camp and told him to go outside to watch. Before the flyover, I had a radiation detection device in my pocket.  It was set to the highest setting and was picking up normal background radiation indicated by an occasional beep sound emitted from the device.  I noticed the flyover approximately 5 minutes after my friend called to notify me to look for it.  During the flyover, the radiation detector in my pocket went off making a constant beeping noise, and the other 3 people in my group heard it, and were amazed and said, ”It must right overhead!""  After about 6 seconds, the detector went back to normal.  After the object flew over, it disappeared past the horizon.   Immediately after the flyover at approximately 8:40 pm, I called my wife who was inside the house on the same property, and told her to call a friend of ours who lives southwes! t of us around the Cove and Hatfield communities located south of the city of Mena, to see if she could see it, after we determined it was possibly heading in her direction.  Later, when my wife and I talked to our 2 friends who we had notified to watch, both confirmed they saw something in the night sky, either the blacking out and reappearing of stars, or they saw 3 yellow lights.   My background is I am a US Army veteran, formerly worked as an investigator for the Department of Homeland Security, am a volunteer trained firefighter and certified instructor for Dept. of Labor.  Due to the fact, the 3 other witnesses and I were looking in different directions for the object, the 3 witnesses did not see the object in the sky, but they did hear the radiation detector going from a standard beep sound, to a continuous fast beep during the flyover.  They were amazed at the effect.  I believe they would be willing to be a witness to the event, but at the time of reporting, I do not have their specific permission to state their names.",2018-02-16T00:00:00,34.5914,-94.1951

""I almost dismissed it off as a lost silver balloon until I kept staring at it and realized it wasn't anything man-made.  I even shouted to the houses near-by, ""Hey guys!  We've got a UFO here!!!""  hoping someone would film this.  I even stopped somebody on the sidewalk and asked, ""What do you think that is?"" (witness 2).  The UFO was about a football field away or less, about the size of a compact car or slightly bigger.  The object appeared to have two distinct features, one is a dull black/green rotating wheel with a broken triangle or arrow pattern tread design that was rotating in the direction of travel and at the same speed. It must have been going around 10-15 MPH up Industrial.  The second and more vivid part was the center axis of the wheel which consisted of a glowing morphing mass of supernatural light or energy.  As it was moving, the glowing mass would flash pink, silver-white, go dim or disappear and repeat but it was really weird to watch. It seemed to be in a distinct sequence.  The glowing mass would also appear to elongate diagonally in a semi-diamond pattern and go back to a morphing mass.  I was in total awe, witness 2 didn't seem to be really interested, but admitted it looked very strange after watching for around 30 seconds and left towards the shopping center on the corner of Industrial & Mission where this thing was floating over.  It changed course when it got to Mission St. and started to run parallel to it and increased its speed some.  I followed it down the sidewalk, it started to ascend and move further away. It kept increasing its distance towards the! NW to well over .5 mile.  This whole time, it kept changing color sequence until it appeared as a silver star in sky.  It ascended and hovered at one point, floated some more and came straight down and followed a path, at well over 2 miles away or greater.  It finally took off toward the NW, appearing as a bright star.  While it was leaving, I noticed a dim dot (part of it?) glow red and go after it at one point.  It finally faded out.  Wildest thing I've ever witnessed.  As it was leaving, there was a Cessna in the area going to the E and must have seen it (potential witness 3).  Also, there was a high-flying ""contrail"" plane going towards the west who couldn't have missed that bright star outside his window to the north (potential witness 4).(MUFON)",2018-04-26T00:00:00,,

The lights were so low and bright, my first thought was that a plane was coming down right towards my house.  I was about to yell for my wife to run out the front in case there was a crash, then I realized that the lights were not moving at all.  I heard no noise and would have heard an air craft this close.  The lights were so bright that I could not discern the shape of the object.  There were 3 lights in a row with the middle slightly lower and one offset and up to the right, as if there was a missing light between them.  The object was approximately 200 ft. in the air, 1,500 ft. away, about the size of a half-dollar at arm's length, so it had to be in excess of 40' or more wide. I watched the object for 30+ seconds and ran to get my cell phone camera in the next room.  I was gone less than 15 seconds but when I got back, it was gone (and, very oddly, my cell phone went down, then came back on while I was wondering what happened to it). I immediately went outside and searched the sky in all directions, no plane, helicopters or anything else was airborne.  It is impossible for any typical aircraft to not be still visible in that time.  We are in the flight path of Joint Reserve Base air craft and Care Flight Helicopters from Weatherford to Fort Worth daily.  This object did not resemble any of those.

So this sighting may be a bit unique because it is current and ongoing.  The sighting I have entered in is the most significant one.  It actually goes back to April 3, 2018, until this morning (April 19, 2018).   On April 3, I was letting my dog out the side garage door facing east.  Up about 30 degrees in the sky was seemingly a very bright star which began to move.  It was very bright and did slow circles and a triangle pattern.  I watched for about ten minutes and went to let the chickens out and went around to the backyard and spotted another southwest a bit higher in angle in the sky.  I had to go to work so the sighting ended.  That night there were objects in the same location in the sky and one more due west.  It was a very clear night and star filled.  These stick out because of how bright they are.  White hot light that sparkles.   As I scanned the sky I noticed 4 more in other locations.  I didn't pay attention to the others however because of the significance of ! the other 3.  Every clear night and early morning since then I have spotted these and have spoken to a close friend and a few other people that have seen them.  The significant report that I have filled into the boxes is the Sunday night following the incident.  We contacted one another via text message and updated on what we were seeing.  The three main ones were in the same positions in the sky plus I spotted 9 more.  The three main ones have stayed in the same locations only deviating by a few miles sometimes getting sort of close and sometimes out towards the ocean.  They appear daily from approximately 20:00 to 6:00.  The pattern changed last night and they are no longer in the same locations.  I spotted one east and one west that seemed very close to town.  The flying patterns don't deviate much from circles to dipping up and down, sometimes dipping down and back up in a teardrop shape.  They seemingly look like they are scanning around or signaling something.  My parents live 12 miles south, and they have been seeing them west over the mountains towards the ocean.  These sightings are picking up attention in the area.  I didn't file a report at first because the photos and videos I have are only like stars in appearance and don't do them justice.  They should be seen in person.",2018-04-26T00:00:00,40.5788,-124.15

It was a sunny day with a clear blue sky, and temperatures in the low thirties.  As I was headed eastbound, I looked out my drivers side window to the north as saw a silver metallic cigar shaped object with no wings, no tail and no contrail.  The object appeared to be at a distance above Lake Erie. I slowed down, and intermittently looked at the object.  At one of the times I looked at it, I observed a horizontal red band in the middle of the object that was a quarter to a third of the object's length, however the next time I looked at it the band was no longer visible. When I reached the end of the road at Bradley Rd, I was stopped by a traffic light.  I had to turn my head a little over my shoulder at this point and noticed the object was stationary in the sky.  I proceeded to drive a little ways north on Bradley Rd., but turned around in a couple of minutes and headed back west on Krebbs Rd.  I pulled into Bay Village City Services parking lot, got out of my car and looked north to the sky, but the object was gone.  I proceeded to call my husband at 2:27pm to tell him about this.

In the wee hours of the morning of last Saturday (July 30, 2016), while out stargazing, I saw something odd which I am unable to explain. 1.  The object was traveling with a bearing of about 5-20° east of straight south. 2.  The object flew nearly straight overhead, somewhat near the star Vega, sometime between 1:10-1:30AM local time (6:10-6:30AM GMT).  I was stargazing at the latitude and longitude 44.795614 N, 94.377516 W (https://goo.gl/maps/FB4yDsR8GYv). 3.  The object was moving at a speed similar to an airplane. 4.  The object's light blinked 3-4 times, but at a seemingly lower frequency than a typical airplane. Also, while planes typically have a very short duration flash, this object had much longer flashes (1-2 seconds, probably), with the light being lit for about the same proportion of time as it was unlit. 5.  I did not hear any propeller sounds, indicating that either that the object was relatively far away or that this was not a plane/helicopter. 6.  The light also seemed brighter than a typical airplane's light, although I can't be entirely sure. It was certainly brighter than every star in the sky. 7.  After the 3-4 blinks, there were no more blinks (and this is on a wonderfully clear night; it's not possible that it was obscured by clouds, as I could still see the stars along the path it was flying)  From all this information, I am able to deduce that it was not a satellite, as satellites don't blink like this.  It is presumably not a typical commercial or private flight, even though there is a small airport roughly 4.5 miles north of where I was, because the lights stopped blinking, and that is presumably prohibited in nighttime flights.  I have not heard of any plane crashes nearby, which I expect I would have, had this been a plane that went down in flight.",2018-05-10T00:00:00,44.8994,-94.4101

It was a beautiful day with a clear blue sky.  As I walking I looked up and noticed a bullet shaped object high in the sky.  It was red / orange in color, similar to a hot metal ingot, so brighter and more orange in the center, and darker and more red on the edges.  I was walking west, and the object was moving perpendicular to me, so from North to South across the road. In my child mind I assumed that I was looking Yuri Gagarin’s Vostok spacecraft as he was completing his orbit of the earth.  Many years later I recalled this event and with my adult and more knowledgeable mind realized this could not be Gagarin because of the flight path and size and shape of the object. I would guess that the object was at least several thousand feet up in the sky, and with that estimation it was perhaps 50 feet long.",,,

They traveled around the cloud and the disc on the left performed a drop down maneuver and rejoined the formation on the right side!  It did not want to go through the cloud!

I have wanted to report this sighting for a long time, but could not confirm the exact date until recently.  There were multiple witnesses (some very close) and physical effects (power grid disturbance). My girlfriend asked me to follow her to pick up the kids.  She didn't say why.  They were at a friend's 13th birthday party on New Year's Eve.  At a high point near White Rock Lake where the downtown skyline could be seen she pulled up beside my car, rolled down her window, pointed to downtown and asked, “WHAT IS THAT?”  Above the neon green-lit 72-story Bank of America Plaza building, a huge object, chevron or disk-shaped with four very large red lights visible around the base which were pulsating in a strangely synchronized but unpredictable way, appeared to be almost parked on the roof.  Maybe 100 feet above it.  It was larger than the top of that skyscraper.I said “I have no idea”. I wanted to stay and observe but she said, “Come on we've got to get the kids now!” and took off.  I followed, glancing at the object any chance I got visibility on the way. When we arrived the object was gone but the kids ran full speed to me saying“ (name deleted)  WE SAW A UFO!  WE SAW A UFO!”.  They were so excited that they were tugging on my clothes.  I asked, “Where was it?” They said, “RIGHT THERE!”, pointing above a large live oak in the front yard. I asked them how big it was and they said “BIG!”.  I asked what shape it was, but they couldn't say for sure because it was so close that it was partially obscured by the huge live oak tree.  They said it had red lights around the bottom. It turned out that the reason we were picking them up early was because they were terrified by this object.  When I went in to talk to the homeowner he said that he also saw it briefly.  He said “Follow me I want to show you something”.  He pointed in both directions up and down the street and said “Look at the lights.”  All the street lamps and porch lights were a very dim, faint yellow in both directions as far as I could see.  I had never before seen anything quite like this.  It looked like all the light bulbs had been replaced by tiny yellow candles inside.  It was as though 95% of all available power had been sucked out of the grid, leaving only a tiny trickle.  Clear cloud-free night.  I hadn't noticed this in all the excitement when we first pulled up. He said, “Let me show you something else”.  I followed him back inside and he tried to turn on his TV, but the power was so weak that it wouldn't come on.  Same thing with the stereo, although the inside lights and lamps were lit, seemingly by tiny candles. I asked “How long has it been like this?”  He said, “Ever since the kids ran in screaming about the UFO”. That's about it.  The next day (New Year's Day), my friend said that the power returned to normal perhaps an hour or two after we left. I found a match for this object when I ran across this video from Turkey:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSNViG1HoX8. At the very end you can see an object racing off over the water near dawn and it has the exact same four red lights! Same object with no doubt.

I walked out to my car which was parked in our driveway.  As I started backing up I looked out of my driver’s side window after only backing up a few feet or so.  I saw a very strange object.  It was moving left, and then right, then left, and then right just going back and forth.  I started trying to think of what it might be while watching it for about 5 seconds.  I then realized that this was no ordinary object.  I got out of my car for a better look.  My neighborhood was fairly new so the trees were still not tall and didn’t affect my viewing.  A few seconds after I got out of my car the UFO started to move my direction.  It moved very slowly without any sound at all.  It was very low.  I literally could’ve thrown a rock at it and almost hit it when it passed over me it was that low. Description of UFO:  It’s very hard to describe.  It was shaped like a typical flying saucer, but the dome part of it was larger than the typical flying saucer photos you see on the internet.  It was also not silver or shiny in any way.  It looked tan or light brown and had little red dots on it.  As it flew slowly towards me I noticed that the top half of the craft was disappearing. By the time it had almost reached me most of the UFO had vanished and I could only see the very bottom part of the UFO.  As it passed over me, I saw the bottom of the UFO and I was just a dark black circle.  Did not see any kind of detail other than that and after a few more seconds the UFO had completely vanished. Summary: In my opinion the UFO may have had problems cloaking or have been in a transition phase of doing so. When it was flying towards me and the top half vanished I could only see blue sky behind it. That really freaked me out because I now know that a UFO can cloak itself and be completely invisible. So the shape of the UFO was definitely a flying saucer it just had kind of an odd shape to it, kind of bulky, not like a slick styled UFO. The red dots were not random but in rows on the craft going up and down. I should also mention around 05:30PM that same evening there was a black helicopter flying around my neighborhood and did circle around my house a few times. That was the only time I’d ever seen a helicopter around my neighborhood flying that low and I’d lived there for around 7 years at the time. Ever since this event, (it changed my life) I’ve been searching the internet and researching UFO’s to find a similar sighting or to see if anyone else had seen the same thing I did. I still haven’t found anything. I feel I may be one of the few people to ever see a flying saucer during its cloaking phase. I don’t know why it’s taken me so long to report this on your site. I did originally post it to MUFON a few days afterwards but they never contacted me.",2018-04-13T00:00:00,41.6725,-88.527

I was by myself driving from Shoshoni to Riverton.  The sun had gone down a couple hours earlier and it was cloudy, so it was a very dark night.  The roads were icy so my attention was very firmly on the road. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a light to the right of my car.  I turned my head and looked at it.  About 20 feet to the right of my car was a glowing sphere.  It was about the size of a basketball.  It shifted colors every few seconds going from green to red to yellow.  The light coming off of it wasn't extremely bright, but in the darkness, it stood out clearly. The sphere was going exactly the same speed as my car.  I was driving under the speed limit because of the icy road.  I was going about 45 mph.  I kept looking over at it and it stayed in the same position relative to my car outside the driver's (sic.  passenger's) side window. The ground dropped off sharply a few feet beyond the guardrail.  My first thought was that there must be a parallel road down below and another vehicle that happened to be going the exact same speed as myself had a tall pole attached to it with a weird color changing light on top of it.  As strange as that would be it was the only explanation I could come up with.  After 15 or 20 seconds of this sphere matching my speed and direction perfectly it was becoming clear to me that my initial assumption was extremely unlikely. I decided to slow down abruptly to see if the sphere would slow down to stay alongside me.  I hit the brakes and slowed to about 20 mph very quickly just as a small hill rose up between my vehicle and the object.  It took about a second to pass the hill.  I expected to see the sphere shoot forward ahead of me alongside the highway but it never appeared.  I looked to the right to the place where the object had previously been and it was gone.  I could still see the light from it, though, for another couple seconds.  A green glow was reflected off of tree branches as the light moved away from the road.  It seems that the moment I slowed down, the sphere made an abrupt 90 degree turn to the right and vanished into the woods. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Yes, I did mean the passenger’s side window.

On sunday night--Monday morning at approximately between 12:50 AM and 1:10 AM in Calvert County, Maryland, I witnessed an unidentified flying/ hovering object in the eastern north-east section of the sky at about 45 degrees from the horizon.  I observed it through a trees branches with no leaves, and at first thought, that it was the branches cutting off a stars light.   After about 30 seconds, i realized that it was much brighter then most stars and was indeed pulsing in a pattern.  I walked about 40 feet closer to remove the branches through a large hole in the trees branches.  A 2 bubble like orb of blue light was emitting multiple 1 and 2 second slow growing pulses over a second or two of time of a bright blue color. After about 30 seconds of me staring at it with my jaw to the floor in complete awe, a military fighter jet, likely a newer F35 from pax river research base flew over my house, towards the direction of the blue orb, with the jets direction offset to the west of the object by 10 degrees or so, at a very unusually slow speed that made it extremely quiet and at a very unusually low altitude.  I see fighter planes around my house all the time, for my entire life and I have never seen a fighter plane fly at such a slow speed or such a low altitude with such a quiet dynamic.   After a minute or two, the pulse began to change its tempo, when the plane came closer to it, though its hard to tell exactly how far away from it, the blue orb light compressed to a small white light.  As the fighter plane got a mile or two past my house, and closer to the direction of the 'orb' the light compressed from blue into white and then a thin orange spike that looked like a meteorite trail that ex! tended upwards and began from the point of the light which then disappeared.  The orange trail was very small and very feint, perhaps the size of a needle in the sky with a tail length about as wide as my thumb or a degree or two. This object was completely stationary in the sky and did not move until it began to disappear and was not on an orbit what so ever.  I would estimate it was any where from a quarter mile to a mile or so in the sky. I have contacted multiple flight facilities, looking for any activity from experiments, but this was not a sounding rocket, or an experiment, or a satellite burning up in the atmosphere.  It was completely stationary.  I have studied ball lightning and I can assure that not only was this not ball lightning, but the atmospheric dynamics at the time was not conducive to ball lightning.  This was not anywhere near the altitude of an elfing event nor was this a 'blue sprite'.  The brightness magnitude during the peak of the pulses was around 2 times the brightness of Rigel and barely visible at the low magnitude of the pulses which were at patterns of about a second or two and changed over the minute or two I observed the blue orb. The glow did not give off diffraction spikes like stars and was a smooth glowing blue orb which had smooth gradients of pulses.  The image shape was diamond orb like and gave off a rounded square edged shape at the height of its brightness in pulse.  The speed in which it disappeared was very quickly at around a half a second or less once it became a smaller bright white light.  I observed the object for around 1 or 2 minutes until it disappeared when the jet appraoched it. I have added photos of a sighting from Puerto Rico in 2017 I found after the event that accurately resemble the shape and dynamics as the orb had a 2 part-like dynamic to it during its pulses with a mild middle dividing line, that made the orb look a bit like two bubbles stuck together.  These are extremely accurate photos to the agreement of what i saw to the point where i believe this is exactly what i saw.   I contacted flight facility of Wallops and searched for flight or experiment anomolies but found no satellites or sounding rockets that could represent these dynamics or color wavelenghts.",2018-03-23T00:00:00,38.6891,-76.6148

I was looking out the window above the kitchen sink while talking on the phone when I noticed light colored, metallic-looking objects in the sky.  Initially, I thought they were birds as it is very common to see seagulls, bald eagles, hawks, and other birds where we live.  At first, I thought the objects were seagulls.  Then I noticed they were moving unlike birds and also moving in and out of the clouds. We had somewhat unusual weather that day with dark clouds in the sky above us, but sun shining in from the west.  The sun reflecting off the objects against the dark clouds is what made them noticeable, as they were so small, I probably could not have seen them under normal weather circumstances.  The reflecting sun is also what led me to believe they were metallic. As I watched the objects, I observed them moving up and down in and out of the clouds, as well as side to side.  At that point they clearly were not birds.  I’ve never see birds fly so high up as to go in and out of clouds at the altitude these objects were flying at.  They almost moved in a playful manner, seeming to chase each other in and out of the clouds.  I believe there were at least two, maybe three, but because they were moving in and out of the clouds it is hard to say with certainly how many; there were at least two, though. The entire event lasted maybe a minute, if that.  I said to my mom on the phone, “Oh my god, I think I’m seeing UFOs!”  Then they were gone.  They disappeared into the clouds and I haven’t seen them since. It should be noted that we live very near to the Canadian border and I saw these objects to the north, quite possibly over Canada. At the time of the event I had a hard time making sense of what I was seeing. I was watching these object, expecting them to act like birds but they didn’t.  When I realized they couldn’t be birds, my brain was trying to make sense of what I was seeing, but couldn’t and it was difficult to process while it was happening. Nobody else was with me and, to my knowledge, nobody else saw what I saw. I am a married, stay-at-home mom to three little boys.  I have an M.A. in History, a B.A. in Humanities, and worked as an archivist before our first son was born.

Flew over Ohio River and made the water move but no sound. My Two son's (12 & 9) and I were driving home from our local mall last night approx. around 8:37 p.m..  My oldest son, who was sitting in the back seat, says to me, ""Mom, there is something strange in the sky.""  I pass it off to be a helicopter or plane, seeing as though we see a good bit of air traffic coming and going from the Pittsburgh airport.   We hit a red light getting ready to turn left (northbound towards home), when my second son, who is sitting in the front seat, reports to me he is now seeing a strange set of lights in the sky, my curiosity peaked, and I asked where they were seeing it?   He says, ""Right in front, right behind the tree line.""  We live in a valley, so there are a lot of heavy wooded area and hills, we also were about to be turning onto a highway that goes right along the Ohio River.  What I see is a VERY bright light through the tree line, I make a joke and say, that it is probably just a helicopter looking for marijuana plants.  I make the left turn onto route 7, and clearly see that this craft is ""flying"" above the river.  In our depressed area, we have trains carrying coal that which the tracks line the river, as well as barges who travel on the river.  We can see W.V. across the river and there are little run down steel plants and canning plants that once were up and running.   I slow down on this highway going only 40 mph in a 55 mph zone watching it, I had noticed that the ""bright white light I once saw, is accompanied by dim whitish lights around the front on the craft.  We roll the windows down and shut the crappy pop music off that my kids insisted we listened to on the way home, and we hear absolutely nothing, but notice that the water is swaying like a boat had just traveled and disturbed the water.  At that point we are shocked and nobody is saying much, we only hear the wind and my car driving down this stretch of empty highway.  It did a drastic turn, something I've never seen a craft of any kind do towards the left, which would be directly over my suv.  It is now out of our sight.  I roll the windows up.  My oldest son asks me what we seen, and I have absolutely no words to tell.  I am only wondering where it went, and if we would see it again.  We drive a mile or so down the road, and notice something else in the sky.  This time we knew it was a plane heading to Pittsburgh with the flashing red lights.  I am telling the boys, that isn't what we just saw, there was no way in hell that was a plane. The strange silence was soon interrupted by the shreek of my oldest son who was now sitting on the driver's side (still in the back seat)  ""I see it mom, I see it"" he screams, in excitement.  I look to the left, sure enough it was there moving or hovering.  This time I could see it better.  It was a triangle shape, with the 4-6 smaller dim white lights on the front of the craft including the bigger bright white light on the tip, with blue and greenish lights surrounding the perimeter there were at least 9 separate ones, 3 on each side.  It was dark, but the craft seemed to be a shiny metallic color it wasn't a huge craft, maybe a little bigger than my Honda pilot, just in a perfect triangular shape.  It hovered for approx. 40 seconds, and then seemed to get lower.  What is strange about this sight is, how fast it would be higher up into altitude and then drop down, it did this at least 3 times, so quickly.  It would be in one place, and seem to move over without traveling.  It was significantly  lower than the plane at all times.  It continued to move left without actually flying, before it was right above a semi big hill off in a wooden area.   What happened next was the big kicker.  It seemed to get very low and blend/land into the trees, but I didn't witness any debris or tree limbs flying into the air.  The 3 of us all seen it, watched it land or whatever it was doing and turn the lights out or completely vanished into thin air.  I've never experienced something like this, or seen it with my own eyes, and my 2 kids experienced it with me.

I turned the corner and up another hill to get another vantage point where I could see the lights once again, making sure not to mistake them with street lights. I knew the lights were something in the distance, not something within the subdivision itself. I made my way back to the highest crest of the hill where the su! bdivision starts, and from what I saw, the separation between lights had grown, or moved. I studied them with binoculars for 5 minutes before pulling into my driveway for the night. From my driveway, I could still see the highest sets of lights still hanging low on the horizon.

Incedence Report:  The following is a report of the occurrences of the evening of 5/5/18 in Burbank, CA, at 7:32 PM. While speaking with a family member on my cell phone in my own backyard, I looked up into the due westerly direction of the dusk sky (which occured at 7:30 PM that evening) I noticed something approaching in the sky at approximately a 35 degree angle to my reference on the ground.  I thought it looked like a mylar balloon or at least a highly reflective metal of some kind. I quickly realized the object was actually moving in my direction, slowly it appeared at first. I cannot say for certain but I would have put its altitude at approximately 300-500 ft.  As it approached, I noticed that it had flat sides on the top and the bottom of the object and was a diamond type of shape, with 8 sides.  Four equal sides on top and four below, similar to two pyramids turned towards each other at the base.  The lower portion of the object coming into clear view as it passed at 90 degrees to me I could see that it too had four equal sides matching the top.  The underside seeming slightly darker, I imagine, because of its reference to the falling sun on the upper portion of the object.  The sky was lit by a fair amount of sunlight still. The object made no sound whatsoever.  It left no trail of exhaust or describable propulsion of any kind that I could see. I was shocked to see the object traveled more or less directly over my home and continued on a due easterly direction at a speed that I also cannot say for certain however, again, if having to choose a speed I would say it maintained a speed of between 50-100 mph. Probably closer to the 50 side I believe.  I had the presence of mind while it was directly over me to open up my camera app and start snapping in its now eastern reference to me at about 30 degrees where it passed behind some trees and I lost sight of it. I just aimed in the objects direction snapping two photographs as it was on its easterly course just before it passed out of view.  Information embedded in the photos state the time of the photos at 7:32 PM establishing the exact time of the occurrence.  I had approximately a 120 degree view of the sky and it completely passed through that view in that 20-30 seconds.  The object in the pictures can be seen at just above and to the right of the tree.  Upon zooming in t! he flat sides of the object as well as its diamond shape can be discerned. If comparing its size to the full moon I would have to say that at its closest point, when at a 90 degree reference to me, it would have been about the size of the full moon itself. Interestingly, the path of the object appeared to violate FAA airspace as it crossed the north/south orientation of both outgoing and incoming air lanes about a mile from the south end of the runway at Bob Hope Ineternational Airport.  I live just south of the airport and see the planes using these air lanes all day. Perhaps related, or perhaps not, I wanted to mention that perhaps 20 minutes prior to the incident I witnessed four black hawk helicopters in a line formation coming into what appeared to be a landing at the airport from the south.  I have no idea if this is related or coincidence.  The helicopters had no describable insignia that I can recall.  All black.

I had just gotten off the freeway at about 10:15 p.m. on May 9th, 2018.  There was a significant amount of cloud cover in the sky so most of the stars were not visible, and the few that were were dulled by a layer of clouds.  The vehicle I was driving was a 2013 Silverado, the windows were up and all accessories, including the radio, was off.  In other words it was very quiet in the cab, especially once I pulled off I-84 E via exit 129.  I turned left onto Gopher Knoll Rd, which heads NW for approximately 2000 ft before veering right slightly and fixing on a NNW heading for the next couple miles. Not long after turning onto Gopher Knoll Rd, still speeding up in fact.  I saw a bright orange light out of the corner of my eye.  Almost dead left of me.  I'm not entirely sure what shape it was but it wasn't a perfect sphere.  Neither was it triangular or disc-shaped.  It was sorta round.  For a lack of a better term, I'd say it looked oblong-ish.   At first glance I thought it was a flare.  But after a second look I realized it was way too big.  I have seen planes drop flares over Saylor Creek Bomb Range many times and I know how easily one might confuse the military shooting off flares for something more fantastical than what is actually happening.  This was definitely NOT a flare.  Nor was it a plane, helicopter, a reflection of interior lights, a meteor, or god help me the sun.  There is no way anyone would be able to convince me it was any of those things.  The closest thing I can think of that could possibly pass as a realistic explanation is it was a very very large and EXTREMELY well lit blimp.  But even that would be a hard sell.  It appeared to be about a third the size of the moon from my perspective (not actual size obviously) and it hovered just below the clouds,  or at least the bottom of it did. The orange illumination only lasted 10 or 20 seconds before it suddenly started to dim. About 4 seconds later it was gone.  By this time I was heading NNW and away from the aircraft.  It was now more or less in my blind spot (to my left and behind me) only higher than my mirrors would show me..  I kept looking over my left shoulder (much like you do when merging onto a busy interstate) hoping I would see it again.  And eventually,  sure enough, I did.  I'm not exactly sure how long it was lit up the second time either.  But the third time I did see it lighting back up.  Its transition of going from nothing to full brightness was real close to, if not exactly the same length of time as its transition from full brightness to pitch black, which was about 4 seconds.  I then decided to pull off and film it.  It would have been really lousy quality but at least it would have been something. Unfortunately, by the time I got out of the truck and turned on the camera it had gone dark again.  This time it just stayed dark.  I sat there waiting for 5 or 10 minutes hoping to see it light up again, but it never did. I should add that I was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or overly exhausted, or anything like that.  I am also not a dishonest person by anyone's standards.  Lying about this would only be counter productive to the progress of humanity, not to mention it'd make me a total ((one word deleted)).  I am in no way lying or exaggerating.  I'm just a guy trying to do the right thing",2018-05-15T00:00:00,43.0784,-115.1971

I saw a black chevron/triangle shaped craft approach and go over my house.  I went to my van to get something.  It was almost completely dark.  I saw a bright light moving from a distance toward my house.  I see lots of commercial and military planes in the area, but this was odd.  I stopped and watched it.  It was lower than the commercial planes that fly.  Did not make a noise. Jet black.  Solid white light in the middle and tiny one at tip.  I've never seen anything like this.  It was rounded like on the sides and there was a weird lined pattern all along it.  You know it was not actually flat, but more like a rounded on the edges, perhaps even cone like.  As it went over me I could clearly see the shape.  There was one bright white light in the very middle.  As it was flying it seemed to slip to the left and right a bit.  It was very unusual.  It did that a few times and then remained straight in the direction.  When the craft got over me, the middle light fla! shed and then dimmed.  Then it flickered in a weird pattern.  The pattern almost seemed like a Morse code for a bit.  It was unusual.  I even had an eerie sense like I was being watch and it saw me because I thought I would like to see more of the craft, but the light was too bright, as soon as I thought that was when the light dimmed to where there was not as big of a glare and I could see the craft pretty well.   Then a small front light came on and was going in all different directions before it faded and only the middle light remained.  It was going fairly slow.  The entire event lasted about 10 minutes.  My neighbor saw me staring into the sky and came over and saw the light but did not see the craft as it had moved farther away.  It made no noise at all--not a sound.  It left no trail in the sky. It was flying from approximately the northeast to the southwest.  I posted the sighting on Facebook immediately after. Before I went inside to call a friend and post this a he! licopter flew around my block and very close to the house and ! just abo ve the tree line.  It was solid black as well.

There was one really bright star that I looked at a good amount that night and was wondering what it was called, or if it was a planet. At about 6 am, my dog demanded to go out and the sun was just starting to come up.  It was light enough out that only the very brightest stars were still visible.  As I’m looking at that one bright star I had been staring at all night, I noticed that there was a second one over to the right of it that wasn’t there before.  While I’m watching this second really bright star and wondering where it came from, it started to look like it was moving, but it didn’t have any blinking red lights on it like an airplane does.  Then it suddenly got a lot brighter and just disappeared.  Have you ever seen an incandescent light bulb when it has a power surge?  How it gets really bright for a second right before it burns out?  It was like that, but just an orb of light.  I have no idea how large it was.  It looked just like a bright star.  It could have been something large very far away or something smaller that was much closer.  When it vanished it didn't shoot across the sky or move noticeably, it was just gone.  It kind of just winked out after it pulsed. It was no shooting star (which I did also see that night) and I live right outside an air base, so I’m used to planes flying overhead literally all the time and it was not that either.  It was still and looked just like a star until it moved a little, pulsed brightly, and was gone. I am a former intelligence analyst for the Drug Enforcement Administration.

What initially caught my attention was the apparent oscillating or alternating shape the object had.   I stepped out to my balcony to view and it was definitely not a plane or balloon.  It was, at this point, low enough to see the object alternating in appearance, yet had a slight distortion or haze surrounding it.   I quickly stepped inside to gather my phone/camera.  The appearance was spherical with an elongating cone shaped distortion that projected from the underside.  I am estimating it was roughly 1-2K feet in altitude but it’s only an estimate.   The object passed nearly directly over me and was gaining altitude as it progressed to the southwest.  Its altitude stabilized when it was roughly 3-4X smaller in appearance compared to the initial time of observation.  At this point the object seemed stationary relative to the ground, but may have gained additional altitude.  Then it slowly moved east and it was visible for another 3-4 minutes.  I took my eye off of it for a second and could not re-acquire.   The entire sighting lasted from 16:43 to 16:52  I took photos throughout the observation.  The initial 4 photos that were taken in fairly quick succession (within a few seconds) reveals two cycles of the alternating shape.  Subsequent photos appear to be too distant to resolve much detail; however I have not down loaded to a computer for better viewing.",2018-05-04T00:00:00,41.52893608562691,-88.1223501529052

We both took our phones with us but they did not work. There was a ship about 50 to 60 feet across and the hight was about 25 to 30 feet and as last time, it did not seem to be touching the ground. Somehow I found myself inside the craft. I have no recollection how I got there, my friend Joe was not with me. The inside was very dimly lit and had a very strange smell of almonds that I recognised from last time and again I saw small figures moving around in the shodows, I couldn't hear voices but had the opinion that they were having a conversation with each other. I was held on top of a floating table that was monovering around the room I had no comprehension of the time but I was in the ship for around two hours. I found myself in the field where I found Joe who said that he could not move until I reappeared he had a memory of me being taken up and into the ship but was unable to to move.

My wife, kids, and I were traveling roughly North on State of Franklin Road going toward Sam’s Club.  My wife and I were sitting in the front of the vehicle, so we were the first to notice flashes of light (reflections) coming from 3 (possibly 4) objects that were traveling due east at tree top level parallel to interstate 26.  I say “possibly 4” because I only saw 3, but my wife says she saw 4 objects.   They were invisible against the trees as they traveled along a hillside and flashed (sun reflection off of metallic surface?) frequently as they were apparently shifting side to side or possibly wobbling as they traveled.  We could not make out a shape.  Therefore, estimating a size of the objects difficult.  They were traveling at a rate of approximately 30-40 miles per hour.   We quickly lost sight of all but one of the objects which traveled approximately a mile away and remained stationary at about 6,000 feet.  It appeared to rock back and forth which continued to cause the reflective flashes as we saw on the other objects.  In between flashes the object appeared to be black.  We watched it for about 3 minutes and then went into the store.  It was gone by the time we finished shopping 10 minutes later.   If I had to guess at size I would say 15-10 feet wide.

Intrigued I stayed outside looking again around the sky Then had a urge to again look above the roof Shocked I see another one coming in from the north to south around 9:25 pm It was heading directly towards over my position quarter mile away As I now stood up watching it as again would brighten up or then just fade right out It moved on a slight turn [ over my house] heading southeast towards Lake Ontario As I watched it high in the sky moving slowly when it appears You could see it rocking slightly side to side Tried to film it heading southeast - too distant and faint light Then after couple minutes lost sight of it There was no sound heard what soever Again just a white slow light - no other colors I then went inside my house again wondering Later , after 11:15 pm returned outside on my deck Curious sat down and looked about the sky Again after a few minutes to the west Maybe two three miles away see another one high in the sky Same characteristics as the previous two types witnessed This third one was moving from south to north It appeared to be going straight yet would fade and appear for 10- 20 seconds apart The sky appeared clear and watched it head north until out of sight Sighting lasted couple of minutes or more  Now having seen three UFO sightings of the same type I felt excited to witnessing three in one night - not the first time Again due to wonderment stayed outside I believe about five minutes later looking about west , north and south I had a urged to again look above my roof While sitting in the chair stretched forward and looked up Shocked I see these really bright pulses of white light Just like a camera flash in the dark I immediately stood up with my camera in hand still shocked looking up The pulses were intermittent flashes After about 4-5 of brightest large flashes Watching it move directly from north to south over house These flashes appeared very slow in movement The pulses then got much smaller after first ten seconds There may have been six to eight smaller ones Then it just stopped near above my house I could hear and see no aircraft at the time No running lights seen Only these extreme bright white bright light flashes  I'm still in a awe coupled in a state of shock in wonder Is this a form of visual contact by non human ?

Being the night owl I am, I usually find myself out for a cigarette at the dead times of night (generally between 1 am and 3 am I go out for the last time.)  Being the observer I am, my eyes are usually glued to the skies. Around the end of November 2017, I began to notice a very peculiar light in the sky, consistently showing up on the horizon around the given hours.  The light is familiarized by it's unique flashing pattern-a dull green fading in and out through a red,white,and yellow spectrum. Naturally curious, I have often found myself trying to eye it out in the sky most nights and am often times successful.  Beyond the pattern of lights the (seeming) ufo has to make it noticeable, it also very often makes spontaneous and erratic movements that just make it seem completely inhuman.  Darting from the left to the right, pausing for a brief moment, and then speeding directly up and down in the sky- over and over continually for generally around 30 minutes to an hour(do note, a lot of the time spent visible it seemingly is still, but has small bursts of movements around every 5 minutes.)  The reason I chose to finally document this case is due to an oddity that was more disturbing than the norm I had come to expect.  It was a semi clear night, just some roaming clouds and a stable wind when I noticed the normal conspicuous satellite-like light coming from the northern sky, but the more I inspected it, the more I noticed it seemed to be moving very slowly and methodically with another light directly above it.  This second light was much more dim and much less noticeable, but the lights were beyond a reasonable doubt moving upwards in the sky in unison.  After maybe 2-3 minutes of these lights slowly creeping vertically in the sky, it had seemed they had come to a halt when very suddenly, the less noticeable light appeared to very quickly speed out of sight going upward in the night sky and before I could even tell what had happened logically, the residual brighter light also seemed to have simply disappeared into the night.",2018-05-10T00:00:00,45.4508,-93.5855

I was driving home from St. George, UT, to Enterprise, UT, heading NW on highway 18 at approximately 2:45 am.  At approximately mile marker 38 I saw two green lights to the SW of me, as I drove through the canyon the lights came closer towards me and was descending from the dark sky.  My initial thought was, “What a weird place to see a drone,” but as I thought through it I realized nobody would be flying a drone in this area at this time of morning.  Then as the lights got closer I realized this was a bigger object than I thought and it began hovering next to me as I drove.   I reached for my phone to take a picture and the object hovered above me then hovered just ahead of me hugged up to the mountainside, I wondered if it was going to land because it was so low then it hovered up and over the mountain, keeping close to the treetops and then out of sight in a northern direction.  As I came out of the canyon I scanned the dark sky looking for the green lights again but I didn’t see anything but stars.    As I continued driving home, I was questioning what I saw and my own sanity.  Then as I turned right down my street there were the two green lights again, about 150 yards in front of me and approximately 20 feet above the ground coming at me so I turned my lights off and grabbed my phone.  As I snapped two pictures the object just hovered in place for about 15 seconds, this is when i noticed the green lights spinning into and out of sight and the first time i saw an orangeish red light blinking below the green lights, then it floated away in a SW direction.  When I got home I could still see the green and red lights in the distance.  I was so creeped out and was afraid of abduction because of the object “following” and “watching” me that i sat in my car with the lights and engine off for 5 minutes before running into my house and locking all the doors, and shutting all the blinds.   I could not hear anything and I could not make out a formation w! ith my naked vision, but when I looked at the pictures I had taken I t hen saw the formation of the object, the windows in the object and some sort of blue glow at the top of the formation, none of those visible to the naked eye in the dark.  I continue to now hear a “hovering” sound over my house come and go as I type this, 4 times in the last hour but when I look outside there is nothing to be seen, then the sound just disappears, (I’m not 100% sure this is related, but we do not have known flying objects such as helicopters flying around Enterprise, and the sound is not that of an airplane).",2018-05-10T00:00:00,37.5736,-113.71909999999998

I was about 5 miles from my exit, when I looked up in the sky and saw a tiny dot-sized object that was moving very slowly or maybe not at all.

I could not tell what it was, exactly, because of its distance, and assumed it was a plane or helicopter.   I looked back down at the road for no more than 1 or 2 seconds and then looked up again and it was gone.

It was approximately 10-12” in diameter but with no distinguishing thorax or center body, multiple non-jointed legs that were thin and translucent greyish(?) with small 1-2cm. disks on the ends of each one. I was sleeping and suddenly woke up and turned my head upwards towards it.  It was stationary perhaps a second, but then when it sensed that I saw it, it scampered across the ceiling (about10-12ft.) in a straight line and disappeared at the wall.  It made no noise, nor had lights.  My chihuahua who was in the room did not react to it. The weird thing is that several weeks ago I had a dream about the same entity.  I didn’t recall the dream until a couple days after the incident.  I usually forget and write off all my dreams, as I had that one, but on 4/6 it popped ino my head while driving.

As we were crossing the Rice Street exit, we saw 2 black rectangular prism shapes in the sky to the south.  There are a few airports  in the area, so planes are constantly flying overhead.  We both asked out loud, ""What is that?""   As we looked closer, we noticed the crafts were extremely low - I'm guessing less than 1,000 feet.  They were larger than a plane (I'd estimate twice as big in each dimension - length, height, width).   The crafts, originally appearing to move southeast, turned counter clockwise and headed northwest.  They moved slowly.  By this time, the two crafts were moving directly over our vehicle.  It was evening, so the sky was darker.   I tried looking for dark shapes extending off the objects to indicate wings; I might have just assumed it was a plane had I seen them, but there was only the rectangular prism shape.  One craft flew with its body oriented diagonally, while the other was straight length-wise.   Both objects had a short line of lights  on the bottom.  I vaguely recall a few white lights and a blue light:  A line of 2-3 white lights, then a blue light, followed by another white light.  The lights did not blink.   As they flew over us, they separated.  One flew more north and the other headed northwest.  I pulled off the Lexington exit and stopped in a parking lot to take another look in their direction, but they were no longer in sight.",2018-01-25T00:00:00,44.95305527415144,-93.11475467362925

Then, all of a sudden, they changed direction and headed south.  I tried to turn off my hot tub to see if I could hear anything, but couldn’t. These objects had lights, maybe reddish.  I can’t be sure of their shape, but I would say round or oblong.  It’s hard to say because, even though the sky was dark, it was still early in the evening and there was some steam from my hot tub.  I’m not sure how high they were flying, but I’m going to guess no more than cruising altitude for a commercial airliner, but it is really hard to guess their altitude.  For reference, we have very tall, mature trees in our village and these objects were much much higher than them and where I’m used to seeing airliners fly. For background information, I live about a ½ mile from Lake Erie near Eastlake, OH.  There are no street lights in my village.  I often sit in my hot tub and look up at the stars and watch the planes flying into CLE Hopkins and Lost Nation airports.  I have also seen a fireball or meteor not to mention many shooting stars.  I was honestly in disbelief of what I was seeing and was saying to myself ((deleted--""What is this?”!. I observed these objects for maybe 10-15 seconds before they disappeared to the south.  In my mind, I was trying to make sense of it and whether it could have been a couple of drones but I guess they’d have to be real good pilots to pull off that maneuver at night let alone daytime.

All I could see was a big bright ball of red light above our road/street 15-16ft from my house.  It stood still in the sky and I don’t know how long it was already there.  And I didn’t thought anything about it at first until I took a few step forward to try to take a good look of it and that’s when it moved and shifted to the right.  It moved pretty quickly towards our dead end road an then it came back towards where it had been above me.  It came a little slower than when it had moved before.  Then it started to flash some kind of light blueish bright lights from the aircraft.  Those blueish lights doesn’t flash like any normal airplane would.  There’s no way and there’s no way any airplanes/drones moves like how this aircraft moves and how fast it was flying up there strangely.  The big ball of red light it doesn’t flash and it doesn’t go off. It continuously was very visible. I cannot make out how this aircraft looks like.  It stopped a few times where I am an then it just moves strangely back and forth rapidly in strange movement. A n then I notice when the first aircraft moved towards hwy I-94, another aircraft moves in towards above the houses across from my house.  It was moving at a slower paste than the first one.  But it seemed to be following the first aircraft.  The second ship you could tell that  its an oval shaped bc it had diminish whitish lights aligned together giving out the shape.  And its color is like a metallic/grayish color to it. It’s only a few minutes then the first aircraft flew quite fast off my left towards the other side of the neighborhood into the sky and it’s gone and strangely so did the second aircraft left shortly after.

I must of have miss record and was in utter shock when I couldn’t find it.  And in all honesty, this is truly my first experience and I feel overwhelmed by this experience.  I like to say really that I DONT want to experience something like this ever again.  But I know what I know now and that’s enough for me.

While focused on that planet, a movement in the sky caught my eye and it appeared as if one of the stars began to move slightly to the left of the presumed planet and then I realised there were no blinking lights or noises, and then I tried to film it with my cell phone, but it didn't appear on my sub par camera, so I watched it move further in the same direction then it appeared to zig zag slightly then just fade out as if it were never even there.

Still looking to the north I pointed at the sky to my wife and she started to track the same flashing light.  The light had an ebb and a flow to it, sometimes flashing brilliantly and other times more like an aircraft collision light through some haze. I stepped into the yard to land mark the Big Dipper so I could reference some trajectory.  I found it a bit further north and west than the north star, a third of the distance past the north star to the big dipper in distance.  In the next four minutes it shifted closer than the north star and further east of it at an approximate degree shift of 25 to 30 degrees. During one of the blinks I saw it shift nearly 5 degrees in the sky before that particularly bright prolonged flash ended.  The flashes metered 2-6 seconds in interval, and only lasted a second or two per flash.  The flashes lacked an exact meter of interval. The movement was mostly left to right which is  West to East.  Sometimes the object blinked stationary.  Other times it would move several degrees East South East. The type of light emission ranged between a super bright star to a dim star.

I am an amateur astonomer who takes photos out my window.  I was trying to get some photos of Jupiter before I would have to leave for work at 9:30pm.  As I was setting up my scope, I saw a solid red object fly by from left to right (north to south).  I thought it was a small private airplane, but I wondered why the red light did not blink.   I looked out the window a few minutes later, and this object was flying directly over my head, northeast to southwest.  I put my head out the window and listened carefully, but there was absolutely no sound. I went about setting up my scope.   A few minutes later, this object flew above my head again, but in the opposite direction, from southwest to northeast.  It was flying quite fast, but suddenly stopped still and hovered.  I grabbed a pair of binoculars and looked at it.  It was two solid red lights that were not blinking.  Suddenly, a bright green light flashed several times between the two red lights.   At this point I grabbed ! my Iphone and took a video.  The object sat still for a minute or so, then moved slightly down and to the right, then reversed to the left.  Again, it sat for still for a minute or so.  Then it moved upward, and even seemed to be approaching me.  Then it flew out of sight to the southeast.

I witnessed a bizarre event on Friday May 4, 2018, in the South Western sky, along with several relatives, between 8:45PM and 10:00PM EST. in Chapin, South Carolina 29036.  It involved up to seven [7] multicolored [red, blue, green, white and yellow] round entities along with a transforming white ""mother"" ship (?) having 5 retangular windows.  The multiple colored UFOs are in the Lake Erie, Ohio, videos and seem to be exact duplicates to what has been seen in other states and countries and London, England.  They were also here on 09May2018. The entities were NOT stars, as all five colors were visible with binoculars at the same time and they would flash their colors at random like a police car.  The binoculars are powerful enough to see Jupiter's moons.  Two were following the ""mother ship"" [pictures attached] then stopped.  That's when bursts of energy like heat lightening were seen [flash] in outer space.   What happened next was and is the real story and all of us saw the same thing.  The multicolored entities were zig zaging all over the place as if they were controlled by a mouse on a PC.  Up, down, left, right, diagonally and rotationally.  Days after I thought about it and could have it been a war in space?  At first we thought that the white light was a planet or the International Space Station.  That's when I took a look at the white object with binoculars and saw what I perceived as five horizontal retangular windows.  They were black like a human DNA chart.  The others also looked at the objects with the binoculars and they all confirmed as to what I saw.  What we witnessed was so bizarre we thought it was possibly a Holographic image, laser or military aircraft but they were way too far out in space.  We also had two commercial jets fly over [9:45PM-10:00PM]  while all of this was happening and the entities were way above the jets. My IQ is 88 percentile.  Others included a Corporate Comptroller and an Anesthesiologist among others.  I am retired and have been in the public arena having appeared on CNN in 1990.

Incident Report:  The following is a report of the occurrences of the evening of 5/5/18 in Burbank, CA, at 7:32 PM. While speaking with a family member on my cell phone in my own backyard, I looked up into the due westerly direction of the dusk sky (which occured at 7:30 PM that evening)  I noticed something approaching in the sky at approximately a 35 degree angle to my reference on the ground.  I thought it looked like a mylar balloon or at least a highly reflective metal of some kind.   I quickly realized the object was actually moving in my direction, slowly it appeared at first.  I cannot say for certain but I would have put its altitude at approximately 300-500 ft.  As it approached, I noticed that it had flat sides on the top and the bottom of the object and was a diamond type of shape, with 8 sides.  Four equal sides on top and four below, similar to two pyramids turned towards each other at the base.  The lower portion of the object coming into clear view as it passed at 90 degrees to me I could see that it too had four equal sides matching the top.  The underside seeming slightly darker, I imagine, because of its reference to the falling sun on the upper portion of the object.  The sky was  lit by a fair amount of sunlight still.   The object made no sound whatsoever.  It left no trail of exhaust or describable propulsion of any kind that I could see.    I was shocked to see the object traveled more or less directly over my home and continued on a due easterly direction at a speed that I also cannot say for certain however, again, if having to choose a speed I would say it maintained a speed of between 50-100 mph.  Probably closer to the 50 side I believe.   I had the presence of mind while it was directly over me  to open up my camera app and start snapping in its now eastern reference to me at about 30 degrees where it passed behind some trees and I lost sight of it.  I just aimed in the objects direction snapping two photographs as it was on its easterly course just before it passed out of view.  Information embedded in the photos state the time of the photos at 7:32 PM establishing the exact time of the occurrence.  I had approximately a 120 degree view of the sky and it completely passed through that view in that 20-30 seconds.  The object in the pictures can be seen at just above and to the right of the tree.  Upon zooming in the flat sides of the object as well as its diamond shape can be discerned. If comparing its size to the full moon I would have to say that at its closest point, when at a 90 degree reference to me, it would have been about the size of the full moon itself. Interestingly, the path of the object appeared to violate FAA airspace as it crossed the north/south orientation of both outgoing and incoming air lanes about a mile from the south end of the runway at Bob Hope Ineternational Airport.  I live just south of the airport and see the planes using these air lanes all day. Perhaps related, or perhaps not, I wanted to mention that perhaps 20 minutes prior to the incident I witnessed four black hawk helicopters in a line formation coming into what appeared to be a landing at the airport from the south.  I have no idea if this is related or coincidence.  The helicopters had no describable insignia that I can recall.  All black. Attached are the two photographs I took.

At around 10:45 PM CST, I happened to be up yet and noticed a pulsing light in the sky from my bed located mostly in the westward, to slightly north direction halfway above the horizon.  What made me look twice and observe for over 15 minutes was that this object was emitting a pulse of light in an irregular interval as well as at different speeds.  At some times, the object would emit a slower pulse of light lasting maybe a second, but then at other times the object would emit a more rapid pulse of light lasting maybe half the duration as the slow pulse.  As I said, the emission of light was also seemingly irregular.  It would emit light maybe every three to four seconds, and as rapidly as every two seconds, but mostly emit light in a slow manner. When it traversed the sky it almost seemed to travel slightly more south-south-east rather than east as time went on.  So, the point I’m getting at is that the orbit of this object didn’t seem to be in a straight line.  I add this because we were starting to analyze the information and evidence at hand to determine if this was a satellite or not.  I would imagine that a satellite would proceed in a straight line and not slightly deviate like this object was seeming to do.  Also, we were considering that a rotating satellite may cause a reflection which would appear to be a burst of light like we were seeing, but not different pulse types unless in was rotating in multiple directions or out of control, which of course would be unlikely and not typical. Finally, it did seem as I was watching this object further, that at times when it wasn’t emitting light that I could see a faint bit of light (perhaps sunlight bouncing off of it; which would suggest that this object was in orbit around Earth) and kind of follow it, but this wasn’t always true.  The French doors I was watching this object through from bed is a typical place that I stare quite a bit before falling asleep.  This is the first time I have seen anything like it.  I would be curious if anybody else saw this or if there is an explanation to what I saw. Thank you!",2018-04-13T00:00:00,42.203,-88.9598

Spring of 2016 I just happen to look up one night while my dogs are going outside and I noticed these white lights or round spheres.,Murfreesboro,TN,2018-05-14T20:00:00,light,8 hours,"Occurred : 5/14/2018 20:00  (Entered as : 05/14/18 20:00) Reported: 5/14/2018 8:39:49 PM 20:39 Posted: 5/15/2018 Location: Murfreesboro, TN Shape: Light Duration:8 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/141/S141498.html,"In the Spring of 2016, I just happen to look up one night while my dogs are going outside and I noticed these white lights or round spherical shape white light that were just above the tree between mybackyard and my neighbor's backyard. I noticed every time I'd gone outside at night that these lights were there in the sky.  Sometimes they we're in different areas above that tree and I could see them move or spin etc. But most always where all between  the neighbors houses and mine in the backyards. with the naked eye you can see them moving and even changing shape if they were down low enough. well I didn't think much of them as time passes i just kept seeing them and the sky above the houses and trees then in August of 2017, I was out at 2:45 a.m. on my back patio and I did happen to look up and there were a few of these lights above the Treetops well I was yelling at my dogs to come in cuz I wanted to go back to bed and so I stepped back to the door and flickered my back porch light on and off quite quickly trying to get the dogs attention and it just so happened it was a red Christmas lights and I had never taken out at that time. After I flickered the light a few times I stepped back on my patio and I yelled at them again to come in and I looked up and one of these bright white lights Round probably the size of a very large oversized beach ball solid white orb type spherical light and as it got to the outer edges that was translucent but still white to some degree and in my mind I didn't want to think about what it was and so I just talk to it like it was a dr! one or something of that nature because if I had really stop to think I probably would have freaked out. So I started asking questions like what are you doing out this late what are you filming what are you doing why are you up there every single night and different locations of this neighborhood what are you trying to find out.  It made no noise it was silent my dogs didn't react to it they just sat there and so I just kind of said to it I think you better leave and I pointed up at the sky and it left. So every night since then except when it's raining these things are out there. There is any number of them from 1 to 7 I've counted in the sky. Now they are in different locations some brighter than others some dim. I live in what's called a circle rd. so you can step on my backyard and all you see are everybody's backyard and the road that's in front of my house goes around this circle of homes. These lights are usually between my house my neighbors, then across the street I've seen them. Down the block to the left of my home which is about five or six houses down and then the other way to the right they've been out down as far as three or four homes. They hang out as dusk comes in just before 8pm. They are at house top level or Treetop level or the telephone poles the wires or just above those and higher.  Then actually I can see them when they are moving up to where planes fly I've seen them actually go.  I've got many photos and videos over months. I've had probably 10 people come out nobody knows what these things are. Everybody's just amazed they change shape size the jump around almost like go dancing. They had different colors in them blues and greens and when they change shapes it almost reminds me of like when you see a dandelion and it's got those white cloud like things all around the seeds imagine that being sucked in and coming out being sucked in and coming out they do that like pulse. Another movement they do is where it's like a hamster wheel and then something spins with inside of itself and in photos you can see several orbs or light spot within the light source. These things are just amazing and just don't know what they are.  Earlier this year I contacted mufon and they came out and the time they did their investigation which was several months ago it was really odd because what I see around my home and just told you about is not what we experienced. When they were here we did capture some orb type things on video. These were not the white light up in the sky but were privacy fence level. We had our camera phones up on zoom to search the sky cuz that's were I see them but as we panned our camera phones down level we caught up to six white orbs type lights in my backyard. They were not presenting themselves as white spinning and moving like when they are in the sky.  What was in my backyard were change shape orbs from colors of orange and yellow but would begin as white. You could even see like rings of a tree or spine type things in the center of them and a few of the orbs we have on video like 19 minutes long. That's a very cool video to watch. In one way it was kind of disappointing because they weren't the lights in the sky that I see every night or it didn't present itself like when it came down to the sky and was in front of me. After that investigation I have not seen what we captured that one night. I've been seeing the white light orb type things in the sky around my home. I still have been sending mufon pictures and video of what I keep seeing every night but because she has no idea what they are disney know how or want to proceed. They at mufon haven't come back out to see these white light orbs in the sky. They dont know how to have me capture them where she can see them better or wants me to have them next to something so distance and size could be figured. Bit its dark at night so phone lines tree tops etc don't show up just the white light. I don't know it's just kind of frustrating. I can't find anyone that seems to know anything about what they could be. No one from any kind of Space or Universal profession like from local college won't retire my emails. I don't know who else to ask what these things could be and why there here around my house and our neighborhood.  They remind me sometimes of the Marfa lights only they're probably closer to me than those are from people who see them. Then also someone had mentioned to me about watching the video that NASA had put out about a tether that came loose in space and I guess either causing noise or bright light and all these white lights rushed to it and surrounded it and they didn't have an explanation for them and nobody else did either. Aanyway I don't know anyone else that knows what they are so I've now decided to report to other website like this one in hopes to find help in discovering what they are. Thank you!

Multiple occasions of white lights jetting across the sky and coming to a complete stop.   Only one day have I seen a military aircraft in the area, and it was an army blackhawk helicopter flying over during the day.  Could have been flying towards the nuclear plant, which is a UFO hotspot in our area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This account comes from my now deceased sister.  She told me about this occurrence about a month after the fact, in 1978.  I remember her relating the incident to me well, even now.  As a matter of fact, I remember asking her many times about her story, thinking she might be putting me on.  She swore she wasn't.  I had no reason, then or now, to disbelieve her, as she never lied to me about anything. My sister, was working late night at a country club as a waitress, in a city about an hour from home.  It was not unusual for her to come home late at night.  As it was springtime, the weather at the time was not bad.  The road to our home was at the end of a hollow, connected by a narrow, two lane road, off Hickory Tree Road.  After passing the neighbor's milk farm, she rounded a bend near an open pasture, which could be seen very well from the road.  It was at this point, she reported that her car, a 69 Pontiac Firebird, suddenly lost power and stopped on the road. She stopped the car, put it park, and tried to restart the car.  It was then she noticed a large, red sphere floating over the pasture to the right of the car, a few hundred yards away.  Front the vantage point of the road, which is elevated above the field and separated by a ravine, she could see the craft moving over the field.  She often vented her window, as she was a smoker, so it is possible she could hear any motor outside her car on this barely traveled road. It was at this time she said she must have blacked out or fainted, as she awoke later, a few hours later, confused and frightened.  The car started up right away, so she drove the to the end of the road home. As my family lived on this road for years, i was able to come back and see the spot where the incident occurred.  While we no longer live in that location, the road and the pasture are still in use, and people still live in that location.  I have even checked this location via Google Maps to see if it was still the same.  I am relating this story for my sister, who passed away some six years later of cancer, as she did not report it during her short lifetime.  She never changed her story, or the details of the incident, before her death.",2018-04-05T00:00:00,36.4554,-82.2088

The date above is not accurate. Back between may '88 & july '89, I saw a UFO in CT.  It was a LARGE triangular one with lights.  Moved rather slowly, I'd say 40mph if that over Bridgeport CT.  Fact is I was a cop at the time on duty.  Sitting on the booking entry roof making out my end of shift reports & killing 20 min as shift was ending when I spotted this large thing heading almost directly towards me.  While looking at it & realizing it was nothing I ever saw before, I radio'd in my car number ID & said, ""Any reports of a UFO coming in now""?  Then the dispatchers mic keyed in & I can hear about a dozen call takers in the background, laughing, when the dispatcher says ""Not until you""!  I said, ""well, I am looking directly at one now""!  Again, the dispatcher keyed his mic & there was a bunch of background laughter ""where is it?""  I said ""Im on the booking roof, get out of the basement (of City Hall where dispatch was) & lo! ok to your right, HURRY and you will see it!""  So I walked down the ramp as my PD building hid city hall from my view & saw them all coming out to see.  It had to be about 11:15 pm or 11:45pm, cant recall if I was on early or late shift.  By that, I mean so at any given time, there's at least half the cars patrolling, so one shift ends at 11:30, the next 2nd shift ends at 12:00am. So they all came out & were in awe at the size of it.  I radio'd the dispatcher to ask to call the airport as that was about 3-5 miles away and it was heading in that direction & should have had that on radar although this was less than 1,000 feet off the ground.  I don't know what height they pick things up.  Dispatcher said airport says cant see it, nothing on radar.  Within 20 minutes, it was out of sight, but appeared to turn to head in another direction, as if an angle of a triangle, not a U-turn, back towards heading North(?) towards Massachusettes (55 miles away).  I later saw a friend & she too saw it above Stratford. Next day read in the paper that it was spotted up the Hudson river if I recall right. Later over the years watching UFO series documentarys, I believe I saw one that was in Europe that looked like what I saw.  This was huge, I'd say like a football field size at least, even at that height & distance away, less than a half a mile. It was a huge thing, about the size of a football field I'd say, with 6 or 8 lights in a ""V"" shape.  There still may be people that work in the complaint bureau or can be easily located to verify this incident I witnessed even though 30 years ago.  With the internet now, it has piqued my interest especially having seen a show recently that showed what I saw. I'm only stating this now as over the years seeing the shows & documentarys, I believe I saw an episode where one was spotted if I recall right, in Europe like the one I saw, but think that was early 90's.",2018-04-05T00:00:00,41.19200961038961,-73.20145714285715

I’m not exactly sure how old I was.   Me my dad and my little brother had heard there was going to be a meteor shower on this particular night.  So we set are alarms for around 1:00 am in the morning because the people on the news had said that 1:00am was when we could see the most meteors.   At the time we lived in a semi-rural area.  We lived in a cul-de-sac of about 12 house down a straight street, and houses spread out around us.  Behind our house was a field and to the right of this field was a baseball field and beside the baseball field a school with a playground.  Of course at 1:00 am no one was around and we lived in an already quiet neighborhood during the day so at night it was eerily quiet.  We had a lot of big trees in our yard but the baseball field was completely open so we decided it would be the perfect place to gaze up at the night sky.  We took some blankets out to the baseball field and laid them down on the dewy grass.  We laid down and looked up at the sky.  The stars were out and the moon was bright.  It was a clear night.  We laid out for about 20 minutes and we saw a lot of what looked like shooting stars which were meteors, of course.  Then I noticed something high up in the sky.  It looked like nothing I had seen before.  It was in the shape of an L.  It was large compared to the stars around it.  It looked like it had windows or lights down the base of the L.  It was still too almost like it was hovering.   I immediately told my dad and brother to look at it.  It was obviously some kind of flying object.  They both brushed and laughed it off.  My dad couldn’t tell me what it was.  He didn’t know what it was.  So we just kind of ignored it.   About 20 more minutes went by and we decided to go inside.  I looked up at the sky again to check back in on the mysterious object a! nd it wa s gone.  I had not even noticed it had left.  My dad and brother still say it was nothing but I know it wasn’t.

It's something that I've been living with for many years and I finally want to share my story.   Back in 1991, I was around 14 years old and I was playing in the garage.  I heard my mom screaming my name, I knew something wasn't right.  I saw my mom staring at an object hovering above the tree's inside our property.   I did not hear any sound or movement, however the aircraft was amazingly well crafted.  It was something not from this world,  I did not see any nuts or bolts.  It was silver colored, with a tinted shield.   After I stared at it for a min or so, this ufo started flashing its lights that where surrounding the aircraft.  The lights were blinking as if they were trying to communicate with us.   Then it flew away, and I jumped over the wall to follow it.  It stayed for a few seconds and then disappeared within a fraction of a second, like the speed of light.   Til today I think of this and I'm glad to finally find a place to share my story and experience.

It turned on several more lights that appeared to be spot lights that gave a loud noise when they came on.  One light was centered right on us.  The craft then made a loud screeching sound as it turned around.  It then was silent again and it hovered off over the top of the trees.

In 1949 I was seven years old.  My sister and a girl friend were both seventeen years old and we were walking to school together in Moody, Texas, on a snowy morning, possibly in December.  It was around 0730 hrs. in the morning.  The street was lined with mostly old two story homes and an empty lot where a house once stood was where we witnessed a saucer shaped spacecraft and three small individuals.  We did not see the craft land but witnessed its departure. The area was covered in several inches of snow but under the silver craft there was no snow and the ground appeared to be dry and at the edge of the melted snow under the craft, the weeds were slightly scorched.  We stood possibly thirty foot from the craft when we came upon it and there was a circular pedestal that the craft appeared to be supported upon.  This pedestal was also silver in color and approximately four to five foot tall, maybe three foot in diameter and the craft was around thirty to forty foot wide and saucer-shaped.  The craft may have been twelve to fourteen foot tall in the center with what appeared to be a second level due to the smaller saucer shape on the top of the craft.  There were no windows visible and no lights are remembered.  The craft was slick with mo rivets or seams and slightly dull in appearance.  There were some kind of faded blackish symbols that appeared to be present on the craft, but not anything we could read.  My height at the time was around three and a half foot tall and I base these measurements in relation to my height.  There was no sound as the craft was sitting there. When we first saw the craft, there was a slanted silver colored ramp under it, and at the bottom of the ramp there was what appeared to be a human-like figure standing motionless, staring intently toward us.  The ramp was only visible from the side.  Within a minute or so, two other identical figures appeared on the ramp and they smoothly descended to the ground without moving their legs.  The ramp appeared to be a conveyor-belt of some kind.  The two who appeared together walked nearly out from beneath the craft toward the three of us then stopped about ten foot away.  They were all about my height, were thin and while their heads appeared to be enlarged, they were enlarged only slightly but appeared elongated in the back.  They had large black shiny eyes, nearly twice the size of a human’s eyes that almost appeared Asian.  They did not blink as I recall! I cannot remember any ears or mouths but there was a small nearly triangle nose-like protuberance present without nasal openings and a small narrow, elongated chin.  I cannot remember for certain but I do recall there seemed to be something different about their hands and I think there were only four fingers on each hand.  These human-like figures appeared to be covered in a light green tight felt-like material and except for shadow-like temporary creases, there were no separate uniform type seams flaps, pockets or belts. No additional body parts were visible.  Their faces and hands were identical to the clothing in color.  Sexual organs were not observed.  They appeared identical to each other.  Of the two who approached the three of us, one nodded at us as he moved his head, apparently to observe the surrounding landscape.  After possibly four to five minutes of looking around the two returned to the ramp and, floated up and inside the craft.  After they were inside, the original being turned and also floated up into the craft.  None of then uttered a sound audible to us.  Once they were inside I particular! ly remember the ramp rapidly moving silently up and the closure did not leave a ridge or any indication of its presence on the bottom of the craft once inside, and in seconds, the craft emitted a low pitch, barely audible sound that may have been in conjunction with a slight vibration in the air that we all felt more than we heard, and the cylinder the craft had been resting on silently raised rapidly up into the craft and the craft immediately raised straight upward to just a little higher than the two story dwelling on an adjacent property, then hesitating for a few additional seconds suspended in the air motionless, it swung sideways and upward. In less than two or three seconds it flew completely out of sight!  The spacecraft did not rotate. None of us felt afraid or threatened while this event was happening.  We just stood there, silently watching and to this day, I cannot conceive of why we were so complacent about what was happening right before our eyes.  As soon as the craft had completely disappeared my sister and her pal were terrified and started screaming, crying and we ran to my father’s business which was about four blocks away.   My father was a pharmacist and he was also the Fire Chief of the City Volunteer Fire Department.  Upon hearing of this incident from my sister and her friend, he alerted the police and the volunteer fire department and several men quickly gathered at the site. While the firemen were inspecting the circular area that was under the craft, they were amazed that all the ice and snow was absent and the grasses appeared scorched.  I cannot remember the time element, but shortly after the fire alarm was sounded and the firemen assembled at the location, the State authorities (police, etc.! ) and a rather large assemblage of U.S. Army soldiers arrived.  The U.S. Army quickly roped off the area and no one was allowed to be on the property.  At some point that day a military officer reported to my father and gave him a clipboard with forms and a Geiger counter and re-quested that he take frequent radiation readings at the site and write them down on the forms he received from the Officer.  My dad complied. I cannot remember how long the site was under investigation.  The area however was and still re-mains within few miles of a WWII military ammunitions manufacturing site and today I understand this site remains functioning as some kind of nuclear research or production facility and is off limits to civilians. After the officer visited my father, my sister and I were told to never mention this event to anyone.  We were also forbidden to discuss the event at home.  Whether my sister’s friend was also informed to keep this event a secret from anyone, I do not know. A few months after this event my family moved to another city in Texas.  While the U.S. Army did retrieve the forms my father had filled out with radiation readings, he was told he could keep the Geiger counter and it remained in his possession for another thirty-plus years.  The radiation readings were high according to my father. I have tried to present this narrative unembellished and to the best of my memory as is possible.  I can certainly assure you, this event was deeply imprinted upon my mind.  In recent years before the passing of my sister and father, we discussed this event only one single time, and together we maintained the exact identical recollection after many years of being silent.  Some things you simply cannot forget. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes himself as a medical professional, Ph.D..  PD))",,31.291,-97.3684

HOWEVER, they seem to be hovering and only move so slightly and in a flight path unlike any regular plane I've ever heard of. Even as of last night, three to four of them are position in an almost quadrilateral type formation.  They seem to be just 'watching us'.  The objects we observe seem to give off a blue-ish hue...yet lights (flickering orange/green sometimes emanate from them).  They seem to almost react intelligently as I am wandering my yard trying to keep focused on them.  They flicker sometimes that it almost seems impossible to focus.  I have seen these thin! gs so often that any notion of considering it to be anything 'recognizable or explained away' diminishes.  My family and I also have witnessed red and green lighted low-flying aircraft in the skies on two of these occasions.  They don't seem to perceive the objects and 'they' in turn seem unaffected, as well.  It's freaky.  Has anyone else seen these?

This is really a report of 3 observations of chevron shaped lights. 1.  In the late 70s, there was a report of strange night-time lights published in the newspaper we received at our rural home.  This must have been the Des Moines Register.  They included a photo in the report.  My memory of the photo is that it showed about 5 chevron shaped white lights against a black sky.  The chevon shapes (shallow Vs) each had one very distinctive characteristic; one side of each V had an offset, or kink, in it — it wasn’t straight.  This offset was in just one side.  The other side of the V was straight.  It should be possible to find this document; however,  I’m afraid my estimate when this happened is +/- several years. 2.  A short time later, perhaps a month or two, I was outside and looked up at the sun with my eyes closed.  I noticed nothing unusual, but when I looked away I saw several vivid and sharp chevron shaped retinal after-images.  There were about 3.  They were the exact same shape as those in the newspaper report.  The retinal after-images slowly faded and were gone in a minute or so.  The approximate date and time of this observation is what I entered on the report form. 3.  About 2 years ago, I was outside my current home.  It was sunny but I did not look at the sun. Suddenly a chevron shaped after-image appeared.  There was only 1 V this time.   It was similar to those I saw 40 years earlier but not identical.  One side of the V was straight and the other was not.  But instead of a simple offset it was wrinkled. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

When crossing Hostmark road between the schools the very large saucer was gleaming in the sun.  It was a rare almost cloud free day.  It was hovering above Bangor submarine base I would guess.  I called my buddy back as he was 20 feet ahead of me asking what was that thing.  He and I walked back and forth across the road to gauge its distance...like when the moon seems to be following you when you were a kid in a car....know what I mean?  It was far away and shiny metallic like a newly machined part with a brilliant finish.  It had a large dome....almost half circle in the upper middle.  It had a real classic UFO shape.  At this time I had already seen the Goodyear blimps twice.  It looked nothing like a blimp.  I remember it like it was yesterday because it was shocking....and no reports in the paper!  It was AM so the sun was to our backs making this a fantastic view of the only shocking thing I have ever seen.  I am reluctant to (but could try) contact my buddy in case he does not remember, but I think he is in the area.  After we returned from the track the UFO was gone so I never saw it move...not even a millimeter.  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",2018-03-29T00:00:00,47.75370000000001,-122.6123

On June 18, 2005, I was running sound for Southern Oregon University commencement.  The ceremony ended at exactly 11:00 AM.   As I walked south across the football field the crowd was moving north toward the platform.  There wasn't anyone within a hundred feet of me when I noticed a brown sphere roughly 30 to 40 feet in diameter, silently floating north to south about 800 feet above me.  Eight hundred feet is pattern altitude for aircraft landing at the Ashland airport.  The sphere would have been on the downwind leg.  I have a pilot's license so I know the Ashland landing pattern. I didn't have a phone with a camera in 2005 so all I could do is stand and watch. The sphere moved slowly, I'd guess less than 100 mph, for twenty to thirty seconds.  Then it abruptly exited at an oblique angle away from me at fantastic speed.  It was gone from sight in less than two seconds. The weather was perfect with blue sky and only a few puffy clouds. Up to that time I was rather agnostic regarding UFOs.  A year later at the Sundial Bridge in Redding, California, I photographed UFOs inadvertently, taking pictures of the bridge.  Since that time, I have amassed twenty hours of daylight UFO video.  I can capture UFOs at will now that I know where and how to look.  We are under continuous presence of extraterrestrials.  The number of alien spacecraft around this planet is staggering. I have video proof. I met with the regional director from MUFON in Portland, Oregon, in about 2008.  He blew off all of my video showing me one of his nighttime videos, a tiny bright stationary light in a black sky saying, ""Now that's a UFO.""  My take is they don't want real UFO evidence because that would end the necessity for MUFON. Think what you want but I know the truth.  Airliners have an entourage every time I follow one with my video camera. Every time.  It requires a very fast shutter speed to capture these objects making my videos look dark due to the camera settings even though all of my video is shot in daylight. If you want to see it done contact me.  I get results every time I shoot. Every time. It's no mystery and I'm sure authority knows exactly what I know, but they aren't talking. Science is about peer reviewed research.  I have scores of followers who have duplicated my results. To that end my research has been peer reviewed and affirmed. My guess is I won't hear from you because like MUFON once the cat is out of the bag you are out of work. It's up to you.  I'm over being recognized as one who has blown the lid off of the UFO secret.  I know what I know and that's all I care about.

Dim red/rust lights on each corner with diffuse blue/purple glow in middle. Silent. Preface:  I understand submitting this 2 years later may show little merit. My friend and I both saw this craft, I did not report it to the authorities and have only informed my family and close friends and have been labeled a ""loony"" on this topic. I grew up flying glider airplanes and have been a hobby aviationist my entire life.  I am knowledgeable on the topics of aircraft mechanisms and modes of lift. This event has burned itself into my mind and I cannot let it go.  I discovered this website today.  What is prompting me to share my story is the report located at http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/130/S130339.html   as it matches my sighting nearly exactly and is only a few days separate from my friend and I's experience. At approximately 03:15 I was standing outside in the ally way of my friend’s apartment with another friend who was smoking a cigarette.  I was star gazing as I am from the midwest and the elevation of Boulder offers a unique and clear view of the stars I am not often afforded back home.  While gazing up I noticed that suddenly stars began disappearing.  As more and more stars were blotted out I was able to make out that a large, pitch black, distinctively solid Triangular craft that was moving North to South at a slow speed at what I estimated to be 500-800ft directly above my friend and I. Startled, I grabbed my friend who was also able to make out the craft as well when I pointed to it and indicated its heading.  The craft was initially only seen by me as I had been peering at the stars in the exact location that it began to fly over us.  If this had not been the case I would have missed it entirely. The craft was a solid Triangle shape with 3 incredibly dim red/rust diffuse lights on each of its 3 corners. In the middle of the triangle was a larger, yet still very dim, blue-ish/purple diffuse glow.  I know this craft was a solid Triangle and not a boomerang shape as the stars blotted out were consistent with a complete triangle.  It maintained its direction with no spin or wobble with 1 of the dim red/rust lights “leading” or being the “front” of the craft. The craft slowly moved over us at a constant speed and over the apartments on the other side of the alleyway in a North to South heading.  If I had to estimate the speed of the craft I would put it between 50-90mph.  The craft was COMPLETELY silent.  Once past us the craft showed no engines or engine glow on the rear of the craft like a traditional airplane would.  The event lasted approximately 8-12 seconds.  I did not attempt to capture any footage as I knew my cellphone camera was garbage and did not want to risk looking at my bright screen and losing my view of the craft. I would not have shared my experience publicly if I had not seen the aforementioned report and the uncanny similarities between the two. The eeriness of the silence was what really startled me. Even a glider at that low of altitude produces the whooshing sound of wind passing over its wings.  I spent the rest of my vacation pointing out to my friend who experienced the event with me how the sounds of jets passing thousands of feet overhead can easily be heard and how bizarre and unique our experience was.",2018-03-29T00:00:00,40.024403601895735,-105.26873952606635

I make the same walk often and have never seen anything like this before this time, nor have I since this event. I believe that this event occurred somewhere between 1:30 and 2:00 Sunday morning.  I was walking through the neighborhood on my way home and noticed a star that looked out of place.  When I was able to find a break in both the branches of the trees above and the clouds then I was able to be certain that this was not a star.  It began to glow more brightly and then made some quick movements with angles that would form a triangle.  Once I knew that I was actually seeing something that was out of place I kept the object in sight and continued my walk home. With the craft in sight and well above the level of any clouds, I noticed that the white light that was coming from the craft was getting brighter and realized that it was descending very quickly and moving straight toward me.  In only a matter of seconds it was at the level of the street lamps, and I was now able to see that the craft was a sphere roughly the size of a basketball.  It was no longer emitting white light but had begun to glow red.  The red lights on this craft seemed to move in sort of a rubics cube manner and then it began to ascend back to about cloud level.   I walked the last about six blocks to my home with this craft not following me but staying within sight and almost leading me to my home. During this time the craft descended to within thirty to forty feet of me two more times.   Each time emitting white light when high up in the sky and glowing red when at street level.  The lights were broken up and moving rapidly on the outside of the craft and it sometimes appeared that there was no solid object but more of an organization of tiny lights moving in a cooperative manner through the air.  I was turning onto my street where I live at the fourth house down and was surprised at how un afraid I had been through the first two descents.  The craft then came down to within eight feet of the ground and still moving ahead of me, it went past and around to the other side of my neighbor’s house.  This last descent was when I first really got my anxiety up and being relieved to be at my house I went inside and tried to wrap my head around what I had just seen. Once inside my home I noticed a wound on my hand that looked like someone took a tiny spoon and scooped out a tiny bit of my hand.  There was no bleeding, it just was already grown over with a very smooth concave scab.  I am pretty certain that I did not have such a wound when I left my last destination to head towards my house.  The next day I also had what felt like a sunburn on my face.  When I looked in the mirror my face appeared red but unlike a sunburn it this burn was evenly spread throughout every part of my face.  Even under my nose and in the creases around my nose that are rarely hit by the sun was burned.  This burn lasted about a day and a half before I began peeling and within a day or so my face had peeled completely.  I am certain I was not burned by the sun.  I suspect that the craft was burning my skin when it was emitting the white light.  My face was the only part of me that was exposed and when the craft was at cloud level the white light seemed to foc! us right on my face as I looked directly back at the source.  There was no visible beam of light, but I could see and feel this light much more than the glowing red light that would be seen when the craft was at street level. The basic description of this object would be a bright white light when high in the sky and a formation of small red lights when at a level where it could be seen easily.    It could make this type of altitude change in barely over a second and during the first two descents the mass of the object hovered completely still while the red lights rotated around a central mass. very rapidly.   It made no sound and was almost the size of a basketball.   The third descent was the only time I saw the craft move in any direction other than up or down while near the ground.  The red lights would move rapidly almost as if they were being worked very quickly in the same manner a rubic’s cube would be solved only spherical and with thousands of tiny red lights instead of the 54 panels one would find on the standard rubic’s cube.  The object moved slowly as it went around towards the back of my neighbor’s house.  As it hovered across my neighbor’s house it maintained a height just below th! e level of the first-floor gutters on the house. It seemed to glow more of a golden or white glow that would overpower the red lights and then fade back to a low enough level that the red lights could be seen once again. I was trying to post about this shortly after the event but I had a lot of trouble using my keypad to form the words that I had intended on typing.  This continued for until I had slept a full night’s sleep.  It felt as if my mind was partially disabled for a bit of time after seeing this object.",2018-04-13T00:00:00,40.55069822812846,-105.07729501661129

From my perspective, the lights I saw where approx. 2 inches apart, while all other aircraft in that were in the sky were about 2 centimeters apart; so I assumed that the aircraft was either close or really big.  The triangle lights were moving at about or maybe a little faster than the other aircraft in the sky (and any aircraft nearby were headed towards the Newark Int Airport.

After flying at the same speed of the aircraft it suddenly stopped at a quick speed hovered for a second and took off in the opposite north east (after heading north-south) direction from Newark.

As I looked at this light it didn’t take long for me to rule out it being a helicopter.  What I was looking at was actually at least 3 very bright, white balls of light.  These balls of light looked to possibly be connected.  And directly above and below these balls of lights was either a long, thin stream of light or possibly some sort of lit up structure.  Sort of reminded me of a jack, like you would find in a children’s game.  Only it was a brilliant white color.  As I began to study this object, I began to notice that the balls of white light were actually rotating around fairly slow.  There was definitely no sound whatsoever.  I live out in a more rural area of the co! unty.  There was not a cloud in the sky when I observed this object.  I had a very clear, unobstructed, view of this object.  It was fairly high up in the sky, but not nearly as high as other objects such as stars or possible satellites.  Things such as that can definately be ruled out.

One object was to my right, emitting green light, lower in the sky than the other and moving more slowly. The other was a bright pale yellow, much higher to the left and moving rapidly and erratically in a wide path. I cannot tell the shape as I am mainly seeing bright light but the light appears to be circular or oval. I am in a flight path for both McCollum Field and Dobbins Air Reserve Base so initially I thought it might be a helicopter or small plane, but the way the object was moving I do not believe would be possible for a known aircraft.

This time however, that object was suddenly joined by a bright green object.  I did not see the green object arrive but it was not there when I first saw the yellow light.  The objects seem to be circling each other but not in any organized fashion.  They are darting back and forth. There appear to be small red lights around the edges of the green object.  I don’t know if the green object is the same one I saw to the right the morning and evening before. I checked McCollum Field’s flight schedule, and there are no scheduled flights or arrivals at this time.  There was only one flight, an arrival at 12:05 AM from Scottsdale that might possibly be heading over my area.  I don’t know how to contact Dobbins to ask whether they have any planes in the air.  Do I need to report this to the police or to Dobbins?  As for my background I am a 56 year old female, currently unemployed but have been a Pharmaceutical/Bio-Tech Project Manager for the past 15 years.  I usually try to find a logical explanation for everything but I also strongly believe there can be no common explanation for some events.",2018-01-25T00:00:00,33.96188745901639,-84.51021319672131

The incident occurred on 3/30/18.  I was lying on my couch facing the large windows (which face west) in our living room (curtains were open).  It was after 8:30pm.  I saw a glowing orb in the night sky.  I had seen the full moon that night but I knew it was on the other side of the house.  Still, I thought, “That’s not the moon is it?” and went up to the window for a better look.  I’m skeptical of UFO sightings but had to take a closer look. I ran outside.  There were some wispy clouds in the east but in the west the night sky was perfectly clear.  There were big trees in the way so I walked onto the sidewalk and saw a dirigible shaped aircraft that was completely glowing or lit up.  The entire thing was lit up or glowing, much like the moon.  In the low center of the aircraft, off to the right, was a blinking red light.  The craft was flying low (although well above the trees) and traveling at a steady pace and headed north.  I saw no exhaust or smoke. I walked up the street and followed it for a bit wishing I had my camera.  I was completely sober.  I had just come back from a Good Friday program at my church.  At the closest range it was probably a little smaller than the size of my palm if held up away from me.  It seemed to be going away from me so was probably on a northwest course.  As I followed it I thought, “It’s probably a dirigible.”  But I’ve never seen anything like it. The blinking red light has made me think it’s something from earth, since that’s what all of our airplanes have on them.  But I’ve never seen anything like it.  Of course, I had never seen a stealth fighter before I actually saw one.  But why would the government make something that glows?",2018-04-05T00:00:00,33.775680842911875,-117.95888314176244

I live in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, and on Wednesday, Feb. 5, 2014, I witnessed the identical objects as in the aforementioned video. It was approximately 8pm after a large snowstorm, I was in the driveway shoveling when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye (north of my location), and was stunned by what I was looking at.  There was a ""swarm"" of bright lights circling, as if they were in a large tornado.  The objects were balls of amber/orange light with fairly long trails of sparks following them.  They moved identically to the objects in the video.  The objects were quite close to my location (approx. 1/2 a mile away), and the sky around the objects had a very pronounced white/orange glow to it. My first thought was fire works, but I heard no bang and the lights did not burn out.  I was able to focus on one object and follow it, and I can say with complete certainty that they were not birds, drones or paratroopers.  They were very bright, self luminous balls of light (like a ball of fire) moving quickly in every direction, but in the same swarm pattern.  I watched the objects for approximately 45 seconds to 1 minute, before running to the front door to tell my mother (who lived in the upstairs apartment at the time) to look out back.  It took  a couple of minutes to get her attention and by the time I was able to look again they were completely gone and the sky had returned to regular darkness, without the glow. This all took place over downtown Sarnia, and there was about 30% cloud cover, so I can say with certainty that they were all below cloud level.  Also, there were no unusual sounds, or airplanes overhead, as I was watching the objects.",2018-03-08T00:00:00,42.96978578947368,-82.31983842105264

I don't know whether what I saw this night was real or something I worked up a bit in my head. Since August 2017, I have seen red/orange orb UFO's flying near, and even directly above, my home in north Dayton.  But on this night in October, an approximate date and time, I was outside alone and saw from the west the now-familiar bright red glow (which, as it begins to move into view, appears incredibly large) as if one of the objects was about to approach from due west as was their most common direction of approach.  But this night the bright red glow did not seem to be moving, or moving west to east; instead, it appeared to be stopped 600 hundred or so yards west of me, low enough that it was actually hovering only around 10-12 feet above the ground in a neighbor's yard. While the the object appeared just as large as had all prior objects, this particular one was not only stationary, lower (at under treetop level), there were two other unusual occurrences.  First, there were shadows which seemed superimposed over the brilliant red light.  These shadows moved like humans except with jerkier movements; two or three were tall while one was short.   Second, while there was (as always) no sound produced by the object, while these shadows seemed to move in front of the red light, I heard what I can best describe as ""whispered internal static"" -- it was not something heard aurally, but more like feeling vibrations and recognizing these as speech, somehow. Though the red orbs have never made me the least bit nervous before, this night, after the object again lifted into the air following its traditional path of flight, I watched it only until it was about halfway through the route before going inside.  I wasn't nervous as much as I was confused by what I'd seen. I didn't trust myself and so I almost immediately decided it must have been neighbors with a Chinese lantern.  If it was, the lantern was as large as a one-story, 1800-square-foot house and the neighbors' shadows were somehow being projected as exceptionally tall, except for the one smaller one.  And, when I truly looked, there were no neighbors outside any house but mine that night; but, for some reason, that explanation made the most sense to me at the time.  Before I came into the house, as I watched this orb first lift above tree level while moving northeast, then straighten its path to move directly west-to-east, a family member came outside.  I told him the neighbors were setting off Chinese lanterns.  ""That's not a Chinese lantern,"" he replied.  ""And what neighbors?""   I have started to occasionally see these red orbs nearby again, starting in February; they had been absent since that last prior sighting in October.  And no, it was not a Chinese lantern; but, everything except the orb itself I'm going to say could have come from my imagination.",2018-03-08T00:00:00,,

When I asked him what saw, he said that he was seeing lights in the sky. We stopped our truck and got out to look.  Almost directly over us there were seventeen red lights moving from approximately SSW to NNE at a speed that I would estimate to be that characteristic of a very large jet (relatively slowly).  The lights were very large (when compared to the strobe lights generally seen on aircraft) and did not cast a beam or blink.   There was no other source of light visible around the red lights--no strobes like normal aircraft navigational lights etc..   There was only a slight noise as they passed--nothing like what I would have expected if these were seventeen large jet aircraft passing overhead.  The lights were evenly spaced (it isn't possible to accurate estimate the distance between them) and traveled in a very straight line from the time we saw them until they faded into the distance. I'd like to emphasize that these lights appeared to be very large.  Due to the lack of noise, I am assume the objects were at altitude and their large appearance was not due to the fact that they were at a low altitude. In the Characteristics of Object section, there is an option to indicate whether there were aircraft in the vicinity.  When the string of lights was quite a distance beyond us, an aircraft (assumed to be an aircraft based on strobe lights flashing) crossed the path of the red lights and continued on until it went out of sight.  The strobe lights never deviated from its apparent line of flight.",2018-03-08T00:00:00,45.3007,-117.09940000000002

It was a lightly stormy night with periodic heavy misting in the air so visibility was compromised.   All of us there tried explaining it away as lightning or a transformer shorting out or the like but all were forced to agree that none of our explanations fit.  The intensity of the lights was enough to light up between a quarter and half the sky.  At times it seemed there was a source low to the ground and other times it seemed high up in the sky, just judging by the relative brightness of the mists and clouds being lit and in which direction the brightness intensified.  The range and i! ntensity of colors, duration of the event, and overall unusual behavior and patterns suggested an event outside all of our experiences.

My wife and I were walking through the parking lot of the Pepin Center in Tampa, Florida, when I pointed out to her two lights in the north-northeast sky at approximately 20 degrees from the horizon. They were about the size and intensity of brightness as Sirius.  They were a thumb's distance apart and stationary. I pointed out to my wife that I didn't know of any constellation with stars that bright in the north sky in the Tampa area at this or any other time of the year.  After about a minute, the two stationary lights dimmed and then disappeared. Thoroughly perplexed as to what these were - - they were not satellites, meteorites, rockets/missiles,or aircraft landing lights.  Their altitude and actual size was impossible to determine. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Good evening Mr. Davenport: It's an honor to hear from you! I am very familiar with the landing lights of all manner of aircraft. I am both an aviation and astronomy buff and am well acquainted with both spheres of study. Within moments after this sighting, I did see a commercial airliner (by engine sound and configuration of landing and navigation lights, likely an Airbus A-319 or A-320 series or a Boeing 737) at about 5,000' AGL commencing a downwind (heading south for a north landing on Runway 35R) approach to Tampa International Airport(KTPA). That aircraft was due west when I spotted it - - I did wonder if anyone in it on its port side might have seen these two lights, but I suspect the lights were possibly too high and too far north to be seen in the field of vision of those in the cabin  - - I would love to know if someone did and was thinking that then!). The color of these lights was not typical of the landing lights of any aircraft that I have seen - - they were the same color, hue and intensity of self illuminated stars or reflective sunlight on satellites.  Although aircraft landing lights can and will often appear stationary, based on distance from, and the heading of, aircraft, such light inevitably moves or grows in intensity as it heads toward you.  Landing lights are seen either coming toward you or from the side, but would not be seen heading heading away from you.   My initial thought after knowing that these lights were not a normal part of the night sky for this part of the year was that they were satellites - - the major problem being that both of them did not move for several minutes but remained stationary.  Their fade out took about 5 seconds and was gradual and simultaneous - - both my wife and I were flummoxed by what we saw. If you have any other questions, please feel free to e-mail or call me at ((END ADDENDUM))",2018-03-29T00:00:00,28.006814358108112,-82.47646101351351

I witnessed my neighbor outside looking at the sky, he has never seen the stars as he is night blind.  I stepped out onto our shared porch and he asks what that light in the sky was.  I observed a bright white orb in the western sky, seeming to hover in place, my wife then stepped out to see what we were looking at.  She observed the same object. I attempted to Google the planets as I am not an astronomer.  The object stayed in place while I did this. I knew it wasn't Venus and far too bright to be a satellite.  Fifteen minutes later, convinced it must be a planet, I went back inside with my wife. 20 minutes later I stepped out to leave for the grocery store and it was just gone. I viewed this object myself for about 15 minutes, my neighbor was viewing it 5 minutes before I stepped out on the porch.  The light was brilliant white. It did not change intensity. No blinking, flashing, or any movement that I could discern.  My wife said she felt like it was shifting positions ever so slightly, but I did not notice this.  The sky was clear and stars were visible. We have regular air traffic in the western sky from our vantage point and have lived here for 4 years.

Monday 1-22-2018 330 am multiple witnesses..multiple objects lights..and one large craft!! Three lights in the sky blinking as if two on the side and on in the middle.  The sky was clear and no cloud cover.  Three of us watched these Lights blink off and on as they did not move.  Then suddenly three smaller craft arrived.  They showed up out of nowhere!  Two moved slow to the right and one began to climb at an incredible rate higher then the other objects and it was very bright.  As we watch this the largest object began to turn to it's right and I know because the way the lights moved.  As it turned, now this object had been sitting perfectly still for 10 minutes, and now it's moving and I can see that it's disk-shaped, and it's huge!   Then suddenly the area it was in seemed to magically have a cloud for it to vanish behind..it was as if it made it's own camo, and it was gone..sat and watched the other lights move away..about 13 minutes passed now...and now it's back!!!!  The largest is roated it's light back to it's original postion.  No cloud!!  Two of us decided to get in the car and go towards it.  As we headed towards the direction I saw what must have been five police cars some with there lights on no sirens some grouped together and other cutting up and down streets.  Then as I turned my vehicle away I saw a large..what I can only describe as ambulance type vehicle but twice as long white, no markings or plates??..with flashing red and orange lights .. When I got home I googled if anyone had seen anything..crazy cuz all these plates are suppose to be visible and then NASA even has a statement about being able to see the international space station tonight..now I don't recall anything in the paper about this, and I'm sure just like the eclipse we had everyone would of been outside to watch that..this was no space station..this was a large round craft with smaller craft in the same facility.  And the way it made it's own cloud!  I'm a complete skeptic but these wasnt what NASA said..this wasn't planets sattiles ...planets...it wasnt airplanes or helicopters..the planes would have been to close together and be able to hover at complete stand still.  And I'm aware helicopters can hover but the way it turned it was one large vechicle and vanished only to reappear..and the way the other smaller ones appeared out of thin air!!?!  And the bright one cutting be straight up.. commercial aircraft don't movie like that...  Yes the climb but the move towards a direction as they do.this cut throught the sky lime a razor higher and higher..fast!  then stopped...and as the large object made its first turn..the smaller bright craft was just gone, as if it bolted out of the atmosphere.  Also, the lights were not the same as a plane..very strange stuff. ((NUFORC Note:  We have attempted to contact by telephone the source of the report, but have not been successful in reaching him.

The craft appeared to be single glowing light and had no colored blinking lights on it as it flew like other aircraft in that area use all the time when taking off from the airport nearby.   The craft was not far from Mara Largo and the Palm Beach International Airport here in Palm Beach County and was flying away from the estate, but and not from it.  These craft are regularly seen in this area periodically and at times have been observed using strange devices in the Palm Beach County area.   In one instance when one of this type of craft were seen in 1996, the craft was flying at about 200 feet and as it got closer to where I was sitting across from a large wooded area in a park the craft released some form of electrical explosive device that exploded near the ground in the woods approx. 75 yards from where I was sitting.  Whatever kind of weapon it was it exploded into a perfect dome of bluish white light about 50 feet in height.  It was unbelievable, and without my military training, I would have been quite scared, I am sure.",2018-04-13T00:00:00,,
