It was around 1:00am,the sky was black and out beside us was a reservoir of some kind . At first I thought it was a remote control plane but then it was persistant and came closer getting bigger .That is when I realized that my wife was getting nervous as I was driving on the highway. We were all alone on the 5 . I then looked really good and slowed down to about 40 mph from 85mph. The object was about the size of a car ,with lights;red,white,orange. It moved diving sideways down to the water of the reservoir fast ,very fast,then stopped and floated up slowly. It did this manuever about 6 times then came right beside the car and floated. Long enough to then get my attention really good. That is when I observed a Metal object that I have never seen before in my life Moving in the night sky ,Diving sideways to the earth then floating up and reapeating this manuever several more time . Then in the blink of an eye disappearing in the sky. It was not a plane or a remote control airplane. My wife was left very nervous and scared after the sighting. I admit that I was a bite nervous. After I noticed that we were the only ones on the highway .I got real nervous . I never told anyone about this incident until know for reasons that are personal and will not be talked about.  It is hard to describe the shape because the craft looks different from other angles. I know that it was not that big, it had no windows that I could see, It had lights on the craft.   The ship was possitively some kind of Metal; silver in color ,with a dark black scraches. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate a date for the sighting.

It was about 3 am in the morning and I was heading north bound when I observed approximately a dozen seperate lights on the initial horizon.  There were about six of these ""lights"" in ""opposition"" to each other approaching the others at a very rapid pace. My first impression was that these ""lights"" could be searchlights operating from two seperate directions but in synchronization to each other. It suddenly occured to me that no power on earth could synchronize these lights at the speed and directional changes they were operating at.  At this point I was so taken aback I actually ran my cruiser off the roadway. I took the next exit (my home) and parked the cruiser in my yard - we lived on a 90 acre stretch so it was isolated.  About five minutes later I looked up at the sky and saw an enormous, oval shaped object flying approximately 300-400 feet in the air in a westward direction - due to the darkness, the altitude was an approximation. This object approached my direction.  I stood in the roadway attempting to interpret what I was observing - the craft made no loud noise but rather as it passed overhead I could only describe it as a ""whoosing sound"" - very quiet.  At certain intervals  there seemed to be a circular, revolving series of low impact lights surrounding the craft which was moving rather slowly to the west. I went into my home to wake my wife but she was too frightened to step outside.  Rather than reporting the incident I tried to call Otis Air Force Base but the lines were jammed, as were those of a local police department - as discretion is often the better part of valor I put the incident in my own ""I don't know file"" and just let it be.

I was a teenage cashier and my sister a PBX operator in her early twenties. That evening I was looking up at a dark starry sky as we walked through Brentwood Park, facing south (toward town). I noticed a circular patch of the heavens which was totally black, devoid of stars. ""Isn't that peculair?"" I asked. ""Must be a cloud,"" she replied. We stood looking up less than a minute, then resumed our walk. After taking several steps, I stopped, too curious not to look again. I was struck by how much larger the black circle appeared, and now it seemed to be moving very slowly(silently) directly overhead -- TOWARD, NOT FROM the direction it had been moments before. This was headed south! I had to hold my head far back to see the whole thing. It looked huge, low as or lower than an airplane. We walked to a bench near the brick building where we lived. The temperature was so pleasant, we decided to sit outside awhile, and talk. A full moon had risen and the night was now very bright. We decided to go inside, but as we stood to leave, I noticed -- about a block's distance south of us, in the shadow of several large trees (I think magnolias) there sat an unlit, domed saucer, not much larger than a volkswagon bus. It was sitting a couple feet above the ground on what appeared to be slender rods. It didn't look tall enough for people to stand in. As I pointed this out to my sister, the left edge of the dull metallic gray craft began to move as if a separate portion of the rim was being raised. This was not hinged like a car's trunk; it moved more like a hydralic awning. My sister grabbed my arm and we crept backward into the building. The private screened porch was inset and we were afraid to go out on it for a look. The landing site was out of view from the windows inside the living room. To my knowledge, neither of us saw the saucer/s again. An afterthought: if I'd ""dreamed up"" the experience -- logically, the vehicle would have opened with a ramp moving ground-ward. (Of course, we didn't hang around long enough to watch the complete action, so there could have been more to it.) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the experience is approximate.

This route 100 was a (2) lane highway,with surrounding montains. There were many ""hard pulls"" on these mountains, for diesel trucks of this time period. (170 horse power).

The first thing I noticed was the mountains on my left, was ""lit up"" like someone had turned on a giant spotlight!  I then saw  what I assumed was meteors coming down from the sky. These were displaying a white hot light,and had like contrails behind them. As they came down to where I could see them better, I changed my mind from meteors, to maybe a large aircraft had broken up in the sky,and was crashing .  On the mountain that I was pulling up.  I could see the top of the mountain,and I could see the valley below. When the objects that I seen, I assumed they was going to crash into the earth. And I would have been a witness to a major airplane crash!  But to my amazement, the objects just pulled up ,and went thru this valley like a speeding bullet.  They traveled the entire length of the valley, and then ""shot"" straight up in the sky!  Also, when these objects was at my direct left, they gave off a large amount of white light, and leaving white smoke with sparks contrails.  I could see just like it was high noon daylight!  I could even see the green leaves on the trees .  When it was all over. The other company driver that was ahead of me had pulled over at the top of the mountain, at a wide spot.  When I came to stop behind his unit, he came ""running""to my truck, and with astonished look on his face said, What in the H**L was that ?   I then asked him what he had seen.   He told me the exactly what I had seen !  What was it?  Till this day (2005) I do not know !   But its one thing for certain.

They stood still and watched with amazement and later swore that they would tell no one.  My mom felt like the beings operating the craft knew her thoughts, and that they meant business about her staying quiet. It was the weirdest thing I'd ever heard. My aunt claims she has no memory of the event (which really angers my mother), making me believe the story even more.  I am very interested in the angelic forms of Ezekiel's book (particularly the first chapter)talking about vessels being lifted high from the earth and that the spirit of the living creatures was in this wheel as it is called.

This site seems legit so here it goes. I am presently 42 years of age and to the best of my recollection, have never seen what would be considered a UFO since this one experience. I still remember the incident vividly. Unfortunately, I can't recall the year. It was either the summer of 1967 or 1968 with an outside chance of it being 1969.  My older siblings were babysitting me one evening. They used to make colored popcorn but on this night, ran out and had to borrow some from a neighbor. When my sister went outside, she started shouting for everyone to come out. I looked out the window at them and they were all looking toward the sky in our backyard. I went out to see what was going on. When I looked up, I saw a circular pattern of red/green - about the size of a small full moon. The object, if it was an object, appeared to just ""hang"" there. It almost resembled more of a hazy ""bat signal"" than something solid. It could have been filtered through the clouds. Not certain about that.  Anyway, our small neighborhood consisted of about 15 to 20 or so homes. Our parents were out so my siblings called other neighbors. All of whom saw the ""thing.""  After a couple of minutes, my sister rushed me back in. I wanted to stay but she wouldn't let me. My brothers came in shortly after and said the thing was gone.  I remember I wasn't afraid because at either 4 or 5 years old, I had no clue what UFO's were. To this day, I keep asking my siblings if they remember that night and they said they still do. No one has ever explained what it was that our modestly middle class neighborhood in Scheller Park saw that night. My parents thought they remembered some explanation of what it was however, the explanation didn't make sense to them and to the rest of us who saw it. I would love to know if anyone else remembers that night and more importantly, if this was a reported incident by other non-government types rather than just our observation.",,42.3461,-73.8412

Approx. 9.30 - 10pm, Saturday evening, coming from northerly aspect heading south, object descended behind mountain to where the local tip (garbage dump site).  This was one of MANY occassions when myself and family members and neighbours saw similar objects, always heading in the same direction, always ""landing"" at the same sight.  The variances were that on some occassions:- the craft would appear and travel at an extremely fast speed and then halt suddenly (but smoothly) and descend slowly; other occassions the craft would 'drop' suddenly, and the craft would be dark; on other occassions the craft would hover and eminate a bright light and 'land'  Some sightings lasted a matter of 10 seconds, others for several minutes.  The crafts were the shape of two saucers placed on top of each other; and were a mid-grey/greenish colour, a matt finish.  A dull yellowish light formed a tail when the crafts were travelling, however whenever the crafts hovered the yellowish light emited from beneath.  Our house was approx. 1 mile from the landing site, and from this distance, it looked as though the craft were 12' in diametre and 10' high and 40' round.  The ""saucer"" had a spinning motion.  I did not see any windows on any of the craft.  Why ""we"" have believed these were UFO is because of the movement/action of the craft - the sudden ""take off"", the hovering etc were not possible by helicopters, aeroplanes, or 'falling stars' or meteorites.  The craft always descended in the same area.  We wonder whether they landed in the tip on the large, flat-ish surface; or whether they landed in the mountain.     Interestingly, we have later learned that there a series of markings in caves similar to heiroglyphs.  And there are two other areas with similar markings and when plotted on a map, form the shape of a pyramid. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incidents are approximate.  PD))",,,

As I was scanning the sky a very bright star-like and star sized object caught my eye from the Southeast.  When I turned to look at it I initially thought it was Venus or some other very high altitude plane. However, the light was very bright and after watching it for only a few seconds, its luminosity changed and went back to just an ordinary star brightness. I noticed that it was also moving in the Northwest direction so I continued to monitor its path.  As I watched it move to the NW it looked like one of the numerous satellites I see all the time so I was about to turn away and find something else to look at it when I began noticing that this light was not moving in a straight line.  It was meandering right and left in a slow s-styled motion.  From my ground vantage point it looked like it was maneuvering through an obstacle course.  The speed of the object remained constant and it was still heading in the overall NW direction but it would jog right and left about 8-10 degrees every 15 seconds or so.  I have never seen a satellite or plane change directions before like this at such a high altitude.  The change in direction seemed purposeful.   I had been watching this first object for about 3-4 minutes when I noticed a faster moving companion object 10 degrees below it and gaining on the first.  Both objects were coming out of the Southeast and headed to the Northwest.  This second star-like object had the normal star luminosity and was travelling 3-4 times as fast as the first object. This second object was not moving in any sort of irregular pattern.  It seemed like it was traveling on a very straight line.  I could see both objects in my field of view and as I watching both, the first object flared up again.  Extreme luminosity.  It was intensely bright. The luminosity coincided with second object  below overtaking the first object above. This time the intense brightness lasted only a second before returning back to normal star-like brightness. Then a couple of seconds later the first object went dark. It completely vanished. I could still see the second object continuing to the NW but my first object just turned off or disappeared.  About a minute later the second object left my field of vision and I could no longer track it.

While photographing celestial objects with my telescope and astro-photography gear atop on Henry Co State Park at about over 3400 elevations, I noted this consistant bright white star like object, approximately -3 in magnitute, traveling slowly from East to North-East covering about about 15 degrees of the sky in about 45 second, very low in the horizen just about 10-20 degrees above the horizen and barely above the distant mountains as visible in the photograph.  Earlier that night before I head up there, I checked for any possible Irridium flashes or ISS (International Space Station) passes as well as other bright and visible satellites which could have been photographed throughout the night (Sep. 5-6, 2005).  There were no passes over California of the ISS or any other other known objects that night.   The brightest I have ever seen ISS was about -1 magnitute at the most and at it's highest in the sky!  This object was not ISS or any other known satelite for sure as it's orbit indicted that clearly, not to mention it was too bright to be ISS or any other Earth orbiting Satelites!  So the only thing I suspected was an aircraft flying towards me head on since there were no flashes and the lights were extremly bright!  However, after observing it's flight path for about 45 second, I realizing that it was not flying towards me. Therefore eliminating to be a normal aircraft as well!  No aircrafts has a bright white spot light on it's side as far as I know!   I have been doing astro-photography since 1986 and I am pretty much familiar with all known flying objects, aircrafs and space crafts in the sky.  I can quickly identify what sort of objects it is when I see one!  In this case, I was puzzled as it did not make any sense!  Luckily, I had my digital camera mounted as piggy-back on my telescope's counterweight bar and was ready to take sequences of tracked 30 seconds wide angle shots to be stacked later.  So I snapped a shot of the object.  The duration of the snapshot is 30 seconds so the star like object streaked a bright white light through it's flight path right below the constellation Auriga! Note the brightness of thte star Capella (Alpha Aur.) is about 0.1 magnitute! In the photo, the stars are being tracked for 30 seconds so the light from them has been accumilated for 30 seconds.   In contrast, the object was moving so the brightness of it is not accu milated like stars. Meaning it is much brighter than it appears in the photograph!  It was so bright that I was confused for a second there as it was the planet Venus (-4 mag.)",2005-10-11T00:00:00,37.17415093167702,-121.65183229813664

While scanning the sky with binoculars for the planet Venus a strange object flew into the field of view.,Olin,NC,2005-09-06T17:45:00,unknown,About 6 seconds,"Occurred : 9/6/2005 17:45  (Entered as : 09/06/2005 17:45) Reported: 9/8/2005 7:45:03 AM 07:45 Posted: 10/11/2005 Location: Olin, NC Shape: Unknown Duration:About 6 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46104.html,"While scanning the sky with binoculars for the planet Venus a strange object flew into the field of view. Tuesday September 6th, 2005.  First I want to say I have been an amateur astronomer since 1972, or for the past 33 years.  I have seen many strange objects in the daytime and nighttime sky and have never seen anything that could not be explained, until now.  I also spent 20 years in the Air Force and know a little about what planes can do and cannot do.  At 5:45 PM (East coast of US) I was in my yard looking for the planet Venus with 7X50 binoculars.  I was scanning the southern sky at about 40 degrees elevation when an object appeared in the field of view. For a second I thought I had spotted Venus but quickly dismissed this as it was moving and I knew I was observing too far to the left of Venus.  If I had not moved the binoculars left to begin another sweep I doubt I would have seen this object. I next thought I had picked up an airliner, as there is an air corridor over my house for planes taking off and landing in Charlotte, North Carolina.  I then dismissed this as it was flying almost perpendicular to this corridor and moving much too fast to be an airliner and I mean fast.  I have also seem all kind of small planes from the old bi-winged planes to you name it kind of planes.  Even high up you can hear their engines. By this time the object had moved from almost due south of me over into the southwestern sky.  A fair distance and I cannot estimate how fast it was going other than to say it was exceptionally fast.  I have never observed anything that moved at this speed. I hate the term “Flying Saucer” so I will say the shape was more of a blob shape.  At the speed it was traveling it was hard to hold the object still in the binoculars long enough to get a good look at it and the entire event was over in a less than 6 seconds or so. I do know it was not an airplane, at least none that I know of.  The speed was too great.  The color was a light gray and almost blended in with the sky.  I have no doubt if I had looked right at it with the naked eye I would never have seen it.  The object appeared to be at a fairly high altitude.  I heard no sound and there was no vapor trail of any kind and I did not see anything like wings sticking out from the sides.  No mater how high airliners fly I do not always see a vapor trail but I have always seen the wings. The sky was very clear and a dark blue color.  This may be the only reason I was able to see it.  If the sky were the usual pale blue or grayish color the object would have been invisible to the eye. If it had disappeared at this point I would have thought little more about it.  What happened next made my knees weak. I thought it continue on over the southwest horizon.  While watching the object in binoculars the object suddenly made a very quick and sharp turn to the right and accelerated in speed, then it was not there anymore.   It just disappeared.   If this had been any type of normal aircraft the pilot would not have been able to withstand the G forces from such a sharp turn at that speed and maybe not even the craft itself. Was it some type of craft that had no wings, maybe?  But that takes us back to the old “Flying Saucer” concept. Unless some nation on Earth has come up with an extraordinary aircraft capable of performing astonishing feats in the sky, then what I saw was indeed what I would call a true UFO sighting where the “U” stands for “Unidentified” of course.

While driving on I-65 going south through Alabama/Tennessee and it was late at night probably around 11 pm as well, I truly had a close encounter with whatever, which is all I can say.  At the time my now ex-wife was sleeping beside me in the car so she new nothing about it as it was happening and when I woke her up after this event was over she shrugged it off as a figment of my imagination even though she noticed that I was flushed and sweaty. What occurred was that I saw a very large and extremely bright light that reminded me of a locomotive train light just behind me about 50yds or so just appear suddenly and it followed me at the same pace but its movement was so strange to me as I noticed because it didn't fluxuate with the contour of the road as I was moving or was I and there was no sound as if a helicopter.  I wanted to alert my wife but I felt controlled as if in a trance or some hypnotic mind control and the only thing I felt that I could do was to only use my eyes to just look in the forward direction which caused me to keep glancing in the rear view mirror from time to time and as well, I noticed my palms were sweaty but for sure this was all I was allowed to do, I felt controlled to only be able to keep my hands on the wheel.  It seemed like for ages even though in this report I say maybe a half hour and just as it appeared so did it suddenly disappear but to tell you the truth, I don't really remimber how long that this occurrence was happening or maybe time was standing still or whatever, I don't really know.  The other thing that I keep going over and over in my mind besides the light is that I noticed there were no cars in either direction all the time this occurrence was happening up until it was gone which also seemed strange for an interstate highway  But anyway the years have passed and the other day I was watching the history channel on ufo's and strange sightings so I was compelled to go on the net and do a little surfing and your site came up and well, now you know mine.

I was taking a girlfriend of mine home. We live in Louisville, KY. She had recently moved way out by a Ford plant, on Westport Road.  At that time (1980) the roads were very winding and the whole area wasn't that developed. There were those huge power lines everywhere on the side of the road like you see in such rural areas. We were both 21 years old, and we had been up late because she wanted to discuss some troubling family issues that had just ocurred.  I took her home and from my house (in Fern Creek)it was a very long way out there. I then drove back the same road and was moving right along in my Mustang when I got to a winding part of the road, and slowed for safety sake.  Suddenly I saw a craft that was similar in body perhaps to a helicopter, in that it was long and may have been wider at the front than the rear. I only noticed it had a high beam light on me. I knew it could very possibly be a police helicopter, and figured it was just what it was. It kept putting the beam on me and scared me. I was afraid maybe they were looking for some escaped criminal or something and may have thought I fit their description.  I saw that the craft though was so low to the ground that it was amazing. I suddenly thought that if it was that low, which was at the first draping power line of the two, that it may get tangled into them and then I'd be affected by the mess.  I was scared that it would cause an accident, so I stopped the car and watched it. It was hovering perfectly still in the air, but was that low, and had NO SOUND AT ALL. I even rolled down the window a bit because I thought maybe they would come on a bull horn or something.  All the time I couldn't see much of the thing because of this beam directed at me. It didn't get entangled, though that close to the lines, and I figured before it did, I'd race ahead and get out of there and did so. Strangely, it went up into the sky then but again, not all that high in altitude.  Then I went all the way home, maybe 30 miles, and it had followed me every inch of the way, sometimes higher up in the sky, others lower, and I was horrified maybe it WAS the police. Then I got home, and parked in our back driveway and saw it flying in the sky slowly, in both directions, no pattern. I thought that was very weird, and it seemed it had followed me so long and far, that I ran into our house. I have always thought it was a UFO though I didn't ever know if I did or did not believe in them and still don't know for sure.  But when I think back on that night, I picture driving and where it was I saw it so close to those power lines, and suddenly I realize I'm recalling the right spot I was driving, but in the wrong direction. I was going homeward on that particular curve, and yet I always recall it as if going toward her apartment instead. That is very weird to me.  The craft had been pretty low when I pulled into the driveway and I watched it after turning out the car lights. Suddenly it zipped up into the sky above my backyard so fast it was a mere speck. THAT is when I didn't think it was a police helicopter and the other reason was that a chopper always makes some big propeller sound, but even close to me as it was on that road by the power lines, it was SILENT.  I also later heard others say that weird sitings happened around POWER LINES and wonder if they someway tap into the power or something.  I am a professional person and college educated, reasonable and have never taken one drug in my life. It was definitely NOT from around here..

We noticed a glowing red ball that hovered in place above a field, we were about 1/2 mile away. It was a clear night and the sky was almost completely dark at the time.  We didn't take our eyes off of it even though we wanted to go in and tell everyone to come see, we just couldn't pull ourselves away from looking at it.  After a couple of minutes of it hanging motionless in the sky, it shot straight up in the air and disappeared.  After it happened we decided not to say anything to our families that were inside because we didn't want to be made fun of, since none of them would have believed it.  So hard as it was, we kept it quiet.  Then the next day at school, I overheard some of my classmates whispering together in a huddle about the same thing that I had seen.  So I chimed in about my account, and they told me that they had been practically under it (which made sense because my friend lived just across that field) and they said that it was a glowing red ball but they could see three white lights on the bottom that formed a triangle pattern.  They also watched it for a while and it shot straight up in the sky, there were four of them that seen it including my friend's father. I never seen anything like that before or since.

I was raised in San Diego, not very far from the airport, and I spent a little over 4 years in the US Army.  I definitely know the difference between rotary and winged aircraft, and I know the sounds that they make when airborne.  I saw something in 1985 that was extremely strange: a small (approximately 30 feet across) round craft, making absolutely NO noise whatsoever; and in the same month, a VERY large triangular shape floating silently in the early morning sky.   At the time, I was staying at a friend's house, having just moved from San Diego, California, to Concord, California.  The first sighting was at approximately 9 pm (2100 hours), and the people that I was staying with, and myself, were sitting together in a hot-tub spa.   This ""vehicle"" was blinking red, orange, green, blue and white lights, flying directly over us at approximately 1500 feet altitude, making no noise at all.  The second sighting was at approximately 4 am (0400 hours) at about 2000 feet altitude, also making no noise at all, later in the same month. (The house was within 2 miles of the Concord Naval Weapons Center, which, at that time, had nuclear weapons stockpiled. In fact, there were several protests about the Weapons Center having those weapons there.)   I had gotten up around 4 am to get a glass of water from the kitchen, and upon looking out the kitchen window, spotted what appeared to be a triangular shaped craft. It looked to be enormous, possibly about the size of a football field in length, except for being triangular.  It made absolutely NO noise, and was heading East, toward the Naval Weapons Center. The reason that I didn't report the sightings then, was because I was afraid that no one would believe me (or us), and didn't want to be locked up for being ""crazy"" or something.  Now, I have had approximately 1500 hours of flying time as a passenger in both helicopters and jet aircraft, so I'm pretty sure that these ""vehicles"" were NOT currently in the Air Force's inventory, at least not as Un-classified aircraft.   Since these were technically Unidentified Flying Objects, I would not be able to say that they were extraterrestrial in nature, but just unidentified.

There was a light breeze which drifted the boat between an island shoel and weed bed. Where we cast our lures hoping to land one. The moon light seemed to dance across the water.  Which soon became like a sheet of glass. The wind stopped and it became eriesomely quiet.  Sounds of water clapping the side of the boat stopped and off in the far distance, I heard sounds of a wiperwill and lune.  This soon faded to be replaced with silence.  The only thing heard was each splash of our lures hitting the water followed by the turning sounds of the fishing real gears.  Then suddenly, a gust of wind and off in the distance about 1/4 of a mile away we saw an oval gray shaped object the length of a bus and about 16'-18' in depth huvvering approx 50' above some tree tops along side the lake bank.  At first, I didn't believe what I was seeing. I looked at my grandfather for confirmation and he looked me in the eye straight back. I then said, do you see that?  He said, yeah.  I said, what the hell is that?.  He said, I don't know? I said, mabey its a cloud. He said, the tree tops are moving underneath it.  Sure enough, tree tops were moving beneath the object. They sway and swished back and forth in small circular patterns within a larger oval pattern beneath the object. Wind passed through the tree tops beneath the object. The object was oval in shape, black in color and huvvered motionless. The object was blacker than the night sky with a haze around it. Keep in mind it was a clear star, moon lit night.

(from the entrance to the camping area was about 2 miles).  we got scared so we ran all the way back.  the car pulled in and didn't stop.  they just left.  we thought they might have been following the craft.  it sure looked that way.  from the time we went out in the field to the time we got back only about half an hour had gone by, maybe 40 min., but when i checked the time it was 1:30 in the morning.  that's over 3hrs. unaccouted for and both of us were shocked and scared.  we didn't get any sleep that night.  the next day when we drove out of there we noticed the name of this area is called thomas landing. my name is thomas.  i thought that was weird.  also when we got back on a major highway we had passed dover air force base.  we both thought that was weird also and considered making a report but chose not to.  we went home to pa..   there are other pertinent details that i left out.  minor but significantly and coincidently relative to this account.  p.s. when i asked my friend how he knew it was about to come over the trees, he said he saw it shoot down from the sky to behind the trees.

My older brother and I were going to walk to the end of our street to meet some friends. It was late and a clear night full of stars. We lived on the outskirts of Victoria, BC. I had grown up on this road and new every corner, tree and even where the deer would cross the road. We were about one kilometer into our walk, starting up a hill after walking the only straight stretch of road. Suddenly the hair on my face and neck stood on end till it hurt. Out of the corner of my eye I thought I saw a flash of light pass. We walked on. Then I defiantly saw a melon sized ball of white light pass us traveling faster than I thought possible. I asked my brother “Did you see that?” He said, “I thought it was just me.” Then there was another and another until they were about six or ten (It is hard to say with the speed they were traveling.). They seemed to be in a range of sizes from a large grape fruit to a honeydew melon. They did not light up their surroundings but seemed to contain their light. They were moving it would seem with purpose weaving away from us and then stopping and launching into our close vicinity again. I asked my brother if he thought we should run but as soon as the words left my mouth I knew the futility of my thoughts. My brother said we should turn for home but just walk calmly and not run. I was glad he was with me for he was a few years older and I had not yet graduated and was still unsure of myself. We descended the hill and rounded the corner leading back to the straight stretch of road. One of the lights sped ahead of us two hundred meters or so in the blink of an eye and stopped instantly under one of the few streetlights on the road. It hesitated there for perhaps a half of a second and the came directly at us. It wizzed past me head silently less than an arms length away. I was terrified, sure neither of us would be seen again and pitying my mother who would never know the fate of her sons. Then a car came around the corner ahead of us and I realized the lights were nowhere to be seen. We flagged down the car and begged them to take us with them. I am sure that our pleading to save us from the UFO lights convinced them that we were crazy. They sped off and once again I was sure we were doomed; but after a few minutes with no return my fears started to subside. I began to build up enough courage to lookup and into the starry sky. Behind us in the distance was a field and far above it I noticed a triangle of lights, just sitting in the sky motionless. I asked my brother if he could see it also and what he thought it was. He said, “ It’s probably a radio tower or something, lets just go!” It wasn’t a tower though, no stars shone through the center of the triangle, and as I confirmed later in the week during the daytime there was nothing that could have confused with what we saw. I don’t recall how our when we arrived home. The next morning I awoke seemingly oblivious to the night’s events. I went to the bathroom to shave and shower. While shaving I saw in the mirror falling from the ceiling next to me, bright shiny sparks falling to invisibility before hitting the floor. Immediately all the night’s events came rushing back to me. I ran to my brother’s room and found him awake in bed with the most astonished look on his face. When I asked him what he said he awoke to find his bed covers covered in sparks. We spoke of this to our parents and friends but few believe us. For months after this event when I would drive home from work, occasionally when I approached, or passed through the area of the incident I would hear from behind my heard a loud clap. It was like two hands coming together. This event has defiantly had an effect on my life and my beliefs. I look for answers and get more questions. I search for truth and find mystery.

It would have been invisible to us except that there was some low lighting or shimmering effect outling the object from our vantage point.  It seemed huge.  I was still trying to figure out what it was that I was looking at, and hadn't yet mentioned it to my friend when she shreiked ""what is it?"". (We were still walking the whole time.) She was an hysterical person by nature and was getting a little frantic (still walking). It looked so much like the Goodyear Blimp that I assumed that is what it had to be.  It had to be right? If that is what the Blimp looked like with no lights except for the outline.  I assured my friend it was just the blimp and we made the turn and walked to the car and left the area.  I figured that if it was anything else, there were enough people with terraces in the many high rise apartment buildings overlooking the bridge and the river - someone else would have seen it.  There was no report of anything strange that I heard or read about so I assumed it was the blimp after all on a joy ride.  I did think it was pretty dangerous and I'm not sure if the blimp could hover in one place and not move. I put it out of my mind and some time later had the occassion to actually see the Goodyear blimp near the G. W. Bridge.  The size was all wrong.  It was tiny compared to what we saw that night.

Another shined light on us. Others jetted to horizon. I was almost home, driving thru a 1000 acre corn field after harvest on a dirt road between Indiana and Michigan 3 a.m. 1991. The sky was very clear. Out of the corner of my eye I saw an orange light descending from the sky. As I turned my head it came to a stop behind a leafless tree line on the other side of the field about 1/2 mile away. The light seemed large for aircraft maybe 2 feet in diameter. More like a small orb, yet small from the distance. It was quite peculiar, it’s color, the way it descended, and the way it came to a stop without slowing. I pulled the van over and said to my friend ""hey, watch that light over there. I could swear I just saw it come down out of the sky"". So we sat there talking, not really paying attention. It had not moved for 10..maybe 15 minutes when I looked and it was rising up and slightly toward us. At about 60-75 ft. the orange light turned into 3 dazzling lights in a triangle pattern...Holy crap!!! Surprised the hell out of us! We looked at each other then back at the lights which were strobing in a rainbow of color so fast they seemed bright white. Then it started to zigzag 1500 feet back and forth several times like a bug without stopping or slowing. I can only guess the speed seemed to be more than 300 mph. It seemed to stay parallel to the ground at the same altitude. Needless to say by this time we were freakin out, both of us tapping each other on the shoulder, looking back and forth at each other and the ""alien ship"", saying ""are you seeing what I’m seeing"" over and over. That’s all we could do. I was astonished. That went on for a little less than a minute. Then it headed east at a steady speed, gaining altitude. Two or three times, before it became too distant, it seemed to disappear and reappear in the same line of flight 2 or three times more distant than it should have been at the same speed almost instantly. An extreme jump in speed or should I say place because when it reappeared it was traveling at the same speed. We tried to chase it to see if we could spot it again but figured it moved on. So we headed back. As we drove back down the dirt road something drew my attention to the field on the other side of the road. So we stopped again backing up into a driveway so we could see if there was really something out there. We sat there a few minutes. It was like a dim, bluish spotlight waving back and forth. The beam seemed to extend only about 20 ft. I asked my friend if he wanted to go out there to get a closer look. He said no, and I was relived. Just put that out of mind. Now I wish I had, I always wonder what I would have seen. But I was more afraid of what might happen. I should have drove through the field. Maybe I could have run my truck into it or run down some helpless alien. Anyway, it waved 2 or 3 times with interrupts between passes. I asked my friend, wondering if it would be such a good idea, if I should flash the headlights at it, which I did. About ten seconds later directly after making another pass to the sky the light shined right on us. I have never seen a light so eerie. It seemed to be more luminescent or dissipated, fractured as though shining through a fog. It stayed on us for about 2 seconds then went about what it was doing without skipping a beat. I wondered if it was signaling some other craft. So, I got out and looked up. There were others that appeared like moving stars. I didn’t get a count but there were more than three because I remember 3 that came together in a large triangle formation then jetted away from each other almost to the extent of the horizon within 5 or six seconds. At the altitude they were at, I’m assuming space, the speed had to be tremendous. Then they flew back to form the same formation just as fast. There were others but they seemed to be stopped then would move shorter distances. I wasn’t taking much note of them though. They were hard to keep track of, they blended in with the stars and my neck got really tired after more than 15 minutes or so looking almost straight up. It had been a long night, the object in the field had stopped signaling and I’m not sure what happened to the ones in the sky. Dawn was approaching so we went home talking about it all morning. Hours later we went out into the field. The dirt was very hard. There were no signs of any activity. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The most bizarre aspect was that they darted around in different directions in a manner that is seemingly impossible. I am not sure of the number but as stated above, it was 8-10.  The most exciting part of the event was that, after I watched for several minutes, I got the feeling that the objects were aware of my presence, (even though they were miles above)! It was a comforting feeling.  And after a while, they disappeared. I returned the next night to see if they were there again.

I think the downed pilot was named Mentel if I can remember correctly.  This UFO shootdown supposedly occured over, or near, Simpson County Kentucky.  Back in 1992 I had never even heard of this story before, so I at first dismissed it all as a silly hoax.  So here is the story.  As I was working one day an older man and woman came in to my workplace and asked me for any information that I could provide to them related to the possible location of the crash site of a P-51 Mustang aircraft etc. which had crashed back in 1948? near Simpson County, Kentucky.  These two people did act very strangely, and were very secretive at first.  They seemed to be looking around the room in my workplace a lot for some odd reason.  I asked them what the crash was related to, and the man frankly told me that the crashed plane that he wanted to locate was shot down by a very large flying disk, or UFO.  I at first considered this man and woman to be some sort of pranksters.  So I proceded to ask the man how that he knew that this story was true.  Also, I told him that the US Military had probably already retrieved the downed aircraft a long time ago anyway.  Yet, he persisted and then told me an astonishing story-true or untrue.  The man informed me that he was a good friend of the pilot that was shot from the sky that day back in 1948?.  He told me that he was flying in formation with Mentel that day and witnessed the whole incident.  He said that he saw the object very clearly himself, and it was no balloon or anything like that.  The man indicated that it was indeed a very large and bright flying disk that he saw.  Strangely, he also said that he even saw the beam of light come out from the UFO that destroyed the military aircraft.  I told him that I would have to look in some older newspaper journals etc. and see if I could find him any material related to this subject.  He gave me his e-mail address and they both left.  I still thought this might be an elaborate hoax or prank.  Later on though I read in a UFO book that some sort of incident like this DID supposedly happen back in 1948? or so.  Needless to say I was a little bit shocked.  Could this man have been telling me the TRUTH about a very strange incident like this?  I tried to e-mail this man and woman in Indiana with this new information I found for them.  Yet, I never received a reply back from them.  Later on I found out that nobody with their names given to me even lived in Indiana.  Who were these people?  This story seems really creepy to me now after the encounter.  I don't know if their story is true or untrue, but it makes one wonder though.  Hoax, or no hoax, this story is somewhat interesting and odd.  We can only speculate as to it's accuracy.  I thought you might like to read this.  Thank you.----JG ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My father owns a house on Lake Champlain in Willsboro bay. We were up at night sitting on the back deck of my father’s boat house. It was a very quite and still night, there was a heavy overcast, but at a high altitude. I noticed what I thought was a plane at that time, flying across the sky from west to east, and at first I thought nothing of it. But it turned around and went back from east to west and behind the mountains there. The light came out again and flew the same pattern, going from east to west and then turning around. The third time it came out I took notice because I thought it odd that this, what I thought was a plane at that time, was flying in circles. I was aware that there was an air force fuel depot directly under where this object was flying. This is directly north of Skagarack Mountain on the shore of Lake Champlain. So I mentioned all this to the guys I was with and I think we thought it was a government plane and one of us came up with the idea to flash our flashlight at it. Immediately, a beam of light shown out of the object and illuminated the porch we were standing on to the point that when we turned around there our shadows were cast on the wall. The distance between the object and us at this point is approximately 1 to 1.5 miles and none of us were aware that a light could shine precisely on 3 people from that distance. This is the point that we all knew that something very abnormal was going on. We all became very alarmed at this and I remember that we began to tremble. The object then went west, behind Skagarack Mountain again, on the north side of the mountain. We thought that it may have left because it did not come out again moving east as it had before. So we were slightly relieved, that perhaps the air force was not after us. However, it came out from behind the Skagarack Mountain on the south side, north of Rattlesnake Mountain, this time a little closer to us. At this point it was going strait up and down, repeatedly coming from behind Skagarack Mountain, and each time it raised above the mountain, the beam of white light was painting us. It was almost as if it was playing a game with us. Then it flew over the mountain and started flying around the bay, and this is when we got a really good look at it. It was basically a ball of pulsating light, there was no wings, no rotors, and discernable body or fuselage. Just a pulsating light that would change colors constantly, as the colors changed, one color seemed to just meld in the next color, I remember it being mainly reddish orange. Perhaps the oddest thing was that it was absolutely silent, it made absolutely no noise at all. It moved well within the normal envelope of normal aircraft, there was nothing remarkable about how the thing moved. At this point a train was coming down the tracks on the opposite side of the bay from where we were, and the object immediately lost interest in us and painted its light on the train and followed it for a short time. Then it left the train, floated across the bay maybe .25 miles north of where we were and headed to the same side of shore that we were on. It disappeared behind the horizon there and at this point my friends and I ran around the front side of the house to find it but it was gone, and that was the last we saw of it.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,44.3765,-73.4232

We were in a residential neighborhood, the houses all being on at least one acre lots.  All the lots have trees on them.  We are 25 miles west of downtown Fort Worth, and there were no street lights, so you can see the stars very well.  From where we were standing, in the street, you couldn't really see the horizon, just the houses/trees around us.  All of a sudden, from what appears to be only feet above the trees,(moving north to south) a large, black (or dark grey) air craft comes into view.  I cant remember what the ""front"" of it looked like, just that there was something VERY large approaching us.  It was totally silent. No vibration, no air movement, no smell, no visible moving parts, no smoke, nothing!! I got the impression that it was either rectangular, or maybe triangular, and for some reason I was thinking that it had to be pretty flat.  It moved, well hovered would be a better description, until it was directly over us. It was soo big that it totally filled our field of vision.  You could not see the stars/sky behind it.  It seems that there were some dull white lights on the edges of it, but me and my husband never did agree on what the lights looked like, or if there were even lights at all.  The whole encounter lasted under a minute.  I dont remember how it left our field of vision, and neither can my husband. Nothing can fly that low, that slow, that quiet, without crashing to the ground. Not to mention the emmense size of it.  What is almost as weird as the sighting itself, is that me and my husband, never could be more specific about what we saw, why I didnt remember the date, or what we saw after it passed over us.  I have tried for years to pin point an exact time frame.  I know me and my now husband were just kids, so it had to be 91-92.  I am thinking it was early fall.  I have thought about this everyday of my life, and have asked everyone that I thought might have some insight about planes/experimental aircraft/military aircraft etc, and no one can explain it.

I was in the back seat, looking out the left window, and the object was in the air a few thousand feet up at about 10 o'clock high. As we got closer to it, the other kids noticed it, and we pulled over the car and started piling out.  By the time all 6 of us had piled out of the sedan, it was moving.  It accelerated in a straight line away in the direction that we had been driving, and was gone in the distance in maybe 5 seconds.  I never heard a sound.  One of the other kids claimed to have heard a low hum. The most interesting thing about how it had initially hovered is that it was not moving at all.  Not bobbing, not leaning from the wind.  It was steady enough to cause me to think it was the top of a tower initially. Then, when it accelerated away, it was in a perfect, straight line.  Ohio is notoriously windy, and that day was no exception - yet the object was floating very, very steadily, without any deviation whatsoever.

The light was so intense and bright that I cannot find words to accurately describe it.  I kick myself to this day for not stopping - I was in such shock that I kept driving.   As I got closer, the object was above the Troutbrook Exit.  It had to be only 200 feet in the air above me.  It made no sound.   It was silver, triangular shape.  It had a red light on the tip and red and white lights on the bottom.  It had an elongated rectangular door.  As I got underneath, I was able to see that the underside was concave.  After I passed it, I could no longer see it behind me.  It vanished - it was completely silent.   In early December, 2005 I saw the same intense light above my house as I came down my street.

A few years ago, I went to a site about UFO sightings and left a very brief version of it, but nothing more than a few paragraphs and it was incomplete. It seemed that everytime I began writing about it in full detail, it sounded like a bad screen play for a ""B"" sci-fi movie. Now, I have decided to recall and record as much detail and as many of the impressions that I can remember. The Summer before I entered High School was when the experience occurred, it was a week or so before school would start again. It was late in August 1967. I would 15 in a couple of weeks,  The closest I can calculate to the day would be August 24th, or 25th.  There were only a couple of kids my age in my neighborhood. One was a cousin; the other was a friend who lived just down the street, two houses down and across the street. He was one year behind me in school, but we were close to the same age. I liked hanging around with with him but he had a mischievous side that my Mom did not trust and our time together was always limited.   One summer afternoon he asked if I could camp out in his yard and followed up by his Mom providing the assurance to my Mom that it was alright. Curiously, and in a very unaccustomed flexibility, my Mother said ""Yes"".   So, after dinner I ran down the street a few houses, crossed the street and starting hanging around with my friend and his younger brothers in their back yard.  I found out the plans had changed and we were going to sleep in his tree house instead of a tent. His brothers were going to use the tent, a small detail my Mom could be spared. An uneventful evening began to unfold. Earlier in the evening I went back to my house. My parents were gone someplace. I went into their bedroom and removed my Dad's pocket watch from his bureau. One I'd given him for Father's day once. It had a radium dial which would glow in the dark. Then, went back to the treehouse.  At one point his Mom came out with some snacks. It was shaping up to be a good night, Steve was being unaccustomedly polite to his Mom, a detail that gave me a sense of confidence that nothing was going to go wrong. As fun as Steve could be, I also had a bit of suspicion about him. He had a knack for practical jokes and doing unpredictable or dangerous things.  We each had a flash light, enough light for us to play game after game of ""Fish"" or ""Rummy"" or ""Poker"" for pennies.  As it got darker his brothers went inside at the behest of their Mom when it seemed they could no longer get along nicely. This was about 10pm.  Our goal then was to stay up as long as possible.  Since we never got the chance to hang out a lot we did a lot of talking. There were questions about my extended family...mostly the girls...an inventory of how I was related to this person or another, and  the same questions from me about him. Staying awake past 1 AM was not difficult.  Another two hours passed of playing cards and snacking. About three AM we were both getting sleepy. ((name deleted)) had to use the bathroom and went into his house and was out in a few minutes.  In the mean time, I snuggled down into some light bedding and I was ready to sleep. When ((name deleted)) returned, he was as full of energy as ever and was standing up in the tree house looking out over the wall commenting on how many stars he could see.  It was a safe structure, the walls came up to our chests but there was no roof and the old tree it was in just had some major branches. No leaves grew on this tree, it was mostly dead and we had an unobstructed view of the sky above us at all times. After just a minute, ((name deleted)) thought he saw something while looking at the stars.  From him...""Gah! What is THAT?""  ""Get up and look at this..there's is something FLYING around out here."" ..  I was ready to sleep and didn't want to get up. I was reminded of ((name deleted))'s penchant for practical jokes and could imagine his riducule if I had jumped up in amazement, I could imagine the story that would be told. I was stubbornly not taking the bait... ""I'm asleep."" I said. From him: ""No, no...you've got to SEE this, it looks like a flying saucer or something!"" with a hushed but very excited tone. Me: ""Uh-Huh""...""You know jets fly around here all the time"". True enough, Seymor Johnson Air Force Base in Goldsboro, N.C. was only 12 miles away, and my Dad worked there as a Civil Servant. Low flying jets were not uncommon night or day. From him: ""No, no!""  ""Get up..Get up...this is really weird!""  By now, I was getting curious...he said he saw something flying, but I heard no noise. How could this be? I knew he might be doing another one of his practical jokes. If I jumped up in alarm...he could tell the story for the next two weeks of how he'd tricked me. Slowly, I got up and pretended to not be interested. ""What?""...from me in a calm tone. Him: ""Look it's over there!"" And he pointed in the direction of the end of the street. Directly to the east. Me: ""I thought you said it was flying around"" (At first I didn't see anything.)   Him: ""It was...it's over there now."" pointing low, not high in the air but down the street in a low trajectory just over the trees.  We could see the houses and trees and other things not darkened into shadows by a few of street lights and it was not a completely pitch black night either. The moon was out. I noted it was about 3:15am by looking down at my Dad's glowing pocket watch.  Down the street and across the road was another street, not exactly a continuation of our street, but a slight jog over. At the end of that street and not very high over the trees was a craft I could see but I wasn't certain of the distance or scale. It was ovoid in shape with only a few lights that didn't seem spectacular or unusual for any flying air craft. It wasn't moving but hovering in the same way a helicopter would hover.  I thought I was looking at the body of a helicopter head on without the benefit of being able to see the side or rear. The shape was like a bubble that was flattened on the bottom. I said: ""It's a helicopter""...Then, as soon as I got the words out of my mouth, I realized I was wrong. The object was closer than I had thought and a helicopter would be making noise, a lot of noise at that distance. The familiar ""beating"" of the air sound was not present and at this distance, it would have been a very noticeable sound, instead, there was no sound. It was only two ""short"" blocks away.   This is when I really started looking to see what it was.  It continued to float without motion or sound but only for a few seconds. Then, it started moving in a straight line parallel to the street it was over and in our direction. We were mesmerized, mostly I think, because we didn't know what it was or wasn't. We didn't think to be scared and it held our attention out of curiosity, We watched it wondering what it was going to do next. The shape and size of became more clear as it approached our area. It crossed the road at the end of our street, then it continued moving slowly until it was over an empty lot beyond the first house on our street. Then it slowed down seeming to drift. By now, the shape was distinct, and very much like a saucer or shallow bowl turned upside down with another saucer under it for a bottom.   The path it was taking was directly in line above the houses across the street from us. It drifted over the first house.  It drifted over the next house, the house that belonged to an Aunt and Uncle. It continued and drifted over my house the third on the street. It slowed down and stopped right over my house. It was amazingly low. Only 75-100 ft. overhead.  Then it moved forward again to the next house, the fourth house on that side of the street. I don't remember Steve and I saying a word by now, somehow thinking that if we breathed wrong it would give away our position. By now it was almost directly across the street from us, diagonal by only the width of one lot.  I could begin seeing some of the details more clearly. It was not the flashing light show many people report, just a couple of small lights in the front and the same near the back. It was about the size of two small houses. I'd say 80 ft. end to end. There was some sort of structure that zigzagged across a segment of the upper domed portion, like a system of trapezoids, alternating in inverted shapes. This structure appeared to suggest windows, but there were no windows, just more of a segmented ovoid panel outlined in trapezoids in spaces where windows should be. After a few seconds, the object floated backwards over my Aunt & Uncle's house again and came to rest. It was high enough that I could see some of the under structure but low enough I could see the profile also.  While floating there, a hatch slid open on the bottom which was evident by the light was visibly appearing from inside and projecting toward the ground. (The light was already on when the hatch opened.) The hatch was squarish and off center from the the bottom of the craft and this light from the inside appeared to create a shaft of light onto my Aunt & Uncles' house. Then the craft moved forward and became stationary again over my house with the shaft of light illuminating our roof.  After a few seconds, the light appeared to flicker and the squarish shaft of light went out. A few seconds passed and another light flickered back on except this time, it was a different shape, not the  shaft of a light formed from the hatch opening, but a tighter and more ""focused"" light and it seemed to have movement, not the stationary light as before.  From the hatch the source of the light then began a small sweeping and circular motion around my house, lighting up the back yard and it's immediate vicinity. Then the source of the light protruded from the hatch. It reminded me very much of the kind of search light that people used to mount on their cars. It began to pivot. It behaved as though it was on an articulating mechanical arm. The light started making circles around my yard and house and then in deliberate swinging arcs.   The light began swinging outward toward the neighboring houses and then across the street. It arced back and forth, sweeping it's light further and further away from it's location with each pass. ((name deleted)) and I stared silently and dumfounded.  In a couple of arcs, it was swinging it's light into the parking lot across from where we were, which co-incidentally was the parking lot for the municipal swimming pool.   We watched as the light continued to swing and then the light hit the fence for the swimming pool and the arcs continued sweeping wider and further out.  I could tell that soon the sweeps would extend to reach our location, and right after that the light began to swing near the edge of ((name deleted))'s yard. I was beginning to feel a little frightened.  On the next sweep the light made it's way toward us but before it arrived I ducked behind the wall of the tree house with my back against it. My friend however continued to stand there with his usual insensibility to danger. I remember looking up and seeing the tree we were in being lit up and my friend stood there squinting into the light, his hands still holding the top edge of the wooden tree house wall. The light did not appear to be of unusual brightness, but it had a bluish cast. By now, it was no longer swinging back and forth but fixed on our location. My friend appeared slack jawed above me and he was not looking away. I said: ""Get down!,"" but he continued to stand there almost frozen and he began mumbling something I couldn't understand. Not wanting to desert him, I decided I would stand up. I looked at my father's glowing pocket watch again. It was 3:20 AM. I stood up and looked over the wall that came up to my rib cage. In the time that I was below the wall, the source of the light had changed. Rather than being the sweeping spot light from under the craft, it was coming from a smaller light that was emanating from the edge about one third of the way from the front.  I remember thinking thinking it could be some kind of bizarre craft from Seymour Johnson with Air Force personnel in it.  I was a little worried that word of the event might get back to my father, but then I thought, ""We haven't done anything wrong""... we never even left my friend's yard that night. So I stood there confident that what was going to follow was not going to result in my getting into trouble. There was no sound from the craft, it was continuing to hover. Then, another light came on near the other one and it began to point more directly at me. This light had a quick flickering quality as with some kind of semaphore or a pattern. I remember thinking, ""I will NEVER forget this.""  Then the lights flickered off. The next thing I recall clearly was sitting down in the tree house and again looking at the glow of the pocket watch. It was 3:45am. Twenty five minutes had passed.  Then we stood up again to see the vessel continuing to float. I could then hear a low whining sound, it sounded as though some kind of momentum was building but it was very quiet. Then the vessel began to pivot. Still parallel to the ground it just turned away and it began to move off directly to the north with a slight gain in altitude. There was a purplish discharge of light around the entire vessel at this point.  It moved slowly at first then instead of speeding away with a steady increase in speed...it made a sudden leap and it was only slightly higher in the sky and about 500 hundred yards away.  Then moved off faster for a second or so, then it made another leap in speed and distance which would have placed it at the altitude of a low aircraft.  It appeared to be bright object in the sky at this point moving off quickly.  Then it made another leap. This time, it made a long bright arc away from where it was. The bright arc went high and to the west and then it was gone. In all, this took about ten seconds for this sequence to pass. All of this without any sound other the low whining sound during it's initial ascent. There was no sonic boom, no sound of turbines, or an engine of any kind. An ordinary jet would have created a heavy sonic boom and this thing was flying faster than any jet I had ever seen. My friend and I stood there in astonished silence. I remember ((name deleted))'s hair literally standing up on end and every time he touched it, it crackled with static. He said mine was the same way and my hair crackled as I ran my hand through it. This went away after a minute or so. Incredibly, we went to sleep after that. The next day, both of us remember feeling powerless to relate what we had seen, but this didn't stop my friend.  He thought we should be telling everybody we saw. I didn't. He began telling everybody about the siting which brought the predicable disbelief, which was also projected onto me now. He also had a reputation for exaggeration and now, the more detail we related was followed by an equally heightened disbelief by the listeners. He would have been the epitome of an unreliable witness by all past accounts, but this time...he was right. We didn't talk about the event very much.  About a week later, school began. When he would see me he would begin telling the story and asking me to verify it. My verification amounted to little. I was going in to the 9th grade, he was going in to the 8th and I thought the best thing I could to maintain any credibility as a 9th grader was not to talk about it. The event then served to separate us, rather than creating a bond. I fell silent about the event. I might occasionally mention I had seen a UFO when television began to popularize the topic during the 70's, but I never related any details. Even saying I had seen a UFO brought the usual scorn and disbelief. I did nothing to convince anyone of what I had experienced. I kept the experience to myself for a long time. Never talked about it. I would see so called pictures of UFO's in newspapers and discounted them as valid because they did not look like the one we saw. At that time I was not prepared to believe that anything other than the type of vessel we had seen was authentic.  My senior year of High School, I did see and article in a newspaper with a photograph of an object much like the one we saw. The photo was taken in Norway. I have seen footage of a UFO shot in Mexico that seemed remarkably similar in the past few years. By some accounts, the craft I saw was not sensation. It didn't blink, or spin, or bounce and weave. It floated and flew off at great speed, sometime reports would have similar details. About 25 years after the event, I made it a point to find my friend who is still living near our home town.

My 65 year old mother lived just down the road from the hospital.   This particular night I finished my shift and left work at the usual time of 11:25 pm.  I drove the few minutes from the hospital to my mothers home.  I lived in the bordering state and she had babysat for my five month old son.   My mom and I had made plans to have her spend the night at my home so we could go shopping the next day.  I arrived at her home around 11:30 that night, collected my son and my mom and we headed out to my home.  It was a 15 minute drive from her home to my home.  The night was extremely clear, the sky filled with bright shinning stars.  We chatted as I drove, thinking of nothing more then the shopping trip we would be making the next day.   My normal route was a ""short cut"" driving on mostly secondary roads with very few houses, just open fields and a beautiful view of the night sky.   As I drove along, I noticed right in front of me, very high in the sky, it appeared to be up there with the stars in altitude, a multi colored lighted object.  It was flashing blue, red, green and bright white lights.  My mother, sitting in the front passenger seat also noticed it.  One could not help but notice it with all the flashing lights, it was so obvious in the night sky.   We both thought it was a airplane.  Then, quite suddenly, it was dropping from the sky right in front of us.  I abrupty stopped the car and we both looked and watched in horror as it dropped from the sky! We both still thought it was a plane, about to crash!  I sat watching with my hands over my ears.  I didnt want to hear the impact that I was sure was about to happen.  Maybe dropping is the wrong word to use, because this object was desending at a tremendous rate of speed.  Then, as we watched, abruptly, just like on a dime, it stopped, hovering above two trees directly in front of us, on the right side of the road. One second, it was ""up with the stars"" and just a small object with lights, and withing 30 seconds, it was at tree top level right in front of us not more then 100 feet away.  The colored lights appeared to implode back into the object itself and now just brilliant white lights flashed.  It made a very soft, quite humming sound as it hovered just above the trees.  There were no other sounds of an engine or of any kind, except for this humming.   I was terrified, my hands shaking as I clenched the steering wheel, I was so afraid for all of us in the car, especially my infant son, asleep in his car seat in the back.  This object was absolutly huge!  Just tremendous in size!  It was saucer shaped, with some sort of dome.  Around the entire dome, we both could clearly see a panel of windows.   What we saw through those windows gave me nightmares for many years.  There were ""beings"" looking out at us!  They were not human in appearance.  I counted 5, my mother, until her death five years ago, swore she counted 6.  I do not know ""what"" they were, but they were not human beings.  From our view, we could see large oval black eyes, with big bug like heads attached to what appeared to be very thin necks with long thin arms.  My mother and I both thought they appeared to be grey in color.   The object hovered there in front of us and we sat frozen, watching it for about 5 or 6 minutes, then, suddenly from somewhere on the underbelly of this object, a bright, blue white light beam shot out at us, lighting the inside of my car like it was daylight!  This light was so bright, so brilliant, that it hurt our eyes and we both had to cover our eyes with our hands to avoid it!  It was so bright that the best way to describe it is to say it was just like the ""blue white light"" that one sees in a lightening bolt!  This beam kept the car lit up for a minute or two, then just as suddenly, it imploded back to the craft.   We took our hands away from our eyes and watched as it abruptly started to very, very slowly move, again, with no sound other then the quiet humming.  It moved above the car.  In terror, I started to drive, anxious to get the heck off of that secondary road and onto the highway to get home!  I was only about a quarter of a mile away from the main roadway.   As I drove toward the highway, the object flew just a slight distance ahead of my car and it was again, within our view.  It was almost like it was leading me to the main route.   I continued driving until I reached the highway.  The object was still directly ahead of us, and it had remained at the same altitued of tree top level.  I made a right turn onto the highway, it did the same.  It continued traveling just ahead of me, following the main highway.   We continued on for approximatly a mile and a half.  At that point, I had reached the left turn to go on the road to my home.  I turned, the craft continued, following the main route.  My home was just a few minutes away.  I got to my home and shut the car off and both my mom and I could still hear, faintly, in the distance the humming as the craft continued on.  I don't think either one of us actually slept that night, I was still shaking the next morning it was such a tramatic experience for us!  I felt compelled to notify someone about what we had seen.   The very next morning, I phoned the civil defense in a neighborring city.  I expected to be laughed at, I was not.  When I gave them my full statement of what had happened they informed me, that they had recieved thousands of phone calls from people that had witnessed the same sighting.  Some they informed me, had merely seen it high in the night sky but there had been many others, like me and my mother, that had seen it at a very close distance.   This event happened to me many years ago, but it is one that I will never forget! I have told hundreds of people about that evening, and I will continue to tell everyone that asks until I am no longer able to. There is life outside our little world, I don't understand the  why's and how's, but I know there is, I have seen it! I hope in your lifetime, you will see it also.

I am an ex military jet pilot. (USMC) 42 years old.  (I add this detail as my qualification for this posting)  My wife woke me at 2 am to show me a  Bright Object in the sky above our cabin in the Big Sur Wilderness.  The sky in that area is dark and has the advantage of having no city lights to ""throw"" a viewer.  The night was extremely clear with no smoke or haze or moonlight.  The Bright Object was steady and appeared to be an orange colored Star.  Larger than other stars in the sky.  First we saw what appeared to be a shooting star drop down, right next to the Bright Object. The shooting star did not come from the object but was near it.  Suddenly the Bright Object dropped what appeared to be a bright plasma ball similar from our vantage point to what one would normally term a shooting star.  At that moment the Bright Object  suddenly began to move from East to West and had the shape of a diamond, but it appeared as if the entire Object was on fire.  Like a space shuttle on fire.  As it moved, it dropped two more ""Plasma balls"" or ""Shooting stars"" and simultaneously, it left a large ""Smoke trail"", which did not have the consistancy of smoke, but more like the trail of a comet.  Then, in a flash it seemed to accelerate out of our atmosphere and disappeared, leaving the ""Smoke trail"" which lasted for another 20 minutes in the star filled sky.  The important part of the sighting is that the Bright Object first appeared STATIONARY and only after dropping the first of several ""Shooting stars"" or ""Plasma Balls"" did it begin to move across the night sky from East to West.  No noise could be heard during the entire event.  As an ex military jet pilot, I know of no technology that would allow a craft or even a meteor to behave in this way.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,36.0858,-121.6086

Not a day in my life hasn't gone by that I haven't thought of this UFO sighting because it was so frightening at the time.  I remember for sure that it was Halloween Night and I am almost positive it happened on Oct. 31, 1988.  It might have been a year earlier or a year later, but I really don't think so.   Me and about 10 of my friends were really bored one Halloween night because we had nothing to do.  One of my friends remembered an old house North of Tryon, Oklahoma, where he had grown up, that was supposed to be haunted.  Just for fun we decided to drive out there, and it was in the middle of nowhere.   It was a clear starry night and we were standing in the road when we noticed an old satellite tumbling across the sky, and we hadn't seen one of those in years.  Looking at the satellite, something far off in the distance caught our eye, and it was about as far away as our eyes could see at the moment.   It flew closer and closer, and then it flew almost directly over us.  It was flying slowly so we were able to watch it for what seemed like at least 5 minutes or more.  We had enough time to observe it with a little scrutiny.   It was a giant, heavy looking, dark colored object that was triangular in shape with a huge orange ball of light eminating from the underside of the craft.  It made no sound whatsoever so it was hard for us to determine how large it was or what altitude it was flying at, but it seemed to be pretty massive in size. The orange, circular shaped ball of light coming from the underside of the craft reminded me of a setting sun. The object had no other lights on it.   When it flew almost directly over us I was terrified to death.  I had been watching too many movies, I guess, and I was afraid it was going to harm us.  But it just kept going, looking as if it was flying kind of in a Northwesterly direction.  We watched it go until we couldn't see it anymore.  It never did change speed, and it appeared to be floating or sailing through the air with no visible means of propulsion.  My friends and I were just in shock.  We couldn't even speak.   About 5 minutes later, a group of 5 helicopters flying in a ""W"" formation came out of the east.  I could not tell if they were trying to follow the craft.  The next day, we scoured all of the newspapers to see if anyone else had reported seeing the craft, but we saw nothing.  We did not report it at the time, because we were afraid that people would say we had been drinking but we had not been drinking.   I often wondered if this craft had been sighted by anyone else in the U.S. that night, or if anyone else has ever seen a craft matching this description.  Just for the record, it was not triangular like a stealth plane, it had more of a short back and two very long sides.   It seemed like the orange circle of light beaming from the bottom of the craft took up a whole lot of space on the underside of the craft.  Thanks for giving me an outlet to speak out after all of these years.  I am currently trying to get back in touch with some of the people that also witnessed this craft in order to see if they remember any other details that I might have forgotten.   Some personal information about myself---I am a female, 46 years old, with aprox. 2 years of college education, currently employed by a university, and at the time of the sighting I was working for ((telephone company)).

As I got onto the highway heading South to Tecumseh, I noticed a bright light coming from the direction of where Tecumseh sits. I at first thought the light to be the town's baseball stadium lights, and that maybe they were accidentally left on. Thinking nothing more about it, I continued home. I finally got off the highway when I reached Tecumseh, and took Rangeline Road back to my house (which also neared the baseball stadium there). As I got closer to the Walnut & Rangeline intersection (right about where the baseball park would be), I noticed that the lights had disappeared. It was at the moment when I reached the intersection did something catch my attention. Something was hovering above the intersection. Startled and bewildered, I turned off my car and jumped out to get a better look. It hovered roughly 40 feet above the ground and looked no bigger than an average car. It gave off no bright glow or luminous light, but was definitely metallic in color. Whatever street lights around had given enough light for me to see this object properly. The object made absolutely NO noise. The only way I have ever been able to describe the look of this craft was that it looked rectangular but with slanted sides, the same way a shoebox would look if you squished it down and the sides were to ""slant out"", like this < >. There were two bulbous objects attached underneath this craft. I stared at the object for nearly two minutes when it started to turn its' direction North, and silently it began moving at what I guess to be 40 miles per hour. I figured the object would be heading towards Highway 177, so I jumped in my car and did a u-turn to follow this thing. I chased it for one mile to the Highway 177 entrance and by the time I got on the highway, the object had taken off like a jet. I pulled off the side of the road and sat there for 15 minutes trying to take in what I had just saw. I've never reported this incident fully, just to my wife and a few friends. I still remember it like it was yesterday. Since then, I have had 5 more occassions where I have spotted these objects (not the same ones however).

It's been awhile since the encounter but here goes… it was sometime in February I believe in 1990 when I lived in Brigantine NJ.  Brigantine is an island and at that time the north end of the island was a wildlife refuge so there is/was no homes or roads or any man made structures on the north end.   This refuge extends maybe a mile or two, it’s a very beautiful place just the dunes, beach, sky and ocean.   I was jogging around 9:00 pm when I saw a round bright light in the distance.  It was hovering over the beach right where the waves were hitting the beach.  It was about 30 to 40 feet off the ground and was maybe 30 feet in diameter. I did not see any structure, just a bright white light.   I kept jogging toward it until I was right under it at which time it went dim, that is, the intensity of the light reduced and it glided about 100 yards away in a straight line, still in line with the waves hitting the beach, stopped and became bright again.   I again jogged until I was just under it.  I thought I hear a very very faint whooshing sound but I’m not sure.  There was no real noticeable sound.   For the second time the light went dim and glided away from me still in line with the beach.  It could have went out to sea but it didn’t.  It stayed right over the hard packed sand where the sea hits the beach acting as if it was trying to avoid me.   My curiosity got the better of me and I jogged up under the light for the 3rd time but this time it did not go dim.  At that time I decided to not push my luck and I turned around and started to jog away from the light.  I keep looking back and I believe I saw a second light coming around the bend where the marshes are and the two of them vanished.   I don’t recall any missing time and don’t believe I was abducted although I did have a weird experience about a year after this sighting while I was sleeping in bed but it’s probably not related.

We were living in a farmhouse overlooking a wide hayfield.  We watched a disk-shaped object that had many lights coming from it. The object seemed about the size of a full moon, but seemed to be flying low over the field.  The lights seemed like crystal; very clear and super bright. It flew erratically and slow, sometimes hovering, then suddenly zipped off to the left moving extremely fast.  Almost immediately it reappeared (or a second one did) from the right hand end of the field. It slowed, hovered, and zipped off as before. We listened carefully but there was no sound.  These had moved too fast to be anything powered by an earthly engine. Later that year, in fall, I was lying in bed fully awake and waiting to fall asleep. I was facing the west window. A bright light outside the window caused me to open my eyes (we had no curtains). I thought it was a full moon, and it moved slowly past the window toward the south. I was still sure it was a full  moon although it seemed to have moved too fast to be the moon.  Suddenly it came back into view moving towards the north. I thought to wake up my boyfriend but I didn't want to miss anything. The round, bright light began to move on a straight path directly away from me. As it moved away it took on a red glow, and within several seconds became the size of a pinhead, then disappeared entirely. In the fall of 2002, I had moved into a house atop a small, forested mountain in the same village. One evening I was working on my computer in the living room. A light began to reflect off the computer screen and it gradually occured to me that no light could be coming from that direction.  I turned and looked out the window. The light was extremely bright and was shining through the trees. It seemed like a very bright yard light that you would see mounted on the peak of a barn.  I went outside and tryed to figure out where it was coming from. There are no houses or buildings back there, and no roads for any kind of vehicle; the terrain is mainly a swamp full of living and fallen trees, barely walkable and certainly not driveable. (Nor is there any area for a plane or helicopter to land).  The light stayed still for some time, then it started to move off slowly towards the right. It gained only a small amount of altitude, and seemed to be moving through the trees. It moved erratically, sometimes hovering. I couldn't make out a shape due to the trees. After it moved along several hundred feet, it suddenly zipped away extremely fast. There had been no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that dates of sightings are approximate.

It  stayed in one place for the entire time I watched it (about 30 minutes) and was very close to the building.  I was amazed that other people did not hear the noise and come out to see what it was.    I was determined to watch it  and would take my eyes off of it.  I got tired, and after a while I grabbed a pillow to lie on my floor and watch it to see how it would move and what it would do.   I fell asleep and it was  gone  when I awakened.   It was one of the two strangest  things  I had ever seen up to that time because it appeared to be too heavy to be just hovering (actually, comopletely still) in the air, so close to me,  making so much noise.

The object stopped and hovered in place once it reached the busy street and then slowly hovered south along Campbell rd.

About 3 or 4 minutes later, my father exited Foodland and we attempted to pursue the craft by driving south down Campbell, the same direction it was slowly hovering in.

It was a late August night.  The sky had a violet hue to it.  That is how, despite the night fall, I was able to discern the shape of the craft in question.  My mother, my grandmother, younger brother and I were parked in our Dodge Ram Charger waiting for my father to get out of Foodland.  My father had been working a number of years as a butcher in their meat department.  Our station wagon was in the shop at the time so, we used the Ram Charger to run errands during the day and were forced to pick my father up from work each night until our car was repaired.  The Foodland was located on Campbell Rd. where it intersects with 14 mile rd.  The Foodland no longer exists.  There is a large grocery store in it's place now, and an Outback Steakhouse restaraunt in the parking lot where we witnessed the bizarre aircraft.  We were parked facing the west side of Campbell Rd, waiting patiently for my father to get out of work.  He was scheduled to work until 8 pm that night and that's exactly when we saw it.  Some bright lights began shining through the treeline above the residences along Campbell Rd.  The lights were very low and they were intensely bright.  Although none of us said a word, I later found out that my grandmother and mother had both assumed, as I had, that the lights belonged to a low flying passenger jet.  Eventually the ascending object came into view above the treeline.  All of us were silent for a moment.  At first, we stared at the object in silence, each one of us trying to determine WHAT it was we were all looking at.  When no conclusion could be reached, my mother exclaimed ""Oh my God!"" and we all got out of the Ram Charger for a clearer view of the strange craft.  By the time I had gotten out of the Ramcharger, the aircraft was no longer ascending.  It remained completely still for about 45 seconds and then slowly, very slowly began hovering southbound along the west side of Campbell Rd.  The object appeared to be about 4 to 5 homeyard lengths, though it is impossible for me to judge exactly what our distance was.  From my perspective, it spanned the distance of about 5 of the front lawns of the residential homes it seemed to be hovering above.  The object was shaped like a relatively thin cylinder.  The perimeter of the craft was lined with rectangular lights of extraordinary brightness.  There were very thin slits dividing the lights that were the same shade as the rest of the exterior of the craft: black(or at least how it appeared as a silouhette against the violet sky).  The lights did not move along the perimeter of the vehicle.  They did however look like they were bound by a textured or coagulated transparent surface.  Those lights were the most incredible display of illumination I have ever witnessed.  I could not see any specific details along the exterior of the craft.  Under the lighting conditions, it appeared to be a flat black or at least a very dark brown.  Although I must admit, there was the hum of Campbell rd. and 14 mile rd. traffic from our position, the hovering object made no sound that could be distinguished from the passing cars.  It left no kind of trail in it's wake either.  After about 4 minutes watching the aircraft hover slowly and silently south along Campbell rd, my mother became frightened and began yelling for me to get back in the Ram Charger.  She later told me that she had begun thinking of all of those horrible U.F.O abduction stories she'd heard about and seen on various t.v shows.  At that point, I could only see about one third of the craft anyways.  It had hovered nearly out of sight behind some of the much taller trees.  I obeyed my mother and got back in the truck.  We all waited with inpatience for my father to exit Foodland.  When he got to the vehicle about 5 minutes later, we were all frantically telling him to get in the car and try to spot once more what we had already seen.  My father laughed at first.  He didn't seem to believe our story at all but after a few moments of him observing our enthusiasm over what we had witnessed, he hopped in the truck and started off down Campbell.  The flying vehicle had not been lost from our sight for more than 6 minutes and yet, as we drove further and further south down Campbell, we found that it was no longer visible in any direction.  Even at major intersections such as 13 and 12 mile, where we looked back to see if the object was flying too close to the trees to be seen from the road itself, we ended up seeing nothing.  It was gone that quick.  As far as I know, no one ever reported sighting the object to the police or any other agencies in that area.  I checked several newspapers the following morning to see if anyone else had shared our bizarre experience.  Given the size, illumination and altitude of the hovering vehicle, it seems completely impossible to me that we were the only people to have witnessed this.  Even as I was glaring at the airborn object, I found it hard to believe that traffic along 14 mile and Campbell didn't come to a complete standstill when this thing came into view.  Save for the indifference of surrounding citizens, it looked like an incredible effects shot of an extra terrestrial visitor in a blockbuster film like ""Independance Day"".  I have never seen this craft again and I also have never seen it photographed or even sketched once during all the time I've spent reviewing popular U.F.O sighting since.

She had called me downstairs to witness this bright orange to reddish light.  I noticed that it was high in the sky and appeared to me to be moving slowly.  It was very peculiar to say the least.  It was so strange that even my wife who was upstairs getting my son ready for trick or treating that night came out to witness it as it sped up and moved in a straight line pattern but in an vacillating fashion.  I was surprised to see other planes move normally against the same  panoramic view of sky. Which gave me a convincing feeling upon comparison that it was not a normal flying craft.  It was hard to tell how high it was but it was certainly much higher than the airliner traffic whooshing faster than the object appeared to be moving.  Erratically this red light started to vacillate to white and then red and the end made a very steep upward climb out of our sight.,2005-09-02T00:00:00,32.71746727272727,-116.98774636363638

I was new to the area at this time and was by myself driving on a two lane road outside of Fuquay Varina, NC.   It was a crystal clear night without a moon when I spotted four large round lights glowing softly off to the right side of the road ahead about a quarter of a mile away.  They seemed to be motionless at first and my first thought was that they were lights on top of a communications tower because of the numerous towers in the area.   Then I realized that tower lights were just small blinking lights there to warn aircraft of their position.  These lights were large, about 3' in diameter, they didn't blink, and they had a soft glow like a child's night light, not like a spot light, and they didn't light up the ground or anything around them.   Then I noticed they weren't stationary, but they were moving very slowly towards the road that I was on.  I started to slow down and realized that it was going to cross over the road right over my head if I slowed down enough, which I did.  I rolled down the windows of the car so I could hear it but there was no sound at all.   There were trees lining both sides of the road that obscured my sight of this object as it got nearer to me but I finally slowed down to the point that I came to a complete stop on the road.  I hadn't seen any other cars on this road at all and hadn't passed any houses for miles, so it was pretty much an isolated and deserted part of the country, so I was safe to sit at a stop on the road with my car idling, windows down with my head out the window and looking up as the front of this thing appeared over the tree tops and slowly and silently floated overhead.   It wasn't more than a couple hundred feet high at the most because it wasn't much higher than the pine trees alongside the road.  Its speed made me think of a blimp cruising along.  It was black and blended in with the pitch black night, making it very hard to see the exact shape of it inspite of being so close, but I could make out what appeared to be panels on the uder side of the craft as the front disappeard over the trees on the opposite side of the road.   It continued to glide in total silence at a very slow speed until the back of the craft appeared over the trees on the right side of the road and then disappeared over the treetops on the left side of the road.  I couldn't see the whole craft at one time because of the trees so the exact size and shape is hard to determine for sure, but because of my occupation I can be considered a very reliable source for size and shape estimates, and I believe what I saw was in a triangular shape and was at least 300' long and 150' wide.   And the strangest part about it is that as it passed over me not more than 200' to 300' overhead, I didn't see the four large round lights that first brought my attention to the object.  I was directly under the craft so they might have been located on the sides and not visible from where I looked up at it.   I have only told a few people about this experience because nobody seems to believe anything that can't be explained, and that things that don't fall within our general knowledge of things just can't be true and must have been imagined.  But I know what I saw and I didn't imagine anything.   And this wasn't something that was in the distance either.  It was only a few hundred feet away from me at the most.  It was huge, totally silent, moving very slowly, and because it was either painted black or made of a very dark material it was almost invisible against a black night sky.   I'm glad I finally found a place that I can tell about this experience because it's been on my mind for the past year and seems so significant that it should be told.

As brillantly lit as any star. I am a college student and I am the only person I know that has seen the UFO as far as I know, but there was a white semi-truck in front of me about three miles up Interstate 84.  I've had this sighting awhile ago but I wrote it down the day I saw it, I am only now reporting it because I finally found a place to do so.  I exited Lad Canyon to get to La Grande for my first class at nine o'clock in the morning.  I saw what I first took to be the galaxy's largest star hovering over the city.  It was four times the size of venus at night, and it was bright and beautiful and didn't move.  However, I noticed a few strange things.  The sky was completely overcast and my star was in front of where the mountain outcrop would be behind the city, so it was no star and no one was driving behind me or on the opposite side of the interstate, so the light could not be a reflection of headlights in my windshield.  However, the oval light stayed hovering over La Grande long enough that I was able to drive several miles closer to it and I was able to distingish faint lines dividing the oval light into quarters, and somehow I got the impression that inside the quarters were several tightly pacted lights within, like stadium lights, but I could not see past the light to count them individually.  When I started to pass under an eletrical weather hazzard sign that warns people of dense fog or winds in the pass behind La Grande, the light started to move.  It made a wide turn and became super thin, like it had turned on its side, and I watched it disappear in a straight line to the east.  I have watched jets cross the sky many times, but this object left no smoke trail and the light disappeared in about five seconds while it seems to take jets forever to cross the sky.  I have no idea what it could have been but I would love to see one again.  It had been so beautiful and I felt peaceful for having looked upon it.  The closest thing I can compare it to is a diamond filled with starlight.

The pattern was at first a shifting kite/diamond shape directly overhead that reorganized into a horseshoe pattern of red lights and sped/zipped to the horizon at high speed.

No prank was played on me as the four buddies were missionaries for the church and no one gave the slightest hint of this being a joke on me. They drew on paper the light patterns and said that they behaved like separate objects rather than off and on lights attached to a single craft or hull because of the jigglly positioning or jockeying the lights did when changing from the kite shape outline formation to the horseshoe formation. Then they departed in a locked in formation as ""one"" entity.   This event was quite possibly recorded in one to four journals as we each kept a journal of our stay in Finland.

"Cigar-shaped, city-block long, silent, super-slow forward moving and descending, three red lights, blotted out the stars w/black.",Wichita,KS,1980-01-11T23:00:00,cigar,3 to 6 minutes,"Occurred : 1/11/1980 23:00  (Entered as : 01/11/1980 23:00) Reported: 2/26/2005 2:52:22 AM 02:52 Posted: 5/11/2005 Location: Wichita, KS Shape: Cigar Duration:3 to 6 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42453.html,"Cigar-shaped, city-block long, silent, super-slow forward moving and descending, three red lights, blotted out the stars w/black. A profound event happened to me on Friday, January 11, 1980.   At 11 p.m., CST, I returned to my then home at ---- N. Emporia, Wichita, KS, parked my car so it was facing east beside my house, turned off my headlights, and in the dark was left with a vision of an object in front of me in the sky like none I had ever seen before or since.   It was huge, cigar-shaped object located about 300 feet in the air above me, about 30 feet east in front of me so that I was not looking straight up, but rather at about an 75 degree angle. It was about a block long and blocked my view of the stars on an otherwise clear night.  It had three flashing lights in a forward-direction-pointing pattern located at its right trailing edge.  It emitted absolutely no sound whatsoever that I could hear, and I have exceptionally good hearing.   How could something that big hover and descend in a fixed direction on a windless, clear night without making any sound? This huge object was moving ever so slowly forward north and descending ever so slowly (just a few feet per minute) towards the massive complex of over 100 Cargill grain elevators on 13th street. I sat in my car for what seemed like at least three minutes scanning my memory for any identifiable object to match what I was seeing and I could find none.  I then got out of my car and moved closer on the ground to watch it.  I stood there for a time as well, but I seemed to lose track of time, maybe another three minutes. However long it was, I still could not come up with any sort of answer as to what I was looking at.  There was nothing in my associative memory to compare it to.  I felt profoundly awed by what I saw and I felt nauseatingly dumbfounded that I could not figure out what it was. Finally, when I could handle my unknowing no longer, I knew I had to take action.  The only traction in terms of evidence and logic my brain had to go on at the time was that there was a very large object moving downwards and in the a northerly direction toward on a path that would soon put it on a direct collision course with one of the world’s largest wheat grain elevator complexes run by Cargill, just one block away on 13th street.  I was concerned that it this huge object hit one or more of those 100 plus grain elevators, there could be a massive grain dust explosion causing extensive death and destruction. Once this horrific thought crossed my mind, I knew I had to call the police and warn them of this imminent danger.  I managed to pull myself out of my awestruck paralysis and go inside to make the call.  The Wichita Police were grateful for my call.  They said they had been getting reports of such an object from all over town and asked me if they could send an officer out to interview me, to which I of course agreed.  The police said they even had one of their helicopters aloft trying to locate and identify this mystery object. They also said the local McConnell Air Force Base people claimed it was not one of their activities and they may even have sent out some planes to locate and identify it, though nothing I know of was ever reported by them. After I got off the phone with the police, I raced back outside to see what progress this object had made.  To my complete surprise, the object was altogether gone.  I got in my car and drove around the area to the north and east and back the other way in hopes of seeing some sign of it.  I never saw it again. The police came out and took my detailed report, which the Wichita police records clerk says was filed January 12, 1980 under the heading, ""Three Flashing Lights"". Shortly thereafter a reporter from the Wichita Eagle Beacon came out and interviewed me.  I was still in shock and awe from what I had seen, and afraid I would be considered some kind of a nut case.  Therefore, I tried to conceal my fear and defend myself from scorn by trying to appear calm and rational, even to the point of trying to normalize or even minimalize and dismiss what I had seen. I told the reporter words to the effect that it was either a very large blimp, a weather balloon, or a very elaborate little hoax.  I was pretty sure it was none of those things, but I had nothing else to reference it to and to speculate any further was quite frightening. Before he left, the reporter gave me the name of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle and the phone number should I want to make a formal report.  I am sorry to say that I did not call that night as I was too shaken up and afraid to do so.  Big things were happening to me, it seemed, and I was already way over my head.  Therefore, lest I go crazy, it seemed best to lie low and see if the rest of the world, or some part of it, had seen what I had seen.   It is only now, 25 years later, that I am able to file this report, thanks mainly to the Peter Jennings ABC program aired here Thursday, 2/24/05, and viewed by me tonight, Friday, 2/25/05, via digital video recorder.  It was a great program and confirmed many of the details of what I saw and the psychological reactions people had to this experience.  Thanks to all who brought this information forward and presented it so well. I am very excited and have much more to say, but I know I don’t have the space to do that here.  Suffice it to say that two days later, on 1/13/1980, the Wichita Eagle/Beacon Newspaper printed the story of what I and apparently two dozen other Wichitans saw on Friday, 1/11/1980.  The article is titled ""It’s a Balloon, It’s a UFO, It’s a Mystery,"" and it appears on page 2E of the Sunday, January 13, 1980 edition of the Wichita Eagle/Beacon newspaper.   Since it does not seem possible to attach a scanned PDF copy of the actual newspaper article to this description, and since I realize you may not have the time or desire to look up the article from the paper’s microfiche, I will copy it, (deleting names and contact information to preserve anonymity even though all interviewees openly gave their names and addresses for publication), for you here:  ((BEGIN TEXT OF ARTICLE)) Headline:  ""It’s a Balloon, It’s a UFO, It’s a Mystery.""

In the evening hours roughly between 8:00 and 9:00 P.M. in the summer of 1980 or 81 (the year is sketchy for me because I was only about 5 years old at the time) My mother, brother and I were on our way to pick up my older sister from a friends house on the backroads of Hancock County, Indiana. It was only a few miles from home on the way back when my mother stopped the car and turned off the motor and began frantically rolling down the window.  My brother and I were in the backseat and my sister had shotgun. My brother and I enquired as to why we stopped and my mother told us to look through the windshield directly in front of us. Upon looking ahead all four of us saw what appeared to be a large round white light moving very slowly and low to the ground from right to left crossing the road in front of us.  My mother was trying to get the window down to see if it made a noise, it appeared not to. When it finally reached the other side of the road above a field the object blinked out like someone flipping a switch and as quick as it appeared it was gone. We were all in awe and a little frightened by this.  We did not report this to anyone outside our family, my mother being worried we might become the town kooks or something but we found out later we were not the only ones who witnessed this object. Apparently a farm family had a terrifying experience a little earlier that evening and had reported it to some sort of investigators I am not sure who, and a burned circular imprint was found in a field close to the family's farm.  To the best of my recollection this object somewhat harrassed the family by hovering near the home for quite a long time. I believe this sighting was reported and could maybe be found in some Greenfield newspaper archives. I have always wanted to report this sighting because the farmer family were not the only witnesses to this astonishing occurence.

This happened so long ago, but something I will never forget....although other known witnesses seemed to have?  My parents were taking me to a basketball game approx, 4 miles from home, 4 of us in vehicle...me I am not sure whom was sitting where anymore, other than father driving....I think I was sitting in the backseat with my brother, and my mother on passenger side front?  Well anyhow about a mile and 1/2 into drive a ""star"" caught my eye....at first I thought it was only that, as sun just barely beginning to set, and we were heading east....this road we were on is called ""V-Highway"" and within sight from the hill we had just crested, and this vantage point, you can see the turn off to George Washington Carver Natioanl Monument.  WELL I noticed that the first ""star"" of the evening was moving. I watched more, and at that time saw 3 other lights. One was on the left hand side of the road from my viewpoint, the other 3 were on the right hand side of the road...and seemed to be quite some distance off, I felt beyond the little town of Diamond which would have been 2 1/2 miles at beginning of sighting, and 1 1/2 miles when sighting over.  Well as I was studying this group of lights and could tell that they were all moving, my second thought was airplanes or helicopters....UNTIL they began to do things, that were just not earthly possible, by any known aircraft made by man NOW let along then. The ""light"" on left moving oddly....but very slowly compared to the 3 on the right....I am not sure how to describe their movement? Like tadpoles in a pond?...or maybe sperm under a microscope?  Very abrupt movement....very darting, very fast, but as well would stop, and not appear to be moving at all....then even more quickly than they appeared ""they disappeared"" in the blink of an eye. It was as if you snapped your fingers, and before you even hear the sound....they ""the lights"" were gone.  I recall seeing a slight tracer, for a brief instant, heading away from the earth, not towards it.  Whole thing I doubted lasted much more than 3 mins, maybe even less...probably so, as distance of sighting only about a mile. I know there were 4 other eyewitnesses that I know of....one was my Mom, but unfortunately she does not recollect it.  Well when I got to ballgame, of course I told all my good buddies about it as soon as I got there...well as I was telling them about it, one of them piped up and said ""Me and my Mom saw those lights too!"" They very respected family at the time in Diamond (have since moved), and loved by all....so was happy to hear him say that...so no one thought I was making it up or anything.  I have been telling people about this for over 20 years now....I am beginning to think ""now"" I am the only one that remembers the lights.  My friend, the last time I talked to him...seemed to have forgotten.  I sent him an e-mail after the ""Seeing is Believing"" episode...and asked him again, if could remember that....and as well to ask his mother if she remembered seeing them still yet today.  To me it was AMAZING, and I will never forget it so long as I live.  I have another tale to tale, although ""not my own"" ....it is my mothers. When my Grandmother died....my Mom woke up and looked at the clock, it was the exact time of my Grandmothers passing. My mother has described to me a dream she had that night many times, before he waking, and looking at the clock. She said she was in a white room, with Grandma.....and others around but she could only sense them,  but not see them,  only my Grandma.   She still describes yet today, what sounds to me like some sort of ""time travel"" or ""travel into another dimension?"" and travelling at a high rate of speed, when all of a sudden a voice came to her....and told her it was her time to go, and she said he final good-bye to her Mom...and she woke up, and looked at the clock.  She can tell you about that dream yet today....as if it happened yesterday. That would have been 1980  I have had other strange things happen in my life....but not sure if UFO related  I had what I understand to be a ""night-terror"" at maybe age of 13?   Woke up scared to death...screaming, but unable to scream...in a cold sweat, and unable to move.  Years later I was only one at home in family's house...and woke up feeling as if ""someone is watching me""  Like woke up for whatever reason, and trying to go back to sleep, and 1/2 asleep....then it ""hit me"" , that feeling...""I am being watched""  I rolled on my back, and made myself open my eyes....what I saw scared the Hell out of me!!!!  I would call it an ""apparition"" ...was no one I knew?  It seemed to be the Grim Reaper, without the sythe....was very shadowy, and appeared to be hooded...but very short, like alien descriptions.  I yelled at it, swang at it, and tried to get away from it....then in a brief second ""it"" was gone.   Well as it was there was a tree near the window, and I dismissed ""it"" as a shadow, or at least tried to. But honestly I have never seen a shadow make a figure standing above you, nor ever again, or before has a shadow woken me up...with the feeling as if I was being watched? As well in order to calm myself down after the incident, I got our faithful frind and Rottweiler to come in my room and sleep there with me. She was very hesitant to enter the room, and entered with head bowed down...very unlike her    I would be interested in having a paranormal investigator contacting me.....too many weird unexplainable things I have seen and experienced....and I know others in same time frame that had weird encounters as well.

It was still visible and was still moving as it became light out, and I took a video showing the only two objects still visible in the sky were this object and Mars.  While it was still dark out we noticed a number of shooting stars.  The next day, at the same time, I noticed three of the same objects making the same motions, not close to each other, about 20 degrees left or right of each other.  They all appeared nearly identical, possibly at different distances from me this time.  My sister saw them also.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,45.9314,-122.4487

We were awestruck and wide-jawed and then one of the 10 foot wide beams scanned us passed us and immedeatley swept back on our bodies. Both other search beams then shot on our bodies, we were completley exposed and frightened.  We ran, hearts pounding and completley freaking out under a tree, where the lights followed and shone through the folliage for a horrifing breif period of time. I think I was praying by then. The lights shut off with a klunking sound and we each fealt safe that we were not going to be harmed.  We walked out from under the tree and saw a large triangular shaped object floating over our heads. We watched it drift off over the glistening water as it made a very low frequency humming sound. There were 5 lights on the back of the ship that blinked in sequence from right to left one at a time, very slowly and methodiclally, amber in color.  It drifted ever so slowly over the silent surface of the water for several min. untill it faded into the horizion.

I sat down for a rest(2300ft elevation) while hiking the hills on our property. It was early dusk with clear skies. Looking west I saw two bright white lights maybe two miles distant approaching at approx. 40 to 50 mph as they cleared nearby hills(3400') by about 200 to 300'. At about 1/2 mile each light resolved itself into 3 smaller white lights located at the vertices of perfect equilateral triangles.  The two craft kept approaching directly towards my position with the one on right side leading by 100ft and about 100ft separation to the other.  Both were absolutely silent and headed directly above me as they moved due east.   I watched intently when ""on a dime"" the lead craft suddenly stopped straight above me (at I guess anywhere from 700' to 1200' above). Looking straight up I saw the craft as a dull metallic triangles against the blue sky--I can't recall much else right then except maybe a central circular feature and the fact the other craft had proceeded east over a hill.  I became increasingly nervous as it sat perched directly above. After about 30 seconds I panicked and ran down the hill (1 minute) to my truck parked in workyard.  Looking up it was still there and the other one was slowly rejoining it from the east.  I jumped in truck and drove it across New Idria Road and up my driveway to my home (about 90 seconds), to find out that both craft were still just hovering there (in echelon as before). So I watched them in their silence.  After a few minutes one of them headed slowly east over the hill again and minutes later returned again.  I went for my camera (35mm) to find no film--highly peeing me off-and I had no one to call (nearest neighbor 6 miles north).    returned outside to watch more of the same action (silent hovering with one and then the other every 5 to 10 minutes smoothly tracking east and then returning-in a sinister manner I recall thinking}.  I think I found binoculars but could not hold them steady to any advantage.  I flipped them (the craft) off in my angst but quickly ""apoligized"" and started making arm motions 'to come on down' and sit a spell--to no avail.  It got dark and yet they were still there. I pulled out my flashlite to signal--it did not work nor did any others I could find (not unusual but I can't say I checked later to ascertain their real status).  In the dark I could see and remember the white lights at the vertices. At one point I got a stiff neck and went in for a sandwich.  Back outside--still there.  An hour or so after dark they finally glided off slowly(at max. 15 mph) in tandem due east.  It seems it was 10:30 pm or so then.  They made me feel uneasy and it's strange but I cannot recall telling anyone about it (except maybe one friend-who can't recall) which just wasn't and isn't like me.   And I might have even forgotten all of this but for the fact that a year and two weeks later I had another sighting which I will report (here in NUFORC database) as September 12 of 1992. It was this later sighting that seemed to trigger my recall of this one. Both sightings were absolutely real but leave me very perplexed (esp as to not telling folks and even not recalling this sighting).  I have no recollections of being abducted (though I'm curious enough to want to try hypnosis) and it seems certain that this first sighting began a recurring 'nightmare' of not being able to find light switches in dimly lit dreams of mine.  Other details: My best estimate of craft size is 40 to 60' on a side. Dull metallic silver hulls. Some sort of circular configuration maybe 10' diameter at center of the belly of the triangles.  Would have reported this long ago but just became aware of this website after Jenning's special.  Want to thank website creators very much and would appreciate knowing of similiar sightings, especially one's around same time and within 200-300 miles of central California.

Half-circles connected by rectangle. Approximate Location: Lat: 42.50 Long: -83.76  UFO approximately  300 - 500  ft in width  minimum. Altitude 800  to  1000  feet  minimum.   Craft  is  best  described  as two semi-circles connected  together with a single  beam. The rounded edges of the semi-circles were on  the outside edge of the craft.  The  craft  moved  in  a  perpendicular  direction  to  the  beam connecting the  semi-circles. The craft was  totally silent. Only two  small white  lights were present at  the semi-circle edges, which neither changed  in color, or intensity. The  under body of the  craft is  thought to  be a  light grey.   The velocity of the craft was  anywhere from 50 to  100 mph. The direction  of travel was S-SW to  N-NE. The duration of the  event was approximately 1 minute,  thirty  seconds. Nothing of an extraordinary nature occurred except the appearance of the craft. It  was about  a quarter  after eight  o'clock, myself and a friend were leaving my home. It was  a clear night, and as we was walking to my car, I was gazing at the stars. Not many stars were present,  as  there  was  a  slight  haze  present  in  the upper atmosphere. A small  group of stars caught my  attention and were approx.  30 degrees  above the  horizon and  directly South of my home. Not seeing anything unusual, I proceeded to walk to my car, I put the key  in the door, then glanced back  at the small group are stars again. I then noticed  that two tiny lights were moving together and at a fixed  distance from each other.  The lights appeared to move  in our direction. I immediately pointed the lights out to my  friend. The lights appeared to be a great distant apart, not something you would expect to see in the night sky.  I assumed at  first that there  must be two  objects, flying  together.  The  object  appeared  to  be  very low to the ground, not more than a couple  of hundred feet. Thinking I could get a good  look at the object with my  spotlight which I keep in the trunk of my car, I  quickly unlocked the trunk, and proceeded to retrieve my spotlight. As I proceeded to get the spotlight, my friend  continued to  watch the  lights. After a few seconds I had I plugged the spotlight into  the cigarette lighter, and pointed the light at the lights.  The light was not able to illuminate any part of the object. I  panned the light between the lights, hoping I could see something.  At this point I realized  that the object had to  be at least  800 to 1000  feet high, and  that the lights were  about  300  -  500  ft  across.  I  deduced  this simply by estimating the  distance away that  the object was. It was flying at a low altitude and it was huge. The object flew directly over our heads, and passed over my home. I continued to shine the light at the object, but saw nothing. I considered the lights belonging to a single object is  because they moved toward us,  and did not vary in position with respect to one another, I therefore assumed that they were connected to a single object.  The lights passed directly over us, and no sound was emitted by  the object.  I specifically   asked my  friend to  listen for anything.  We heard  absolutely nothing.  The object  traveled at what seemed to be a  constant altitude, with a constant velocity. The lights did  not change in intensity or  color. The object did not rotate  or maneuver in  any unusual respect.  It glided over, not making a sound as it passed.  We attempted to chase the object in an automobile. We drove several miles north along the service drive of U.S. 23. A heavy cloud front was approaching in from the north, and we gave up hope of following the object. We stopped and stood outside of the vehicle looking up at the approaching cloud front.  While standing outside of our vehicle, a craft  emerged from  a the clouds. The craft  which appeared was fully lit with running flashing running  lights, and landing lights.  The landing lights had  illuminated  the  clouds  just  before  it  emerged. Looking carefully at the  craft, we noticed about 20-30  red lights which appeared  to be  mounted to  the front  of the  craft. They  were brilliant  red,  like  heat  lamps  used  at  restaurants.  There appeared to be  no pattern to the way the  lights were mounted on the aircraft's  front, it did  seem that there  was some type  of surface  area   to  whatever  was  holding   the  lights. I have never seen anything similar before or since that was mounted to the front of the aircraft.  Almost immediately after the aircraft appeared  from the cloud, the roar of jet engines was very loud. Was  stuck me as odd was the amount of noise  generated by this  aircraft, and it's  low velocity. We thought immediately that it must be a helicopter because it was moving  very  slow.  The  craft  traveled West to East,  crossed  over the expressway (U.S. 23),  and  headed  in  the  general  direction  of Detroit Michigan. I would estimate that  the craft was about one thousand feet  from the  ground, and  traveled less  that one  hundred and fifty miles per hour.  After waiting  around for about a  minute for something else to happen,  we left the area and proceeded South to my home. We could  still see aircraft that emerged  from the clouds, it stayed  on course, and  was disappearing into  the horizon. We did not see that aircraft again.  When we returned home and discussed what had happened, my friend stated that she saw the shape of the object as it passed overhead. The shape she drew was basically a circle cut in half and separated, then a rectangular bar connecting the halves.  As stated above, I could only see the lights mounted on the edges which seemed to shine toward the center of the object, but I could not make out any shape. I believe my vision was impaired because I was holding a bright spotlight that I was using to illuminate the object. I believe my friend was being sincere about what she had seen.  I can say with a high confidence that whatever this object was, it was a single object, it was traveling at a very low altitude, and there was absolutely no sound generated by this object.  The following Monday, I called the FAA at Willow Run Airport and reported the incident to a  FAA investigator. He said that he would  look into  it, and  call me  back. I  did not remember his name, and I am not sure that he gave it to me.  On Wednesday  of that week, I  called again to the  FAA, and talked to  a Mr. ((name deleted)) (sounds  like - ((deleted))),  he said he had heard nothing of  the report.  He asked  around the  office, and found no  one who remembered the  report. He then asked  me about the  incident, and  I told   him everything,  with of  course the exception of the actual visual sighting  of the craft (shape as described by my friend). I told him it must have been a blimp. The following Friday, I  called the  FAA back,  and asked what the about  progress of  the investigation.  Mr. ((name deleted)),  then told me that  he passed  the report  the Mr.  ((name deleted)),  and that he would contact me. About  an hour  later, Mr. ((deleted)) called.  We had  a long discussion  about  the  event.  He  told  me  he  personally  had contacted all major airports in  the area, which was an extensive list I must say, and they had  no reports of a blimp in the area. He  then  contacted  Goodyear  and  asked  them. According to Mr. ((deleted)), no blimps were operational in Michigan.  He went on  to tell me what happens when  a craft appears on radar. When a  craft has a transponder, it  relays the aircraft's ID code back to the control  tower. No aircraft were operating in the  vicinity  at  anywhere  near  the  altitude  given.  Then we discussed the possibility of large aircraft without a transponder. The  control  technicians  are   responsible  for  recording  all incidents  of  these  so  called  ""primary  targets"", none of the airports reported any primary targets  in this area. He contacted all the airports in the  surrounding area, and nothing was found.  I must say that Mr. ((deleted)) went far beyond my expectations of a  FAA investigator. He  was very frank  and honest about  the entire situation, and  had gone far beyond his duties to attempt to identify this aircraft.  At the end of our conversation, he told me that this report is not closed,  and will remain open. My hope is that one day someone will be able to review historical radar data to determine whether the object that we had seen did actually show up on radar. One thing is for certain, it was not a figment of our imagination, a meteor,  or swamp gas.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,42.54766358381503,-83.77078901734104

Alternating red lights in the Northern Maine Woods,Millinocket,ME,1992-06-30T20:00:00,triangle,30 minutes,"Occurred : 6/30/1992 20:00  (Entered as : 06/30/1992 20:00) Reported: 2/26/2005 9:08:08 PM 21:08 Posted: 5/24/2005 Location: Millinocket, ME Shape: Triangle Duration:30 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42511.html,"Alternating red lights in the Northern Maine Woods Back in the spring of 1992, my wife, my younger brother, his girlfriend, and I took a ride up towards Baxter State Park on what is known locally as the ""State Road"" in my 1990 Ford XLT 4X4 pick-up truck.  The sun was slowly setting in the sky and it was a beautiful, but somewhat chilly, early summers evening.  We drove past the entrance to baxter state park and continued north on the state road which, at the time, had been closed to vehicular traffic as it was being utilized as a logging tote road due to the logging operations in the area.  Having lived out of state for a few years, and home for the fourth of July holiday, I commented to my brother, my surprise that they were havesting timber so close to the park.  About that time my soon to be sister-in-law exclaimed ""Did you see that? Did you see that flash of light?""   My brother replied that he did but my wife and I stated that we didn't see it but intrigued, I stopped the truck and we all looked off towards the right side of the road where they said that it had come from.  As we were sitting there talking about what they had seen, the bright flash occurred again and instantaneously the truck died. No lights, no radio, nothing! The ignition key was still turned on but the truck was entirely dead. This time, all of us saw the flash of light.  Spooked, I opened the drivers side door and got half-way out of the vehicle, scanned the area and got back in, leaving the drivers side door open.  I turned the key to start the engine, tried the horn, and the headlights, all to no avail for a period of about 2 minutes.   As we sat there talking about what had occured, with my wife sarcastically accusing me of ""Using the dead battery trick"", the trucks' dome light and headlights slowly and eerily came back on as if someone was turning a rheostat from dim to bright. The radio came back on with static with its clock reset and counting down from 00:00.  Needless to say, we were all a bit spooked by this, but at this time the rational part of me was thinking out loud that the truck had some sort of electrical problem. I quickly turned the ignition key and started the truck. My brother agreeing with my thoughts, stated that maybe we should turn around and head back towards town (25 miles away) before the truck dies again. I agreed and proceeded to perform a quick three-point turn in the middle of the narrow tote road.  No sooner had we turned around and started to slowly drive back towards town, my brother, in his usual humorous manner, started to carry on that maybe the truck died because of an unseen UFO or aliens.  We all started laughing and joking about his comments, but as I turned my head to say something to my brother, I was stunned by what I saw and mid-sentence I said ""What ((obscenity deleted)) is that!?""   Off to the right-side of the vehicle, approximately 50 feet into the woods and approx 10-15 off the ground, were three alternating red lights in a triangle pattern, that were ever so slowly, gliding silently through the trees.  I stopped the truck and everyone stared out the passenger side window as these lights slowly moved through the forest, parallel to the road.  My brother exclaimed ""go! go! follow them,"" so I put the truck in gear and started to drive down the road at approx. 10 mph in order to keep them within view on our right hand side.  We both had our windows down yet the lights made no sound what so ever. Nor did they seem to be impeded by any of the trees, they just floated and blinked silently through the forest as we kept pace with them.   About a half mile down the road they started to pick-up speed and I adjusted the vehicles speed to keep up.  Further on down the road, they increased speed again, staying within the forest at the same elevation as before, but now  visible out the front windshield of the vehicle.  Again my brother prodded me to speed up.  By this time I had accelerated the truck to 50 MPH on the rutted old tote road yet the lights were leaving us behind. As we crested a hill we could see the lights approx 100 yard directly in front of us in the middle of the road.  I floored the accelerator hoping to gain on them but in the blink of an eye the lights took off..gone!   As we approached the section of road where the lights dissapeared I stopped the truck and we all scanned the forest, sky and behind us for any sign of them.  Nothing. Just eerie blackness pierced by my vehicles headlights.  I put the truck in gear again and continued down the state road towards town.  As we neared Millinocket Lake we decided to pull into the Golden Road gatekeeper's office to see if anyone else coming out of the Northwoods had reported seeign anything strange.  (Note: The golden road runs parallel to the state road for several miles between millinocket lake and abol. Where we witnessed the UFO lights the distance between the golden road and the state road is approx 1/4 mile with a high tension power line (from McKay Station Hydro) running parallel between the two roads.)   After we reported what we had witnessed to the gate tender, we returned to the state road heading towards town (millinocket).  As we rounded a sharp turn in the road, just before the millinocket lake store, I slowed down and pointed up to the power line in front of us to make light of our experience,and I jokingly told my brother that the UFO must have just refueled because the wire was glowing red. (note: this section of line has device on one phase that intentionally glows whenever the line is energized)   My brother started in with his wisecrack comments and then......the truck died!  Same as before, no lights, no nothing!   Totally spooked, and with the hair standing up on the back of my neck, I jumped out of the truck and started looking around in all directions for the lights that we had seen previously. Nothing. Nothing but total blackness.  I jumped back in to the truck, and this time the girls were rather upset, again my wife accused me of pretending that the truck died (why I'll never know?) so to prove it to her I turned the key repeatedly and pushed and pulled the headlights several times all to no avail.   And then..just like the previous time...the headlights and the vehicles dome light slowly and eerily came back on as if someone was turning a rheostat.  Needless to say I wasted no time in starting the truck and headed towards millinocket.  That was the end of of our freaky experience in the Northern Maine Woods...or so we thought.  Upon arriving back in town, we headed over to my brothers house to watch a movie that we had rented earlier in the evening.  Still excited by the nights events and good naturedly discussing and jibing one another over what had transpired, the girls and I turned on the TV and sat down on the couch while my brother popped some pop corn.   As we were sitting there watching TV and talking...the TV mysteriously turned off...all by itself, with the remote control to the TV sitting on the coffee table in front of us.  Weird Huh?   With that my brother went into another hysterical episode of how they had followed us and were hovering over our house....but then ...you had to have been there.  The next day I took my truck up to the Ford garage where a friend had worked.  My brother and I told him about our experience and they willingly looked the truck over.  The only thing that they found was the positive post of the battery had a dark discoloration as if it had been overheated.  They cleaned the terminals and the truck never died on me again for as long as I owned it.    Maybe it was a coincidence that the truck died, and we saw and followed the flashing lights or, maybe the lights that we did see, did in fact affect the trucks electrical system.  Either way it was not a natural experience seeing those lights, alternating and floating through the forest and out-running my truck.  I must add, this was the second time that my younger brother had seen a UFO (1980's which I didn't find out until after our mutual incident) and since then, I have witnessed another UFO, years later in 2003 while camping at millinocket lake with my older brother.   But those are for another day. Respectfully submitted  ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))",2005-05-24T00:00:00,45.7226,-68.7951

We lived in Pembroke Pines Florida near Ft Lauderdale.   At around dusk, which was probably around 7:00 pm, I heard my neighbors who were in my back yard yelling for me to come outside as a UFO was passing directly over my yard. As I came out, I was stunned to see the brightest orange object I have ever seen in my life. The craft was flying several thousand feet in the air. The size of the object was about 50 to 75 feet across. The object was disc-shaped. The color orange was so bright; you could not make out any details of the bottom of the craft.  The craft made absolutely no noise and was cruising rather slowly in a north-to south direction. Upon realizing this, I quickly called my brother who lived due south of me in Miami to run outside with his video camera to capture this incredible sight. Unfortunately, when I called, my brother was not home. The local Miami FOX news channel however, did receive video footage of this event and broadcasted it the next day.

A very bright beam of light shone on me from behind, and thinking it was a car coming, moved to the side. But a car didn't pass me.  I thought nothing of it since I had passed a house not far back (opposite the cliff) and maybe the car had stopped there (didn't look back). A minute later again a light from behind, throwing my shadow directly in front of me, and again moved the side so a car could pass, the light went out and no car passed. Another minute or so later it happens again and I noticed my shadow moving in an odd way, turned around to see what was going on and saw a bright light, maybe twice the apparent size of a full moon in the treetops high up on the cliff.  Just as I looked at the light it went off, fading out and seeming to turn as it did so. I stood there puzzling on what was going on, knowing that there were no trails on this cliffside. I continued on my way another few yards and the light came on again. It did seem to be a beam of light, shining directly at me, since it only illuminated the area right around me.  And just as before, when I looked up at the light, it faded out and seemed to turn as it did so.  I saw some diagonal movement of the light before and during it's fading.   I continued into Pana for a much needed beer, but unable to tell anyone for several days of the events of that evening. Years later saw two men on an afternoon talk show telling of there experience while in a small boat on a lake at night. Their description of the light, turning or swiveling as it faded out, seems almost identical to my event.

It was around 11:00 P.M. I was driving my car to home in Dayton, Nv. It was a Friday night. I am not sure what the date was other than the Year and Month. It was April of 1996. This is a real true encounter and I do not wish to be known. It has been actually a hard thing for me to deal with in my life. I was actually going to go home to grab my guitar. I was a 25 year old guitar virtuoso. My indian friend from the Hopi tribe in town was waiting for me to come back. I was a kid, just trying to have some fun on a Friday night. So now I am going to put into perspective the events that happened, true and factual. I will have you know straight forward that this story is complete and true. I will send drawn pictures soon. So I was driving in my Dodge Rampage on Hwy. 50 East in Moundhouse Nevada. My window was down. The air was blowing on my face. I had my radio tuned in and up fairly loud. My speakers sucked with some distortion, but it was cool with me. I was on my way home to grab my guitar at 11:00 at night. I was intending to get there as fast as possible cause I wanted to create some music with my friend Chris, the Indian. So it was already late and I knew I had to hurry. I had nothing else to do. I passed the Virginia City turn off on the left. As I passed it I noticed some light on the hills at the mouth of the Canyon there. There were 4 lights. They were a whitish blue and very very bright. They were lighting up the sagebrush actually on the hillside on the west side of the VC Highway. They were about 50 to 100 feet off the ground. I was driving so, I saw the lights but I looked away as I was driving. I was thinking to myself thats a low jet. I thought it was a jet plane coming from Reno. I looked back at them. They were still in the same spot some 30 seconds later. Then I began to wonder. What the heck is that. Must be a helecopter I thought. Then I really began to stare. No it's not a helecopter. I knew it was no helecopter or plane. Yet, I could see no object, only lights. They were not moving. I could see the brush on the hill bright as day. I saw some things moving in the brush. Little objects scurrying about very quick like that of coyote's or something. My heart began to thump. The adrenaline kicked in as I realized this was something different than that I'd ever seen. I was driving still and slowed down so I could see more of it. I was very realized and already had a hunch it was a UFO. I said out loud, ""Haha yeah you know I can see you."" As soon as I said this, the lights began to turn. They were no longer shining on the brush. They span approximately 100 yards apart with 2 on top about 30 yards apart and the lower ones at the sides about 100 yards apart. They looked like the lights in a stadium kind of. They were very big and bright. There were no other cars behind me I could see lights from nor in front of me. My heart was racing fast. I was frightened. I no longer was really watching the road. The lights had my total attention. They turned around and began slowly hovering down the Canyon towards the Highway I was driving on. There were then smaller lights below the larger ones that were blinking in succesion around and repeated. Thats when I realized it was a round object. I was freaking out. My eyes were huge I'm sure and I was awake and ready to notice every detail. The lights came closer down the canyon as if to head me off at the pass. Like direct coordinates at my speed to meet me at a certain point ahead. I knew I was heading straight towards them at the same time. I was afraid, yet I was curious. So I kept driving and looking as they became larger and closer. I was amazed. Entranced by the realization and curiousity I barely even looked at the road ahead. I was just staring out my downed window. My radio became all fuzzy and then was silent. My car was driving fine. Soon there became an embankment on the side of the Highway that separated the lights from my vision. I knew from driving the Highway many times that the embankment recedes as you approach Dayton hill where the Canyon is. I also knew the thing was moving down the canyon at the same speed I was. The suspense was incredible. I came to the hill and as soon as the Embankment receded, there I saw something that I will never forget for the rest of my life. I was at top the hill and the Canyon beside me on the left. Right there as the ground cleared way, I was gazing into the middle of a set of windows! Yes, this was real. I was not even watching the road. I was mezmerized by the depth. I was staring straight into a spacecraft from another world. It was indeed a saucer. Yes, there were long windows draping all the way across and around. I saw the tiers or stories, the floors. I saw the walls. Everything inside was white. This was incredibly astounding. I had no clue what to think or anything. All I could do was stare and observe.It was like I was above it and as I went down the hill I became level with it. On the left bottom story in the windows were aliens that I first saw. There was a female. They all were wearing white robes. She had a bracelet and a necklace on, that of gold or silver and makeup like blush on her cheeks. Her arm was on the shoulder of a younger one, a boy and they were looking right at me. Right into my eyes they were. She nudged herself to him and spoke to the other younger children along the window maybe 10 or so more. They were all smaller like a 5 year old. She was talking to the older boy and them without speaking! And me! I felt a joyful feeling inside as they gazed into my eyes and she then smiled and pointed at me as to show them that I understood her and them. Her long finger, their faces grey. She had 3 fingers and a thumb. I then had a terrible feeling. I looked up to the second story. There was 2 beings there in the middle of the room. I was about level with them I think. The being I first saw had a long draped back skull like that of the movie alien kinda but the face andeyes of E.T. His skin was chocolate brown and he too was wearing a white robe. His skull was maybe 2 feet long behind his head draping down. His face looked a lot like E.T. The kids faces below looked like the alien pictures you often see yet their eyes weren't black. Their eyes were shaped like the pictures but they were white with irises. Blue eyes, the girl had green eyes. The one with the draped skull on the second story was standing and holding a clipboard against himself in his white robe. I noticed all that stuff as he noticed me. His mouth dropped! His eyes bulged! As he realized I was looking at him and them and He was staring straight into my eyes! He was frightened that I saw him. It was deffinately not part of his plan. His eyes were white with huge blue irises and pupils. I'd estimate I was 20 feet from his face. I made contact alright. He immediately turned to the other one in the room in front of him. The one in front of him was sitting. I saw the side view of him but only his head at the time. He had a human like head. Not a draped skull. I could see wrinkles all over his head. It made him look very old. No hair on any of them whatsoever. He was not in white. He was wearing a black suit from what I could see. He turned his face toward me! Right after the one with the clipboard looked at him after seeing me! He turned his face toward me. Ohhhh Myyyy Goddd was I scared!!!! He was so so so so so old looking it sent shivers all over me. His face was all wrinkled and old and his eyes all beady! They were pure black. As he and I stared eachother in the eyes I realized he was a man. He was a human. He must've been thousands of years old and very wicked. I was petrified. I was scared shitless. He gave me this snarling look yet at the same time I could see his smarts. There was some kind of bigscreen in front of him blinking at the outer rim of the windows edge at the end of the ship windows on his floor. He then looking at me directly, raised his hand up with a very long finger and smiled or smirked as he hit a button on some kind of panel in front of him. Instantly! The windows covered themselves with a fanlike shell that was that like of ripples like of a Chinese fan decending from the top. Corrogated riffles about 1 foot high each decending from the top to the middle. They were breathing like and sparkling with colors. I noticed that they were very sharp looking like razor blades all on the top along the riffles.They could cut through anything! The bottom sealed up and began blinking lights around in succession. That must be how they do their airports. That must be their laws or regulations I thought. Then it began to spin. My window was still down and I was close to the bottom of the hill as I heard the riffles begin to hummmm! They sounded like they were some kind of giant fan blades. The object tilted at about a 45 degree angle. As it spun faster and faster I could only see the outline of it. Like it was suddenly cloaked. Kinda like a rim on a car as it spins. It spun so fast it began to become invisible. It then shot up into the sky leaving a small white trail behind for a split second. I was petrified. I had reached the bottom of the hill and pulled over. I had to look through my rear view mirror to switch lanes from traffic. I pulled over and got out of my car. I looked up. I wanted to see it more. It was sunny outside. There were cars going by. It only takes 3 minutes to get down the hill. I was at the top at 11:00 P.M. and the bottom around 8:30 or something. Yet, I didn't even realize this. Not at all. I had no conception of time. I was tired. I went home and crashed out. I woke up and remembered the hill. I don't know how it was daylight when I got to the bottom of a 3 minute hill at 11:00. I don't remember anything between that time accept for driving down the hill. I have only told a handfull of people this story. There's more to it as well in the day and the months that followed. I will tell more if I get a chance. I think they were mining gold or silver. I bet if someone pulled a map of resouces and compared it to sightings they might realize some things. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was constant but incredibly loud for how far it was from us.

I had just done a radio check with range control to let them know everything was ok (that is why I remeber the time so well)anyway I pulled my poncho up over my whole body because of the bugs attacking me, and the next thing I know my poncho is pulled off of me and I see what would be called a typical ""Grey"" looking alien, except that his skin was more of an almond color (it was a very bright night with a full moon)standing over me with what looked like four others behind him.  What shocked me even more was that it talked to to me, but it sounded like one of those adult characters on the ""peanuts"" cartoons - like ""wha wha wha -wha wha etc."" I remeber just becoming unglued and jumped up and started screaming when it talked to me and then it just disappeared along with the others- The other guy out there guarding ammo with me, woke up when he heard me scream and asked what was wrong - I told him what had just happened and he looked at me like I was crazy, I then noticed that it was 10:30pm, and I was like what the heck, I know that I did not fall asleep because it was my turn on radio watch, so I know that I did not dream this but cannot account for the missing time. I did not want to radio in what just happened for fear of getting a psych eval, even though an intruder near an ammunition dump is serious and should have been called in and the other Marine with me said that he was asleep the whole time and did not see or hear anything until i started screaming and jumping around.  Anyway I kept quiet about this incident for a few days but it was bothering me so much that finally about a week later I told a couple of my friends about it, and a good friend of mine that had been out there a day before, said that almost the same thing happened to him, except that he had chased into the ammo tent and when he was just about to shoot it, it just disappeared - he said that he was also afraid to say anything because he thought that people would think that he was crazy.

Your site has several listings that are very close to this and it is interesting that no one seems to have a clue what it is.   The following description was originally posted on my own website (www.danafrostick.com) about 4 years after the event occurance and was updated as noted on 3/22/2002:  ufo in breckenridge, texas?   On the night of a full lunar eclipse in the autumn of 1996, my future husband and I were stopped at a small roadside motel for a rest in our Southwestern journey. We enjoyed dinner and went to our room. We had been able to watch the progress of the lunar eclipse as we ate our food and we were anxious to get the binoculars out to watch its culmination from the parking lot.  The parking lot was adequately lit for security, but it didn't diminish the light from the full moon as it gradually went a bloody brownish color. The motel itself was the only establishment on the road for at least a mile or so. There was nothing on either side of the hotel or the other side of the highway except desert.  We were leaning against our rental convertible, passing the binoculars back and forth as the moment of full eclipse approached. Only the thinnist sliver of reflected light was left showing as we both appreciated this natural phenomenom above the roof of the adjoining motel rooms.  Suddenly, motion just below the moon caught my eye. I turned my head to the right to follow it and briefly saw the object as it flew off at a disturbing speed. What I saw doesn't sound like anything I've ever heard described before. Likewise, my husbands's description is unique, but only shares a few similarities with what I saw.  We both saw something, because, I turned and looked at him and he said, ""Did you see that?""  My description:  The first view I had was only a glimpse of motion. When I turned my head I saw for just an instant what can only be described as a net of dim stars. It was a loosely structured object with a network of greyish ""lines"" which were actually various series of points. This grid structure was moving in all directions at once in an undulating fashion. It reminded me of watching a fisherman's net being tossed around in the waves, or an amoeba floating around on a speciman slide.  Even though it didn't seem to have a method of propulsion, it was flying too fast for my eyes to follow it as it crossed the highway and headed out into the desert night.  My husband's description:  He only got one glimpse of it as it passed underneath the moon. He saw what he called a gigantic skeletal bird, flapping its wings.  At first, this doesn't sound like it could be the same object I saw. But, it is similar in that large sections of the object were moving, and that there was not much mass to the object, but a lot of empty space in it.  Skeptics answer:  This was obviously a flock of birds flying low over the hotel. Even though I've never seen birds fly so fast that I couldn't keep up with them visually for at least 3 or 4 seconds. And, there was absolutely no sound.  Then it must have been some piece of debris flying in the wind. Even though it was a still and completely cloudless night.  Written: 9/25/00   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Updated: 3/2/2002 I was watching a show on TV last month, called ""You've Got To See It To Believe It,"" and I saw this really weird piece about something people are calling rods. It really freaked me out because it reminded me of the description that Richard gave of this incident. I went online and sluthed out a website about the rods called www.roswellrods.com and showed it to him when he came home. He told me that the rods looked like the object he saw that night in Breckenridge. They really do look real, but I can't convince myself that they actually exist. I'm thinking about setting up a video camera and maybe even a digital camera and doing some skyfishing on my own. ((NUFORC Note:  The date of the reported incident is correct.

On the night of December 28, 2005 I was sitting in the parking lot of Rockford College off East State Street in the College Security Vehicle.  At that time we had light bars, and spot lights on the vehicles as well as a programable police scanner to monitor activity near the college, or the response of emergency equipment when requested.  I had just finished updating my report and saw a low flying object approaching from the west with white flashig lights on the edges and a red flashing light.  At first I thought it might be a lifeline helicopter coming into land at Saint Anthoy Hospital to the east of the campus.  As I watched it approach, I realized it was flying perfectly level, extremely slow and about 100 - 200 feet off the ground.  When it came close enough to identify, I was surprised to see it was a very low profile black triangle shaped ship of some sort.  The ship paused and seemed to hover perfectly still over the campus above me.  I looked at it very closely for several minutes it just hung there without any sound or engine noise.  I notice on the bottom a cylinder type object - if you took the lid off a skippy peanut butter jar, and place it on the bottom of  a black triangle you would have the image I saw plus 3 white lights at the corner of the black triangle.  Every inch of it was pitch black in color.  Being excited, I aimed the spotlight in the direction of the craft and turned it on and my lightbar flashers.  The craft immediately changed from stationary to traveling at an extremely high speed beyond that of the speed of sound into a higher elevation and southern direction before disappearing.  I estimate the length of the craft was about 75 feet across and a perfect triangle shape.  Being an former Air Force Security Police Law Enforcement Specialist/Sgt - I have seen most if not all the current military aircraft.  I also have a relative to an inlaw who works on black projects, and it isn't one of theirs.. that he would let me know of.

So here it is. Around May 1997 it was pretty bright out even though it was about 9:30 pm. I believe there was a full or close to a full moon that night. My best friend, another buddy of ours and I all had a few beers and decided to go for a walk along the lakeside which was really low due to the major drought we had. We parked our truck on the lakeside and started off. We walked about a mile away when I noticed a very bright blue star. I pointed it out to the other guys and we continued on our way. We walked about another half mile and I kept looking at this star when one of the other guys said to me that he needed to sit for a minute. My buddy was 6&#8217;2&#8221; at about 260 lbs at that time. As we sat and chatted I noticed the star had started to move. I then thought to myself that it might be an airplane that was coming right toward us and I didn&#8217;t notice it moving. My friend asked me why I got so quiet and I told him that I was watching this light. He joked and said it was a UFO and we all chuckled a little. We all sat there for a about 1 minute and as eerie as it may sound we all stood up at once and looked at each other. The object was now very close and seemed to be headed in our direction at a great rate of speed. We all stumbled around and started to head back to the truck. Walking fast and checking behind ourselves, I noticed it was now about a foot ball length away.  The object was teardrop shape and almost looked metalic that glowed bright blue at first but looked white as it came closer.  I high tailed it and began to run. This is when things get a little fuzzy in my memory. I remember running, feeling my heart beating really hard. I stepped on a stick and made it crack. I remember hearing a sound about the same high pitch sound it makes when you turn on your television. I don&#8217;t remember hearing my friends anymore or even thinking to turn around. I remember opening my eyes slightly and seeing hardly anything. It was so black and dark wherever I was. I was lying on something flat that was at an angle. I looked down what seemed to be a hallway with an opening about 1 ½&#8217; wide. It was a very tall opening and couldn&#8217;t see the top of it. I noticed an oval shaped hole in what I thought was the floor and could see about 5 sections of finned propellers spinning in reverse direction of each other.  I couldn&#8217;t hear anything except a low hum sound that was steady. I saw a transparent plate of what seemed to be glass with markings on it. The next thing I know I hear my friends yelling and running towards me. I was lying up against my friend&#8217;s truck. They began to ask me where I was. I told them I remembered running toward the truck after seeing the light and then hearing them just know. They didn&#8217;t remember the light and said it was already 12:30 am and that when they got to the truck I wasn&#8217;t there. They thought I ran home and went there to pick me up. After about 2 hours of waiting for me with no return they went back out to the lake to find me. After another hour of looking for me they decided to go back home and that is when they saw me there by the truck. At first I didn&#8217;t remember what I saw until about 2 years later.  I couldn&#8217;t explain why there was a long lapse in time. I tried to talk to my buddy but he said he doesn&#8217;t remember any light. He only remembers me running off and missing until he came back with the truck and them finding me there. I tried to talk to my best friend and he never wanted to talk about it. He always said for me to shut up about it. After 9 years of trying to talk about it with him he finally said he remembers the reason why we ALL started to run. He remembers the light flying by at a great speed and then disappearing but never hearing anything. He said for me being gone for 2 ½ hours boggled him for years and wanted to know where I went. I told him the things I remembered and he said he doesn&#8217;t want to talk about it and will never talk about it again. I tried several times but he gets angry and walks away. I never told my father or anyone what happened.  One day he told me about an encounter he had and I decided to let him know what happened to me.  Since then he told me about this site and keeps asking me if I am going to post my experience. There you go Dad.  It is now posted.  I love you.

The first one was in Hamilton located flying above Wilson Jr. High school on the first day of school in 1997. As far as i can remember is was a silver rounded object hovering above the school for about a few minutes not moving at all, it was about the height that average planes fly but made no sound and many students saw it but never said anything of it. I'm still unsure of what it was. It light as day out and too bright to see any kindof satellite flying that low. The second and third sightings were exactly the same and located about two miles south of downtown Hamlton at around 10PM the first and 2AM the second time. They were two glowing lights, just lights slowly moving in differant directions as I saw riding in my car by the great miami river on the west side of town. I've seen these two lights in the same location twice and I strongly don't believe they are planes because they just hovered around the same area for about 30 minutes each time without any blinking lights. There is an airport there that just has small planes, none of them are capable of doing, or look like these two objects, They where white lights . I am a very openminded person and I would not give you a fake report or anything, as I, like so many want to know the truth about what is happening.

Almost an instant later the reflection or bright light seemed to shrink down to nothing and disappeared.

Here's my UFO witness report from Saturday June 4, 2005.  I tried to power up my digital (still) camera for the really awesome one of the four UFOs I saw that would have shown you something interesting, but was too late to capture it.  BTW, these are the first UFO’s I’ve ever seen.    We were 13 miles South of Mt. Adams looking towards the mountain at 10:15 pm Saturday night until midnight.   Here's a synopsis:  First sighting: a star sized white light UFO was crossing the sky directly above us going from approximately North to South at a fairly fast clip, and was ""snaking"" perhaps 10 degrees back and forth by several nearby stars.  It moved across the sky for about 20 to 30 degrees of arc, and stopped, parked there and dimmed.  With the hundreds of stars visible and the fact that it stopped moving, I soon lost track of the UFO's exact position.  Another witness had a telephoto lens and saw a red light attached to its tail, while it was moving.  I managed to spot this UFO first, as I have excellent long range vision.  Second sighting: a brighter star sized UFO came into view from the East traveling in a Westerly direction.  It traveled for about 10 to 15 degrees of arc across the sky at about a 60 degree angle from the ground.  Then, in a very short space, it took a smooth 30-40 degree arcing turn to the NNW, traveled a short distance, and stopped high above Mt Adams.  No dimming.  Lost site of it among the hundreds of stars that were out (I can only go so long without blinking!). Third (and best) sighting: A medium bright, star sized UFO came in from the WSW, meandered somewhat randomly for 10-15 degrees of arc, heading in an Easterly direction.  It stopped right next to a dimmer star.  Suddenly it ""lit up"".  I don't mean it got a little brighter; it got hundreds of times brighter than it was.  Imagine Mars, when in view, is the brightest object in the sky by 2-3 times the brightest stars in the sky, and multiply that by 50-100 times. The ""lighting up"" lasted for 3-5 seconds, then dimmed to a faint star in size and brightness, and moved off into space, dimming to nothing, within a couple arc degrees, in a snaking trajectory, heading ENE.  When that UFO lit up, the dozen or so people there reacted with awe, cheering and yelling for more.  That UFO was just letting us know it was undeniably there and perhaps saying ""Hi"" -  I was extremely impressed... Absolutely drop dead awesome!!!!!!   Fourth sighting: A star sized UFO traveling from the North and very dim, was moving South when it ""flashed"" like a strobe pulse, maybe 5-10 times brighter than Mars would be, then returned to a very dim object (barely visible). A few seconds later, it flashed again, and dimmed. This scenario repeated 10-15 times while crossing directly overhead, and traveling 30-40 degrees of the sky, changing directions several times, along the way. The flashes were randomly timed, varying from a second to several seconds in between. The UFO then stopped almost directly above us, and parked there for the rest of the night, dim and unmoving. It was SE of the big dipper, then, and was aligned to two stars below it, where I could see and check on it, and it didn't move again.  During the viewing time I saw a shooting star (which I've seen dozens of before), and airplanes, which were obvious by their trajectories, flashing colored lights, straight traverses and speeds. Observed them many times before. The four UFO sightings, above, were nothing of the kind. ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot be certain what the witness observed, but we have an opinion on the third and fourth sightings.  The third is not inconsistent with the flash of an Iridium satellite.

The reports appears to us to be consistent with the direction a witness would have to have been looking, in order to witness the ""flare.""   The fourth sighting is not inconsistent with a tumbling booster in space, but that is only a guess.   PD))",2005-12-16T00:00:00,45.9798,-121.5312

Mr. Dennis Balthaser said that I should report the two triangle sightings I have had this year on this site Mr. Davenport.  I consider him a wise person, and will follow his suggestion. On June 8, 2005, I had just recived a phone call from my son that he had been involved in an accident on a road near a nearby lake.   I was running out the front door and down the sidewalk to my car when I realized there was something coming out of a cloud.  I looked up and saw a huge triangular craft exit a cloud or something reddish brown like a cloud and it was straight up above me.  I was facing somewhat south as I headed to my car in the driveway.   The size and the silence of the craft stopped me in my tracks and for a second  I couldn't do anything but stare.  It came out of the north and was directly paralle to Interstate 540 in Lowell.  This meant it was headed in a southerly direction. The only way I can guess at the altitude is that it was about the altitude of a plane upon descent to the airport about 15 miles west of me.  That, or very shortly after lift-off altitude. There was no sound coming from it at all, and no strobing lights visible.  The shape was well defined triangle.  There were cream or light yellowed colored lights across the back or flat edge of the triangle and they went up towards the front point about three-quarters of the way.  The lights didn't extend all the way into the point.  The width of it across the back edge appeared to be a football field or more perhaps.  I couldn't guess at the length because I was pretty overwhelmed at the size as it went over me.   I watched it long enough for it to go over several houses after mine, but it may have only been a minute or more.   I am not aware of any other witnesses, because I had to quickly go to my son's accident, but used enough time to run towards my front door screaming for my husband.  He ran out the back door of the house but it had already appeared to enter another clouded area.  I have not talked with any of my neighbours except one who did not see anything that night.

The other student, a friend named ((name deleted)), was crouched next to me and was talking to me.

It had rounded edges, made no noise I could hear, and had solid, regularly spaced bands of various colors which slowly passed across it's glowing, illuminated surface. I was stunned, and remember thinking ""What the hell is that?""  After a few minutes it faded from view, and I realized that I had just seen a UFO. At this point I had said nothing, and ((name deleted)) was still jabbering away to me about whatever.  A minute or two later the same object, or a second, identical object, traversed the night sky above me, but in a different direction (I do not recall N/S/E/W details).

Surfside, TX in November 1982, my friend and I were in our early twenties. We just arrived about 12 miles up the beach from the beach entrance to camp at around midnight so we could meet friends in the morning at our favorite spot and avoid morning beach traffic from Houston where we lived at the time.  A flashing light was in the rear view mirror just as we parked. The area behind us was swamp so it couldn't be a land vehicle that was approaching us and it seemed to be blinking at that distance. I scrambled for my camera when it became clear that it was something tumbling toward us but I only had daytime 100 ASA film in my 35mm Nikon.  As I looked up from the van, I saw what was an oblong, still silent craft covered entirely with triangular windows and thin black frames around them as it slowly tumbled with no visable means of propulsion or wings, it never made a sound and always maintained the same distance from the ground. It was about two telephone poles off the ground and stood about two telephone polls in height which was easy to determine since there were telephone poles to compare to.  Roughly football shaped, each window was back lit with a different soft pastel color. As it came over the power lines nearly directly above us it took a sharp 90 degree turn, tumbling only in the direction it was traveling and followed the power lines up the beach northward and disappeared into the distance. It was literally a stones throw from me.  We scrambled out to see what would happen next and nothing further took place. BUT! The next morning when it was about to become noon after our friends arrived, we were to go to 7-11. I joked about the UFO sucking the battery dry when the van wouldn't start. My friend said there was a flashlight with new batteries in the glove box and sure enough the flash light batteries were drained too!  Really creeped us out but it was awesome at the same time.  Over the years I've shared my experience with friends and received awe, and at times skepticism, but it's always been important to me to come forward. One friend who was a UFO buff said that my description only represented about ten percent of all sightings he had read about and that never had anyone been that close to this particular type of craft. Cigar and saucer shapes were far more common.  I still have a sketch of it I made the following day after I returned home. I could say that is was a religious experience for me.",2005-05-11T00:00:00,,

This is among many many sightings I've had as a kid. This is the most memorable.  Coming home from church on a, probably, Sunday night, I was riding in the back of the car with my sister. My mother and father were in front of car. I was about eight years old. I was watching the night sky, looking for more of what I saw alot of, bright lights that would chase each other through the sky and come together again in a huddle.  Now, I did not see these bright lights every night, but on occasion along with the very frequent meteorites, I would see these bright objects. I'd often ask my father what they were. I asked him if jets or helicopters in the military could do that. He'd tell me, no... and that he had no idea what they were.  This night it was a full moon out. I was looking out my window and my sister was gazing out of hers. I was looking at the moon when I noticed a light off to the right of the moon blinking. It was more than one light, in fact it was a few rows of lights that were of varying color. Then, I noticed that I could see the lights reflecting off of a metallic surface. I also noticed the entire shape of the craft was cylindrical. A flat cylinder much like the same proportion of a tin can of cookies. It was hovering over the tree tops. It was, I noticed, above the trees as high as the trees were tall.  The strange part was yet to come. I was excited to finally see one up close! The craft moved to where it was slowly moving along side the car over the tree line. In my point of view it was getting closer to the full moon. When it got just in front of the moon two beams of light lit from it, much like a car's headlights. The craft slowed to a stop. The wierd thing I remember about the lights is that they stopped as if hitting some invisible object. I cold actually see the ends of the light beams. Then, the two beams crossed over forming an elongated ""X"". The craft then slowly moved back the other way and finally out of sight as our car got further and further away.  My sister to this day remembers it. My parents only remember the strange lights we'd see, I don't think they actually saw this event, but they remember me continually talking about it. I know that strange craft fly the skies, folks.  Over the years I've talked with many people who have told me what they've seen. Sightings in Charlottesville... Waynesboro (one I saw on here, I swear that I've talked to a lady about.. the one that talks of the spinning rod and ring over a person's house)  I can't claim that ""aliens"" as we think of them, exist. I think it's very possible, but what I do know for sure is that there are things in the skies that are not usually seen during the day that fly. Crafts of some sort, no doubt, that someone does not want us knowing too much about. Hey, keep up the information, the research, too many people know all of these things are true. Never stop your pursuit of the truth.  I often wonder why there are alot more science fiction movies and shows coming out in the past 10 years? Anyone else taking notice  it?",2005-05-11T00:00:00,37.375834640522875,-77.6171705882353

I was thirteen I believe, so it must have been around spring 1984.  I had been in bed. I woke up to alot of commotion, voices. I could hear my mother and brother speaking very animatedly. I walked out to our kitchen, and they were standing out on the porch. I looked out of the porch door, which faces west. I saw a family we were friendly with (they lived one town north of us) standing on the porch with my mom and brother, they were all talking to each other in an excited manner.  I was surprised to see this family on our porch so late at night. They were all looking up into the sky. I walked out of the door and noticed as I was looking west, towards Route 32, that there were cars all stopped along the road, including police cars, ambulances and firetrucks. Everyone was outside of their cars and looking up in the sky.  As I stepped onto the porch and turned to look southward, towards the Rondout Creek, I saw a large object in the sky above us. It is difficult for me to remember now, as this happened 21 years ago, but I recall lights, and black space between the lights, and an edge that wasn't distinct. I thought ""That's got way more lights than a plane."" The lights were colorful and ""pulse-ey"" ( not entirely pulsating, but with a pulsating quality )   Also, The size of it was enormous.  It didn't make any noise, and it moved excrutiatingly slowly until it seemed to hover over the intersection of the Rondout Creek and Route 32. I could hear the family of friends that were with us telling my mom and brother that they had followed it, but I don't know from what direction they had followed it.  The object began to move slowly northwards. Many people, including police and emergency personnel, jumped into their cars to follow it. My mom was eager for me to return to bed. The next day was a school day. That part always strikes me funny, because although I was very agitated about what I had seen, I didn't have any trouble going to sleep. The next day, at school I remember talking about it in class a few times, asking if other kids had seen or heard about it. Some had.  I know that the next day The Kingston Daily Freeman reported a story about the sightings, because apparently they had started quite a bit south of us and continued up to the north, and alot of people were involved. Lots of policemen had made reports, along with other reputable citizens.  However, the day after that The Kingston Daily Freeman reported that they had been told by military officials down in Newburgh that it had only been helicopters flying in formation. I remember thinking that that many helicopters would have made a huge amount of noise and wind. Everyone who was on my porch remarked about how quiet it was at the time we were watching it.  A few years ago, we were at a gathering with the same family of friends who had stood out on our porch watching with us that evening. I said "" Hey, do you guys remember the UFO that everyone saw that time?"" They nodded, but no one remarked further and my mom seemed embarassed by my candor, so I didn't push the issue. Sometimes I wonder if it was a dream, but I know that the newspaper wrote about it twice after the fact, so I couldn't have just dreamt it.

The thing I remember most about this event was that - for something so stupefyingly amazing - I don't remember a lot about this event, and none of us talked much about it afterward.  This happened when I was in high school and I don't know the exact year, but it would have been approx 1982 or 1983.  Four of my friends and I were in the desert north of Phoenix in a very rural area where it was pitch dark except for the stars and the light of our fire.  We had been there long enough to build a camp fire and at the time the sighting occurred we had not consumed more than one beer each.  At some point we all noticed something looming in the distance, coming very, very slowly towards us.  The only way I can describe its size is monstrous.  It was way bigger than a house, or even a couple of houses.  It was virtually silent for its size - I do remember a sort of low humming sound.  There were definitely lights on it, but I don't remember how many; I seem to recall that it had lots of little lights on it.  We couldn't see into it; I don't remember seeing ""windows"" in the craft.  It was definitely round in shape, but it is possible that part of it was ""cut out"" - I don't remember.  It moved directly over top of our group at an extremely slow rate of speed.  I remember feeling a sense of awe, stunned and amazed, but very calm.  We all were.  No one was hopping up and down and going crazy with excitement, like one might think you would in such a weird circumstance.  We just watched it go over.  I ""think"" I remember seeing it disappear behind a mountain.  The next day, I remember the radio station KUPD had a few people call in and they were talking about a UFO sighting in the same area (approx 7th Street and Union Hills Drive).  But the weirdest thing is, none of my friends who were there, none of us talked about it much.  It might as well have been like we'd seen a kite flying.  No big deal.  About 10 years ago I had the chance to talk to one of my friends who was there, who ended up marrying the boyfriend she was with and who was there that night.  I asked her if she remembered it and she said she did.  I asked her to ask her husband if he remembered it, and she did that while we were on the phone, and he said he did.  But again, it was like ""no big deal.""   I know what I saw, and I know we all saw the same thing.  I wouldn't expect anyone to believe it unless they'd seen it for theirself.  I've always thought that maybe whatever was inside of it had a way to make our reaction to it numbed or dulled, because aside from seeing it, the most fascinating part of the experience for me has been that we didn't alert the media or that every time we got together that wasn't all that we could talk about.  I fact, we never talked about it except that one time I mentioned above when I asked my friend and her husband if I remembered it correctly - that was probably 8 years after the fact.  I've always kind of wondered if we lost time and just didn't realize it, but I simply don't know.  That's all I know.  I wish I could remember more details.  I've never seen anything like it since, and I had never seen anything like it before, but I wouldn't mind seeing it again!  I don't remember if the thing left a trail.  I don't remember there being an aura or haze around it - it seemed crystal clear.  It was dark brown or black, hard to tell.  It was matte, not shiny.  I can't remember if the lights on it were blinking at all and I can't remember if there were colored lights, just remember white lights.  Our vehicles were turned off, so I don't know if there were electrical or magnetic effects.  I just watched the Peter Jennings special and that is what inspired me to come to this web site, to see if maybe someone else had seen it and reported it here.  Like I said, I've never talked about it to anyone other than the people who were there, for fear of being sent directly to the nuthouse. :) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

We were staying at a motel in a small town somewhere in southwestern Utah. As we were walking down walked we noticed something on the ground flopping around like a fish.  When we got closer we noticed it was a bat fighting a bug.  As the bat flew away our eyes followed it toward the sky.  Upon looking up we observed about eight lights in the sky. They traveled from left to right.  Each was a different color and they were flying in a v formation.  One side of the formation was one light longer than the other side. I believe the right side was longer than the left. As they crossed the sky, they left a small vapor like trail behind them. They were far away it seemed and moved in the same direction across the sky for the duration of the sighting. They made no sound but again they were also far away. When all of a sudden they seemed to head in a more upward direction. Then in a split second they were gone and now left a longer trail behind.  Each trail was they same color as each light that left it. They seemed to go up at an angle and did not cross the sky. The trails slowly dissipated and nothing more was seen of the objects.  I have never heard of another sighting like ours. I have told the story to a few close friends only, due to the fact people look at you like your crazy. I have no oppinion of what is was.

My father was on the back porch (a raised deck, perhaps 8-10 feet off the ground) listening to a baseball game; I remember that I was in the living room watching TV with my grandma. At about 8:30 PM or so (it was getting dark) I heard dad call me from the back. He said ""Come here for a minute."" I got up, annoyed (as only a teenager interrupted from the TV can be), and went the the back of the house. I stood at the screen door and asked what he wanted. I was told to come out of the door. As I came around the door and closed it behind me, my dad inclined his head and pointed toward the western horizon. ""What is that?"" he asked me. I turned to look, and what I saw were, as I recall, 5 small white lights closely clustered together, slowly moving west-east, toward us. One of the lights was blinking. ""I've been watching that for about 5 minutes,"" he said. ""I watched it come over the trees. Is that a plane or helicopter?"" I said that no, it sure didn't look like either a plane or a helicopter. The lights were too close together, for one, and planes (and helicopters) usually have multicolored blinking lights; blue, red, white, etc. Besides, a plane flew past it (of course, it could have been miles away, but from our perspective, it passed close to the object), and we were able to compare the two. It was no plane. We watched it for perhaps another 5 minutes or so, until it was nearly overhead, and as it disappeared behind the village's water tower that was two lots over from our house. We waited for it to come out from behind the water tower, which would have put it almost directly over our house at perhaps 1 o'clock. It never did. We looked north, south, east and west, and saw no sign of it having come out from behind the tower. Not very exciting, but that's my UFO story.

During the latter half of the 70's roughly the summer of 78's several of us saw an object dart from place to place at incredible speed only to jart off in another direction at impossible angles of trajectory.  We summoned our parents who also witnessed this event only to get the shoulder shrug, oh well.  Part 2. 1984, 5.5 miles north of home. A friend was having problems with his soon to be wife. We took a drive so as he could discuss his problems. Upon driving for no apparent reason I sugested we pull over and talk about his problems. Within 6 or 7 minutes everything changed from ""personal problems"" to what is passing in front of us. The object was and is not of this earth.The night was peacefull, a gently breaze if best. A field of crickets chirped as in a wave like sound ( if one has been in th country they know the sound) the object moved with exacting precision.At this point I said tho my buddy, Lets get out and stand on the car. I told him immediatly it was a u.f.o. No sound.  At the point the object entered our plane of view, the crickets stopped. no sound, a pin drop dead silence.The object passed by approximately 300 ft. away, following the contour of the ground, up a small hill and over the top and down the other side, out of sight.  At this point I told my friend that it was going to a large 15 acre pond/lake. This pond/ lake  is very deep. left over glacial sink hole approximatley 100 -125ft deep. I know this because I hunted the land years earlier. It is private land.I also knew whatever it was knew we were there. I told my friend ""lets wait a minute because it will be back"" Less than 2 minutes had bassed and The object returned up over the hill, only with an intensely bright ambure essence light, scanning the ground back and forth as if searching. Note: the craft is only feet over any brush or tree at any given time, following the conture with precision. At this point the objet was directly in fron of us, slowly comming closer.I felt a sensation only experienced when I had dental x-rays bluured vision. I asked my frfiend if he had felt anything wierd and he had.  We opted to leave immediately. jumped in the car and left. CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT ! I could not leave the scene entirely so we apt to view from a distance. A half mile north was a paralell road to view with caution. Apon driving there another object with the same intense light came almost straight down into the same area. With this we left. apon arriving home my ever trusty cat freaked out. my brother and his friend asked what was wrong with us because we didn't look right. I explained the event without fanfare. The cat would not come near me for 2 days. Never before or since has this occured, animals are sensitive plain and simple. LIFE GOES ON : several years pass. 4 to be exact. August 1988. Apon driving home, again I see what I know is not a star, planet etc... Same vacinity as child hood,as well as the very close expeience. Nervous I drive north again 5.5 miles. As I approach the same spot, it becomes apparent that the object is large, stationary and when I stopped and turned off the car, dead silent.After observation for approx. 5 minutes taking all vantage points, marking distance at about 1100 ft. and general observation. the object began to move. I got in my car and idled at a pace of 5 mph. for a quarter mile, watching in awe. The object increased speed, I followed up till120 mph. at this point the object shot like a cannonto approx 15 miles in two seconds, no more.Again awe.More years go by. I see an old friend that lived within a quarter mile of these occurances. I casually ask if he had ever seen anything of the sort. Yes , many times, unexplainable , remarkable movement that nothing of this earth can produce. I FEEL STRONGLY THAT THIS EVENT COULD BE CAPTURED IF SOMEONE HAD THE TIME TO OBSERVE AREA FOR ROUGHLY 2 WEEKS ANY GIVEN AUGUST.. FOR THAT IS WHEN I FEEL IT MAKES A REGULAR APPEARENCE. If I had equipmentIE:proper video, camera electronic sensors etc. and a little more time I know there would be no argument as to the validity of other life. This is no joke and I wish some day to have time and resorces to accomplish and prove with hard evidence the reality of life elsewhere. Sorry for the lengthy explination. there are more examples which may take a little more time to devulge into. Sincerely, Joseph Deutsch",2005-05-11T00:00:00,43.3208,-88.0314

I got into a conversation with her about the tilt of the earth, and how it causes the seasons, and explained to her why we see different stars at different times of the year, depending on which side of the Sun we are on, and since our night-time has us looking a different direction.  Just about the time I finished explaining this to her I noticed a VERY bright light in the north sky, directly under the North Star, about 1/5 the way up from the horizon to the North Star, not too far above the trees.  I said, ""What the hell is that?"".  My mother turned and observed it also.  It appeared redish, just like Mars now appears in the Eastern sky, only much brighter, and was as bright as a landing light, but totally stationary.

We rolled our windows down wondering, if it was a helicopter dropping for fire fighting water. No Noise.

Soon (within 10 seconds) a ""round light"" appeared to just ""pop"" over the same horizon and droop down and ""hold"" still for several seconds. It then darted straight up to the ""heavens.""   In Mere seconds it appeared to be among the stars and changed from a white light to a blue ""cast"" light.  We watched it, until seeming to disappear, for many seconds.

September 12 of 1992 (a Monday, Tues. or Wednes.) I was at home alone finishing dinner when I heard my pack of dogs start up a chorus that means something's up that needs checking into. I walked out to the edge of my deck and looking east(and a sliver south) could see 3 small white lights in an equilateral triad configuration(somewhat obliquely presented) hovering a few degrees above the ridge of a hilltop but to my crude estimate maybe a mile or two beyond it. I said to myself ""I know what that is--they're back"", instinctively recalling my sightings of August 29,1991(see NUFORC database). I watched this triad for about 8 seconds when it's three lights broke formation and seemed to swarm around each other like bees in approx same amount of sky. After maybe 6 seconds they reformed to original triad. Another 8 or so seconds they buzzed like bees again. And then again returned to rigid triad config. Seconds later one of these tiny lights shot forward toward my direction and in 2 seconds manifested itself as a glowing sphere of fluorescent white light I guaged to be 5 to 7"" in diameter positioned maybe 3 to 5 feet above the top of eastern hilltop ridge(about 1500' from me) and immediately began descending said hill along a sandstone outcropping, all the while nicely illuminating the scrub oak and manzanita about 4 feet below it. I was so startled I turned around to fetch my rifle thinking some one was running down the hill with a light(tho' there are no trails and it was way above the bush). I caught myself in two steps and quickly faced back to keep observing. The orb descended at about 8 to 10 mph following sandstone outcrop at an angle and then abruptly cut level to the right for 20 or 30 feet then followed another similiarly dipping sandstone outcrop for about 40 feet---lighting up tops of the scrub-brush for 25' in all directions. Suddenly a smaller globe of white light came on about 2 or 3 feet below it, this one maybe 2 or 3"" in diameter with similiar intensity. They continued on in tandem for another 10 feet, made an abrupt leveling to right for 30feet or so and then began ascending the hill. After rising 5 feet the small orb seemed to swing as if on a pendulum maybe two swings and then blinked off. The large orb continued it's ascent to the top of the hill and then shot eastward back to rejoin original triad. From beginning to end of this ""probe"" action might have been 40 to 60 seconds. Once rejoined in the distance I watched for some 10 to 15 minutes the same bee-like/re-triad sequence. At this point I hauled my 4.5 "" Celestron refractor to a good spot to observe but two small white lights,one larger than the other, with the smaller one moving back and forth a couple degrees in 8 to 10 second cycles, towards and away from larger light, almost or maybe touching it on ""inward"" part of cycle. This action continued for 20 minutes or so followed by a breif re-showing of third light and then back to the two. I got bored and came in for coffee. Went back out and sure enough it was still there. I continued watching and the two lights now seemed to rise at same rate as nearby stars. I tracked this for another half -hour as the two rose several moon widths--went inside for a few minutes--came out and it was gone. Soon after, I went to bed, shaking my head, trying to sleep and wondering just what in hell I had seen. It then seemed to be a bit scary. Next morning told mother and sister of it and how it looked like triad craft I'd seen a year before. It was then I realized I hadn't told even them of that earlier sighting---which is what really spooks me! My sister thinks I well could've been abducted on first round--I have no recollection of such--but still to this day cannot explain not telling even family, til this second sighting. I conveniently procrastinated taking hike up to sandstone ridge to look for anomalies and such for atleast 4 years afterwards--and found nothing unusual ofcourse when I finally did. As said in other report, I would've reported this sooner but just found this great website. Already have seen similiar accounts of probe-like orbs. Must say I'm a true believer that ""they"" are here --seeing makes quick believing--and what I saw,-- I don't think humans have even back-engineered yet.

Until I had the conversations noted below, I had supposed that UFOs were certainly the figment of overactive but in some cases quite honest imaginations.  I'm still not totally convinced of the reality of UFOs, but I am not now as sure of my original assumption because I have good reason to believe these two women told the truth. The entire text of my notes (with names deleted as you requested)is submitted for whatever benefit it might be to your pursuits. The two individuals below that I interviewed had no objection to this information being made public.  They are both now living at the exact spot where the sighting occurred. INTERVIEWS  During a conversation in early February 1993, a neighbor of my mother mentioned that she and her daughter had seen two flying saucers.  At that time, she seemed so unperturbed about the sighting that I more or less dismissed it as a subject of light and probably negligible conversation.  When she later mentioned it again I became more interested and asked if she would mind going into the sighting in more detail and if I could take notes on the answers she might give to my questions.  She readily agreed and said that her daughter would no doubt be glad to do the same.  Below are interview notes I made on April 25, 1993 with the mother, followed by interview notes with her daughter. 1.  The mother came out of her house with her daughter, looked up and saw the 2 spacecraft.	 	2.	She called the daughter's attention to them saying excitedly ""What are those things?"" 	3.	Daughter answered, ""Mommy, what are those things?"" 	4.	Two UFO's, each looking like two saucers with their outer rims fitted together, flying—floating just over the house, one in front of the other, down the slight valley and up the opposite valley to the top of the ridge. 	5.	Lights on the edge of he craft, clear lights, blinking off and on. 	6.	No noise, no smoke, no markings on the craft. 	7.	No seams, no doors, no windows—no apertures visible on the craft. 	8.	Could not have been a zeppelin or (weather) balloons or helicopter she was sure of that.  She knew very well what each of these craft would have looked like. 	9.	The two women (husband/father had gone to bed early) had probably, she recalls, been watching TV. 	10.	Not sure of the date or even the month, but weather was cold. 	11.	No wind, no dogs barking and no background noises. 	12.	Craft seemed to ignore them, oblivious to their presence. 	13.	Did not speed up; did not turn off (until later), took no evasive action. 	14.	They climbed the mountain at constant height, did not bob or weave or speed up or slow down. 	15.	Stars were shining. 	16.	Turned sharply left, still one behind the other, and finally disappeared behind the trees on top of the ridge. 		    Copy of my notes made during the interview with the daughter at my temporary home in Virginia 4 27 93.  	1.	Cold weather—looked like two plates or saucers put together—this happened two or three years ago. 	2.	No (outside/yard) security light; no porch light was on; TV might have been on; no noises; no dogs (barking). 	3.	Went through gate—stars—cold—looked up—saw them before her mother did. 	4.	Over the house—twice as high as house—maintained altitude. 	5.	(Moving at) 5 miles per hour—fast walk (speed) 	6.	Dark gray—dull gray—not shining 	7.	Lights one color—didn't flash—orange and red (orange red). 	8.	In a row (one behind the other)—big things—6 feet tall man could easily stand up in one. 	9.	Man could stand up in its center (highest part). 	10.	Lights—just lights—no ""headlights"" effect. 	11.	Wasn't spinning. 	12.	Can't recall (detailed distinction between) bottom/top (of craft). 	13.	Heard no noise at all (from craft). 	14. 	Wasn't a blimp; she fully knew what a blimp looks like. 	15.	Has ridden in a balloon—this was no balloon. 	16.	One solid light was on the edge.  Edge appeared to be lit up all round but more intense at some points—(my interpretation of what she said). 	17.	Thirty seconds to the top of the ridge. 	18.	Turned and staying in row (one behind the other as they turned left—see below). 	19.	Could see just the shape of the lights (lighted configuration) at top of the ridge. 	20. 	Had seen TV and read about UFOs of this same shape. 	21.	Bottom and top (of craft) same—looked the same. 	22.	Smooth; dull gray in color. 	23.	Dogs didn't bark. 	24.	Went over the other side of mountain after left turn. 	25.	Surface reflected lights. 	26.	Thought they (craft) were manned—assumed they were manned but did not feel she was actually being observed. 	27.	After 90 degree turn at top of ridge (mountain) they stayed in row and gradually disappeared on the other side as they followed the road out to the left.  	At my request,  (who has had some basic art training) drew a craft which resembles a smooth bottom, inverted bowl with the bottom of the craft convex but much more shallow than the top.      	  Additional notes I made after initial discussions with Gladys Wells 	a.	Different colored lights blinked around the edges   (changed this to say some clear lights"" in interview of 4-26-93). 	b. 	Each craft looked like two bowls or two dinner plates placed together. 	c.	Top rounded, slick. 	d.	Floated; floating (words used several times). 	e.	Noise (no motor, no exhaust, no sounds of any kind) 	f.	Over the house; up the hollow/valley, turned left at top of ridge, following road out the ridge, (300 feet altitude?) and disappeared behind the tree line.  No seams, no doors, no windows noted in the craft.  UFO INFO All thoughts below are premised primarily upon the accuracy of one sighting—by a neighbor and her daughter—, who, I believe, told the truth; who saw essentially what they think they saw, as detailed in the interview information given me in April l993. My Own Scattered Thoughts Written Not Long After The Above Interviews Were Made  The various sightings of UFOs have never been really photographed; that is to say: They have never been irrefutably photographed in a journalistic sense.  Reportedly, UFOs of one description or another have been followed by pursuit planes and in such cases got away fast.  These ships have to be very valuable (vulnerable, however, to damage) or very secretive (shy).  Why?  Is this to protect themselves, their civilization or is it to protect us from a knowledge that we cannot handle?  Which suggests that they are either manned (which seems unlikely) or mechanically manned, or, more likely, guided (monitored) from central points or from light years away.  The speed, the quiet energy, the flawless navigation, (possibly) unlimited source of power or ability to cross dimensions or cross/change time zones at will.  All this suggests an intelligence capable of controlling earth, supervising it, intervening in any or all events, studying it as an earth scientist would study a ""primitive"" garden or exotic laboratory culture; earth being merely a thing of abiding curiosity.  Where do ""they"" come from?  They would ""come"" from a time and speed derivation that we, at this point, are not capable of comprehending, or perhaps of accepting.  Which means that human, conventional thinking and reasoning have not been able to even scratch the surface.  If they are that intelligent, that powerful, and if they care about our world, what form does their ""intervention"" take?  Why don't they help us solve our problems?  Because this would render us dependent on them and our evolution would cease.  Our efforts would cease; our life would be meaningless?  This recalls the aborigines of Australia and natives of New Guinea whose cultures/lives were ruined by exposure to modern civilization.  Are we talking about a supreme being(s) here?  Which brings us back to the same point—life, thought painful, hard and often apparently futile—there has to be a ""purpose"" by a ""higher definition"" that to this point at least, has for the most part (except theologically or emotionally) escaped us.  How do we—can we—should we try—to get in touch with them?  If they are as superior as it appears, they will get in touch with us only when and if they are ready—which may be never.  RIDDLE:  If these craft (UFOs) have been here or have visited earth for thousands of years, one must wonder if they have ceased to evolve, to make progress.  —Or, another possibility—that these craft come from so far in deep space that this is a one-time space probe and these craft were programmed to stay here, study earth and possibly other planets and send back their information over a period of thousands or millions of years.  In other words, they may be marooned relics of a long since disappeared and obsolete civilization and are now captives of their own programmed mission with nowhere to go—doomed to ""probe"" forever with no one at home to listen.  There is no way to ""communicate"" with these ships in a humanly traditional or personal way if the above hypothesis is reasonably accurate.  However, if they are programmed for contact (such as by maneuvering with lights or responding to signals of various kinds) or making some response to certain stimuli, then some kind of communication seems possible but perhaps very limited.  —Perhaps not more than a friendly, patronizing response—much like a human could communicate with a dolphin in the wild.  Another possibility is that these ships were sent here years ago under a space exploration program that has (1) performed its mission (2) the civilization that launched it no longer exists or because of evolutionary process no longer cares (3) has lost control or contact with these ships (4) that these probes will continue indefinitely—much like our ""primitive"" probes that were sent into outer space to wander for eternity among the stars and through the great expanse.  But, if this (no. 4) is true, the technology that powers and programs these craft is so advanced that we are millions of years behind the creators of such machines.  All this brings up a point of logic.  It is difficult to avoid edging over into theology here.  Is it possible that these space machines are not only space ""probes"" from another, far-advanced, civilization millions of light years away (as we measure it—with our limitations) but are, in fact, machines that constantly monitor the meteorological, cosmological and seismological status of earth as well as all other human/non-human factors that influence life on earth?  In other words, are we a ""laboratory"" or simply an intriguing but relatively primitive place in the universe that some ""force"" some super intelligence, for some reason perhaps unfathomable by our primitive logic sees fit to perpetuate?  The difficulty in knowing or even approaching the answer to this is that our logic as compared with the logic of our benefactors (or tormentors as the case may be) would have to be so inferior that we cannot begin to even form a workable hypothesis—or can we?  Is it possible that we are one of these: (a) a place where we are sent (recycled) to ""learn"" something that would help us in a higher civilization somewhere else?  (2) A place where we are sent as a form of punishment (boot camp or even ""purgatory"") or rehabilitation as having been unfit for where we were before?  (3) Are we, in fact, as far as our feeble logic can grasp it, in some kind of hell?  —For what purpose?  (The question that immediately arises here is how can we superimpose our definition of purpose upon an infinitely higher intelligence—after all, it was man within the past several hundred thousand years who invented the concept and word ""purpose"").  If these UFOs do exist in the form and behavior that I'm beginning to believe they might, then the apparent, often presumed, meaninglessness of life on earth comes into question.  The theological explanation for the purpose of life would, in a sense, be verified though the details or description, at least of one level or dimension of authority or power, of the structure would be only vaguely correct.  The prime question here is: Can we reasonably expect that the intelligence behind these ""machines"" will ever make themselves comprehensively manifest to us.  (Or, like God—the infinite—would it be literally impossible by definition?)  How far will we have to advance for this to happen?  What would it do to the human world if it did happen?  Would life, as we know it, become even more meaningless?  Would we become dependent (economically and emotionally) and thus so disillusioned that we would cease to be a ""civilization""? –Or would the communication with this intelligence simply confirm the existence of God—the infinite?  Then, where would faith go? —And what would that do to us?  In other words, if we literally know that an ""infinite"" force exists and interacts with humanity, how would that knowing affect us?  Are we ready for it?  That is the question that this superior intelligence—if it is as benevolent or caring or at least not destructively hostile—as it certainly appears not to be—can apparently already answer and will not let itself be ""known"" until the right time comes—if ever!  These craft seem to have definite form and substance—to be of metallic (or other durable) derivative, and the strobe lights, that are apparently of different colors and blink in some methodical or rhythmic order, appear to be for some purpose other than illumination. (a)	They have not been observed through another object—for example ""like a ghost"" passing through trees, mountains, buildings, etc. 	(b)	They seem to ""escape"" hurriedly only when close contact is made or pursuit is attempted. 	Another possible facet: Is it possible that the appearance, behavior, existence of these craft do not depend upon the nature of these beings or upon their advanced technology, but in fact, derives from the very nature of the universe—time as related to space—of which concept we are so primeval in understanding?  Could it be, therefore, that what we are seeing is not the flying machines from some distant planet, but is a fleeting manifestation of a 'spiritual' (for lack of a better term) realm about which we have no comprehension—much like a dung beetle who happens to be at the edge of an airport runway?  The beetle feels the vibration of the airplane’s engines, glimpses the craft in motion but hasn't the slightest thought, nor could he ever have, as to what kind of people made the craft or for what purpose it is flown.  In fact, such concepts are beyond the beetle’s comprehension.  It is anathema to the ego, but I rather think that as related to the intelligence of UFOs as we begin to imagine them to be, we human beings are still at the dung beetle stage. 	This is not as far-fetched as it may sound.  Imagine that there are populated planets by the millions or billions, and that some or all of them are millennia older than our planet and the conditions of their environments were such as to promote intelligence at several times the speed of ours.  No mathematical formula is necessary to conclude that such civilizations would long ago have learned to travel, or to send spacecraft, at the speed of light or perhaps even several million times faster.  Their kind of 'travel' might be so advanced that distance has long since been conquered, and that ""time"" is only a force to be taken advantage of, not to be handicapped by. 	But all the theories, all the possibilities, and all the fantasies mean little more than interesting exercises, until we can break into this new frontier with our brains.  The problem obviously is: As we now perceive the universe, it seems to be a stacked deck.  You can advance only in a ""straight line"" and can go no faster or no farther than the human mind can deal with.  For example, had a cave man family of five suddenly stepped through a curtain onto the deck of a modern aircraft carrier, the effect for that family would no doubt be quite dramatic, if not mentally unmanageable. 	It seems just as logical to begin with ""what these UFOs are not, as with what they actually are.  They are not: (1) Manned [[in the sense that little green men are inside]].  (2) Hostile, certainly in the short term.  If it were otherwise, we would have long since been made toast.  (3) Not intrusive.  This would have already become manifest in their behavior.  (3) Particularly concerned about what we think of them.  –If so, they could certainly avoid detection altogether. 	In fact, it seems that they are aloof, or perhaps more accurately, totally detached, as if the brains behind their being here, are either no longer in existence or are so much in advance of us that our existence is no more than dolphins to a cruise liner.  The one possible (and chilling) exception to this might be that these craft have a far more sinister mission.  –That they are fully equipped to manipulate the earth's inhabitants through mind control, much like experimental animals in a laboratory.  –Which brings up another intriguing dimension to this subject.  Is it not possible that these craft were responsible for the experimental seeding of earth with a hybrid, some sort of a cross between themselves and earth animals such as the ape several millennia in the past?  Could they not now be monitoring our progress and therefore have a personal interest in whether or not we are capable of advancing on the ladder of successful evolution?  Could their mission be simply a matter of scientific curiosity, a kind of space gardening project, a seeding of the various, infinite number of planets in all the solar systems with varieties of species for purposes so far above our intelligence that we could never begin to comprehend? 	I am inclined to believe that there have been no human contacts whatsoever; that there have been no encounters of the third kind, and that with the exception of simple chance sightings, all the rest of the UFO stories are pure baloney. 	All this brings us back to where we began: An intelligence capable of traveling through time or sending space ships through time, or through space at the speed of light or even infinitely faster, would not, it seems to me, have the slightest interest in our terribly primitive existence.  The one possible exception might be that we do show some promise of progressing technologically to a point where we would eventually have to be made a part of that vast network of intelligence.  –Or we would become a sufficient nuisance in space travel or space communications that we would have to be severely dealt with. 	Or could it be that there is some benevolent power behind these visitations to earth—that our planet or solar system is monitored, and cared for as an exotic but isolated garden, a thing of curiosity that is protected like we would protect endangered species?

I was a State Trooper working the night shift and was patrolling US83 south of Canadian, TX.   It was around 10:30PM local time.   I always had a citizens band radio on and had been listening to two truck drivers enjoying a conversation.  It was an unusually warm evening for a winter night and I was wearing short sleeves and had the car window cracked a bit as I slowly patrolled northbound.   As this is the Texas panhandle area, the land is fairly flat, but with some rolling hills every so often.  I could see the two trucks ahead of me and all three of us were driving north.  The two trucks were approximately 1 - 1.5 miles ahead of me.  As we neared the Washita Creek bridge on US83, the road dipped down into a little valley.   I lost sight of the trucks as they dipped lower than me.  One of the drivers was talking away when he suddenly stopped and said ""What the hell is that""?   I heard the second driver say ""What are you...oh hell!"".   The radio was silent for a few seconds and then I heard the second trucker say ""I nearly ran into you when you stopped.  Are you pulling over?""  To which the other trucker said ""Hell yes...I want to see it"".   By this time I was starting down the incline toward the creek and I could see one truck stopped and on the side of the road and the other pulling past it to park in front of it.  I still didn't know what they were talking about but started slowing down.   I crossed the bridge and at that point I saw the driver of the truck just in front of me standing in the middle of US83.  He was looking west and upward.  This was the first time that I realized a very bright light was shining onto the ground from what appeared to be a very large dark object which seemed to be about 1,000 feet in the air and maybe a mile and a half away.   I remember thinking this because I'd been down the dirt road that runs from this location west and was fairly familiar with the topography here...and I could make out it was over another hill.  I was afraid I'd be run over from behind so I started to park my patrol car on the shoulder beside the first truck.  I could see the second driver running to the first one and pointing at the object.  At this point, a small passenger car topped the hill just north of us and started slowing down...probably from seeing the two trucks and my car parked there.  But as the car passed by I saw the brake lights come on and the car slightly screeched to a stop right in the middle of the south-bound lane.   There was a female driver and she stepped out of her car, right foot still inside but standing outside the car, and was looking at the object.  I asked her to quickly move out of the road.  She turned to me and said ""What is that?""  I told her I didn't know, but to please move.  She did so quickly and then came back to us.   Now there were the two truckers, the lady and myself standing on the shoulder of the southbound lane.  I couldn't hear a sound from the craft but could see a immensely bright beam of light shining straight down.  The light didn't sway back and forth like a search light or anything...it just shone straight down.  Suddenly I was aware of the fact that the object appeared to be moving toward us very slowly.  This was because I realized the sheer dimensions of the craft.   It was a moonless night..or as best as I can remember it was moonless.  Thousands of stars in a totally black sky made it very easy to see that the object was indeed moving toward us.  It was triangular in shape.  That was obvious almost from the start.  The point was forward as if you'd imagine a triangle being mobile and one of the points being the front of the object.  (I hope that makes sense)   There was absolutely no sound coming from the craft. Not even a whisper.   I realized no one was talking...I think we were completely confounded by what we were seeing.  After around five minutes, the object had gotten to a point that I felt it was within a mile of us.  I still had the strong sensation that it was higher above us than it appeared.  That's when the bright light simply shut off and it was easier to see the outline of the craft.  The mere size of the craft was incredible.  If my references are even near what I think they are, I'd estimate the size of the craft to be at least 1000' per side.  It was massive.  The reason I use this word is two fold.  One is from the dimensions of it.  But the other is this.  As the craft neared being almost directly over us, I remember feeling weight....felt something heavy on me.  It also seemed as if there was a haze around the object...just barely off of the surface that seemed to make the stars near the edge flicker before they were occulted by the object itself.   I also remember realizing I was holding my breath.   And although we couldn't hear anything, one of the truckers said,  ""Do y'all feel that?""  It felt as though everything, the road, the air, us...everything seemed to be vibrating.   Up to this point, I don't think what I felt was fear....just amazement.  But when the craft was directly over us, something happened.  I was staring straight up at it, and I remember at this point that the women started sobbing and ran away to her car.  She left before I ever said another word to her.   The object was black. Much blacker than the sky.  This may have been an illusion from all the stars in the background, but it was darker to me.  But as I looked up, I suddenly saw a circle appear...just forward of what would be the center of the object.  This circle didn't light up. It became darker...as if there was absolutely no light shining from it or reflected from it.  Without a doubt it was darker than the rest of the craft.   The craft literally stopped directly above us.   One of the drivers asked me if I should call for help.  I told him I didn't know what I'd say.  The thought did cross my mind, but I was thinking they'd be thinking I was crazy back at the Sheriff's Office.   The craft then started pivoting above us...with the point moving clockwise in relation to me until it was pointed in a generally north-west direction. Then it began moving again.  I remember hearing one of the truckers talking, but my ears felt as if they were going to pop.   Again, there wasn't a sound from it...but a tremendous feeling of weight or pressure...sort of like when you dive deeply into the water.  That kind of feeling.   As the craft moved off slowly, one of the drivers said something about driving to the top of the next hill to see it more clearly.  He started to turn away and at that moment the craft sped up noticeably, then shot off to the northwest in a matter of 3-4 seconds.   The drivers asked me what we should do and I told them I didn't know.  I don't know what we saw, what we experienced.  One of the drivers, the one that said he wanted to see it from the hilltop, ran to his truck and drove north.  I ran to my patrol car and got in, passed him on the way north and pulled over at the top of the rise.   We all got out again but couldn't see anything.  I remember my ears were ringing like mad.  Looking back, I think this was side effects of an adrenaline rush.  I've been in shootings, high-speed pursuits and numerous other tension-filled moments and I always have that reaction.   After some time, we all got in our vehicles and left.  I went straight home.  I undressed and took a shower.  I still could see the object in my mind...and am absolutely convinced about the darker circle inside the craft.  I  then sat down at my desk in the study and sketched out the craft on a piece of paper.  I then went into my bedroom where my wife was asleep.   As I lay down, she rolled over to kiss me goodnight but stopped and asked ""Have you been fighting a grass fire or something?""  I said no and asked why.  She told me I smelled like burned grass or hair.  I told her what I'd seen just an hour earlier.  She knew I was sincere.   The next morning, I got out of bed and walked into the bathroom. As I looked in the mirror, I saw that my face looked like I had a very light sunburn.  Not deep red...just a little blushed.  I looked down and most of the hair on both arms looked as if I'd been synged with a flame.   I called my wife and she came in and gasped at how I looked.  We looked in the bed and there was a mass of burned hair on my pillow and the sheets.  I say burned...I mean it was very brittle and it and I still smelled like I'd been fighting a fire. That was 12 years ago.  I still see it in my mind and I sometimes dream about it.  I've never told anyone other than my dearest and most trusted friends.  I have no doubt that what I saw was real.  I have no doubt that it was huge, it was manned, and it was being intelligently operated.  I'm not assuming anything...that it was an alien craft, a military craft or whatever.  But what I saw moved with great stealth when I first saw it and was able to reach an unbelievably high speed in the blink of an eye.   So...as you're reading this, you may think I'm nuts.  But this is the single-most bizarre thing I've ever experienced, and I'm absolutely convinced it was real. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I came home, and when I walked up onto the front porch, I noticed a light in the sky over the mountains. The sky was clear, and I live several miles from the next closest house, so it was perfectly quiet.  I watched the light for a minute, but is was more of a glow more than anything else. Then, a second light came from ground level and slowly raised up in the sky to where the first one was. At that time, the two moved together (independently)toward my general direction. There was absolutley no sound, which I thought was peculiar. Then the two craft slowly, unwavering, and perfectly straight, came over the trees, and at point, they must have been about 200-300 yards from where I was standing on the porch. They traveled for 30 seconds, and then the two accelerated, and did a turn that I can only describe as a sharp angle pinpoint turn, and sped away so fast that they left a light trail in the sky, before disappearing. I was pretty frikkin' scared at that point, I broke the key off in the doorlock. Six years later, I was working as a carpenter on a new house, and I was talking about this incident while we were eating lunch.  Another carpenter overheard me.

AND & tend to be long-winded, sooo....I think it was either late December, early January or March, in either 1992 or 1993. Sorry for being so vague; I know I was home on some kind of break from college.  ****SIDE-NOTE...a few months earlier while I was still at school a friend of mine from Round Rock called & told me that she & her fiancee (also a friend) had seen a UFO (in Round Rock). She said that when they went outside they immediately saw it because it was the brightest light in the sky; you couldn't miss it. She said they sat there & watched it for over an hour.****  Anyway, so its a few months later & I'm home from school. My friends (the 2 I mentioned earlier) & I had planned on meeting at his apartment in Round Rock & going to dinner in Austin. Leaving my parents house I was driving North through their neighborhood & turned East onto a main road, driving towards Round Rock. It was already dark outside, I'm guessing about 6:30 or 7:00. As SOON as I made the turn East onto the main road & looked up, I saw this bright, captivating light. It was in the Northeast. I had completely forgotten about the UFO my friend had told me about earlier. This light was so bright & out of the ordinary, I watched it for the entire drive to my friends place. The drive took about 5 minutes & the light didn't appear to be moving. It didn't even enter into my mind that this was anything other than a really odd light of some sort. But it was so interesting, I had planned on mentioning it to my friends. So I got to my friends place & I hadn't seen them in a long time, so we got caught up in talking & I completely forgot about this light. I'm guessing its around 7:00 or so now. We went into Austin & had dinner. We were driving back to Round Rock (north) on I-35 around 8:00 or 8:30 or so. I think we were somewhere between Pflugerville & Round Rock & my friend said ""Oh my god! There it is!"" & told me that was the UFO they had seen a few months ago. It was the same light I had seen earlier that night & I told them that I had been watching it on my way to his apartment. We watched the light as we continued to drive up I-35. We decided to go park on this small hill about half a mile or a mile East of his apartment & watch the light. It was a quiet area w/no lights around. I dont think it was an overcast night, but I dont remember there being many stars in the sky either. So we back the car up the hill for a better view & we're facing South now. I dont remember the light being any color, just a bright clear light. It was very dark & the object wasn't close enough to make out a shape. It would blink occasionally in a seemingly random pattern. As soon as we got there & were sitting still we could see that the light was moving. And MAN, was it MOVING!!! It was jumping all over the place. We couldn't actually see it moving, it must've been moving too fast. One second it would be in one spot & half a second later it would be to the left or to the right or up or down. It was absolutely not moving in any kind of set direction like an airplane, etc. It was bouncing all over the place.  A little while later another light showed up & then a little while later a 3rd light showed up. They were all in the same general area & were close to each other. They never seemed to get right next to each other though. It never looked like any of them were close enough to touch. When the 3 lights were there, they seemed to be more active than just the one when it was by itself. They were all blinking & moving around & seemed to be communicating in some way. They weren't constantly moving though. They would each stay still for a while & then jump around and then stay still again. We sat there & watched the light/lights for about 1 1/2 hours, until they left. About an hour into watching the lights, my friend & I (not her fiancee) got the VERY distinct feeling that the UFOs knew we were watching them. We both felt like they were extremely upset at us; that we were seeing something that we weren't supposed to be seeing. Guessing I first saw the light around 6:30 or 7:00 and last saw it around 10:00 or 10:30. Between my drive to his place & the 3 of us sitting in the car, I viewed it for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Haven't seen anything like it since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2005-05-24T00:00:00,30.540183846153845,-97.66624923076922

A man and a woman were walking near us on the path and we all asked each other if we had really seen what we thought we had.

I was with my mom and bro, I was probably around 6, my bro 11.  I guess there was a meteor shower or something so we took a drive out to nowhere, just desert with mountains in the distant, this kind of setting may be hard to find now but remember this was 10 years ago  :P .  So keep the picture in your head I want you to see exactly what we did.. we are coming home from stargazing now and all you see is flat, kinda sandy, dirt everywhere... a straight rode in front of you and mountains on the left.  Alright so we were driving straight ahead, no other cars on the road and we came across these water pump things and hovering over them was a huge craft!  The best way I can describe this thing was it looked like a stereotypical saucer. The kind of things you would see in cartoons...a saucer shape, with the glass kind of bubble on top, black all the way around it and blinking lights on the sides. The lights blinking though is the thing that confuses us the most because the colors of the lights were red, white and blue....government craft??? We have no clue... Now you wont believe this but it was within I'd say 100 yards away from us on the left side of the road!! And so you get a feeling of what we saw, it wasnt ""a light in the sky"".. it was like...imagine standing in your driveway and looking across the street at the house on the other side.. only hovering about 50 yards off the ground. thats the best way i can describe the distance away from us and the size of this thing. And it made NO NOISE!!!  We just drove slowly along, staring at it, and it was going the same speed as us in the same direction, I guess following us in curiosity..or wanted to kill us :P  And so we were in awe, we had no clue what to think or do at the moment,  and I was only 6 so I got out of my seat in the back of the van and crawled in between the two front seats. Then out of nowhere the thing literally was behind the mountains that were way off in the distance in 2 seconds!!   So obviously we sped down the road to get a look behind the mountains and it wasnt there, I still cant believe what we saw to this day.. I really wish others could have seen it. Since then Its hard not to look up every 5 seconds :P ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))",2005-05-24T00:00:00,33.7283,-117.1464

I was about 15 at the time and was awake in my bedroom with a friend (with the lights off) waiting to fall asleep.  Suddenly and silently, an electric green filled my room, coming in through windows that looked out over the road.  The green was an aqua shade.  As I recall, the light seemed to pan across the room.  Both of us became immediately frightened and confused.  There was no sound and we could see (while still lying on the bed) no source for the light.  The green light filled the room for approx. 5-10 seconds, and then suddenly and completely shut off.  We listened but heard nothing (like a plane or helicopter flying away, and a quick glance at the moonlit road revealed a smooth and unbroken bed of snow; no vehicle big or small had disturbed it in quite some time.  As soon as the light went off, we noticed that the house had experienced a brief electrical problem as we could hear the answering machine resetting, and the electric clocks were flashing 12:00.  There are power/communication lines that run from nearby towers to the house, but never before or since have I witnessed any phenomenon similar to the green light.  My friend and I were frightened and excited, but decided to try to go to sleep.  Less than 10 minutes later, my friend alerted me saying, ""It's happeneing again"".  I opened my eyes to find a much softer glow, this time appearing to be focused somehwere outside my room.  I said, ""What the hell is that?"" and jumped out of bed and went to the window and looked out to see the house across the street completely aglow; the entire back of this two-story white home was extremely bright.  The light, this time, was much whiter and seemed to me to be pulsing at a frequency of about 1-2 nodes per second. (My friend would later describe the second light to be changing from white to brief spots of green and red.) For the entire duration of this second light (20-30 seconds), my friend (now joining me at the window) and I searched for a source for  the light, and found none.  The house was glowing as if some very bright light was pointed at it from above the house about 20ft from the rear wall and 20ft above the roof, but nothing was visible.  Again, complete silence throughout, and again, suddenly the light was gone, as if it had never been.   Though my friend and I were very freaked out and certainly studied the possibility that we had just witnessed a close encounter, I later became convinced that the lights were nothing more than electrical surges or what-have-you caused by heavy snow/ice on the wires in the area.  Now, however, I am unsatisfied by that explaination, as I have never heard of or seen anything similar before or since.  I never saw an object.  I don't know what it was.

They were smaller but still looked human-ish.  They looked the same as a white person but they were only about 3 feet tall and their eyes were creepy and huge.  They all stood in a ring of light that the fourth UFO hovering overhead had created with a beam.  Then they started dancing and doing the jig or something.  It was really wierd and reminded me of the Telletubbies.  They didn't even seem to notice us.  But we all watched astonished not knowing what to say or do.  No one ran in fear though.  When they did notice us they just blinked away into non existence and disappeared.  Right when they disappeared we all heard a creepy lingering little laugh, and in their place all that was left was a ring of burnt grass where the light beam was about three feet in diamater.  As far as I know it is still there.  As far as I know, none of us has has ever actually told anyone else about this, for obvious reasons.

The airport beacon would shine in through the bedroom window with it's rythmic flashes every night. I'm a pilot and enjoied living so close to the airport with the sounds of the planes and goings on. I could identify almost every plane by the sound. I was awoken by my, then, wife with her saying ""their here!"" She was out of bed and heading toward the window on her side of the bed by the time I was awake. The room was filled with blue light coming from the small window in our up stairs bed room. By the time I was on my feet and walking around the bed toward the window she was trying to open the window. The window was an inexpensive aluninium frame type that had moisture intrusion between the glass panes causing a white calsium deposit to obscure the view. So opening the window was in order to see what was going on out side. When she finally got the window open it made a bang on the aluminium frame. I scolded her for making too much noise. I could only see out of the bottom half of the window so I had to bend down. I saw four half sphere white lights that were so bright it was difficult to see anything else. The airport beacon was obscured completely. However, I could see what I think was the side of the craft. I say craft because there is no other explanation for the lights or anthing else being there. It was completely silent and stationary above a hanger 25 yards from where we were. Now, the most extrordenary thing happened. I have had an interest in UFO's and the possability of life on other planets and inter dimentional travel all my life. So it would stand to reason that when confronted wiuth such an event a photo or closer investigation would be appropriate. After looking at the lights for about 1 minute I closed the window and she and I climed back in bed and promply went to sleep. Right before I closed my eyes I thought ""what are you doing?"" A day or so later I remembered a dream that I had and was telling her about it I discribed everything that I could remember down to her banging the window open. Her face changed and she said that she had the same dream. She remembered the sound of the window banging open. That was her trigger.

In early May 2005, the 2nd week I believe, a friend and myself, decided to go for a drive, and have a cigarette. We drove to north of the airport in my city, where there is a Polish Hall. We parked in the parking lot, put some music on, nothing out of the ordinary was happening.  The parking lot is to the east of the building, and it stretches about 4 or 5 rows north with more spaces. North of that is a soccer field, than a small field, just less than the size of the soccer field, and groups of trees where the forest begins to start, I would say two soccer field lengths away from where we were parked. It was around 10:40, or 10:45 PM when I glanced up into the sky above the trees in the distance, to the north east and I saw this glowing small orange light. I though it was a plane at first but it struck me as odd, because it was moving very very slowly. The object appeared to be moving southwest towards the town of Whitby, or Brooklin, which is the north part of the city, but remained at a very low height. As it came more towards the west and directly in front of our view, the shape began to change but because it was closer, not because it was morphing or anything. It became an oval or disc shaped glowing orange. It looked like it was a giant glowing neon orange object at this point. Definetly was not a plane as I have been living beside this airport for a few decades, and all that usually flies out of there are the small DC planes. We have a police copter, but it already flew by about 30 minutes before this happened, and I can tell you this thing didn't make a sound in the sky at all. It was a clear night, no sound. As it came closer towards whitby, more southwest, the orange seemed like it was the back of the object, as if it was some sort of afterburner like on a jet, but extremely large. You could somewhat see a shadow of the body, in the sky, but again it was nighttime, and very dark so it wa hard to make out the shape. It seemed like a giant egg or oval. Right before it left our viewpoint, at the closest point to us, clearly the orange was the back of the craft. It seemed that it had two giant afterburners of some sort on the back, you could see the outline of the body in the dark and these small flashing lights began to appear, on the top, bottom, the middle around the sides, and at the front. I distinctly remember them being a blue, orange, off white, red, and green. Then it was gone without a sound. The next day at my old job, I overheard a woman i worked with talking about the same thing. I knew what I saw really was an event that cannot be explained. I even called the airport about planes in the area and they are supposed to have a curfew for planes flying at 11PM so there should not have been anything in the sky. I drew a picture in the paint program I will email to you. I have seen strange orange lights over lake ontario in whitby before, but this was much closer and it was a longer duration.

I'm belatedly reporting, only having recently found out about this website.  On May 10, 2005, approximately 3:00pm, in the courtyard behind my townhouse in McLean, VA, I witnessed three balls of ""white,"" hovering over my home.  It was the day before fighter jets were dispatched in DC to intercept a civilian aircraft--very much in that days news at the time, which had intruded into restricted Washingtion air space.  One of these jets also flew low over my home.  I have since learned the objects I saw are referred to as balls of light or BOLs. I was gardening and happened to look up at the very blue sky to the right of my chimney...south. I saw three small balls, more like three round white puffs, not illuminated from within...that I could tell...but just reflecting sun light.  At the time my estimate of their altitude was approximately 100 feet. They were bobbing around one another in a circular pattern; the formation was staying stationary.  Quickly after spotting them, and as if they realized I had noticed them, one shot off to the northeast, going behind my chimney and again becoming visible on the other side.  If the object was at 100 feet, I estimate the speed at 50-60 mph...the day was sunny and rather calm. This object, slightly bobbing, but moving in a straight line, quickly moved out of sight behind trees and other townhouses. When I turned my eyes back to the other two, they were also gone, obviously in different directions from the first.  The objects I saw were much the same as the BOLs I've seen on television of lights taped over crop circles.  Their bobbing movements were also similar.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,38.9474631840796,-77.21196832504145

I only got a good look at it for about 15-20 seconds. It seemed very low in the sky and was traveling fairly slowly. There was absolutely no sound associated with it and no flashing lights of any kind, nor any red lights like you would see on a normal aircraft at night. The lack of sound or flashing lights is what made it unusual. The cabin area was quiet, being in the countryside vacationers already settling in for the night.

I had decided to take my morning break from work and have a walk around the neighborhood, specifically so that I could watch the Blue Angels practicing their maneuvers.  There is a park near the bank where I work that has a large, open field.  I decided to linger a bit longer than normal in the beautiful, clear, warm day and watch the planes work their magic. So, I was standing in the middle of this field facing North.  The Blue Angels were flying all around the sky, so I was just standing in one position and trying to catch as much of it as possible.  It was a very clear day.  All of a sudden, I noticed an object almost directly above me very, very far up in the atmosphere.  It was something between a cigar and an egg shape and had almost a khaki color to it.  It was moving extremely slowly from west to east.  I have never seen a flying object move this slowly before.  I was astonished at seeing this mainly because the Blue Angels did not seem to notice it at all.  (Granted, its position was much higher than their own.) The object just continued on its trajectory at the same speed the entire time.  It seemed to be pushed by the wind more than move on its own power; however, that said, it was a very regular speed and constant direction.  There were no windows on the object, but it did seem to have the same shape and indentations as the object sited in St Louis this past summer.  There were some very high cirrus clouds in the area, and the object seemed to disappear and reappear through those clouds, so that might give an indication as to its altitude.  I watched the object for probably 10 minutes (which gives you an idea of how really slowly it was moving), and then suddenly felt very disturbed by it and walked back to work.  No one else seemed to notice the object, though there were several other people walking through the park and commenting on the Blue Angels. The reason I decided to post this report was that the object looks almost identical to the report from St Louis posted on your main page today.  The only difference is that this object I saw was not metallic.  It had a khaki color and no irridescent or reflective qualities at all. I thought it might be a weather balloon, but never having seen one, I'm not sure if that's what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We pondered reporting it to the authorities in the area but did not.  the object seemed to wobble slightly over the time that we obsered it but was hard to be sure because of the distance.  we continued to watch it until the fog crept across the mountain top and we lost visibility.   upon our return home the following week from our holidays we saw a news clip of the UFO sighting that was witnessed in Port Alberni and to our astonishment there was the object we had seen exactly.

There was an overpass in the distance maybe one half mile ahead when I saw an amazing acrobatic display of three lights (all attached to one flying vehicle, I could not see the structure of the vehicle itself but the lights were attached to something triangular).  The lights were a blinding white and bluish color, almost like the headlights on new european import cars.  The vehicle was flying very low turning rapidly and banking east to west then north to south along the freeway.  I had the window down on my vehicle and was traveling approx. 75 mph, I heard no destinctive sounds.  I was surprised that other cars were not stopping ( I did not stop either), I thought that this might be routine for local drivers.  I thought that I was possibly seeing a helicopter crop dusting the citrus trees to the east of the freeway. I am the type of person that would normally stop on the side of the freeway to see what was actually out there. I did not do so in this case, I was in awe,rattled, and honestly a little scared by the display.  I have been to many air shows and aircraft events, but I have never seen this kind of performance in an aircraft at such a low altitude.  The airspeed was a little faster than my driving speed of 75 mph. I estimate the aircraft's speed to be somwhere between 80 to 110 mph, but I am not quite positive. When the event was over and I continued along the freeway I began to question what I saw: Was this a crop duster? Why would a crop duster be doing these displays over a busy freeway, and if so was he or she drunk and pulling a prank?  Was this a military aircraft, and why would the military be so ignorant to pull a stunt like this over a busy freeway?  Was this a sighting of a UFO?

I realize that this is a very old sighting, but felt that it was too significant to not share with others, and see if there are any other reports of it on record. I was approximately 15 years old when I saw this UFO.  It was approximately 9:00 PM.  It was a moonlit night, and there were many cumulus clouds in the sky that were bright white from the moonlight.   I was sitting outside my house with 4 of my neighbor friends when I noticed a very large object slowly drifting across the sky.  All of us saw it.  The object was extremely large; much larger than a blimp.  I would estimate the size to be at least 100 yards in length.   At first I could not tell the altitude of the object but then realized that it was very close because it blocked out the clouds as it silently drifted over us.  I listened carefully for an engine noise, but there was none audible.   The object was irregularly shaped.  The best way I can describe it was that it looked like a large rock; appearing at least 4 times larger in diameter than it was in height.  The object was rough and had many craters (resembling the texture of asteroids I've seen photos of).  The craters emitted a dull glowing red-orange light.  I could not actually see the source of this light, the light instead seemed to be reflecting off the craters of the object from a source within it.  The object did not vary in speed, direction, or altitude.  The object was visible for at least 5 minutes before it finally drifted out of sight. During the sighting I knocked (no banged) on several neighbors doors to have them also witness what my friends and I were seeing in the sky.  When the neighbors would come outside to find out what was going on they were awestruck with what they saw in the sky.  It was no doubt to any of us that what we saw was not of this world, and was a UFO. The next day I looked in the St. Petersburg Times Newspaper for information about what we saw the previous night.  I was sure that many hundreds of people must have seen the same thing we saw in the sky.  I thought that surely it was reported by many people.  I finally found a very small article in the back of the paper that said (to paraphrase)  ""There were numerous reports of an unidentified object in the sky last night.  There is no need to be alarmed, it has been confirmed that this was only space debris"". ""Space Debris!!!"" I thought...... Well this was no space debris.  I am sure that the object was within our atmosphere because it blocked out the clouds as it drifted overhead.  The object had no wings.  It had no engine or propulsion device that I could see nor hear.  This object should have fallen to the ground if it were space debris, but instead it defied gravity and drifted across the sky. I am sure that this sighting must have been reported to UFO reasearchers by others that also witnessed it.  I did not save a copy of the article that I read so recently I attempted to search the database of the St. Petersburg Times to find an archive of this article but the database online does not go back that far.  I am hoping that there is eveidence on file of this sighting.  Could you please tell me if you have any record of this.  As I mentioned this was a very large UFO and plainly visible in the evening at approximately 21:00 hours.  The Date is just an estimate as I was a teenager at the time and guess that I was approximately 15 years of age. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The other person with me at the time of sighting was the trainer at the same farm. Myself and the other person were transporting a load of 6 horses from a farm in Houston to our base farm in Waco Tx at night.  Around 10:15 pm we pulled over to check the horses, water them ( it was a very warm night)  We opened up the side door of the transport and proceeded to tend to the horses. We were driving a semi tractor trailer type transport  A few minutes later we noticed the horse getting agitated, ears flicking back and forth, breathing heavier, stomping their hooves. The other person stepped out of the transport  to see if there was a coyote or something they caught scent of, he saw nothing.  The horses agitation increased  At around 10:30  my companion called me to come outside the trailer I did. He pointed up to the sky, northwest direction, I looked. There was a patch of the sky that was darker than the rest, and the stars were blocked out. It appeared to be moving towards us in a southeast direction At that time the semi started to run roughly, the lights started to dim all over it and inside the trailer. The horses were quite agitated at this point. The dark spot in the sky was now almost overhead and we were aware it was a triangle shape, and very large. In my estimation it was over 2 football fields long, or over the length of my outreached hand to the sky, I did that to try to judge the size. As it passed overhead there was no sound. It was definitely a solid object, had a appearence of metal, possibly stone, or another hard surface. And as it passed over  the semi tractor trailer ceased running,like the fuel wasn't getting to the engine and the lights faded  to going totally off. The horses were very nervous by this time. After approx. 10 minutes ( the object moved slowly) it had passed completely over us and was heading in the southeast direction still.  As it got farther away the semi tractor trailer started back up, the lights came back on, both gradually as if they were filling from being drained off or something. the horses settled as it got farther away as well. Both of us were shaken at this experience, and have never forgotten it to this day  We watched the object until it disappeared from decent view which was around 11pm  then closed up the trailer, and proceeded on our way to Waco. Neither of us have spoken or reported this until this past year. Only to the Coast to Coast radio website, and have told a few close friends.

I went outside and started to look up the street to where my friend lived to see if he was outside and saw him then I saw the craft one block over to the north coming from the West and could'nt bellieve it. It was moving very slowly. As we were watching it I ran to my neighbors house to tell them to come outside and check this out and they witnessed it also. As we were all watching it it began to move sideways while still moving forward; like a crab moves.The lights did not move sideways then straighten back out; everything stayed pointed forward. Then it basically stopped moving sideways once it was over our street and continued moving straight forward. As it approached us it made no noise whats so ever. The configuration of the lights on the bottom of the craft were in the pattern of a parallelogram but not sure of the shape of the craft because it was dark against the dark night sky. The lights were arranged in a straight line, front to back, in groups of three. One samll white light, one larger red light, and one more white light. Then back and off to the side was another grouping and this repeated staggering left to right to the end of the craft. As the craft passed over head you could hear a low, dull humming noise but no sign of an exhuast area you might asscociate with with aircraft we know of. It was very low and by the shape of the lights it was quite large. Exact size is hard to say but guess-timating I'd say it was the lenght of one and a half to two yards(house lots in my neighborhood- approx. 75 to 100' long) It flew in a straight line from that point until it disappeared from sight out toward Long Island Sound to the East. One thing I remember was the neighbors house I went to, his father was was visiting and he worked for Chrysler Corp. and he said that he never heard a 'engine' like that before in his life. My father is a single engine aircraft pilot and use to buzz the house from time to time and the lights on his plane were much, much smaller than the lights on this thing. One news report going around was that it was pilots flying ultralights trying to fool people but that was in the Puoghkeepsie, NY area and if you've ever heard ultralights engines you'd know these were'nt ultralights(even if somehow muffled). Another thing was that this craft moved as a single entity, not multiple craft trying to be one. Well, that's it. This is the first time telling this story in a forum like this and it has stayed vividly with me since it happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was climbing up a ladder into my bow hunting stand , it was a crisp clear morning with many stars.  As I was climbing I looked up into the sky, not to specifically see anything but naturally as one climbs a ladder. I saw a bright light, not very large, passing from the north and moving to the south, the light appeared to be quite high. I thought it was an aircraft passing overhead.The light was steady, did not blink. I did not notice any sounds, nor any delayed sounds due to a jet airplane overhead. As the light was directly over me it appeared to come to a stop, stayed there briefly, say 2-3 seconds, then moved at an extremely high rate of speedoff at a 90 degree angle to the west. In comparison to most obervations of spacecraft in orbit, which I have observed, much faster say within 2-3 seconds it was gone from sight. The size of the light was about the same as most earth objects in orbit which I have seen over the years. I could not identify any details as it was much too high in the sky. However, the abrupt 90 degree turn after stopping was noted as unusual. This is the first time I have mentioned this to any organization.

While waiting for the coming meteor shower, my husband and I were warmly wrapped in blankets, sitting on lawn chairs in our back yard looking to the North.   As the showers began, we were enjoying the show when I noticed a very bright light gliding slowly across the sky going North to South off in the distance.  At the time it looked like just a white light.  At the time we lived near LAX and at first I thought it was an airplane. But then I realized there were no red or green runnung lights.   My husband continued watching the showers and was unaware of what I was seeing.  For no reason, I said, ""If you're not an airplane, come this way, come this way"".  No sooner than I spoke the words, the object slowly veered west in our direction.   I got an eerie feeling and I pointed the object out to my husband. It moved very slowly and when it reached a point of about one half mile from us we still couldn't make out a shape since the light in front was so bright.   We stood there transfixed by what we were looking at.  It was only about 50-75 feet above us as it moved directly above our heads.  We looked straight up above our heads and it seemed so low I felt I could reach up and touch it.   It was a triangular shape,  dull black and there was no sound. It was gigantic.  At each point of the triangle was a dull white light with a very bright white light in the center.  It glided over us and slowly headed west towards the ocean.  There wasn't any noise or sound of any kind.  After approximately one half mile or so, the craft veered back to the south as we watched it fly out of our line of sight.  At this point, my husband, who was no longer watching the meteor shower looked at me and said, ""well it's time to go inside"".  And that was the end of that.

I know the decade - the 80s; I know the day - Friday; I know the time - 5:30; I know the season - winter. I know the time and day  because I was meeting my husband, a University Professor, after he left school, at the house of friends for a drink before going out for dinner. It had to be winter because it was already dark. I took back streets to avoid stop lights, had stopped at a two-way stop and, because there were no other cars in sight, was preparing to cross the intersection when  all at once  shining above me was a  bright, bright white light, not a searchlight type beam, but a hovering object with light diffused all around and about, seeming to come from within. It could not have been more than 30 feet above me and made no sound at all. I was so startled that I couldn't take note of any particulars.  It just radiated light.  I couldn't move, but after no more than a minute, the light rose straight up to a great height and sped away in a north westerly direction, very straight and purposeful, very rapid.  I followed it with my eyes and headed in the same direction in my car but it was moving much too rapidly and I couldn't of course follow a straight course. When it was just a speck of far-away light,  a shower of sparks fell from it and it was gone. When I got to the home of our friends, I told them my story and then called the police to ask if anyone had reported an unknown object in the sky.  No one had.  I can't imagine that I was the only one who saw it.  Perhaps there were those who wondered at it but didn't report it, or perhaps those seeing something streaking across the sky didn't think it unusual.  I probably would have been among any of those except that I had seen that object rise from just above me before it sped away. I had no idea what to do with such information and, too, didn't want to be among those being laughed at for  telling  outlandish stories about flying saucers.  So - I filed it away in my memory bank and thought of it seldom until I saw the Jennings program the other night.  This inexact description of events of that evening probably does not advance knowledge re UFOs at all but at least  and at last I've told it.  I am a feet-on-the-ground sort of person;  never before had I experienced something of that kind, nor have I since. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date above.

Looked up as we were walking back to my residence and I saw a cigar shaped aircraft...didn't think to much about it because of the tregectary it seemed like a silver aircraft carrier and as we were in a ""military training zone we saw lots of aircraft so no big deal right? The wings would have been practically equal to my line of sight.When an aircraft that big comes into sight it always appears cumbersome and slow so I did not really pay much attention cause the craft from a distance always seem to move slowly because they are so high. Dinn't think too much about it because I assumed I couldn't see the wings as they were equal to my line of sight and therefore I would not be able to see the wings. Anywaywe continued to walk and after about 5 minutes the craft as we observed still appeared stationary. This caught my attention and I therefore paid more attention to it...and then I noticed that the under carriage was brighly lit which could not be possible as it was around 3pm and the sun would illuminate the craft to the far side not the under carriage. On closer inspection we realised it had not moved for 5 minutes and that we were actulley getting closer. We were just stunned and did not even consider it to be anything other than a terrestrial craft. Until when we were debating what it was and when we looked up after around 10-15 seconds it had just vanished!",2005-05-24T00:00:00,,

I was with my friend at San Francisco's Lake Merced while doing some night time fishing. The night was cool and there was some overcast clouds as we were talking and fishing, then I spotted some lights overhead and thought they were coming from hi-beams such as an automobile. I thought they might be police patrol car spotlights (we were not supposed to be fishing at night because the lake was closed after dark) So now we were on the alert and thinking  we would get busted by cops so we remained silent for a minute or two. Then, across from the lake we saw a bright round metal ball about 20 to 25 feet in diameter peek out from behind a tree top, while hovering some 30 to 40 feet above the ground. At first I thought it was a spotlight that someone was projecting onto the trees, but almost simultaneously I realized that there was no attached beam that could be making the spotlight, plus , it was partially obscured by the tree tops. My friend and I looked at eachother and   we could not believe our own eyes! Then, the light slowly went back behind the trees and suddenly was gone. A few moments afterwards, the light appeared directly above the lake (approx. 100 feet or less above the water) but this time the shiny round object was obscured by the overcast clouds/fog but we could still see it shining. The next thing that happened will stay in my memory forever, this thing started emitting three sets of light blue arced pulse-typed  light rays. They were coming down in three rows and when they hit the surface of the water they simultaneously bounced back up through the arc stream for about 10 to 15 seconds and this thing made absolutely no noise. After this , it took off and was gone forever.This event happened 12 years ago but I remember most of the details clearly as if it just happened. After watching Peter Jennings' report on UFO's two nights ago, I learned of the National UFO Reporting Center and this was my experience.

I have only told 3 people this story.  I saw what I saw as clear as the laptop i am looking at right now. Absolutely no mystery to me. I could care less if people believe me but after seeing you i thought a valid sighting was worth recording with someone. I don't tell anyone about it because they would think me odd.  My name is       . I am a 41 yr old business owner now living in Santa Barbara, CA.  In October of 1993 Orange Couty CA was ravaged by fires.Hundreds of homes in Laguna Beach CA burned to the ground. 400 approx. Hundreds of other homes burned in the area as well. Orange County was on fire. I mention this because it seems a rather significant event that may have caused some interest to something.  We owned a wonderful oceanview home in the exclusive gated community of Emerald Bay. Our home burned down that month, October 23rd I recall. With all we had left being a lot full of ash we would come from our rented home to walk on the beautiful private beach of Emerald Bay.  On approx Dec 15, 1993 there had been light rains that day and the clouds were light, and very high, but mostly it was clear. We were walking down the beach for about 15 minutes towards the north. The bay is about one mile long from end to end. When we walked to the North end we turned around and walked back to the center to watch the sun go down. The visibility was fantastic, we could clearly see the Island of Catalina and beyond.  After the sun actually set over the horizon we got up and started to walk back towards our car when I looked strait out, over the ocean, to the south of Catalina perhaps 15-20 degrees up from the ocean horizon.  We witnessed an object in the air that had the sun still reflecting off it. No blinking light. It looked round or oval, i think metalic in it's reflection.  At first it just stayed there, for about 3 or 4 seconds.  We both thought, plane, and were about to look away. It seemed like a far away plane was having the sun reflecting off it. Just before looking away the darn thing shot off at an extreme angle and stopped! This thing moved so fast all we saw was a blur.  It stayed in that position for maybe 2 seconds and shot off again at an extreme angle to another position. OK, now it had our ATTENTION. I looked at my wife and said ""Does anything we have move like that?"". We watched this thing for about 40 seconds or so. It did about 7 angled moves before shooting off again at an extreme angle only to not be seen again. It appeared to be farther out than Catalina, more than 20 miles out at least.  I am an extremely skeptical person. Nothing I know of could move like that, take the g forces.  That is my story for what it is worth. I will say this. I absolutely believe that object was not of this earth, I saw it, would swear by it, take a polygraph, etc. I also definately believe in what I saw. I only wish I could have filmed it.  Can anyone tell me what can move like that? Since this time I have become an amateur astronomer and though I know I will probably never see something like this again I have become very interested in all subjects having to do with our universe. Esp. observing deep sky objects.  My equipment includes a 25"" Newtonian and my hobby has close to $30,000 in equip. to give you some idea of how interested I have become.

What intrigued me about the light was that it changed color from blue to red to white and back again but not in any particular sequence or order.  Also it seemed to hover over the house.  I would estimate that the light was several thousand feet in the sky.  I located it as hovering over the house because the house itself was the nearest landmark that it appeared to linger above and because I could, of course, see nothing beyond the house because it impeded my view of everything else behind it.  But as far as the light goes, I would estimate that it far up in the night sky.  What was strange to me though, besides its changing colors, was its hypnotic quality which cause me to stand and watch it for quite some time.  As I did, it came closer to me (I know not how much it actually moved) and then retreated a few times.  It also seemed to zig zag from right to left and back again during this process.  I was afraid to leave it for fear that it might be gone when I got back, but I was ultimately able to pull myself away long enough to run in my parents' house and get my mother who promptly followed me outside.  I quickly pointed it out to her.  As soon as she spotted it, the light quickly flashed across the night sky from horizon to horizon in the matter of a split second much in the same way that a ship in science fiction movie would go to ""warp"" or ""light"" speed.  And that was the end of the encounter except for my mom calling the county sheriff to report strange lights in the night sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

My UFO Sighting  On a Sunday morning in February of 1994, I saw an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) from the window of my twenty-first floor apartment in Toronto, Ontario, where I was living at the time. I had just gotten home from working the night shift as a security alarm monitoring station shift supervisor and was preparing to go to bed to rest up for my next shift when I heard the sound of a helicopter flying by at some distance from my building. As a lifelong aviation enthusiast who takes notice when any aircraft flies close by, I got out of my bed and went to the window to see if I could see the helicopter, which I did. It was a Bell Huey, flying from east to west along the north shore of Lake Ontario – which was approximately 2 kilometers from my location – at an altitude of roughly 800 to 1,000 meters at a speed I estimate to have been 80 to 100 knots. From what I could see, the helicopter was predominantly light, possibly white in colour, but I could not tell what subtype of Huey it was from my distance (eg., a UH-1D, UH-1H, UH-1N or Twin Huey). The weather conditions at the time were overcast (approximately 9-10ths to 10-10ths cloud cover) but reasonably bright, with the cloud ceiling at roughly 2,000 to 3,000 meters, and there was a brisk wind at ground level.  As I watched the Huey fly along the lake, I caught some motion out of the corner of my left eye and looked up. There, just below the cloud deck, was a small, round, metallic-looking, “discoid” shape that very much resembled the head, or nub, straight pin, moving in a stable, straight line course almost directly south towards the lake. It was moving a good deal faster (speed roughly 200 - 300 knots) than the helicopter and looked to be about the size of a head of a pin when held ten or twelve centimeters in front of your face, so I’d estimate it’s size to have been eight to ten meters in diameter at the altitude it was flying at. It showed no irregular motion or changes in altitude or direction. But what was remarkable was the fact that the brisk wind – which I think was from the northwest – didn’t seem to affect it’s flightpath at all; it maintained a straight and steady bearing south to the lake without exhibiting any drift. At one point, it passed through a slightly lower bank of clouds and produced a straight line wake in the clouds that lasted no more than two seconds. When I looked away to the Huey for a second, which was continuing on it's own course, then looked back to the object, it was gone. The sighting lasted less than 10 seconds and it was absolutely astonishing.  As I mentioned before, I have a lifelong interest in aviation and flying, and am fairly expert at identifying a wide variety of aircraft of all types from military to civilian, antique to modern. I am also an amateur astronomer and also have an interest in meteorology, so I am very familiar with what’s in the sky on a daily basis. I cannot speculate on what it was because I could not identify it, but I can say that it was no conventional aircraft, helicopter, or balloon in any way, shape, or form, nor was it any celestial object such as a meteor or a weather-induced optical effect such as a “sundog” simply because the conditions did not exist to observe sundogs or anything similar. I don’t know what it was, but I’ve never seen anything like it. ((initials deleted))  Whitby, Ontario ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I noticed what I thought to be a row of stars lined up vertically, straight up and down.  At first I thought to myself it was the belt of Orion, but for some reason it didn’t look right to me. Within a matter of seconds, the bottom two stars (lights) began to move. The middle one going left and the bottom moving to the right.  At first they started to move apart slowly, but then they began to increase in speed. They both started to move really quickly in circles weaving across eachother, all the while staying in the same general location they started in. They never moved very far from their original location.  Eventually they disappeared into the sky. When that happened, the remaining star began to move in the same rapid way and making circular movements, also eventually disappearing into the sky.  The whole thing could not have lasted for more than one minute and thirty seconds, since I first noticed them. It was one of the most mysterious and fascinating things I’d ever seen.

When our ears touch, it was like a quick few seconds where I heard what i can describe like millions of tiny voices. but they weren't like any language and they were all speaking at once but like no sound i could ever describe without making a fool of myself.  We pulled away from each other as i was so blown away. I immediately screamed toward him and asked if he just heard what I heard. and he was so freaked out, that he did not want to discuss it at all.  I just pleaded over and over and asked if he heard all those voices of whatever that was. He admitted yes and would NEVER discuss it again. The wierd thing was that after that day, his bedroom window had no curtains and there was a driveway and bushes to the side. Well after that for the next couple of months or so (until we broke up), there was a bush that every night as the night lights outside went on was the most perfect shape of a large head of what we normally see described at what aliens look like. It was a large bush and by day it was just a bush, but by night it was just the side view of a large alien head because of the lights around.  Anyway, this was not an actual sighting of an unidentified object, just the most bizarre unexplainable thing that I have EVER encountered in my life, especially since the bush thing appeared that night.  I can remember those voices as if it was yesterday. Never heard anything again after that, as believe me i have tried to copy the ear thing again, but never worked.

I'm reporting it now because I really would like to know if anyone else has seen anything like this in Goshen before or since.  Would love to compare notes.  Anyway... here's the story. It was about 11:30 at night on a clear starry night in late summer.  My girlfriend at the time and I were driving down ST. RT. 28 heading out of Goshen towards Blanchester.  Just to give you a better image of where we were, Goshen is farmland and out past the town it becomes a long stretch of road with forest and fields pretty much everywhere you look. My girlfriend was asleep in the passenger seat when I noticed a very bright row of white lights in the sky ahead and off to my left.  These lights were bright enough and just about the right height that I at first passed them off as stadium lights until I remembered that we had already passed the high school about 10 minutes before. Not being familiar with the area I woke up my girlfriend and pointed to the lights to see if she knew what it was.  She, like myself, was clueless.  Both of us kept our eyes glued to these lights as we drove further down the road.  At the distance we first noticed it... we didn’t notice any deviation in the brightness of the lights or any movement from the object until we got closer.  At that point we could see a sort of oscillating effect to the lights that made it look as if they were rotating around the object.  When we noticed this, honestly I began to get a bit excited.  I had always heard about UFO's but had never seen one and the thought of seeing one was a rush.  But even then I wasn’t planning on tracking this thing down... I was interested but not THAT interested.  That is until I was getting really close to my turn off and realized that my route would take me right by the field this thing was in.  So it looked like we were going to get a closer look at this thing after all. I took a left onto Shiloh road... I think that's the name of the road.  However after turning left the object was on my right hand side about a football field away and few hundred feet in the air (guessing on the distances).  Just after turning off we saw a little gravel driveway near a broken down barn that went a short distance into the field.  Both our curiosities were really peaked at this time so we pulled in, shut the car and radio off and watched. What we saw was amazing, the object was so dark that all we saw was the lights that ran around its perimeter, we couldn’t make out a shape yet, but watching its maneuvers was enough.  It would sit horizontal with its lights seemingly rotating around it, extremely bright but not so much you could look at it.  Then, its lights would dim down and stop “rotating”, it would shift from horizontal to a roughly 30 degree angle and shoot straight up in the sky and back down again in a matter of seconds but in a different spot within the field.  It would then settle fully horizontal and its lights would return to how we first saw them.  At no time did this craft seem to notice or care we were there, there were times when it would move that it would come close enough that we could hear a pulsating humming sound coming from it. All in all, we stayed and watched this for about 1/2 an hour and never did either one of us have a sense of fear, we felt totally safe (whether we were or weren’t).  While we sat there though, we noticed several other object at varying distances all pulling the same kind of maneuvers, bringing the total to about 8 UFO's in that area.  We really got the impression that they were searching for something or practicing maneuvers? Who knows. Finally we decided to leave before we pushed our luck.  On the drive home my girlfriend noticed that one of the objects was moving in our general direction.  Not so much following as we had a good idea that the direction it was going would take it really close to her home.  Her Dad happened to have a good set of binoculars so when we got there we ran back outside with them and took a look up as it went by.  What we saw was a dark triangle with 4 lights, 3 in the corners and one larger one in the center each having a yellowish/white light underneath.  In fact the picture of the Triangular UFOs from Belgium look almost identical to what we saw. So there's my story, I would love to hear from anyone that might have seen anything similar.  Granted this was 10 years ago, but I'm betting that if anyone else saw this it would have stuck in your mind as much as it has mine.

I was at NTC in Fort Irwin with the 2AD and 1st Calvary Div. I was a dismount in the Army 3-41st at the time and was 20 years old.  We had a fairly large perimeter we were guarding. There wasn't anything to do, but look at the stars. I was amazed at how many stars could be seen in the sky in the desert. I was watching airplanes, satelites in orbit and just star gazing.  I had been watching the sky for probably close to an hour before seeing this yellow-orange light moving across the sky at a consistant speed, not fast or anything that caught my eye.  I continued stargazing and watching other objects in the sky.  I was kind of tracking the objects seeing where they were going and what they were doing.  I was keeping track of a satelite an airplane and this other object which I thought was also an airplane.  I was looking at these three items when I couldn't find the yellow-orange light. It didn't flash like the other airplane I was watching and wondered where it had gone.  I thought I saw it in the sky but it was not moving.  The position I was facing was toward Baker California. The object was to the left of Baker, I have no idea of the distance. The desert is very deceiving about distance but Baker was atleast 20 miles away.  I focused my attention on the object and was about to dismiss it as the plane I had been watching when it moved. It made a series of movements and returned to the position I first saw it sitting stationary in. The first movement was side to side it moved left, then right past center, then left past center, then right past center, then returned to center. It then moved up and down starting in the position I first saw it in stationary.  It moved up, then down past center, then up past center, then down past center, then back to center. It then did what I would call a four leaf clover move.  What was strange about it, or what stuck in my head is it never took the same path during this move and returned to center. Between each of these moves it would return to center and pause for about a second to a second and a half.  By this time I am running toward another soldier in my squad that has a set of binoculars I wanted a better look at the object and also for someone else to see it besides me. The event was over before I made it to him.  The next two moves is what I couldn't believe. The object paused a little longer after the clover leaf move, maybe two seconds, then moved away from the ground in an arc towards the sky. The object appeared to be in the place I first saw it stationary and also where I would describe the edge of space at the same time. The yellowish-orange light was about 3 inches long and the same width and intensity as the object. The light caught up to the object in a fraction of a second. It then paused again for about 2 seconds and went out into space as far as I could see at a slight angle away from me. The light appeared to be wherever it was going and where it was at the same time again and then the light disappeared after it.  This sighting was so incredible that I believed I was seeing things. I started changing my mind when I saw seven helicopters come from behind and to the right of me, go the the area I saw the object, circle the area, then return where I saw them come from. I also felt relieved the next day when I ran into a guy from the first Calvary Div. that said he was lying on his tank and described the same thing I saw.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,35.3001,-116.74419999999999

There was a sighting previous to this one which displayed certain similarities to the one explained.  We were walking down a boardwalk right after work.  The airport was to the right, to the east - about five miles away.  I saw a light hovering in that direction.  At first it looked to be a helo or close plane.  Then, as quickly as I spotted it, it started moving sporadically; first to the left, then to the right, then back, then back, then up, then down, then 20,000 mph to the right and gone.  Don't worry, I'm fully convinced that it was a gov't craft - or worry.  The only thing I have trouble with is that about four years before, I witnessed a craft do the same type of motion, exactly.  And not only that; we were talking about that previous experience when this one occurred.  However, my previous observation was of a craft that was so far away it was equal to a satelite in distance.  I grew up watching stars and planets and I do know what I am talking about.  Currently, I own a four and a half inch reflector telescope which I can see the rings on Saturn and the moons of Jupiter.  Well, four of them.  Back to the original story; This craft was so close it could have been a local craft before it started to move in a manner consistent with a non-earth-craft type of motion.  I hear the Discovery channel skeptics who relate observations like this one to energy and motion hallucinations.  These people are on the pay-roll, don't listen to them.

It was two hypersonic plasma spacecraft being tested near the TRW Hypersonic Test Range in stoddard valley.  They were not visible until they illuminated the sky.  They might have been using high power microwave and lasers to generate magnetic fields and magnetohydrodynamic or electrohydrodynamic propulsion.  They would have been invisible to radar as plasma disrupts radio signals.  They were definitely hypersonic aircraft or spacecraft as I am aware of some from an aerospace company I used to work for.  It had rocket flames which would be magnetohydrodynamic diffuser generators to provide power.  I know the Air Force Research Laboratory is building UAV's and SDI weapons using these same technologies.  Also they might have had flickering skins to confuse IR heak seeking missiles from tracking it as it had a enormously long rocket plume(They had intense lights from them that were flickering and plasma doesn't flash at such a high frequency).  The two spacecraft darted across the sky at high velocity going in opposite directions on the hypersonic test range.  The plasma was blue and there was no noise or shockwave as the plasma attenuates the shock wave at hypersonic speed.  You can find more information from Venik's Aerospace Website.  They also test hypersonic missiles and missiles can't keep darting back and forth for 60 minutes at least.  It was near the border of Nevada.  I haven't seen them test since that time.  But they acknowledged that a super secret TRW test range was there but couldn't comment on the subject as it was highly classified information. http://www.aeronautics.ru/archive/plasma/index.htm http://www.rpi.edu/dept/eng/live/mane/lightcraft/Research/DEAS/deas.html ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was 58, walking a darkened mobile park's streets.  The night was unusually beautiful, moonless and crystally clear.  My head was craned back as I looked overhead and marvelled at how velvety black the night was and how sparkling the stars.  As usual,  the milky way was much in evidence.  Suddenly,  in a group of 5 1st magnitude stars ( I thought later it was the handle of the Milky Way ) two of the "" stars"" began chasing each other. [ If you took a pencil and slowly drew a 5 pointed star without lifting your pencil,  that would represent 5 seconds and the approximate angles of flight; in other words, sharp, sudden and continuous movement )  The first thing that popped into my mind was, "" Planes can't do that.""  I remained half an hour to see if they reappeared,  but they didn't.  The next day I called the newspaper office and asked if anyone else had reported seeing a UFO.  They said no.  They wanted me to give my name and details,  and I said, "" No way!! I don't want to be identified as a crackpot.

Check reports in the past for Sardine Creek Rd.,  Sam's Valley,  Gold Hill. Later my best friend told me of a couple he knew who'd built a cabin on Sardine Creek Road,  a cabin with a flat roof.  They put a mattress up there and stayed up late watching UFO's.

There was other people there as well. There was a hispanic man standing on one of the many boulders watching the sky. I looked west towards the setting sun and thought at first I was watching an airplane. But then I realized it was round and metalic and very bright. Still I thought it was just the sunlight reflecting on it. I pointed it out to my frined and her kids. At that moment it skipped across the sky at such a fast speed. It was in one spot than the next, to the point your head had to turn real quick to catch it. It was definately faster than any fighter jets and made no sound at all. We just stood there watching it skip back and forth across the sky. I started to get creeped out and said to my friend we need to go. I looked over to the Hispanic man he was rushing his family out. It was like everyone just instictually knew to leave. For some reason my friend, who was driving decided to take the scenic route or back roads back down to Denver. It was a wierd decision because the freeway was right there. As we were going down the mountain side it was still pretty light outside. The sun had not set yet. There were these light like a negative print from a picture but they were florecent green. Not bright, but almost like an olive florecent? they came at the car in waves. It looked like waves, and they made geometric shapes infront of the car. Like outlines. The kids were scared, she was scared. I wasn't susre what to think. At one point we got by this switch back dirt road and there was a man just standing there. He was in plain clothes. And he was just watching us. We drove by him. I couldn't get a good look at his eyes but, He was so very still. We got to the bottom of the road and it was night outside. We couldn't figure it because the cars time clock didn't seem to be messed with and we all seemed to be of sound mind. The car was acting up.  We got to her place just in time to discover the brakes were completely gone. Which was extremely wierd because she just had new ones installed a few days before our trip out there.  Not an hour later there was several helicopters flying over her home and they were gone. The kids still have dreams of that experiance.

There was a right hand turn that we had to make or the road would take us all the way to Douglas, and since we lived in Elfrida we didn't want to go that way.

The next thing I remember we are about 5 miles past the turn we should have made.  I remember stopping and we talked about it for a minute and then we turned around and went back.  We found the turn with no problem.   Just after we hit the pavement I noticed a large cirular object in the sky, it was like it was the moon, it cast a glow, it was bright enought to cast a dull shadow.  I was watching it as I drove and realized that it was way to close to earth to be the moon, it was like it was hovering.  I am not sure of the distance, the object didn't move it just sat there, stationary, and even as I drove at it, it seemed to stay at the same distance.  I stopped my car and asked my friend ""what the hell is that?""   He said he had no idea and that we just better ""Get the *$^% out of the there.""

We all found out later that our IFT was reporting what he thought was a starboard side navigational light (green) from another aircraft heading the same direction as ourselves.  A few minutes later, the IFT keyed the mic and was gonna suggest that FLIGHT change course as the Green light appeared to be getting closer, but he really got out was ""Holy (expletive)!!!  What the hell is that thing?  Flight, you guys see it?"". All this sudden commotion on the intercom got me and the other Acoustic operator to look up from our stations.  Looking up the ""tube"" (which we affectionately called the aircraft interior), we saw the flight station was flooded with a brilliant light shining through every window from above.  I got up from our station and made my way up the Tube towards the cockpit. Both pilots and the flight engineer (FE) were leaning forward trying to look up.  Everybody was kind of panicky and yelling back and forth in the flight station when the brilliant light stopped, and the pilot said ""look at that! look at that!!.""  The object had moved from above us to about a hundred yards off of our port wing.  That was the first I actually got to get a look at it. It was about 50 feet long, cylindrical, and green light all over.  The surface was smooth, or at least I couldn't make out any markings or features. The second FE came up to the flight station with this high tech camera that we used for intel gathering.  He told me to move, so he could get some good shots of it.  I made my way aft to the port overwing exit so i could see the object.  It just stayed off our wing for maybe 2 or 3 minutes then shot off and up faster than anything I have ever seen.  It went from about 100 yards to out of sight in just a couple seconds. Our Navigator/Communications officer (NAVCOM or NAV) had been on the radio with Red Crown (An AEGIS Cruiser acting as the air traffic control for the exercise area) who asked that we loiter on station and see if we could re-establish contact.  We remained on station for another half hour and were told to RTB (return to base).  When we landed, two white government vans took all of us to the briefing/debriefing center.  We were interviewed one at a time.  Our interviews taped.  Our film confiscated... (two of the guys had their own personal cameras and had snapped some photos too).  Our mission tapes confiscated.  We were told to not discuss this flight and made to sign an agreement to that effect.  Well, we thought this was all too cool, so we get back to the barracks and my buddy, who had been the radar operator on the flight, and myself started spilling our guts.  ""We saw a freakin UFO!!!""  The following day, our crew was called into the CO's office, he informed us that he was hearing ""stories"" and reiterated the fact that we were ""NOT to discuss it.""  So with the exception of a few hushed story swappings, here and there... we did.

She was a very practical woman, not given to flights of fancy so I know that it is true. When I was a kid, she told all of us grandchildren many, many times about seeing a cigar shaped UFO when she was about 12 years old.  This would have been in 1910 because she was born in 1898. This occurred in broad open daylight, in front of her house in the country, and it moved from West to East at a fairly brisk pace.  She said it was very large, gray in color, and that it had nothing below it or any sort of wings whatsoever (like a dirgible for instance).  It made no sound. She told this story all of her life.

Neither of us have ever seen a UFO previous to this occasion, and have only heard stories. I was out on my apartment balcony which faces south, just after night-fall, when I noticed a orange looking star-like object slowly streaking ""down"" the sky in the west. The character of the object was that of a comet. The object began above us and to the west of us, and was slowly streaking down in the western sky. The object was moving at an angle so that it may have been only reaching the western horizon, and not actually falling. As the object neared the horizon, it disappeared into the clouds. Six main points of interest that may be helpful to anyone reading this for investigative purposes. 1 - my wife and I both agree that the object had a tail (comet like tail). 2 - my wife and I both agree that the object was shifting horizontally in the sky, and that the tail was not effected - the entire tail was shifting with it (jumping to the left and right). 3 - My wife and I both agree that there was some sort of activity around the object, appearing as dancing blue specks of light to us. 4 - Upon calling my brother who lives about 50 miles away in Greenville, TX he confirmed the same comet like light with a comet like tail, in the same part of the sky, headed the same direction. He saw this briefly before it disappeared into the clouds. (Brother is a religious conservative who would never believe he saw a UFO - he felt this was a comet). 5. My wife and I researched every website we could find on the sky that night, and found no reports of a comet. The Perseids meteor shower was scheduled for within the next couple of days - but this object moved much much slower than any shooting star/meteor that I've ever seen. 6. Both my wife and I agree that the object was an orange ball of light, looking about the size in the sky that a planet looks like when we see mars, only it was moving with a tail streaking behind it.  Myself (age 26)- Open minded individual, who has shown intrest in UFO/paranormal activity. Wife (age 24) - Not open minded, does not show intrest in UFO/paranormal, and pokes fun at these types of things (feels there must be some logical explanation for what we saw that night, like a sattelite or something). Brother (age 29) - Definately not open minded, very conservative (also feels there must be some logical explanation for what we saw that night, thinks it was a comet).

The sky was clear of clouds except for the distant horizon (West) which had clouds only at the base of the sky, and behind us there was a small bank of clouds through which the nearly full moon had just risen.  As we scanned the western horizon above remnants of the sunset, two of us saw 4, perhaps 5 repetitions of a light show.  We saw a row (once two separate rows) of very bright yellow-orange lights, large rectanglular 'panels' of light perhaps 4 times as tall as they were wide, in a regular horizontal row.  One of these phenomena involved two rows of lights next to each other, but not in the same-dimensional plane -- as if there were two objects giving off light that were not level with each other.  The # of 'light panels' we saw at any given time varied from three to seven altogether; the time we saw seven there was a gap or space of darkness which provided a marker and it was as if the lights were slowly rotating out of sight on the right hand edge.  The lights were out over the ocean, perhaps 3 to 5 miles, about 15 or 20 degrees above the horizon from our vantage point.  There were no other lights visible before, during or after we saw these lights (no running lights).  No Sound we could hear above the surf.  The lights were on, very bright light like looking through ports into a blast furnace, for 20 to 30 seconds, and they did not move, remained stationary in the sky, and then they would all turn off at once.  The second set of lights was WNW or so, then the two sets of lights next to each other again due West, then one at WNW again, and finally one light due West down closer to the surface of the water that I saw with peripheral vision, only briefly.  From one sighting to the next, the lights appeared in a different part of the sky, but at the same height, and after a 30 second to 1 minute pause.  We never saw the outlines of craft, or saw the lights move at all when they were on.  One of those times, my partner saw the lights reflect off the surface of the ocean, not as if searchlights, but just that the light was so strong and bright it clearly reached the water and bounced back up.  All of this happened within a span of 5-7 minutes, then it stopped.  From that distance, we estimate these lights were something like 4 feet wide and 10 feet tall @ 2-3 miles away: they were huge and very bright.  Background: I practice Chinese Medicine; my friend is a Policy Analyst in state government.  We were camping, and did not see anyone else around us at the time of the sighting.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,45.46619999999999,-123.71

The first time I saw them was the best. It was about 8:15 PM. My brother, his friend, and I were on our way back from a foothill we call ""Sawtooth"" out by the Silverbell mines. I was spacin' out, staring out the window. Directly where I was staring about 4 or 5 larger sized (about the size of 2 or 3 planes coming in to Tucson)yellowish orange lights appeared in the blank sky, and held a steady glow. They sat there for about 15 seconds with their lights on, then all went dark. At this point the 3 of us were standing out on the side of the road. So, about a minute or so later, a single light comes on. Then another up and off to the right of the first one lights up, then another in the same direction, and another. There ended up being I believe 5 lights at that time. By the 3rd light, the first was fading out simultaneously, and the rest followed suit. After a little of this type of action, different light patterns and #'s of lights, etc. they seemed to be playing or something, maybe just flying around observing. The thing about it was that now there were maybe twice as many lights and they didn't blink. They would sometimes shut off their lights, but never blink. Then, at about 8:45PM, the Marana Regional Airport sent 2 jets out. I heard them take off and watched them cross the sky. All the unidentified lights were now shut off. But once the jets were close, they all turned back on, and were very close together, shining toward the jets. There had to have been like 15 of them. It was like a wall of light in the sky. Eventually the jets arrived and chased about 4 of them toward 3 Points, and 2 or 3 toward Pheonix. The rest were gone. I've seen them do many different but similar things since then on maybe 7 different occasions, and have maybe a dozen other witnesses.

We then noticed a cluster of 5-7 lights high above us.  These were DEFINITELY NOT fireworks.  Nor were they stars.

The shape of the object was not discernable, however it had, as I recall, three white lights, situated what I assumed to be at its perimeter.  The most noticeable thing about this craft was that it made no noise and that it moved so slowly -- very slowly. The object was easily 300 feet long if all the lights observed belonged to the same craft. It moved very slowly to the NE.

I wrote down as much as I could remember back in 1986 and saved it. It was suggested by a local man who had been studying UFO phenomenon since the age of 13 that I write it down. This is only one entry I wrote in a Journal over a two month period. August 2, 1986 I went camping overnight at Clarks Fork. It was at dusk when I noticed a small bright light directly above me, the sky had no stars out yet and this light was close and glowing. It is my 21st birthday and my boyfriend and I are going to go to Kennedy Meadows for a drink.  It is dark now approximately 9:30, we are driving toward the main hwy to go to Kennedys. We both see a very large bright glowing light up to my right of the car, just above the treeline. It is moving along as we do then over the mountain and it waits. It moves ahead the waits, then moves ahead then waits.  By now I am telling my boyfriend I do not want to go anywhere. I want to watch them.I can feel that they are here.  We are approaching the bridge at Clarks Fork I asked my boyfriend to park facing the object because it is in front of the car, low in the sky its very large and glowing. We watched it for what seemed forever. It is hovering there, moving to to the right then back in front of us. It is much larger than the one I have seen at home maybe because it is closer, like the night on the way back from Tahoe, really big and close.I asked them in my mind to come closer so I can see them then it comes closer then stops. I feel they do not think it is time. I don't know how I feel that, I just do.  My boyfriend actually agrees it is really a UFO, he sees the way it is moving. Now he believes me. While we have been watching, he noticed  a yellow one to our left side, not moving,glowing big just like the white one to our left side. Then the yellow one moves slowly away back toward the mountain as we decide to go back to the campground.  They are both followed us. The yellow one stays more in back and the white one moves more in front. I am looking up and around to spot them. They are here, I am comfortable with that. As we went to sleep in our sleeping bags in the back of the truck, I am watching the white one up through the trees toward the Dardnells. The yellow one is behind us but still in sight.  All of a sudden a disk shaped craft with red lights all the way around moved past the white one circling, its spinning as it hovers horizontally across the tree tops; moved past the white one circling in the air. It has landed I believe, but it came from nowhere and went very low. God, there is no noise. Oh my god I can't believe it. It is round. I looked for it but it was gone I believe there are several crafts here, I feel the presence. I am to tired to stay awake. I hope they come see me tonight.  I had a cup of water in a white styro foam cup and set it on the edge of the truck bed toward the cab and asked them in my mind to take it so I'd know they were there. It was gone in the morning, nowhere in camp to be found anywhere. I never did have that drink and no alcohol this night. I attended a MUFON meeting here in the area many years ago. One man wanted to put me under hypnosis, but I had lost time and been visited in my bedroom and felt scared, part of me still is afraid.  I do know that they meant me no harm because they kept me from panic, they stopped that physiologically in my body, but they used their minds to do it. Now I am ready to find out what happened all of those times. I have had sightings since the age of 8 or so and then visits.  Please contact me. Please, I am 39 going on 40 this year and I want to know finally.Thank you for your time.",2005-05-11T00:00:00,37.9521,-120.2019

My mother, my sister, and myself were traveling home after they had picked me up from marching band rehearsal at my high school's football field. Mom was driving, my sister was riding in the front passenger seat, and I rode in the back seat. Approximately 1/2 mile from the school, I noticed a light above the trees on the other side of a field. This area is mostly vast farmland. The light had a reddish/yellowish glow. Upon noticing the glowing light, I said to my mother without taking my eyes off of the light, ""Mom, you might want to pull the car over. I think you want to see this."" As I remained transfixed on the light, Mom pulled the car over. She jumped out of the car, as did I and my younger sister. The three of us hopped a small ditch and stood in the open field looking at the light. The moment the three of us stopped and stood together to watch the light, the light began to move toward us. While in the distance, there was no way to tell its size, shape, or distance. As it began to move toward us, I could see a large red sphere of light, flanked by a smaller yellow sphere of light on each side of the larger red sphere. It moved slowly and made absolutely no sound. As it approached, I could see the red glow reflecting off the field in front of us. As it grew nearer, static electricity grew strong as well raising the hair on my arms and head. From the moment I first noticed the object, I looked away only twice. Once I looked down at my arms to notice my hair standing up and the red glow reflecting off my skin. The second time I looked away, a car was passing by. It was a friend of mine leaving rehearsal as well with his mother. I watched them pass to see if they noticed the light, or us watching it. They passed by without notice of anything. It was then I turned back to look at the light when I realized it was almost directly over head. The three of us grew highly anxious and embraced one another tightly. My mom stood in the middle, I was on her right, my sister was to her left. We never spoke throughout the duration of the event. As the object hovered directly over head, I could see through the light. There was no structure within it. No apparent source from which the light emitted. The red and yellow lights were bright, but not blinding or hurtful to the eyes. The lights appeared electric, yet soft, like a neon sign. That moment in time is the last memory either of us have of witnessing the object. For all three of us, there is no recollection of the object departing, us departing, us going home, us returning to the car, or even discussing what we had seen. The object hovering directly above us is collectively our last memory of that entire night. It was a few years later while in college that I remembered the incident.  I was outdoors one evening photographing shots of the moon. Upon later developing the images, I noticed a small metallic-looking ball hovering near the moon in the frame. I had taken several shots and the object appeared in one other photo, only this time it had moved much closer to the moon. Viewing these photos startled me. It was then I remembered the incident with my mother and sister in 1986.  Upon recalling the incident in 1986 with my mom & sister, I was quite disturbed when my memory didn't last beyond the object hovering above us. I promply visited my mother to ask her about it. She rememberd the incident vividly with the same detail as myself, with no memory of the object's departure, and no memory of the incident at all until then. She and I called my sister on the telephone to inquire about the same night. She too remembered the exact same incident with the exact same voids in her memory. Later, the three of us met face to face to recall the events of that evening and our memories, and lackings thereof, were in perfect accord. I do not know what it was nor do I claim that it must be alien. The only thing I know it to have been was a UFO...an Unidentified Flying Object. A UFO that left the three of us with some very unusual effects. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))",2005-05-11T00:00:00,,

Although this happened several years ago, I still remember it vividly.  My family and I had just driven to a nearby community, called Engelberg, to look at the Christmas light display that this area is known for.  The road that leads to Engelberg is a rural road without much traffic.   On our way back to town, while on this road, my younger brother, who was about 6 at the time, said ""Hey, look, its two Haley's comets.""  Haley's comet had already come and gone earlier that year, so I said, before I even looked, ""No, stupid, Haley's comet has already gone!""  But about that time, we all looked over out the passenger's side of our van and saw what appeared to be two comets (complete with tails) in the distance.   No sooner had we fixed our eyes on them, they ""shot"" directly over our van.  My dad stopped the van because we didn't know WHAT the heck it was.  It was probably no more than 50 feet above the vehicle and it no longer resembled comets, but appeared to be random red glowing lights.   It was a clear night out, but the lights were hazy.  We could not distinguish a craft shape, although whatever it was was hovering.  We just stared at it for about 2-3 minutes.  (although it seemed like time had stopped.)  As we were watching it, my parents rolled down the windows to see if we could hear anything.  We heard NOTHING!  Only the wind.  We all commented on the fact that this was just ""weird.""   My dad, trying to remain calm, came up with the idea that it must be some sort of special military plane that has special ""silencers"" on it.  My mom said, ""Yeah, but wouldn't we SEE a plane? It is DIRECTLY over our heads.  Dad: ""I have NO idea""  Brother: ""I'm scared"". At this point, the lights ""shot off"" to our left, in a blur and then disappeared.  We sat there with our van in the middle of the road for a while after that just trying to absorb what we had just seen.  When we got back home, we were watching the local news out of Jonesboro, Arkansas (KAIT) and the weatherman said that they had gotten lots of calls from the Pocahontas area about this phenomenon, and the weatherman said it was a meteor shower.  However, later in the broadcast, the weatherman said they had just received a report that it was NOT a meteor shower after all, but was reported by the FAA to be a Russian Missle that had gone off course.   I would have believed the whole ""meteor shower"" story had they not come back and ""blamed the Russians.""  I can still recall the exact date, even though it was almost 20 years ago because I wrote about it in my diary that night (which I still have) and my family still discusses it frequently.  I am not sure what it was, but I DO know that meteors don't hover and the story about the Russian missle is just too lame.  I think no one knows what it was....sure wish I knew, though!",2005-05-11T00:00:00,36.3064,-90.97720000000001

I do not have an exact date or time of this event. It could have been between mid 1986 and mid 1987, so I arbitrarily assigned it December 31, 1986. The time of 9pm or 2100 hours local is also approximate.  The precise information was recorded in a log book that I used to record astronomical measurements in and was later stolen in a home burglary. And I can only guess the above dates because of other information that was recorded before and after the log book was stolen. Also the Houston area is not much of a seasonal place so that does not help my recollection.  The following is the best of my recollection.  The formation of lights appeared in my northwest sky at about azimuth 315 and about 30 degrees altitude up from my horizon. The formation was 4 white lights parallel to the horizon appearing as two pairs of lights with about twice the distance separating the pairs as was between each light in the pair. The brightness of these lights were around 4th magnitude star lights and appeared as such - point light source stars.  The lights were steady and not twinkling. The angular width of the formation was about 1 degree. This formation of lights changed location in the sky within an area of about 4 degrees. I based the approximate degree measurements using the width of the index finger at arms length to be about 1 degree. The formation moved from its initial location down about 1-1/2 degrees and to the left about 1 degree, and then from that location moved about 2-1/2 degrees to the right and down about 2 degrees. The lights did not move but instead disappeared and reappeared in a different location as noted. These were the only movements I can recall and then they disappeared completely.  When the lights changed location it was and instantaneous movement meaning the lights did not disappear for some time then reappear. This was in fact what caught my attention to begin with so I really don't know how long they were doing this movement before I noticed them. There were no other noticeable objects or lights in this area of the sky. There was no other apparent motion with the lights. There were no sounds. There was no noticeable object associated with the lights. The formation of the 4 lights never changed its shape. I assumed these lights to have been at a very great distance away from my location. There were clouds in that area of the sky and I viewed the event through an opening in the clouds that stayed open during the entire event. This was all viewed using only unaided eye vision - no telescope or binoculars, etc... The event duration was probably about 15-20 seconds.

This also was a very up close encounter.I called for my son and after several emotional outcries he finally responded by rushing out to the back porch.He still is very haunted by the memory.I too have no equal experience to diminish this. As far as features go,there were no signs on this craft revealing it being assembled by the usually standardized fabrications we see in aircraft such as rivetings or weldings or paint.However there were metallic trims around the many windows that adorned this airship from front to back that seemed to be the only thing I could define as perhaps seeming ""natural"" to my eyes.It was raw metallic and flawless in it's design.It had semblance to a blimp but however this was a colossus that stretched several hundred yards in lenghth and had no carriage or motor housings. It made no noise that I might discriminate and the ocean was relativity quiet. A brilliant ray-beam of light emitted from the entire bottom side.My son left in my car to go in pursuit of this craft as I watched it slowly travel left to points ahead. A short time later at 11:00 PM the local news media reported that the Coast Guard Auxiliary Station at Carolina Beach, N.C. issued a statement that the UFO being reported by people all up and down the Eastern Seaboard was nothing more than just their drug surveillance vehicle.Me and my son began to laugh. It was the one time we could as that UFO was and still remains to this day the most spellbinding encounter to date. He posted his post about this years ago on this website and no one has backed him up as he asked for.Well here is my account. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I know it was in the late 80s.  The sky was clear, and it was warm weather.   I was traveling west of US RT 33 when a faint light in the sky caught my attention.  I put my head out the window to make sure it was not a reflection on the windshield.  It was still there.  I pulled over to listen, but I could hear nothing.  It was very high in the sky.   The best way to describe it would be that it was a rectangular shaped object that moved very, very slowly to the north.  It seemed to have four circles that appeared to pulse rhythmically in order - as one would brighten, the one before it would dim.  What really got my attention was the only bright light (not overly bright, at that) that came from it.  My main thoughts were that it was some type of aircraft since it had what appeared to be the same type of light that I had seen on commercial aircraft that were like headlights.   The odd thing about it was that the lights were going in the opposite direction of the way the ""object"" was moving.  The lights also carried out far into the sky.  Without having any point of reference, I will describe the difference in my own terms.  If normal aircraft headlights would extend out one inch, these lights extended out 5 feet.  Even though I know I saw something, to this day, I have no idea what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

It was a bit chilly, and as I was trying to fall asleep  I was looking out the back window at the stars.  I saw something peculiar, three 'stars' that were equi-distant apart in a triangle.  A fourth 'star' of the same brightness emerged from the bottom right corner of the triangle and made a slow straight procession to the top 'star' of the triangle and disappeared into it.   There was a pause of perhaps 6 seconds, then the star re-emerged and moved to the bottom left star of the triangle.  Nothing further happened, and the whole experience is somewhat unremarkable, but I think in retrospect, if indeed I was looking at a stationary craft, perhaps the fourth star was part of a light array on the trailing edge of the craft.   The formation was stationary, more-or-less directly overhead, and probably a good distance out.  I could not initially make sense of the experience because I was thinking in terms of the moving object being a craft itself, a satellite or plane, but could not reconcile the eccentric stop-and-go movement, or precise relative movement to the other 'stars'.

I was 15 and am now 31.   We were driving along the beach after having had dinner that night.  I can't remember what exact month it was (it was Sep, Oct or Nov) and I now for sure that there was smoke on the horizon line that night from wildfires that had recently swept through several parts of Florida.   There were about 6 surfers heading toward the waves with surf boards under their arms.  They were pointing up and then I saw it....a cylinder like a cigarette shaped thing with lots of lights.  The lights were rectangles some on their sides and some standing up.   It was ridiculus.  I can remember that there was no order to these lights.  Isn't craft supposed to have symmetrical lights?  The light source seemed to be soft fluorescent and didn't shine outward.  The lights were soft white and there was nothing visible behind them.  I estimated the craft was at least as long as a football field.   Anyhow after about a solid 45 seconds of this the lights shut off and two purple lights appeared, one on each end of the thing.  Never at anytime did the thing make a single noise.  Then it started to move away slowly and began to spin wildly.  The spin was unlike anything that could be reproduced in any object having mass.  It spun out of control with no axis of rotation and dissappeared into the southwest sky.   That last split second it went from being just hundreds or so feet over the Atlantic to out of sight.  So the distance was like 500 miiles travelled in about one tenth of a second.  There was no light trail like the kind the starship Enterprise used to leave.  That is what I saw.   My mom and my step dad both saw it too but claim now that they can no longer remember seeing it.  I saw this thing just last December, a photo, in my Encarta computer encyclopedia.

Once we realized it was much too early, we sat and watched for nearly an hour as that portion of the sky got brighter and brighter, at one point I questioned my friend as to what I was seeing, and if he saw it the same way. Apparent beams of light were now stretching to the sky in that one area of the sky only. Slowly, towards the latter part of the hour, the light faded away, until once again the night sky was completely black. At this point, I went into the house to check the time again, It was now nearly 4am. I returned to the fire, and as we sat there discussing what we had seen, I saw an object in the sky, we believe coming from the south, I questioned my friend, ""Isn't that object moving awfully fast?"" Other aircraft (planes) could be seen in the sky, the standard, slow moving, plae blinking light. This first craft had four, large, unblinking, white beams, in a diamond shape. It was moving so fast over and above our heads we were having a hard time keeping track of it.  Followed very close behind this object and moving just as quickly was another craft with what appeared to be two solid green, and 2 solid red lights, these did not blink either.They followed very close together on the same course, and were out of sight in a matter of minutes. My friend and I sat awestruck, and debated what we were seeing, the objects were soundless, but very large, and were travelling so quickly that ordinarily you would hear a sonic boom- but nothing. We figured that about 15 minutes passed and were still discussing the nights events, and how eerie this all seemed, saying ""No one will ever beleive this, I'm glad to that you are here to see this!"" Just as we were going to get up to go to bed,a third, fastmoving object came flying from the same direction as the previous two.The big difference was that this one appeard to be disc shaped.lights,all different colours, flashing it seemed to be a completely random order. This ship flew as quickly, and fllowed the same course, and we actually got up out our chairs, clinging to each other, walking beneath the object, up the yard, we had a hard time keping them in sight even as we got up and walked across the lawn following them. Even after it had passed the blinking band of mulicoloured lights could been seen clearly until it passed over another wooded area. This whole event from start to finish may have lasted as long as 2 hours. When we finally went to bed it was nearly 5am. I just want to add, that the night sky was clear that night, numerous stars and constellations were presnt, and whether tht two events, the light in the sky, the crafts, etc we part of the same occurance, I'm not sure, but both my friend and I can honestly admit, that we've nevr seen anylike that before, and it sure gave us an eerie feeling.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,44.4475,-64.4129

I thought this odd, and questioned my friend that it seemed awfully early to be getting light. It started off dimly, but slowly began to brighten, only in this one area. The sky was clear, with many stars visible. After 20 min- 1/2 hour, my friend and I noticed that apparent beams of light were now pointing skyward from this one location. (Think, Hollywood, movie/searching lights, the kind that point straight up). I questioned him again, to be sure that he was seeing the same thing I was. After a few minutes these beams started to fade, and for the remainder of an hour the lights slowly faded altogether, the sky then becoming dark like the rest of the night sky. We thought this odd, but didn't know what to make of it, and went back to our campfire. A few minutes later, we noticed an object in the sky, I made a point of saying, that it seemed to be moving awfully quickly. As it approached it became apparent it was diamond shaped, made up of four, large, bright, unblinking beams. As it sped across the sky over our heads, my friend mentioned how an object moving as fast as this should break the sound barrier making a sonic boom, or some sort of noise, yet none could be heard. Right behind this object was another, following on the exact same course, moving just as quickly. Only, this craft had two large red lights, and two large green lights. While they were travelling above us, other regular aircraft were visible, and there was no comparison between the size, speed, etc. These were no regular crafts. They were big, silent, low flying and extremely fast. As we watched, I held my friend's arm awestruck, not able to say anything.

As I said it was overhead and gone so quickly, I had to run across the lawn to keep sight of it. After this third craft, we were quite shaken, and retreated to the house.

I live in a house in the city of Rio de Janeiro, 20kms from downtown and 25kms from Ipanema (yes the same Ipanema from the “Girl from Ipanema” song), 2kms from the coast, in a condo with houses and buildings. (if the location were I live is important, I looked in the yahoo maps for the location http://mapas.yahoo.com.br/mapaxml.asp?arq=10.10.7.2/temp/6218_yahoo____endereco_06032005_235343&jump=#topo )  Me and my 5 friends were talking in the swimming poll at my house (we were not drinking or using other stuffs). I saw a strange light far southeast, it was changing colors, faint, red, green and blue, just one spot. And it was dancing near the top of a distant building. I thought it was someone that taped a small flashing light in a kite, and was playing with it over the building. Then the light made a fast movement down behind the building. I thought: - well, they collected the kite. (Just I saw this light). But when the light disappeared, one of my friends pointed to the sky (west +/- 45 degree), and asked: ""What is that?”. Just above us one black triangle, with NO lights and NO sound, was floating, west to east, it seams to be very slow and calm. It seams to be gliding, floating, not flying. But it appears to be going in a straight line. It was a PERFECT triangle with sharp corners, it was not a glider, or a stealth plane (both of them are not a perfect triangle). And it was black, but stealth planes black. And smooth, with nothing visible on if surface. It was a very clear night, without clouds and no wind. We were seeing it because of the reflections on it from the lights of the city. So it was relatively low. Kind the same altitude of the clouds (we can see clouds everyday illuminated from the city light too). As it pass, we could see the rear-end of it and there was no lights or fire from engines. It did appear to be a thin object. It passed over us until disappearing behind another building (not landing over or behind it, it just passed over it). We where amazed and wondering what was that, then we looked west and other TWO black triangles were floating the same direction of the other. They did disappear behind the same building the same way and speed (slow). We were even more amazed and clueless and we looked again to west and the last 2 were coming and did the same trajectory without light or sound. We were very excited at the end, but frustrated for not having a photo or video camera. I don’t know how to describe the size of them. They were very big to see, but not huge like others descriptions that I heard of black triangles. The were probably huge, but due to the distant, they seamed to be just very big to us. Maybe it could cover 8 to 10 full moons lined up. There is a small not-military and not very busy airport 10km north from here, so I know how to identify planes and I know that they are noisy. And the city’s Goodyear Blimp, lands in the same airport almost everyday (sometimes passing south to north over my house), so I know blimps too. Gliders, well I can see all kind of them when I go to the beach here. Theses black triangles we saw are not like anything I ever saw. I don’t know if there were others in Rio that saw, but nothing were reported on the local or national TV or newspaper.  If you need, I can take a panoramic photo from the place and draw the size and trajectory of them.  Sorry my bad English it is hard to explain this kind of stuff in another language.I hope it was enough detailed.  If you have any question, just e-mail me.

Bright light that speed away as we approached. (10 years have passed) I was onboard a flight from San Antonio, Texas after my father's funeral, and was heading back to Dallas (DFW.)  Since I get motion sickness easy, I have to look out the window in order to get a fixed point to look at.   A Cold front had gone through that cold cloudy day and it was rather windy around the time the flight took off.  The takeoff was rather bumpy, and I had my face looking out the window for something to focus on.  But the front had begun to clear the clouds away and as we gained altitude, it plane smoothed off.   After the plane had leveled off, I was looking out the window (right side of the plane) facing eastward.  I was enjoying the lights of the towns below and to the distance wishing I had not packed away the video camera so that I could show my son what it looks like from above.  I could see the tiny lights from the light poles along the roads and suddenly I noticed a light off in the distance that was down and in front of the plane.   My first thought was that it was from an airport tower because it had flashed to white as if it was turned on.  I wandered if I could see a plane take off.  But it went from a dim white light to a very-bright white light. Then all of a sudden, the light changed from white to bright red about the time the plane approached it, and it was then that I remembered that airport towers do not have red beacons.   Although this was away from the plane, (it appeared to be about a mile or so) when we were almost side-by-side (figuratively) it accelerated from what appeared to be a standstill and quickly outran us as if WE were standing still.  Unfortunately, I couldn't see it anymore because of the thickness of the windows on the plane, but it as it left, it was angled upwards at a slight angle about 15-20 degrees.   Other than family and one friend at work, I haven't spoken of this until now.  I was wondering if maybe you might have a report on or about this date in February 1995, the actual location is unknown. But I do know that we stayed on the West Side of DFW all throughout the flight.  As we approached the area of Dallas/Ft. Worth, our plane turned and headed east for about 8 - 10 minutes or so, then turned left in order to land from the south.   I've looked at the map of the area several times trying to remember the details.  After we took off, I could see Austin, TX in the distance to the East.  Then Killeen (still east of the plane, but much closer) and Waco off in the distance more North East of my location when I spotted the light. The size of the light?  I'm not exactly sure.  But the light itself was circular in shape. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2005-05-24T00:00:00,31.7126,-98.2143

It was difficult to determine the distance but my guess was approx. a mile away.  I knew that there were not airports or air traffic around that area (it's in the middle of nowhere), and besides that, this object was too low and moving too slowly to be any type of high flying commercial aircraft.   This may sound rather incredible, but I picked up my flashlight that I had sitting next to my chair and on a whim, shined it at it.  To our dismay, the object darted vertically downward and fast, stopped on a dime and continued its same slow left to right direction, apparently reacting to the light I had shined in its direction.  There was no sound associated with this object and it's speed ruled out anything such as a helicopter.   We both looked at each other, and I had to ask her.. ""did you just see THAT?!""

I was traveling north on the 55 freeway. Early summer, warm, not a cloud in the sky. I first noticed a shadow move past me, moving North. I expected to look up and see an airliner as I'm not that far from John Wayne Airport.  Shading my eyes from the sun (which naturally would have caused the shadow) I saw nothing North of the sun. I looked back to the freeway and continued to see the shadow moving up the freeway. Again I looked at the clear sky and saw nothing so I looked back at the freeway. It was still there and still moving Nrth.  But this time I noticed the shadow was circular/oval and huge. The freeway moves pretty much due North. The shadow was moving in a North/NorthEast direction and I noticed that the edges of the shadow were overlapping both side of the freeway. That meant that it was wider than eight lanes and a center divider of the freeway.  Being in the printing industry, I know something about screen density and know enough about shadow to know the closer the ground is to the subject, the more dense the shadow. I would say the shadow was what would be called in the printing industry an 80% screen which means it was at a fairly low altitude. At that time, at the point on the freeway, the traffic was moving at approximately seventy and I would the shadow was doing a hundred and thirty to a hundred and fifty.  Also, I detected no noise but I was driving the freeway. Anyway, the shadow continued in a straight line until it disappeared over my horizon.

I was very familiar with this road becuase it was a very beautiful place to walk/run as I would often jog on that road for exercise.  We pulled over into the driveway of the farm house.  We pulled over because there was anohter man who had seen the light and pulled over also. We got out of the car.  At that time there was only one light and it was floating toward us.  It came over a bunch of pine trees and across a field directly toward me and my roomate.  He got scared as it got to about 40 yards from us.  He begged for me to get in the car but I couldn't move.  I wasn't scared.  I was amazed.  He got back into his car.  The light came toward me and the stranger that had pulled over.  It was getting closer and closer.  It was a large, warm glowing light.  It was beautiful.  I felt no danger.  It's weird to say this but I felt very safe, almost like I was being comforted a bit somehow.  It sounds stupid but it's true.  Well, as the light got closer, now it was about 20 yards away, a car came down the road from our right and the way the road bends the cars headlights blinded me and the stranger.  When the car passed us the light was gone and that's how the entire incident ended.  The stranger jumped in his car and took off.  My roomate was yelling at me at that point to get in the car.  We went back to our apartment and called all our frineds.  They didn't believe us becasue it was April fools day.  I called 911 and told them what I saw. Well, the next day in class I drew a picture of the formation of lights for one of my frineds.  One month later that friend called me and told me to turn on the tv.  In May of 1996 there was a similar sighting in Arizona and it was on videotape.  My friend was freaked out becuase of my drawing and how much it looked like the UFO over Arizona.   We wereI was apparently not the only person in Harrisburg to see that UFO that night as it made the local news.  They discounted it as a flare from an f-16 which is used as a decoy from heat seaking missles.  I found it interesting when the Arizona UFO was discounted they same way, saying it was a flare.  If the government has a flare that can float and hover and light up for over an hour then fine.  That's what I saw.  However, the flare that they showed on the news that the f-16's drop fall to the ground like a brick.  That's not what we saw.  I'd love to talk to the girls that saw the similar UFO on 9/18/02.  I think we saw the same thing.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,40.307082581453635,-76.8305888471178

At first I thought it was a meteor or something like that until I heard reports of such sitings. The object was big and roundish and it looked black but was covered by, what looked like, flames as it was quite bright and filled the sky with an orange tint and was leaving an orange trail. Some people around were looking but most people did not see this as their were busy driving or what not, but there was many looking. But I thought it was quite strange how some people did not even see this huge fireball object. We followed the object as far as we could then it kind of went behind a builing and dissapeared. That's when I thought it was a meteor as I believed it had hit into the river,but there was no reports of anything in the sky or crashing down.

After watching a program on tv tonight I was compelled to tell my story. I never knew who to report what I had witnessed to - until now.  While driving on a secondary road with a friend we both noticed a bright light in the sky - at about the same instant we both commented that that ""plane"" had not moved.  My friend had binoculars in the car so I retrieved them to look at the light and was shocked at what I saw. It was a huge round jet blacl object with huge lights similar to traffic lights in that they had a sort of roof over each light. There were many lights but only two were on. I could see a sort of fog swirling around the light. I remember saying ""Oh my God - pull over."" All I could say was ""Oh my God, Oh my God"".  My friend pulled the car off the road and I was now looking at it through the passenger window. When I took the binoculars from my eyes all I could see was the light but with the binoculars the entire object was visible. It was silent and huge.  Of course I could not tell how close to me it was but it appeared bigger than a football field as it blackened out the whole sky.  When I turned away for a moment and then looked again the lights that were facing me were off and the lights on the back of the object were now on and looking in the opposite direction. By the time I handed the binoculars to my friend the object was gone.  I did contact the Pittsburgh newspaper and the Air National Guard and they just politely thanked me and told me nobody else had reported a sighting. I will never forget it.

We looked up and saw a very large black object in sky heading east. It flew over us and over the house at a slow rate of speed.  It was a triangle like shape and appeared to be black but it was hard to tell because it was night but with alot of light pollution. As it got directly above us we saw ""lights"" that were inverted V in shape and a greeish yellow color.  Both of us thought at the time and still do that we saw a stealth bomber flying at night in a heavily populated area at a low altitude and slow speed. We had both seen stealth bombers at air shows and were convinced that this is what the craft was.  We listened to the News to see if there was such a craft in the area but there was no mention.  We looked at the newspaper but no mention.  I asked people at work the next day if they had seen or heard anything but no one had.  I even mentioned the incident to my boss who lives in Phoenix.  We do not remember the date that this happened because we were completely convinced this was a stealth fly over.  We did think it odd that such a craft would be flying at night at such a low altitude and slow speed over a heavily populated area near a busy airport (FLL.)

The turn was not a sharp right angle turn, but a tight arc with a radius of approximately 8 - 10 inches, at arms length.  I have a degree in electronics, have worked for defense contractors and have studied air craft and space craft extensively, and to my knowledge, this type of a maneuver in orbit is currently beyond our capability. The craft did not slow down while making the turn, and the amount of rocket fuel required to make such a turn at 17,500 mph and maintain a stable orbit, would be beyond the ammount carried by current satellites.  Currently, we move satellites over the course of several orbits. The space shuttle is not even capable of such a maneuver.

My friend and I watched a flying object for several hours and witnessed its presence as long as five hours after initial sighting.  The object made no sound that we could hear.  We were at the top of a small mountain with a continuous, nonchanging rise to the area on the other mountain where the object was.  In other words, we were in a bowl shape that would have channeled sound very well.  The object was in the sky and about half way from the bottom of the mountains to the top.  The bottom of the mountain where the object was is also the bottom of the mountain that we were on.  It repeatedly flew in a ""T"" shape.  It would fly straight back and forth for at least 10-15 minutes and then drop at a perfect right angle down into the bottom of the ""T"" shape.  It would then resume the back and forth movement after coming back up to the plane it was moving in horizontally.  The object had a light that could best be described as an amber light resembling a street light in color.  The intensity of the light decreased significantly as you look away from the center.  The light appeared like a round ball of evenly dissipating light.  The light stayed one intensity, but would increase approximately 10 seconds before the object descended into the bottom of its ""T"" movement.  There would occasionally be a red light that seemed to be attached to a lever that was  connected to the object in the middle.  The lever would look stowed into the vehicle and normally not be visible, as there was no red light visible.  As the object came up out of the ""T"" pattern, the lever with a red light at the end would sweep 180 degrees, from horizontal at the rear of the vehicle to horizontal at the front, and disappear.  The red light appeared to swing down from out of the craft, swing in a half circle and disappear up into the front.  The angle at which the object descended in its ""T"" movement pattern was a right angle, not an arcing angle like a helicopter or balloon would follow.  Also, the amber light was bright enough to see over the forest on the mountain.  We could barely see shadows in the trees(I have 20-20 vision) moving as the object moved above the woods.  It resembled what one would see from 2 miles if a military flare to expose enemies was released, but a dark amber in color, just bright enough to see the tree shadows moving if you look slighty to one side of area being lighted up.  The light was not bright enough to easily see in the woods by looking straight at them even though our eyes were adjusted to a very dark sky.  The object never left the one spot where it was first seen.  The ""T"" shape that it moved in appeared to be approximately 100 yards or less in length across the top, and about the same distance down the vertical leg of the ""T"" shape.  It appeared to be maybe 200 yards above the forest on one end of the horizontal, and about 150 yards above towards the front.  I fell asleep and did not see the object depart unfortunately.  The ""T"" shape would be perpendicular to the mountain, meaning, as you look straight to the top of the mountain, that the object approached and then moved away, as opposed to moving back and forth relative to the top of the mountain.  I am an electrical engineer and am quite certain by the angles at which this object moved that it could not be hovering by manipulating air.  Also, I know of no aircraft that can silently move at impossibly right angles for over five hours without refueling.  Plus, this mountain is all a National Wilderness Area with no military activity that I have ever heard about.  The nearest military base is the Navajo arms depot about 20 miles away, west of Flagstaff.  I believe that everything approaches infinite mass when approaching the speed of light and that living beings cannot live long enough to travel the distances necessary at the available speeds to reach other planets.  Therefore, I am truly perplexed by this event.  I really hope this information helps us learn more.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,35.2633131147541,-111.52902404371584

The young man is from Seattle.  He provided a really good drawing of what he observed with a ""halo"" around the object.  Incredibally, this object is very similar to the object I reported seeing on your web site from Bowling Green, Kentucky, back on July 24, 2001.   Shockingly, the drawing is what took me back to remember that strange night.  Yes, this object he saw is very much like the object we saw that dark night through a pair of binoculars.   Our object too had a ""halo"" around it, and it was somewhat diamond/kite shaped.  This object we saw had a purple color to it, and it also glowed really bright in the sky.  It did appear as a really bright fireball until we used the binoculars to get a closer look.  All three of us witnesses saw the same thing.   What these things are I don't know.  But I do know that they are REAL, and still being observed in the skies of Warren/Simpson Counties here in Kentucky even today.  Friends of mine have seen them.  They look like large fireballs which move around at times.  Smaller bright objects also have been observed flying close to these larger fireball ones too.   This story is no lie.  It is the truth, and I propose that the Seattle man is telling us the truth about his sighting too. Thank You!

I was ten years old, ridding in the front seat of our car next to the passanger door.  My mother was in the center front and Dad was driving north on old highway 75 neaar Conroe Tx. headed home to Corsicana, Tx. My clear memory is aided by the many times I heard both parents relate the story to others who voiced simular experiences.  As we traveled up a slight hill with a curve at the top to the right, traveling approximately 60mph, a semi-circle of five or six bright white lights came over the hill following the road, straight at but above our car at what appeared to be less than 100ft. in the air.  There was no sound but our engine.  Immediately in front of our car the object [or objects in formation] made an abrubt, right angle turn to the right, our left, toward the west and quickly disappeared over a row of trees about 200ft. off the highway.  After a moment of stunned silence, my Dad said, ""Did you see that damn thing?"", to which both my mother and I responded, ""Yes, what was it?""  None of us had a clue.  Desperate for a solution, Mother said, ""Maybe it was our car lights on highwires"".  Dad quickly pointed out that there were none.  Even more desperately she said, ""Maybe it was birds"". ""With bright lights tied on?"", responded Dad.  ""Well, she searched, ""Maybe they got into flourescent paint""?"".  Frustrated, Dad bluntly said ""No.  That was some kind of object or several objects doing something I have never seen before"". Only later that year, with the ""flying saucer"" flap, did we realize what we had witnessed.  The object was real, it made a manuver impossible for any then [or now] known aircraft, made no noise, and, importantly, we were not ""programed"" for such an experience.  I could add much more about another highly anomolous light performace I observed with one other unknown witness in the mid 1950's. There are many credible, first hand observations related to me, such as one by an ex-fighter pilot, a geologist, scrambled out of Japan to pursue a clearly visable fire orange craft that played can and mouse with him until altitude forced him to turn back [it was his frightening debriefing that was the real story], a private pilot for and oil company CEO viewing a spinning ""top-shaped object"" in day light over West Texas, a very conservative Episcopal priest with a daytime viewing of a  circular craft near and slow enough to observe windows along the side, and many other clear, detailed, objective sightings that, like mine, have never been reported.

It was a clear, summer’s evening in 1947 (or 1948.  I can’t be sure of the exact year).  The sun had just set over the foothills of the Cascades north of Leavenworth.  My childhood friend and I were playing in a vacant lot next to my house in the small town of Cashmere, WA. which is nestled in the Wenatchee River valley.  We were both starring off into the clear western sky when, in the southwest, we both saw four circular (like dots) light green objects moving toward the west in a diamond formation above the top of the foothills southwest of town.  It was hard to judge their actual distance and speed, but they were moving quite slowly.  We watched them move slowly west for less than one minute; and then, one at a time, each object went from a lumbering speed to streaking away at a fantastic speed (i.e., we saw each leave a short green streak and it was gone in an instant).  This event would be analogous to the Starship Enterprise jumping to light speed, leaving the momentary streak of light (cf. Star Trek movies).   After they were gone, my friend and I ran to tell my parents what we had seen.  My Mom said, ‘Well, tomorrow go down to the local newspaper office and given them your report’.  We did just that the next day, but they were not interested. While my friend and I now live in different states, we still recall/discuss this ‘sighting’ whenever we see each other.  Like so many others who have witnessed a UFO event, they often say, ‘whether or not people believe UFOs exist, I know what I saw’.  We know what we saw in the sky on that summer evening years ago, but we don’t know what they were.  I think it is fair to say that no earth-based ‘flying machine’ at that point in time could have possibly behaved as these four objects did.  When they streaked away out of sight, it was almost like they simply departed from our ‘optical window’ and immediately entered a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that our visual mechanism cannot perceive. I have never communicated the foregoing to anyone, except my own family; and for the record I have been a science professor at the university level for the past 34 years.

I was Sergeant of the Guard at Fort Sill. Bud Glade was on guard and reported that he saw a number of objects that would move rapidly in one direction and then shoot off at an angle in another direction. This was in the spring of 1951 as I remember. Bud was wounded in Korea but he should be living in SLC. I saw him a number of times after the war.  Anyway, I've heard of this flight behavior before. It was common in that day. Can you tell me what it was? It could have been military flights flying in formation.  I have another question you might answer. In Korea in the fall of 1951 the sky looked as blue as possible with possibly faint clouds. What we saw were wave forms exactly like those when you toss a rock into a pool of water. It looked to me that the waves formed far north. I thought that maybe there was a nuclear test in the USSR that send out the wave forms. Can you explain this atmospheric behavior?  I've never seen a UFO but my dad said that he saw one of the cigar shaped critters over Zion’s or Brice Canyon back in the 50s.  I saw part of the latest network TV show on UFOs. I also was watching the History Channel tonight with the Chinese stuff. I'm not a member of the ""Church of the UFO"" but I do enjoy listening to what others say. The problem in my opinion is that there are too many nuts and too little hard evidence or plausible explanations. But UFOs are fun and some people make their living that way.  I heard that ""Nuclear Scientist"" speak at ISU in the 1960s. I've forgotten his name, but he was making a buck touring around. He was not very convincing but he was fun to listen too. Besides, ISU was paying his fees and it was free to me. His stuff didn't impress me at all at that time, but he has gathered more since.  I remember in the 1950s that a ""UFO"" went flashing over the SLC Airport. I could see that it was an airliner after studying the thing. I also knew that there would be many UFO reports. There were! I called the newspaper and told them that it was an airliner. They did not retract their story even though they told me a zillion people had corrected them. So the story is still in there for anyone to read in the library with no retraction. So it became part of ""UFOalogy"" or whatever it is now called.  Anyway, I do hope you are having a great time with your stuff. Are there UFOs? Of course there are. They are flying objects not identified. Nothing more until someone comes up with credible hard evidence and shows it to the world.  I'm sure that any aliens would run like scared rabbits if they came within our radio traffic (and could understand us) or if they picked up our nuclear explosions. I wouldn't expect any hint of them after 1945! What really scares me is that we could someday send our species out to ruin the rest of the universe. Fortunately, the earth has a cycle of mass extinctions that might protect other worlds form our influence. We can always hope! But what will protect us from theirs? I'm betting on pneumonia.

It was a life changing experience and I entered The University of Michigan as an astronomy major in 1958 as a direct result of fascination based on this event. It occurred at 9 pm as I was leaving the Binghamton Girls Club, at that time located at the intersection of Frederick and Liberty streets in Binghamton, NY.  We were all dismissed at 9pm so the front yard was full of girls age 9-16, about 45-60 in number, heading for home.  The date was approximate- but the moon was a crescent descending in the west. The object appeared in the southeast sky, looking like a shark's fin, or like a crescent moon cut in half by a cloud, but the sky was black, clear and cloudless.  I was fascinated by the night sky and the beautiful stars even then, so I was constantly looking up at them.  I may have been the first to notice this thing.  As I looked at it, it was self illuminated- sort of a harvest moon orange color- no lights visable.  It did the most incredible thing. As it drew closer and enlarged in size it flipped or sort of rolled over, I saw this whole thing very clearly, when it sort of turned over or revolved horizontally it appeared as a disk and approached us very quickly and stopped in the sky about 45 degrees up from the south horizon.  There was no sound at all, but the machine appeared solid, and had a series of windows (?) or port holes (?) around the middle.  I had the distinct feeling that we were being observed or scanned or something.  It was a very oppressive feeling I had never experienced before.  When someone yelled ""it's a flying saucer"" it started a stampede back into the Girl's Club door, if you can imagine a large number of teen-age girls all trying to get back into a small door all at once.  We yelled at the 2 women directors that a flying saucer was outside, they reluctantly and (too) slowly went outside.  By this time the machine had moved to the southeast and was much smaller in size, it quickly moved away in an apparent straight line becoming quickly smaller to an orange ""point"" and disappeared as it speeded away.  "" It's the moon "" said our director, but I said ""no"" and showed her the crescent moon setting in the west.  I checked the local paper next day but couldn't find report, but being very young maybe I didn't follow up on any reports.   The thing looked most like an orange football or blimp shape with those portholes around the middle, but I know it was no blimp as they make a noise and cannot approach or speed away like this thing did.

It was as though the blue sky open to let this object in.

I have pictures On Sunday October 2, 2005, I was standing by the window of my 15th floor apartment in New York, when I saw a ver strange object coming from the east (Queens), flying at relatively low altitude.  I live in a high rise on the East side of Manhattan by the river, and I have unobstructed view of the city, including La Guardia airport nearby and JFK farther in the distance, so I normally see all kinds of aircraft flying around, but this object caught my attention because of its odd appearance.  It was a dark, almost black, very big object that flew very smoothly without making any noise.  Its shape was extremely unusual, very difficult to describe, but it was not aerodynamic at all.  The only thing I can compare it with is a modern sculpture.  It was definitely not an airplane, a helicopter or a blimp.  But it didn't even closely resembled either the image that, at least mentally, we all have of UFOs.  It was not a bright-silver flying saucer, did not emit any lights and did not fly at great speed.  It came very close to my building and then veered north and disappeared in the distance.  I had it in front of my eyes for at least 3 minutes.  It was such as strange sighting that I even thought it might be a hallucination.  Amid my disconcert, I was able to grab my camera and take two pictures which, to my surprise, came out as sharp and crisp as my memory.  I want to point out that it was a beautiful early-fall day, there was still plenty of sunlight, the sky was clear and lots of New Yorkers were outside.  I could see many people walking the promenade along the East river so they all had to have seen this object.  It was impossible to miss it.  And, still, no newspaper or TV news made any mention of it.  I have shown the pictures to all my relatives, friends, co-workers, neighbors, acquaintances, etc. and they all look at them in disbelief.  So far, nobody seems to have a plausible explanation for this phenomenon and even the most skeptic ones (I consider myself one of them) admit it's very strange and suspicious.

It was diamond-shaped with the tallest points verticle. It was very bright and clear, possibly lit from the moon's glow. This was night time. Through the center was a green belt. The entire surface was faceted, as though it was made up of millions of tiny crystals, including the belt.

I stood in disbelief at what I was seeing and decided to call 911 on my cell phone to report what I was witnessing.  The first object moved slighly back and forth leaving straight lines behind it.  I felt that they knew I was watching them.   While I was on the phone with them, all 3 objects simultaneously moved behind clounds.

A very quiet and still night, no traffic. Listening to my walkman, I turned my head to the right to the overlooking valley during a clearing in the trees facing south towards NYC. I Immediately notice a thick orange-colored ball of light heading north in my direction; seemed like a low-flying plane still a few minutes away. I thought I heard a young male voice shouting under his breath: ""Hey!"". The way somebody might say ""boo!"". It was definitely not from my walkman which set to AM, but from inside my head like FM-style of broken audio interference. Ignored it and kept walking further (west), until the next available view over the valley twenty seconds or less from there.  So I look to find the orange light already passing over the street, behind me, where I just walked. Something didn't feel right, so I stood watching it; still flying north at reasonable speed. Then, the craft seemed to slow down as it was perpendicular to me, and then sped up to do an incomplete U-turn and stopped dead in one spot. At this point it is 40 degrees up in the sky or so, and I'm curious. There was no sound.  The craft then moved diagonally down-right in the sky to a lower point, but seemed closer at the same time. The orange color was gone, and it was dark and blinking a white light and a red light. Blinking white, white, red, could not detect any pattern to the flashes. Now I was getting very very nervous and started to take a few steps backward further up the hill in the direction I was originally going. Then jogged a few more paces and turned right onto a side street and waited behind a house which covered that part of the sky completely.  It swung to the right of the house, (west). It was definitely under one thousand feet up, and seemed small. Only could make out the flickering red and white lights, and a reddish glow that would brighten and darken as it moved. The lights seemed higher up on it, and the glow was on the bottom part of it. Watched it for 15 seconds or so, and became scared beyond belief and made a run for it, looked behind a few times and it was pursuing, swinging wildly left and right to keep a view of me. I turn another two corners in my run and stopped to get my bearings. It was nowhere in the sky to be seen.  Feeling jittery and worried for my safety, I walked for a good 20 minutes. Constantly checking the sky, listening to the radio and trying to calm down. Finally returned home, and sat down to relax calm myself. Probably was in shock, but was fine in a few hours.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,40.94350311850312,-73.87235613305614

Me and my ma were coming to our motel from our house...and we were on the road to the motel when I saw 3 huge red lights that were kind of curved (suggesting where they were coming from was a disc shape) really close to a car wash building.  It was wayyy too close to be a plane and plus planes have blue lights...and then I said Ma whats that?  And shes like where?  And I said those lights, over there… Somehow I knew it wasn't a plane and not a sign or anything, I just kinda knew it was a UFO.  Then the 2 outermost red lights disappeared and the middle one remained.   So I tell my mom to park our car in the parking lot already so I can get out and look..I was about to get out and was looking at the reamining middle light thru the window when it kind of just disappeared suddenly. It was almst exactly 10:00 PM.  2nd sighting, the next night: (also 10:00PM)  Same place and time.  They looked pretty much the same except I think a bit smaller and some of the lights looked like they were falling?  This time when they disappeared, I belive it was more random.  3rd sighting, the next night: Same place, different time. It was 10:30-ish.  We were pulling up and there they were.  You see them from a distance, but when you get closer, you cant see them anymore, but they dont vanish because we pulled around the highway and drove back down the road to look at them again and they were still visible from a distance.  This time there was about 4 lights I'd say, and they were higher up (so their smaller) and still red.  When you get closer, the outermost lights disappear first and then the middle ones.  I'm pretty sure its a UFO now because I saw it very clearly last night and I have no idea what it coulda been; def not a sign because its the same lights but like 10x higher up than the first time I saw them.

There are no large antennas or anything like that in the area.  I have never seen this before nor since that night.

I'm a bit foggy on the precice time and date , but it was a chilly evening , at leist durning this encounter.  Temp. was around 40 deg. My father was outside getting ready to start unloading his van , when he came in and asked us if we wanted to see a UFO . As soon as he pointed in the direction that he had see it we rushed out onto the deck , me just expecting to see some strange lights , as we had seen on two other encounters, looked straight up over head where dad was pointing. I was awe struck to see three triangular shaped crafts just barely visible in the night sky, seeming to just be giving off a glowing reflection and a slight silloet. one of the ships had a amber light and they were headed north at an speed of 60-80 mph perhaps a little slower. I could make out some detail of the under side of the vessele as i strained to take in as much of this spectical as possible just faintly seeing possible panles and contures in its structure. As they headed to the north and i was assuming that that was it they reached the hilltop 1/2 mile to the north of us and to our amazement made a 180 degree turn and headed right back over us for a second look. At that moment Im thinking can we hitch a ride . Well knowing that a photo wouldnt develope well under such low lighting we all just stood and looked on as they proceded over and continued heading south and out of sight over the dark horizon. All the time I qas watching I was listening for the slightes sound and all i could make out on that calm cool night was a faint whir like wind or air passing over the crafts smooth surface. When the crafts were at the hill crest I could estamate their altitude at around 500 - 900 ft. , and then on their second pass I figure that they were around 100 ft in length and 75 ft in width and perhaps 25 - 40 % larger . My girl friend At the time who always looked at me strange when I would mention some of the questionable sightings I had in the past was speachless and never mentioned this to any one that I know of , and this is the first public mention that I or any of my family has made of this outside of a few close friends and relitives. After looking through some of the reports and finding a few that could be in the same time frame and had very close discriptions as to what we saw I thought I would let them know their not seeing things , well yes they did see something ... Im sure that after I post this som other details will come to mind but their was soo much to take in in those few short minutes that seemed to go in slow motion.

"That's no meteor, or satellite, or ANYTHING I've ever witnessed! =)",Lousville,KY,1988-07-22T10:45:00,light,6 seconds,"Occurred : 7/22/1988 10:45  (Entered as : 07/22/1988 10:45) Reported: 2/25/2005 2:12:53 PM 14:12 Posted: 5/11/2005 Location: Lousville, KY Shape: Light Duration:6 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42400.html,"That's no meteor, or satellite, or ANYTHING I've ever witnessed! =) I apologize for the unclear date of the event.  That is my best guess due to the fact that the reason my mother and I were looking skyward that evening was due to the fact that a newly found comet was supposed to be in the vacinity of Earth and observable with the naked eye. (the year could have been 07/22/86) I can imagine based upon what we saw that NUMEROUS other witnesses are available to report this one.  So here are the details. On the 5:pm news Channel 32, the ABC affiliate at the time in Louisville Ky., reported that a new comet would be passing within eyeshot of the earth later that evening within a specific constellation which I cannot recall.  I have been a amateur astronomer since I was in 4th grade and possess a number of telescopes.  I became excited about the comet news and later that evening forced my mother and sister to join me up on our second floor roof deck with a clear view of most of the mid-west sky.  After locating the constellation, possibly Orion, which was directly overhead, after looking for several minutes I was dissappointed in NOT being able to see any comet at all.  This was bizarre to me as the newscast was very specific and I thought my knowledge of the sky was reasonably good.  My sister quickly lost interest and was looking down at her feet (something she regrets to this day) when the following occurred...in precisely the spot in the constellation where we believed the comet would be visible, my mother and I saw a spectacular METEOR whiz directly through the spot where the comet was supposed to be.  I immediately reacted with a shout of excitement ""DID you SEE THAT!"" just as mom reacted with ""WOW!""  I have seen literally over 500 meteors in my lifetime and what happened next defies all knowledge of meteor behavior...  The moment the meteor's bright white light dissipated, I assumed it was just pure luck that we happened to see it instead of a much slower if not stationary comet within the same region.  But as this though instantly crossed my mind. a second meteor appeared with the same intensity and duration only this time it was exactly on line with the first meteor but farther toward the horizon...in the direction of Downtown Louisville about 9-miles to the West.  My mother also saw this second one.  The second burned out immediately and then a THIRD meteor made its appearrance also on the same line as the first two!  It then burned out and yet a FOURTH meteor followed on the same line now nearly at the sky's west horizon.  This was an absolutely silent event which lasted roughtly 6-seconds.   When it was over I was speechless, as was my mom...but I mamaged a ""...did you see that?"" her response ""yes."" and THEN I  went NUTS with excitement!  It was clearly not a meteor as meteors do not switch on and off, and the on's and off's were in equal lengths/times.  Judging by the speed and duration of the event, the object had to be moving a AMAZING SPEED to go from a point directly overhead to the west horizon in only 6-seconds at that altitude.  And finally, I have seen satellites, and the shuttle, orbiting the earth in the past...and they were practically stationary compared to this thing.  I realize that we are talking about an event over a decade ago, but perhaps this description corroborated other reports you may have received.  If you care to discuss this further call me at 310-((number and name deleted)) =) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))",2005-05-11T00:00:00,,

No one really believed it.  He kept talking about it for several days, and finally I asked him to show me. He did! It was about 5ft across, and 2.5 feet high. Very irregular. It looked like a large mound of preserved animal remains. It had no bones. No birds, no bugs, worms or maggots were in/on it. It didn't smell either. I could see the pattern of veins in the membrane. I  poked it with a stick, and it was tough and leathery. It was also pale greyish-white in color. At the time I had no ideas about it, and I sort of forgot about it. Later I read two books, one about UFO sightings in the same area...and another about secret govm't experiments with anti-gravity. It seems that this is the effect that this technology has on living tissue. The authors of the books desribed things almost identical.  Within a year or two of my experience, another friend said he saw a UFO (black triangle) about 1 mile from this location, still other friends reported seeing strange animals in the woods.

The lights were changing color and I assumed it was the twinkling of a star.  I was pointing it out to a friend I was giving a ride.  He followed the light and pointed at its direction.   While stopped at a traffic light I looked over and a small orb of light raced from about the top of the tree line across the sky parallel to the ground.  Its speed was far greater than a plane or helicopter and it's size was quite small.  It moved faster than even a firework and left no trail.  The ball of light looked similar to video of ball lightning that I have seen but no clouds were present and it was really right at the top of the tree line.  It's movement was similar to that of a shooting star but it was so close to the ground and it's trajectory was completely unlike any of the many meteors i have observed.  The main light I had been watching continued to change colors around a main white but UNUSUALLY bright light.  I have observed in my area and around in other research I have attempted that these unusual lights appear in alignment with existing heveanly bodies, but they look quite different than the bodies they are alligned with.  Meaning that you notice a light that does not look like a star and displays properties that are quite different than a star, Venus or Mars but occur in identical places.  The regular bodies can be seen later in the position of the unusual object, light, or occurance, but appear to have little in common with the occurance.

First off, I dont know if/think this was an 'alien' ship - but I couldnt figure out WHAT it was, even using binoculars. So I am interested in knowing if anyone else reported seeing anything at the same time/night or if you know of any monitoring equipment that was flying around over NH that night.  I took my dog outside at around 1:30 am and was sitting on my porch and noticed a relatively large, bright light in the sky. I started staring at it and then noticed that it was moving around randomly in the sky almost like it was being blown by a light wind or something. It was visable above the treeline and looked like an extremely large/bright star, but then I noticed the strange movement. I used binoculars and did not see it much more clearly so I imagine it was quite high in the sky, but realized it definitely had lights on it of some sort - and they were bright enough that it was throwing light around it like a halo. From MY PERSPECTIVE, way away from it, when moving it was only covering a patch of sky about 3 inches X 2 inches. It kept moving around in that general area. I also noticed a few times that a short distance from it there were flashing lights, coming off from about 2:00 and 9:00 and 5:00 if the object was in the middle of a clock-face. I then noticed a second one to the right but farther away as the light was much smaller and dimmer, but I could still see it was moving around also. I thought maybe it was a satellite, but then realized that the movement was not right and it was not tracking across the sky on any sort of trajectory. I also thought maybe it was a weather monitoring device, but didnt understand why it was covered in lights... I studied it with binoculars for about 1/2 hr and couldnt get any clearer picture of it. I looked for it in the morning but could not see anything in the sky so imagine it was either gone or far enough up to not be visible by day.

No audible evidence of the explosion ever presented itself.  A friend of mine saw the same event while out jogging in Vicksburg, MS. He said it looked like it was heading almost straight down from his perspective 50mi away from Florence. As for viewing angle, he said it appeared to be approximately E @ a 45deg up from the horizon. From my perspective in Florence, it was headed SE on a slow trajectory and lasted approximately 10sec. My viewing angle put it approximately WSW @ 80deg up from the horizon.  In addition, what looked like a shooting star traveling SW at high speed intersected where the burning object would have been if it hadn't exploded a fraction of a second earlier.

The parallel lines were approximately 1/2 degree apart. I guess you could say the flight path was zig-zagging as if to dodge something in it's path. We were unable to determine the lights altitude. If it were in low earth orbit it would have been moving about twice the speed of the ISS. It took 15 seconds to cover half the sky.

Me and my friend were coming back from High school on a bus from the town of spilsby when only a few miles from my house in New Leake We observed a Small Black Triangle Craft. It was moving very quickly all over the sky, interesting before each rapid burst of speed it seemed to emit a greenish heatwave/shockwave of some sort. It constantly moved forwards then backwards so fast we lost track of it several times, but each time appearing in another part of the sky in the same direction.  It seemed to be following our bus from a distance i am not sure, At one point it swooped down to tree level and back into the air.  It was travelling in a southernly direction. I have no idea what it was or why it was showing off and flying like it was. either it was trying to get noticed, the pilot was crazy or it was a probe of some sort. This triangle was not giant like the one most people describe i cannot recall seeing any lights but this was in the day time between 3:50 to 4:10pm. I only remember the time as that is the time i normally use to get home, My friend is also a whitness.There is no mistaking this was a triangular spacecraft of some sort as it was there for 10 whole minutes and doing manuvers so fast it was definately no plane, unless planes can travel warp speed,all this in broad Day Light On a clear hot sunny day means there was no mistakeing what so ever of what it was.  My older brother and his friend also saw a black triangle at quite close range fly over them coming home from soccer one evening in the early 90'S. They saw this in the east coast Lincolnshire town of Sutton on Sea not too far from Mablethorpe. This object flew in a easterly direction towards Belgium. It had 3 lights on it all yellowy,orange i assumed like the belgium ufo. However my brother has resently told me he only remembers 2 of the lights colours which were green and red. one in each corner and this sighting was at nighttime. Interestingly this object was reported all over the news in belgium the same week so that can narrow down the date better. Thanks for listening :) My email is GangstardannyBoy@hotmail.com if you have can shed any more light on these sightings and ufos similar to them or help me see if anyone else whitnessed green shockwaves coming from these triangles before sudden bursts of speed id like to hear from you.

I had gone out on the terace and opened my first beer,and it was nice and warm out because it was in the middle of the summer.It was a really nice day, and not a cloud in the sky.eventually after being out there for about 5 to 10 minutes i notices something kinda hovering out over the water.It was moving from north to south really slow,and at first i didnt give it much thought because initially i thought it was a hang glider.I was talking to someone and i kept looking over at the object, and eventually it just stoped and hovered. So i started to ask others at the party what the hell is that.the owner of the place actually brought out some binoculars and we got a really good look at this thing.   It was actually to big to be a hang glider, and the only reason i thought thats what it was at the begining was because it was boomerang shaped.It had a very shiney metalic almost chrome look to it,and while it was hovering in the same spot it was fliping from front to back, and from side to side.While this was happening i was looking at it through the binaculars, and in the middle of the craft the metal was warping and changeing shapes.There were geometrical patterns forming and creases in the metal itself and they were changing.Imagine how the cuts on a daimond looks and while you are looking at them they are shifting and makeing new side apear.Thats what it was like.  My freinds and I then watched this craft rise slowly out of the atmosphere, or at least straight up till it disapeared, and the whole time it kept fliping and turning from one side to another while warping its own configuration.I would really say that there were about 15 to 30 people there who all saw this happen, and i got to say its one of the strangest crafts ive ever seen.I grew up near numerouse military instilations and have been on many military bases,and have even been on a veriety of militaray airplains,ships,tanks.You name it ive seen it first hand, so im used to seeing all kinds of things like that but ive never seen anything like this.  Now im not claiming that this thing was something from another world or an alien craft or even a military craft.Frankly i dont know what kind of craft it was.What i do know, was that this had some type of intelegant behaivior about it,and i also know it wasnt a baloon or something simple like that.It was pretty complex what ever it was.I found it strange that the entire city didnt seem to see this craft,because it was pretty big and it was in the middle of broad daylight.I didnt hear anything about it in the news.I am not in touch with the people who saw this with me but if i need to get a hold of them to back up my story i could.Frankly i do not care weather people believe i saw something wierd or not,But just in case someone else saw this there will at least be one report on this incadent.I figured that i should report this since it actually happened, and people can take my word for what it is.Sorry i have no picture or video of the incedent,i never even thought to get a camera out the entire time.I was just to into looking at it, because i was facinated by it.  I would like to add that i do not do drugs nor am i an alcoholic,nor do i have any mental disabilities.  This all lasted for about 45 minutes.

The others looked up but did not want to believe me that this was a classic and very real ufo!  They tried to explain it away as a balloon or blimp of some kind, even though there was no gondola attached and the object moved purposefully in a very straight line.   The craft was approximately 500 to 1000 ft high and I'm estimating that it was about the size of a standard passenger bus.  It was metallic, shiny and reflected the sun on it's surface but it was a semi-dull shine, and not of mirror reflecting quality.   On the surface of the object were two lines that seperated it into 3 sections:  pointed nose section, middle and rear.  There were no other distinguising features on the object either; no windows or door apertures could be seen.   When the object passed us overhead we had a clear view of the back which was round, perfectly smooth and also featureless; no exhaust could be seen, No motor or propeller could be seen either and no sound at all - it was completely silent.

We were arranged ""slumber-party"" style, with me and a friend in my bed, and two others on the floor in sleeping bags.   My bedroom is on the second floor.  My back was towards the large window, facing the expansive lawn of my rural home.   Suddenly one of my friends started shrieking, ""what the....!!!!""  We all turned towards the window.  A pulsating, orangish-red light was shining into the window.  It wasn't exceedingly bright, however, it was exactly level with the second-story window.   I glanced back at my alarm clock for some reason, but there were no numerals displayed--the power was out.  The flashing light lasted for about 30 seconds.   We were screaming the whole time (as teenage girls do) so I'm not sure if any sound accompanied the light.  Unfortunately, as we were so frightened, we did not look out the window to locate the source of the light.   Finally, my father,  awoken from his sleep with our screaming, came to my bedroom.  We recounted the story.  He insisted it had something to do with the transformer that lies at the far edge of the lawn.  He went outside to investigate, and found nothing amiss with the transformer.   After this sighting, my friends and I experienced a few other similar sightings over the next few weeks, cultimating in a sighting (also late at night) where the lights appeared to be coming from the side of the house.  This time, they were so bright that a light that turns off at sunrise outside my house turned off.   Although we didn't see an object, I feel that these lights are so unexplanable, as to constitute a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

WOW... I wasn't a believer, but this changed my mind. First off, i know the gov't is reading this and hiding all the evidence, well u know what? Screw u top secret agents, this is a free country, i guess not then. Anyways, it was about 12 at night and my family and i were in the car (6 including me), and it was in the middle of nowhere except for a gas station and some restaurants. There were roughly 50 cars around or so, and nobody noticed or something, i noticed first that a light was just sitting there above a street light, not moving at all. we were about a football field away from it, and we were driving slower now to see it better. I am learning to get my pilot's license, so i know this isn't something ordinary. As we were driving closer to it, i opened the window and stuck my head out, and i guess they noticed me or something. because it started to move to it's side, left and right very slowly, and knowing planes... they can't do that. there were a lot of lights around it, that's all i could see, and due to how the lights were arraigned... it seemed like a street's stop sign cut in half. As we drove underneath it, i tried to see it, but when we looked back, it was gone. that lasted for about 8 mins or so. Then about 20 mins later, we came to our relative's house and just as we parked the car and got out, we saw the same thing again, but further away. I believe it was following us, it's lights were even brighter this time and it seemed to hypnotize us or something, because i would've thought about getting the video camera, but i don't remember thinking about anything....strange, and all i saw as i was looking underneath it was a bright red light... kind of like a beacon, and it seemed like glass or something under it. because i was able to see through it, there were lights from screens on the walls and shadows that just stood there, probably looking at us, don't remember looking at them directly, weird feeling at that time. As it came up to us, it was about 100 ft in the air or so, and was very slow above us and about 100+ ft in diameter. It made NO engine sounds except for a quiet hum and just the wind blowing, most likely from the engine or exhaust that is very efficient. Then as it was getting about 50 ft from us, it was going higher in the air and again... not much sound still and just then was i able to think of the camera and took a little video... but i can't find it, it's somewhere in the house and afraid the gov't might do something to me. then it started gaining some altitude and just turned off the lights or something and it seemed to stretch, because it was so fast, and that's when i finally heard a louder sound from it, could've been an antimatter engine, who knows? the gov't does. Also, i heard that there's an underground military base there at Moses Lake. I know, long story, but i wanted to get the details out, and i didn't revise this, so there's things that are prob. confusing.

I remember the exact date of this because it happened the day after the tragedy of September 11th, when all the planes were still grounded--well, I should say they were supposed to be grounded.  My wife had went two houses down to visit some of my relatives and I can see the house from my house.  We had been having a problem with some drug addicts that were living down the street breaking into peoples cars at night and since this was around 10pm, I didnt want her to walk up on them by herself so I was sitting outside waiting for her in case she ran into any trouble.  I am an amateur astronomer and as any of us can tell you, a ""no fly"" zone is a dream come true.  So I am outside with all my lights turned out and I am sitting at the end of my deck facing that house my wife went to thats maybe 300 yards away and I just happen to look up and sitting there over my head, maybe 3000 or 4000 feet up (hard to tell because it was night) was this light, just sitting there.  It was a good size, maybe 1/15 the visual size of the full moon.  No sound, no movement, just stillness, and like a small breeze blowing through the trees suddenly.  I could tell it wasnt a planet or star, it was definantly something in our atomosphere.  As I looked at it, the light drew up--like the way the cornea of you eye draws up when you walk from a dark room to the outside on a sunny day.  It was still barely there, you almost had to not look at it to see it, it was so dim.  Then the dim light took off towards the southeast at an AMAZING speed--it had to be going faster than the speed of sound, but there was no sonic boom.  I have never saw anything move like this. I dont know of any military craft that could go from a hovering position to the speed of sound OR MORE within a second.  I am wondering if anyone else saw this craft around that date.

It seemed like an object moving at a phenomenal rate of speed towards our general area. Probably far from us.  I observed it long enough to determine it's size and speed as being quite extraordinary. I looked around neightbouring areas in the sky, noticing multiple trails of smoke starting from a center in a bike wheel pattern. The center moved away from where I had spotted the bright light. I looked back at where I saw the object and it was gone. The centerpoint pattern continued for some time until it dissipated.  Here's what my friend has to say.: Ok let me start of by saying I did not see the part of the event as aforementioned by my friend, but we both heard the loud bang, I thought something very large had exploded. When I looked up to the sky I saw what looked like a hole in the atmosphere, a huge round circle in the sky, bright green and possibly blue in colour patterned like the lines of an iris as in the coloured part of the human eye. It was as if there was a puncture in the sky. All I know is It felt out of place and completely unatural.

As I walked out the front door he was standing next to his car staring up into the night sky with his mouth wide open. As I glanced up, I saw what I could only describe as a stealthy black disk almost directly above us. By stealth, I mean that it was silent and as it passed between us and the light cast by the moon over a thin layer of clouds (like fog) it's sillouette became visible. It was perfectly round and blacked-out.  The disk appeared to hover for approximately 5-10 seconds then shifted from left to right in a zig-zag pattern. Suddenly it began moving to the south at a slow rate of speed. Then in a flash, it sped off at an unbelievable rate of velocity.  My friend and I agreed that what we witnessed was exceptional. So much so, that we still talk about it to this day.  I firmly believe that because the atmospheric conditions were just right that evening is the only reason we could see the disk. Without the clouds illuminated by the moon I don't think we would have noticed it.  I always catch myself looking up at night now, wondering if on those dark moonless nights how many disks might be up there.

It was gone. A minute later it came out from the cloud & it had a matching partner that sat close to it. They both moved back near the direction of the School yard, moving slowly & quietly & seemingly not too high up. They sat for about 5 minutes near us, then moved due North slowly until they were some distance away from us. Possibly 3 blocks away. All of a sudden they both bolted out of sight so fast that in seconds they disappeared.Still not a sound. Many of the guys acted as if we saw nothing. I believe they were upset & didn't want to face that we just saw two UFO's. They'd say they were clouds,etc. About 6 or 8 of us had no doubt what we saw. Needless to say we never finished that ball game after that event.

We thought they were coming to talk to us. When we went up to them with our story of what happened about 7 hours ago, they just ""poohed"" us off as some kids that were making up stories.

It appeared to give off its own light, although there were no visible windows.  I recall having car radio on, but a high pitched noise coming from the sky made me turn the radio off.  The ""something"" was a silver-blue disk-like object which gave off this high pitched noise.  I estimate the distance to be approximately 1000 feet in altitude and in a southern angle.  Over the years, what has always stayed with me is that the object was turning on its axis in a semi-slow circle.  The bottom of the disk/saucer was not concave, but more or less flat.  After approximately 30 seconds, the object suddenly raced across the sky at an unbelivable speed in a north, north eastern direction.  The sky, in that part of the country, always displayed many stars on a clear night, and this was a clear night.  I don't recall a moon.  Furthermore, my friend and I raced to our hometown to tell people what we saw, and the movie theater was just letting out, and the first friend we saw we told of the incident, and he said, ""I know. We saw it too.""  This was 5 miles south of where we saw it, so the object had to be at a fairly high elevation.  There are many mountains in that part of the country, but where we saw it, was at a place where there was an open area where one could see about 6 miles to the next mountain. We asked around, and there were no county fairs or other happenings that would have a spot light turned to the sky.  I have told this story many times over the past 50 years, and will never forget the phenomenon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD)))",,41.646,-76.7924

I  suddenly saw a craft hovering over the tree tops right above the road just ahead of my car.  It was just getting dark and trees still lined both sides of the road in those days, so the outline of the craft was very prominent. I remember screeming out loud: ""Oh, my God.  It's a blimp...no it's not a blimp"" as I was trying to rationalize what the object might be.  At the same time these thoughts were racing through my mind, I was slamming on my brakes and backing out from under the craft as fast as I could.  I somehow found a driveway to turn around in as I was shaking and crying so hard I could barely drive.

I was in the driveway on my red bike (along w/ my Cocker Spaniel named Pedro). I looked up towards the north and saw a huge black blimp-looking thing moving (from east to west)over our house and moving over the apple/cherry trees that we shared w/ a long distance cousin next door who we called ""Cousin Odell"". It was moving at a slow pace and as I stared at this huge black thing...it slowed down and hovered over the orchard trees and just stayed there. My dog and I moved closer towards it and Pedro was barking at it when suddenly his tail tucked, ears went back and he ran up on the breezeway and sat down. I was so intriqued by this gigantic baloon and  I just stood there in awe! I stared at it for the longest.I then heard a faint humming sound. When it made this humming sound I saw these tiny red lights (like dots) around the belly of this ""balloon"". And because it hovered so long..and then made this humming noise, I dropped everything and ran into the house to tell my mom to come outside and see this ""big gigantic and huge black balloon"" She finally adhered as I grabbed her hand and led her outside..only to find that this gigantic balloon was gone. I tried to explain the big baloon to her, etc. etc. That was it! Nothing else. Nor have I seen it again.

The lights appeared to be about the same size as the jets and they would let the jets get close then they would change course immediately.  My mother and sister were also witnesses.

I think he would talk to someone about it. I only corrected his grammer. The story is his and I believe him.  A True New Brunswick Experience   Time: About 4:15 to 6:30 am  Date: Early in the morning of the first Saturday in October 1955.  A point to remember: We were very excited, so the estimated times, and dimensions of the craft, made and mentioned in this article are no doubt inaccurate, especially the vertical height of the craft.  My friend and I left home very early in the morning to go hunting for the day. Needless to say, our hunting trip was cancelled. I never hunted again.  We parked the car at the edge of a field about four o'clock in the morning and leaned back to get some sleep before daylight arrived. At about four fifteen, directly in front of us, a light appeared. It looked like the cabin of a small two-seater helicopter which was making a very loud noise, not unlike the sounds of engine trouble.  The light came over the top of the hill immediately in front of us, perhaps a hundred or so yards away. We were in a long narrow valley, surrounded on our right by woods, behind us slightly to our left by a high wooded hill, to our left by a clear valley and immediately to our front by what appeared to be a steep wooded hill. To our left at about forty-five degrees toward our front, there was a large barn, presumably used by local farmers for hay storage. No other buildings or structures were visible, although on another road was a small community, not more that a half-mile or so away.  The lighted, noisy vehicle appeared to be quite small. I realized later that it was because of the time of day. At four fifteen or so in the morning, the sky was very black; and everyone knows that it's always darker just before the dawn. In any case, the lighted area was all we could see, the rest of the vehicle being hidden by darkness.  In a few seconds the noise diminished to nothing; no noise at all! Then, the craft moved very slowly out and over the field to a point just behind the barn; slightly to the right of the barn when looking from our vantage point. To us, it appeared to be about one hundred fifty feet more or less from our car and about fifty to sixty feet from the ground. It seemed to be not very much higher than the peak of the barn but, in appearance it seemed to be at least twice the size of the barn itself. The craft just sat there for a while, appearing suspended in the air; no noise! Nothing! Just sitting there! Imagine our awe!  To the best of our knowledge, no earthlings as yet had such technology. I'm still not convinced that technology like that exists in our world even today. Something to think about!  Anyway, we were so awe-struck that we completely forgot, or abandoned, our hunting trip. We just sat there and watched for something to happen. We were not disappointed. After a period of time, probably fifteen minutes to a half-hour, things started to happen.  First, we noticed the ship's appearance. It was shaped like this: two saucers, the top one being inverted, and the two saucer edges being separated by a vertical external side which appeared to be about four or five feet high; not unlike the appearance of a hamburger. The lower part appeared rounded and sloping with a flat bottom.  Above this bottom section, what I would call section two was a straight-sided cylinder with a brushed aluminum or leadish appearance, the same as all the other external sides.  On top of this section, and no doubt part of it, a section not more than a foot or two high was visible; looking like one continuous glass. There was still darkness, so perhaps the glass just appeared that way in the dim light. In any case, I was not able to discern whether the glass surface was clear or opaque.  It seemed like another fifteen or twenty minutes before this windowed area came to life. There came from behind the windows, a series of lights, changing from red, to pink, to yellow, to blue to green, to blue, to yellow, to pink, to red; all the time rotating around the craft, so that when the colours came around again, we did not get the same sequence each time. Some colour was always visible; that is to say, the colour series was long enough to extend completely around the craft without breaks. These lights continued until just a few seconds before the craft departed.  Section three was immediately on top of this rotating coloured area. It was also a windowed area, separated from section two by a vertical side of not more than three or four feet in height, and which appearance has already been described. These windows were wide panels, perhaps four or five feet in height and perhaps six or seven feet long; each of the panels being separated by a single vertical strip; no doubt some kind of support. These windows were definitely opaque, and through which we could discern a lighted area behind the glass panels. The light was what could be described as 'bright white', not unlike that of our own brightest fluorescent lamps, only much brighter; more like halogen light. The top of this section was rounded, ending in a flat top.  The fourth, the top section, was much rounded, being topped with a short, round vertical area of perhaps four or five feet in diameter and about a foot and a half to two feet high, topped with a rounded, tapered roof with a flat top of a diameter of about a foot or two at the top.  Since we were so amazed at what we were seeing, we decided to attempt a contact. We flashed the car headlights a few times. No reply. Tried again. No reply. Tried again and the lights in the craft's lighted window panel area dimmed and brightened, so we took that as a response. After a few more trials, we knew they were replying to our efforts because we had changed the number of times our lights were flashed and we counted the number of times their light dimmed. The counts were identical every time. Real beings were inside that thing! Amazing! Not of this world! We don't have that kind of technology! Maybe Japanese? German? Russian? British? American? Australian? Canadian? Naw! The Cold War is on! Couldn't be from this earth. We don't have those capabilities. (Canada had what they called a flying saucer at the time. It was more like a hovercraft without the skirts, driven by fans and only managed to get a few feet off the ground.) Naw! Can't be from here! No one our earth has technology like that!  Suddenly, silhouettes of three or four beings (I think three), appeared in the opaque windows. We could see their shapes, but because the glass appeared opaque or frosted, we were unable to tell what their hands or faces looked like, but their appearance looked like us! Humans? Don't know! Can't see through the glass. Exasperated!  Boy, how I felt! Overjoyed, but very small in a very large universe! Isolated! - Want to make contact and go on board!  Not my friend though. He was too awe-struck and very scared. He just wanted to get out of there; right now!  I finally convinced him that I needed to know more about this craft and see the beings inside, and perhaps even meet them. I so desperately wanted to go inside. He finally agreed to stay until daylight providing no-one came out of the craft. OK. Great!  In regards to the size of the craft, or should I say ship, I would estimate it to have been about fifty to sixty feet in diameter at its widest point across the saucer edge and perhaps twenty-five to thirty feet high, from the very top to the flat bottom. I believe that today, researchers would call that a scout ship.  After a few more minutes of flashing headlights and getting responses each time in the same sequence from the lights in the cabin, their replies suddenly stopped. All was very quiet for a time.  Suddenly, there was an extremely bright flash which caused us to cover our eyes, which flash appeared to come from the exact center of the flat bottom of the craft. After what seemed like maybe fifteen to twenty seconds of extreme blackness, the whole valley lit up. The light was very bright; much brighter than daylight! We could see extremely well, the whole valley; brightly lit as far as we could see. It was easy to tell that the valley extended beyond our field of vision. This was a pure white light very difficult if not impossible to describe; much better and brighter and more pure than any light we have, even today. Wow! What an experience!  The valley stayed brightly lit for at least five or six minutes or more, and then the light quickly faded into complete darkness in what seemed like only a few seconds. This period of darkness remained for what I would guess to be about five minutes or so, but we could still see the lighting behind those windows. No more of those human-like silhouettes were visible. Guess they were busy doing experiments or some other duties.  Soon, a bright shiny globe appeared from the exact center of the bottom of the craft, the same spot where the flash of light appeared. It lowered itself slowly about fifteen or twenty feet and then slowly moved to our left; then rising slightly faster in an arc, to a point above the craft, stopping behind and to the right of the craft as viewed from where we were positioned. It just sat there!  Following over the next few minutes, several more globes appeared in like manner, finally positioning themselves slightly above, and to the side of the craft; each a distance away from craft and from each other, each at different heights. All of these globes were in positions that appeared to us to be some distance behind the craft.  These globes remained suspended in the air for well over what seemed to me to be a half-hour or more. There was no further action during that time except the dimming and brightening of the each globes' appearance from time to time; giving us the impression that it was a form of communication. Then, each globe returned to the craft, following each other in what appeared to be reverse order. I don't remember counting them, but think there must have been ten or twelve of them, each judged to be about two feet in diameter. Then, all was quiet for a while. The area around us was beginning to get brighter. Daylight was coming!  It wasn't very long before we heard the loud 'clank, clank, clank' of what sounded like someone pounding on a steel pipe with a very heavy hammer. That lasted a minute or two.  A few seconds after the noise stopped, we heard (or should I say felt?), a very low frequency growling noise which quickly increased in pitch. It was not long going above our hearing range. It was then that we realized what it was that we heard; the sound of a gyro starting up!  Of course, we could no longer hear the high-pitched whine of the gyro, so there was absolutely no sound whatever. The rotating coloured lights went out without warning and the craft immediately moved strait up in a vertical plane, until it appeared as only a bright dot in the morning sky, about the size of the head of a small pin. The dot stayed motionless until after the sun came up and hid it from our view.  Boy, sure would be interested in knowing how fast it really did move. Seemed to me to be a thousand miles an hour! Perhaps by knowing these facts, someone with more mathematical skills than I, might discover just how fast that craft really moved during its vertical climb.  I cannot forget that sudden upward movement. It was so rapid that we strained our necks in an attempt to follow its path. We did manage to follow the movement, but after all this time, I'm still paying for it. I know it took less than two seconds to reach that height, so the neck strain was very substantial. I still have sore muscles and an almost continuous pain in my neck from that experience, which remain with me almost constantly each and every day.  Anyway, it appears to me that no other type of contact was made between us and the occupants of the craft, at least as far as I know, although sometimes I'm not quite so sure. It was while watching that dot high up in the sky, hoping it would come back for me, that I felt very alone and totally abandoned! Left behind! Lonesome! Alone in the expanses of the universe! I felt like I belonged on that ship! Why did they leave me? Even today, I sometimes still feel that same way.  Well, it seems that even if no further contact was in fact made with us, they were still somehow able to influence or affect me. It was during this experience that I suddenly realized the I knew for a certainty that other worlds do in fact exist. We are not alone in the universe! I sometimes wonder if they were somehow able to convey to me the truth that other worlds really do exist, something that I have always believed from as far back as I can remember.  Another lasting gift also remains in effect. I can tell when these types of crafts are in our vicinity, which crafts I prefer to believe are interstellar spacecraft. Although not always visible to us, I can usually tell when one is nearby because of the tingling of my skin, being accompanied by that high-pitched whine which I can somehow hear. Yes, they are definitely here! They come around mostly at night and seem to have the ability to hide from our sight by means of some device as yet unknown to us. None the less, they are still in our midst, occasionally even in the daytime.  Since my friend is no longer living, there are no witnesses left but me. The incident was not reported because UFO reports were very common in the fifties, and were mostly considered to be bunk. Ridicule was just not our cup of tea! As for him, he remained totally afraid until his death as far as I know. He didn't even tell his own children, and wouldn't discuss it with anyone; not even me. Unbelievable! Maybe he thought they would come back to get him! I don't know. Sometimes I wish they had come back. I really would have liked to go with them, at least for a while. Still have that desire and would welcome the opportunity to go on board one of these crafts should an opportunity present itself.  On a couple of occasions I related parts of this experience to Mr. Stanton Friedman, a well known UFO investigator and a personal acquaintance of mine. He chose not to investigate. I thought several times that perhaps I should send a report to SETI (Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence), which has a world wide website on which such reports can be made. But, because of the time lapse, forty eight years already, any technology from that time period would undoubtedly not apply today and would therefore be redundant, so I decided against making that report as well.  It doesn't matter whether this related experience is believed by anyone other than myself or not. The fact is that it did happen, and it happened to me! From that time onward I have known that other worlds do exist, and they have beings shaped like us, and their technology far exceeds our own. These facts are true and I know that they are true! That's all that matters! ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC is delighted to have this case on file, and we have invited the source of the report to appear on a radio program.  We are grateful to the witness for sharing his sighting.  PD))",,,

Myself and two other Navy Corpsmen were on duty at the Naval Air Station, Willow Grove, Pa. in the spring of 1956.  The weather was warm and the sky was clear with stars being visible.  We were sitting outside the base medical facility on a step.  We were facing west north west when we first sighted a light brighter than the other stars in the sky. We noticed that the light did not seem to be remaining ""in place"".  The movement we detected was obvious in comparison with stars that were in the vicinity.  The phone rang at the duty desk, and we went inside.  The crews quarters were at the north end of the building by the medical store room.  Immediately outside was a loading dock. Before bedding down we were curious as to whether the ""light"" was still visible.  We stepped out on the dock, but could not immediately locate it; this is because in the course of not more than ten (10) minutes the light had changed position to almost due east and the movement we detected was more demonstrable. We called the radar shack and they did not have anything on their scopes.  We rousted the duty photographer out of bed.  The photo lab was in the control building just below the control room itself which was unmanned.  The photographer set up a camera on a tripod, in the open doorway of the lab which faced the area of sky we were interested in.  He took still photos and time lapse photos.  The time lapse photos demonstrated the light/object to maneuvering; changing position (up/down, right/left.  The duty officer in charge of the station was notified and he advised that we hold everything until morning (he had been sleeping).  The following morning the photos were given to the Operations Officer and he took them to the Radar Control Officer.  They went over the photos with the three of us present.  They did not know what to make of what they were seeing.  They contacted the Commanding Officer with all of the information they had and he advised that we all stay availble.  The CO's office phoned and told us that Naval Intelligence had been contacted, and someone was on the way to interview us.  In addition we were asked to report in writing what had transpired.

My mother, the woman who usually babysat us, my brother and I were all in our back yard.  It was just after dusk and getting dark.  My mom and the other lady were dipping apples that had fallen from the tree in the back yard into a sulphur solution to kill the hornets that were feeding inside of them (to this day, that part of the story sounds as bizarre as the UFO part of the story itself!).  My brother started crying because a hornet got in his boot and stung him.  But just then, a disk shaped object came out of the sky and hovered near us.  It had a section in the middle that was made of glass through which could be seen bright flames burning.  My mother felt like it was about the distance away as the top of a telephone pole, yet she felt the impulse to just reach up and touch it...it seemed so close.

We were traveling east, and we were at an area where there are fields on both sides of the highway. My friend in the passenger seat was looking out the window, and then I heard him say,""Oh my God! What the hell is that?""  I immediately stopped my girlfriends car.(we were using hers because my truck was out of commission)  I looked so I could see what he was seeing, and to my astonishment, we saw a bright orange, glowing object to the south of us.  It appeared to be very close and very low to the ground, also, probably 300 yards out in the field and approximately 200-300 feet off of the ground.  We got out of the car to watch this phenomenon happen before our eyes.  Then suddenly it zipped to the west at an amazing speed, then it would slowly come back to where it was when we first saw it.  It had done this 3 times.  Then it started moving to the south.  We got back in the car and I  turned south down a gravel road and we could see it through the trees that it was moving a little faster than us. The object was to our right hand side and in front of us on the other side of the trees.  Then it began to go to the south east.  Then I turned left down another gravel road so we could meet it on the next road over.  We got to the next road over that went north and south.  We turned to the south and could still plainly see it over the road about 1/4 mile ahead of us.  Then it crossed the road still heading south east.  We got up to a bridge and then started to go up the hill that followed.  Then there were open potato fields on both sides of the road.  We could still see it, but now it was ""pulsing"" orange and red.   We came to another highway that went east and west, but we stopped to watch it again.   Then right before our eyes, the sphere object took off to the north, and in the blink of an eye it was gone.

We had to night hike for a few hours on Friday.  The exact location of the sighting was across from a dirt boat ramp on Sweetwater Lake, which our hiking trail passed by.  As we broke into the field that runs along the lake and watershed, the fog was very thick.  This is when we first noticed flashing that we assumed to be heat lighting or something similar.  By the time we reached the boat ramp, we were away from the field and completely out of the fog.  The flashes were coming from 3 points.  Two points were far away enough that the source could not be seen.  The 3rd flashing was across the lake and only a short distance inland (I guessed around 100 yards at the most).  The light was flashing at various intensity, length, and time.  Ranging from a very small fraction of a second to nearly a second.  The intensity also ranged from:  just enough of a flash to see the low level clouds light up with a white ambient light, to a bizarre ball of light that peaked over the tree line by many feet.  When the ball of light was large enough, it resembled plasma.  The colors were red, yellow, white, purple, etc.  The ball also appeared to move around, by maybe 30 yards to the left or right.  Other than describing it as plasma, my friend suggested the side of a huge water tower was reflecting the flashes at us.  There is no structure at all in the area.  The flashes were coming from the center of the Talladega National Forest, indeed, there is no plumbing.  I should also note that the ""ball of light"" as I've called it, was only 300 yards away at most, and completely silent.  We watched the 3 flashes for about 30 minutes until they became quite infrequent.  It was such a strange thing to see and we still have no good idea as to what it was. I hike there frequently and may inspect the area sometime.  My best guess to date is that we saw military testing of some kind. Heflin, the nearest city, as I now know, has many reports of strange sightings and some other odd things.  The Fort McClellan Military Reservation was to our West as we watched the light to our East.  The Comanche helicopter was supposedly tested in that area. Also, that whole area of Alabama is a huge military arsenal.  The military has installed solar powered sirens throughout the forest recently and some old timers explained that there is a history of weapons buried in the forest during the Cold War era who's keepers died with the knowledge of their location.

My wife, who is not an enthusiast, even recognized it as something strange and said,""What is that?""  The two lights approached the highway and then came to a hover, not directly over it, but near it.  It was at an altitude of perhaps 500-750 feet.  I was still trying to figure out what it was, and said I thought it might be a helicopter, but I had seen helicopters at night, also, and this was not one.   We were still heading toward the craft and as we passed to the side and under it, another light came into view and it was recognizable as a triangular shape craft with a white light at each point.

My friend and I was driving towards Newport,Tn.one evening to pick up a video taped payper view event at his friends house.He was driving. we were heading northeast ways.I looked up towards the sky and spotted this pure white ballshaped light just suspended in the air. there were no stars out and it was a very clear blue sky evening,no clouds at all.It looked to me that this object was fairly high up in the sky.I looked at it for about 2,3 seconds and then said to my friend,""Hey,look at that ball of light in the sky."" My friend looked up towards where I was pointing and he said,""Aw yea what is that?"" We were continuing down the road and I was watching this ball of light all the way.He had to keep his eyes on the road but glanced at it when he could.We then came upon some trees on the side of the road and passed by them.it took about 3 seconds to pass by and when we were back in the clear the ball of light was gone! I looked all around in the sky to see if I could find it but It was no where to be found..I really started to think about what we had just seen.and to me it was not any type of plane or helicopter.I am pretty good at spotting man made aircraft at all times of the day and night. before living in Tn. I grew up near an International Airport. My friend also couldnt see it anywhere around his side of the car.The wierdest thing about this was that to me I got this funny feeling inside that it knew we were looking at it....!and thats why it disappeared.To make things more interesting that about 3,4 weeks later.There was a county police officer who came foward and claimed to have video taped the same object my friend and I had seen.He was on this show at the time called ""A current affair"" they showed the tape on the show and yes it did look exactly like the ball of light we seen! he also claimed after coming foward with his story. He was ridiculed by his coworkers and that when he was not at home one day. someone ransacked his house,like they were trying to find something.anyhow that is my story about what my friend and I had seen. I believe that it was not anything explainable maybe it was military but I doubt it! I believe that it was extraterrestial....

I then saw the hovering object pull in the ""probes"" and ascend back up to what appeared to be a larger hovering object up above, higher in the air.

My sighting took place in the middle of June 1995. I do not remember the specific date.  I was camping alone on a remote beach located about ten to fifteen miles west of the town of Cameron, located in Cameron Parish Louisiana. The beach is located about a mile off state Highway 27, which runs along the Gulf of Mexico coastline from Cameron to Port Arthur, Texas.  I had spent the day on the beach fishing, and was spending the night. The weather was perfectly clear with no clouds and no fog. I was laying on the beach, just looking at the stars and thinking.  At 2 a.m. I noticed an extremely bright object moving across the sky at very high speed. The object was coming in from out over the Gulf of Mexico and moving toward the beach, moving from south to north. I spend a lot of time outdoors and I am used to seeing aircraft at night. The object was moving extremely fast, much faster than I had ever seen any jet move. It's speed reminded me of a bright bullet. It was also at very high altitude, higher than what airliners normally appear to be, and seemed as if it were up among the stars.  The object was quite bright, like a brilliant white light, and appeared to be quite large considering that it seemed to be so high. I was not able to discern any particular shape, only a very bright object.  My first thought was that this must be a military jet of some sort, but then something very remarkable happened. While maintaining speed the object suddenly reversed direction. It did not make a turn. It did not stop and then reverse. It was as if it hit a solid wall and bounced back along the exact same course. One second it was moving north, and suddenly it was returning south along the same route in a perfectly straight line.  I had never before seen any aircraft do that and have not seen anything like it since. Because of this amazing straight line course reversal, I am convinced that this object could not possibly have been any comet, meteor, or known aircraft. I observed the object fly out over the Gulf of Mexico until I could no longer see it. The entire incident lasted only about a minute or perhaps a little less.  I told my sister about it, but told no one else, out of fear of ridicule. I have decided to post my sighting now, thinking that perhaps someone else may have had a similar sighting in the area.  As for my background, I have two college degrees, am a former police officer, and at the time of the sighting was teaching biology at a local university, where I taught for six years. I was not drinking or taking drugs of any kind. I'm not making any wild claims, only reporting what I saw.",2005-05-11T00:00:00,29.852,-93.6232

I am not 100% sure about the dates but it was winter in 1996 and I was visiting my then boyfriend in Silver Springs Maryland.   It was night time and a very clear and cold night.  I was driving towards the Washington Beltway 495 heading home to my house with my boyfriend traveling to Pennsylvania.   Before we reached the beltway some 2 miles away in the distance my boyfriend and I saw an enormous flash in the sky.  Almost like lightning but hovering by the horizon.  I said ""did you see that? It was like lightning!""  He said he did see it.   I didn't think too much about it and we finally arrived on the beltway.  We were coming up on the Mormon Temple in Kensington. The massive temple with the white spires and trumpeter and I noticed the lights were off (which I never have seen that before as the lights are always on) I thought to myself that was the flash we saw!   I said to my boyfriend, ""Thats what that flash was the Temple lights ble..."" I didnt even finish my sentance when right above us there were these fast flashing lights that flashed red, blue, green, yellow, purple, just poof poof poof poof poof...  It was stationary, no sound that I could tell but we were in the car, but being that it was so close if it were a helicopter or plane it would've been close enough to hear it even on the highway. There was a mist or something in front of whatever it was so we could not make out an outline of a craft, but whatever it was it was huge!   My boyfriend (a skeptic in all senses of the word) was gaping at it with his mouth open and he stated ""Now that IS WIERD!""   Mostly all of the cars in front of me put on their brakes (not stopping totally mind you its a very busy highway) but you could tell everyone noticed.  It was so incredibly strange.  I dont know how long it lasted as I could not stop to find out since I was on the highway.   I did see these types of lights once more by my house in Pennsylvania about a year later.  It was Very late and I noticed off towards my left side the same exact lights flashing red, blue, yellow, green, purple, just over and over very quickly and again you could not see a craft and it was stationary and there was this weird mist in front of it.  There was a person in front of me that saw the craft as well and he slammed on his gas and took off... and I quickly followed suit!!!  It was very unnerving and eerie.   I am being 100% honest here and wasnt exactly sure about reporting it...but I really wanted to tell my story.

Tonight I drove out to the country to get a better look at it.  I am almost certain this is not an alien craft, but rather a military craft doing test maneuvers. For the first hour it moved around in the sky on maneuvers described last night.  It appeared that 1 or possibly 2 small aircraft were staying in close proximity to the UFO, maybe observing it, but after about 15 minutes they left. Within the first hour I positivly identified an aircraft, possibly civilian or perhaps a small military craft approach the UFO.  Upon getting in close proximity the aircraft did a 180 turnaround and proceeded in the opposite direction it had came from.  About 20 minutes later another unidentifiable craft came down from the southern part of the sky.  Craft was a bright light heading towards the UFO at a high rate of speed and downward angle, after reaching approximatly the same elevation, second craft's light went out and it disappeared. Not sure what happened.  After an hour and a half, the UFO took off across the sky in an easterly direction at a fairly high rate of speed, stopped in mid air, and traced it's path back to where it had come from.

Between 8:30pm & 8:45pm on 09/13/05 I was driving west on I-10 west of Phoenix, Az. Nearing 107th Ave. when I noticed three lights moving slowly in formation a mile or two south of I-10. I was talking with my son on the cell phone and told him I could see three aircraft in a very tight formation. The lights were very close together at exactly the same altitude and moving in a precise formation.  After a minute or two I thought I was mistaken that they must be lights on a tall building or facility in the distance as they were not moving as fast as an aircraft would move. After a few minutes I could see they were moving WSW slightly faster than the 70MPH I was driving. The aspect angle between the lights was changing and I was certain they were moving. All the lights were at exactly the same altitude.  The appearance of the lights was different from aircraft lights. They were larger and not as intense as an aircraft light. They had a different color than aircraft lights, they were not white, but had a tawny tint similar to the old incandescent sealed beam headlights on cars. These lights were diffused rather than focused. There were no red or green lights that an aircraft would have, nor any strobes near these lights at any time, they had no similarity to conventional aircraft lights. They were definitely not bright Venus in the evening sky. I have been watching Venus & Jupiter the past weeks and they were larger, brighter, lower, further south and moving in formation, I have no doubt.  I got off I-10 at Litchfield Rd and then continued south on McDowell Rd about 1/4 mile north of and parallel to I-10. While driving on McDowell at 45MPH and in a dark area with no street lights I could clearly see the aspect angle changing and the lights were moving WSW and now drawing away from me. They were about 300 to 600 feet above the ground at the same altitude and moving together. I thought it possible they were three lights on a very large aircraft.  I drove south on McDowell to Sarival and decided to pursue them, turning South on Sarival. It was very dark and a fourth light appeared behind and slightly below the other three. I did not see where it came from, it appeared suddenly. It never reached the same altitude as the other three lights and disappeared as suddenly as it appeared. I drove 2 miles south of I-10 trying to reach some open country roads where I could drive fast and get closer to the lights.  When I reached Yuma Rd. I turned west but they were getting further away, they may have been speeding up, but not moving as fast as even a slow single engine Piper or Cessna. They turned to the SW approximate compass heading 235degrees. Another of the lights disappeared suddenly leaving only two. After a another minute the remaining two lights disappeared. They did not appear to land or fly away, they were just gone.  This entire episode covered 10 or 12 miles of driving and lasted 15 to 20 minutes. I was on the phone with my son describing my observations and chase to him while it was going on.  I am a 54 year old, stable & successful business man. I was driving home my usual route, as I do at this time several times a week. I fly often and live near an Air Force base and can recognize and easily identify many types of aircraft. These were not lights that an aircraft would have, wrong color, no red or green and they were not intense enough to be aircraft lights.

I could get the peak of the mountain in focus but the object remained a bit fuzzy with a gold light shimmering inside of it.

There were dim lights on the underside, and on the back of the object as it moved away from us over the rest of the neighborhood at a VERY VERY slow speed.  We just stood there in complete silence watching this thing move away until we could not see the object any longer.  Once the object passed, we could see the moon again, and normal night sounds filled the area.   Both of us, looked at each other, quickly said goodnight, and I ran into the house. He quickly got into his car and drove to his home.  I was pretty freaked out by what we saw, and looked for an explanation in the paper the next day, but there was nothing reported.   We are not located near an airforce base, nor have any military maneuvers run over our city that I am aware of.   This object was so low to the ground, it was as if we were looking up at the underside of a Star Wars model.  The object was moving from the West to the South East through the night sky.  I told my folks the next morning, but they shrugged it off as something military.  Was this a UFO, or could it have been a secret military craft?  We have not spoken about this to many folks for fear they would think we were nuts.   We didn't realize that there was a place to report such sightings, or we would have reported this when it happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It also seemed like there was light in the room, but how was totally unclear...a moment before it had been pretty dark.  At the time I was only thinking ""ghost"", not ""aliens"". I really felt a presence. I began to get very angry, and something in me told me that this was my only defense. I nursed the feeling, and then when I was seething mad in my mind, whatever it was let go. The room was dark and silent again. I jumped up. Even though I strongly felt like this had been a ghost of some sort, something in me made me look out the window, and I discovered that it was unusually windy to my surprise.

It almost sounded like a fire engine or a police siren, but the sound seemed all wrong.  It was like there was extra noise and a few different pitches.  So I looked to see what it was.  The noise got louder and finally there was a thing speeding down the road, only it wasn't touching the ground.  The trees between the house and the road were birch and spruce, so I could kind of see what the thing was.   It was very large, very tall - my guess is between 40'-50' in height.  It had white/yellow and red lights.   It was moving extremely fast...close to 80 or 90 mph.  The road that my parents live off of, Peede Rd, is a mile long.  Vincent Ct, the road my parents live on, is very close to the end of Peede Rd.  You can't take the corner too fast because it's sharp.   I timed the time that it takes for me to run out to Peede.  It took 27 seconds.  After seeing this thing zoom by, I ran out to Peede Rd.  I figured that it was a fire truck since it had been so large, but when I got out to the road I saw nothing.

Hi Peter, I just recently learned about you from listening to the Jeff Rense program, and from watching the UFO special on ABC.  Great work you’re doing!  The reason I’m writing is that I would like to report a UFO sighting, although I’m not sure if you’re the right person to receive it, as this incident happened in Germany several years ago.  If you know of someone who is more interested in international sightings, feel free to pass this along.   I apologize in advance for all of the important information that will be lacking in this report, but I think you’ll agree that every little piece of information contributes to the overall picture. I am completely at a loss as to the timing of this sighting.  I was in Germany from June of 1995 until the summer of 2001.  This happened sometime between ’96 and ’98.  That's as close as I can get to giving you the timing. I was a soldier stationed in Wuerzburg, Germany from June ’95 until August ’97.  I remained in Germany until 2001.  My friend and I often visited the Café Haupelshofer, a popular café downtown.  One night, my friend was driving us to the café when he noticed an object in the sky.  He asked me ""Dude, what the hell is that?""   I looked toward where he was pointing and saw a bright light in the sky.  I told him I didn't know what it was.  He asked me to keep an eye on it while he drove.  I was able to keep it in view continuously until we parked the car.   Stepping out of the car, it was still in view, about 75-80 degrees above us.  We walked the short distance to the café, keeping it in view the whole time.  It never seemed to move at all.  We got to the Haupelshofer and stood outside in the alley to the left of the café watching this hovering light for approximately ten minutes.  As we stood there, several German pedestrians would pause for a moment as they walked by us, looked up and wondered aloud, ""Was ist das?"" (What is that?) before continuing on.  It was a clear night with plenty of stars in the background.  The whole time, the light never moved in the sky.  By contrast, there were airplanes crossing the rather narrow field of vision. We were in the alley close to the corner of Sanderstrasse, so the streetcar tracks were right behind us, looking up at the strip of sky between the buildings.  The light was basically centered in this narrow piece of sky, and planes flying much higher than this object were crossing in the background.  It was obviously not a plane, nor a blimp or balloon.  It COULD have been a helicopter, only it was low enough that had it been a helicopter, I'm sure there would have been sound, but there was none.  All I could see of it was a single, bright, white light - I couldn't see any hardware. It wasn't very high up, but higher than the altitude of the average hot air balloon.  If I held an object up at arm's length to hide it from view, I could probably hide it with a dime. We could not positively identify the object, so by definition, it remains a UFO.  Eventually we got tired of staring at this light, just hovering in place, and we entered the café.  When we left, we paused in the alley and looked up, but the light was gone.  Unfortunately, I don't have more specific details to give you.  Interestingly, I found a picture of some folks eating breakfast at the café.  If you look at the picture, you'll see four windows behind the people.  My friend and I were standing just outside of the two windows on the right hand side when we watched the UFO.  I've also included a rough sketch of the view looking up at it.  I hope this is something you can use.  If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at ((e-address deleted))  Keep up the great work! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Witness: 44 Years Old, Computer Programmer/Systems Analyst  Event Description: Sunday, December 8th, 2002 8:30 PM. I was out walking my dogs. There was no moon out so it was very dark.  Something caught the corner of my eye and made me look up. I saw four very bright, large, round, white lights strobe-ing very rapidly forward. Then they would reverse and go backward. The strobe effect was very rapid.  To my amazement, a huge black “triangle” floated just over the tops of my trees. Then it stopped and began to hover near me.  To me it seemed like once it had my attention that it turned off the strobe lights and  just hovered there.  I suddenly realized that the object was not making any sound, not a peep. Aircraft fly over all the time, I can always hear the engine clearly, the private planes above the clouds let alone the jets. And this was absolutely silent.  Then small white lights on the top, bottom, front, back and sides started to do a little ""dance."" All of the smaller lights began to play a pattern. First the two top lights would blink twice, and then the two lights at the front of the craft would blink twice,  then the two top ones again, and then the two back ones, etc.  It went through the pattern until it had blinked every sequence it could with the number of lights that I could see.  The object appeared to be dark except the lights, black in color.  It was darker black than the night sky.  The object was very large and solid, I couldn’t see stars through the object. I estimate the length to be between 60ft to 100ft long judging by the trees and houses and other landmarks in the area.  I couldn’t tell how wide the object was because I was looking at it from the side and slightly below.  Suddenly, four much larger diamond shaped red lights appeared at the rear of the object, themselves arranged in a diamond pattern. I could see them because the object slowly started to pivot towards me.   The diamonds had a “grid” inside them that reminded me of a honeycomb. I knew then that I was seeing something totally unknown. They just stayed on for a moment, and then went out. They were so bright that you could see that the object had a kind of triangular or diamond shaped tail end. Or maybe like two inverted pyramids with a notch on the top and the bottom. And this “tail section” was large enough to house these large red diamonds.  Finally the object flashed the lights in a kind of “grand finale” with the small white and big red diamond lights flashing a pattern together using all the lights.  I just stared motionless, even my dogs were standing perfectly still in the snow.  Then the object started to move away, flying very slowly. Just gliding along, in no hurry at all.  It didn’t look like it was worried about radar, fighter interceptors or anything else. Although it was probably flying too low to register on radar.  It started to turn in a slow bank at about 45 degrees towards a nearby cellular phone tower.  Right then as it flew near the neighbor’s house across the street, his truck's alarm went off. It continued to honk until he finally had to come outside to stop it.   I wanted to shout to him to come look at this thing, but it was already getting further away.  My neighbors don’t live close by and he couldn’t see it from his point of view.  I also thought about running inside and trying to get my camera, but I just couldn't take my eyes off of it.  As it moved further from me, the patterns got simpler and the red diamond lights came on less often.   I was very relieved that it was moving off, away from where I was standing. While it was right above me the lights were flashing nonstop.  It moved close to the cellular tower which also has lights on it, to let aircraft know it is there. But it only has two beacons, slowly blinking white lights like you see on any tower.  The object blinked its white lights at the tower and the lights on the tower began to blink rapidly as well.  It seemed to linger in the area of the tower for a short time and then starting moving steadily away.  I stared at it as it moved slowly further away. Finally, after about 5 minutes and it getting cold I wanted to go inside. When I turned my back around again the object was gone. I thought that was strange too, because I thought I should have been able to at least see a little dot but nothing.  I have no idea what it was. But I do know that I know a lot about airplanes and have seen them fly over at night many times.   Their collision beacons blink very slowly and they have a small red light on the tail that stays on at night. This was *nothing* like that. It was as if these lights had a program written, to get them to create a little light show. I don't know why any aircraft would have something like that.  I wouldn't have believed if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.  It sure was unusual; I've never seen anything like it in my life. I'm not too sure if I want to again either.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,38.4043,-81.9702

Caught my attention. I ran out onto the deck & the low-end hum was tactile! Shaking the hair in my arms! I looked to the northeast, there it was! Big as night! A Huge, non-reflective, black triangle object! Just floating above the Pillager Water Tower. Hanging there humming. Maybe 100 feet or so above the tower. It had 3 star-like, lights! 1 on each point of the triangle. I was stunned! I couldn't believe my eyes! Couldn't believe this was happening to me! The freakiest feeling I've ever encountered. Ever! Then, as I saw a small plane approaching directly from the northwest, the Triangle began to depart. As if it knew it was visible. The low-end hum began to speed up as the Triangle slowly made it's way off. It seemed to just float away in the strangest manner! This thing was like 3 city blocks long! Never ever seen anything that big move that slow with that much power! As it sped up, a circular, multicolored light in the center of the triangle began to light up & spin.

This is a official close encounter of the third or forth kind. I am risking everything writing this and have nothing to gain since I do not need the attention. Aliens do exist and I have seen them, matter of fact I have been 2 feet from them. The recent controversy over whether night terrors cause people to continue dreaming  after awakening from a night terror needs to be restudied.  On March 14, 2003 I began to have what is known as a night terror (These started after a head injury in 1994). I have never been able to fully awake during a night terror except for 03-14-03.  Sometime in the early morning I started having a night terror as I partial awoke I saw two small black figures enter my bedroom at that point I started to freak out and was yelling at myself to wake up, wake up, wake up and then I awoke.  The two small black objects were two small grey aliens, once awoke I no longer was freaking out. I looked directly at these two aliens they observed me for about three seconds and then went running down my hallway at what appeared to be around 50 or 60 mph, their was an amber light being emitted down my hallway and the aliens ran into the light and disappeared.  I jumped out of bed ran down the hallway unlocked the door that was 4 feet from the end of the hallway and ran outside, there was nothing but dead calm.  There was an highly unusual calmness in the air and physiologically.  I was the calmest and most relaxed that I have ever experienced in my life (No pain killer or muscle relaxent has ever put me in this state).   To this day I look at this experience as the coolest dream that I've ever had. I don't feel crazy because i know the truth and we are not alone and this was not like the other night terrors that I have had where I wake up with a racing heart rate.  I went back to sleep after this occured which is highly unusual. I have an idea of what is going on and they are the creators of life, they put life on this planet to evolve and us stupid humans have poisoned the entire food chain which has inadvertantly poisoned us and now they are trying to save whats left as well as to protect us from possible other alien colonies.

My friend was having a party, with a bon fire out in the country inbetween Glenwood, Iowa and Bellevue, Nebraska.  Their were 3 of us kids (15 yrs old at the time) outside, and two adults when suddenly I noticed that there were strange blue lights that sort of looked like shooting stars in the sky.  I told the rest of the people to look up and we were all amazed. One of the adults told us that it was probably just something from Offut Air Force Base, and to just forget about it, but it was to amazing for us to quit looking at. The lights were running into eachother breaking off into many other lights and created large circular shapes in the sky. After about 10 minutes of this occuring, I over heard the adults talking to eachother saying that the lights were starting to creep them out. Me and one of my friends rushed inside because we had a weird feeling that this would be on the news or something talking about an alien invasion, so we skipped through all of the channels and were suprised to see that it was not on t.v. We rushed back out there and suddenly the lights stopped.  Everyone who was ouside decided to come inside as it was starting to get a little chilly.  Every few minutes we would look outside to see if the lights came back, and around 5 minutes after the lights disappeard, strange beam like lights flashed from the ground up to the sky every few seconds. This stopped after 2-3 minutes and that was the last of the lights that we saw.  I am VERY sure that what I saw that night was from a different planet as no aircraft that I have ever heard of runs into eachother.

My two kids and I were spending the night in my hammock in our yard in Rancho Bernardo to watch the Perseid meteor shower when we noticed three lights larger than stars silently moving in unison across the sky at a very high altitude.  We noted that the three lights formed a triangle and comprised a single object because as it slowly and steadily traversed the sky it blocked out the view of the stars.  We became entranced by it, especially because periodically it would literally make 90 degree left and right turns without slowing down or banking, something which to me seems impossible.  It's path originated from the southeast initially heading northwest, as we were laying in my hammock facing north.  Periodically it would stop and hover motionless, and ultimately darted off at a high rate of spead in a southerly direction.  This occurred in August 2003 and since then, every August when the Perseids come, my kids recall the event and tell their friends.  I'd like to know if anyone else in San Diego witnessed what we saw or can provide me with information about what we witnessed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It was difficult to track visually . If you looked away it would be difficult to locate again. There were a few more of these objects appearing centrally from great altitude. This was not a saucer of plane or helicopter. My brother said a jet from Moffett flew through the general area where these objects were appearing. The jet slightly lost control, regained control then flew off. It may have sucked one into the engine intake. Oh, these things weren't small.

It was the night that Sputnik was supposed to be visible to the naked eye in my hometown of San Leandro, California.  The night was clear - no cloud cover at all.  My brother (about 11 yrs old at the time) and I (about 8 yrs) and our 16 yr old babysitter were out in the back yard, laying on the picnic table watching the sky for the spectacle of man's first craft in orbit! Sputnik was expected to be seen after dark in the southwest sky (going just over our fig tree in the S.W. corner of our yard.  The house was on the north side of the yard so we had no fear of any obstruction of our view. As we lay watching, we saw [no less than 5 nor more than 8 - I'm thinking it was 6]what we initially thought to be our subject sighting.  The two problems were: a) there was more than just one object and, b)they were traveling from the wrong direction - coming from the east, traveling west!  Their time to go from the eastern horizon (which was the roof of the one story house of our neighbor to the east) to the western horizon (trees - quite a ways away) was about 1.5 minutes - possibly 2 minutes but not more. The objects were quite bright but looked like Sputnik did when we finally DID see it - it was just where we expected to see it, too.  The objects had no specific formation but their flight pattern was direct: east/west.  No side trips at all BUT one ship or the other would race out in front of the group then slow and wait for the others to catch up.  This happened about 3 or 4 times while we watched them traverse our field of vision.  We called it the ""Dragrace in the Sky."" We did talk about whether or not it HAD been the Sputnik, discussing the direction and number of vehicles, or had INDEED been 'flying saucers' and decided we had been treated to a very special show before getting to see our (meaning earth's) Sputnik.  Seeing the first man made space craft was pretty exciting but, honestly, the ""dragrace"" pretty much stole the show that night - for us, anyway.

At the time we were both amateur astronomers (built our own 6"" telescopes) and spent a lot of time star gazing.  The night we saw the UFOs was clear and moonless.  I was in the process of moving the telescope from one sky object to the next when I caught sight of a v-shaped formation of about 8 circular shaped objects crossing the sky almost directly overhead.  I immediately shouted to my friend and he saw them as well.  Each object was about the apparent size of a full moon, were circular in shape and had a dull, light grey metallic color to them.  I'm not sure whether they were visible as a result of reflected light from the ground or whether they were semi-transparent and lit from within.  I am sure that they seemed metallic and definitely gave the feeling of being ""hardware.""  Also, the fact that they made absolutely no sound left a strong impression on me.  We watched them as they flew across the sky at uniform speed and finally disappeared behind a building.  We saw them for about 5-10 seconds.  They remained in formation throughout the sighting and there was no individual movement by a disk within the formation.  I believe as they receded you could see that they were disk shaped and that the direction of flight was north to south but I can't swear to these things due to the length of time that has lapsed since my sighting.  At that point we were both confident we had seen something not made on earth.  Being amateur astronomers, we were familiar with observing high flying aircraft, satellites, comets, meteor showers, Aurora, etc. and I know that what we saw that night can not be explained as some natural or man made phenomenon.  We bought all the local newspapers the next day thinking that we would see our sighting confirmed by others but didn't see any related stories.  I have been watching the night skies ever since and never saw another UFO.  I hope this report helps with your data base. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Numerous residents called police to ask about the object.  It was seen by the CAA control tower at Burlington Municipal Airport.  The tower said the fireball also had been seen from Albany, N.Y., and seemed to fall straight down toward the lake.  Pieces seemed to shower away from the main object, which changed in color from whitish to a dazzling pale green as it neared the horizon line. ""It looked something like fireworks that showers apart,"" the man said.  The U.S. Weather bureau here had no information on the object, but said teletype messages indicated it had been seen in Scranton, Pa., and Buffalo, N.Y., among other places.  Some detail may come from astrologers (sic--astronomers) who might have followed the fiery object. The Burlington Free press, Burlington, VT, Monday April 21, 1958; page 1(?)  ‘Don’t Talk Too Much’  Fireball in Sky Baffles Area, Especially Cote  By Vic Maerki  A dazzling ball of fire suspended from a parachute, a red flare, blinking ""signal"" lights and a burned-out area in the Winooski woods remained the ingredients of a puzzling mystery last night.  Most baffled of all was Lyman (Shorty) Cote of 65 Pine St., Winooski, athletic trainer at the University of Vermont, who witnessed the entire display. ""I don’t know what it was,""  Cote said last night.  ""But I’m sure it was something mighty interesting. ""The Air Force seemed to think so, too.""  Col. William Hevde, commanding officer of Ethan Allen Air Force Base, confirmed the Air Force’s interest, but claimed an investigation failed to reveal any clues. The unusual sequence of events began shortly before 9:30 p.m. Friday when a fireball, thought to be a meteor, flared brilliantly in the sky northwest of Burlington. Hundreds of persons saw it. But Cote saw more than that. ""I was watching TV and noticed this brilliant red fireball when I glanced out through my picture window,""  he said. ""It was falling and all of a sudden appeared to slow down.  Then the color turned from red to white and sort of pale blue. It was then that I clearly saw the outline of a parachute. Then it seemed to land in the woods behind Fitzgerald’s dairy farm off the Malletts Bay road.  It flared up red.""  Calls Police  Cote promptly called the Winooski Police to notify them.  They said they would check with the air base. A short time later, some Winooski policemen arrived at Cote’s house and at their request he tried to guide them to the spot where the object appeared to have landed. Capt. Joseph Sprano of the Winooski Police Department said a swampy area between Cote’s house and the spot they were headed for blocked their efforts. ""But I plainly saw two blinking white lights, like flashlight signal lights, at the spot Cote was pointing to from his house,"" Sprano said. Cote said he was pointing out the spot to the police when a red flare went up and the blinking lights began,  Police and Cote tried in vain until about midnight to find their way to the spot. On Saturday morning, Cote tried again. This time he was successful. He said he found a scorched spot in the woods, but no signs of life or of the parachute. Later on Saturday, two enlisted men from Ethan Allen Air Force Base paid Corte a visit and he guided them to the spot. ""They seemed to know what it was all about, but told me not to talk too much about it,"" Cote said. ""The sergeant also told me not to touch anything,"" Cote said  The two airmen left, but Cote said a helicopter was seen later Saturday ""hovering just over the treetops.""  Hovde confirmed that an Air Force helicopter was sent out to search the area, but said it found nothing. Will File Report  He said he will file a report with Washington, but added that he had no knowledge of what it might have been. He said he had none of his aircraft in the air at the time and did not know of any planes in the vicinity.

Immediately after the recently-lauched""Telstar""satellite passed overhead during the summer of 1958,and fell below the horizon, two utterly silent triagular objects moving parallel close together in tandem,each with a point of white light at each corner, passed directly overhead,blocking the background stars, each the width of a full moon,at what appeared to be low altitude, moving slowly south to north, which was followed the next day by an article buried in the inside pages of the Baltimore newspapers claiming that ""hundreds of persons reported seeing UFOs over northern/northwestern Baltimore County the previous night.""  These two objects were not aircraft,since completely silent yet low in altitude,but were obviously under coordinated controlled flight,and moving too slowly to be supported by aerodynamic lift.  These identical observations were made by me(about age 9), my then best friend,age 11,and his mother,then about age 45.  She is the one who found the newspaper article the next day,which I have never taken the time to attempt to relocate since then, but which forever impressed this sighting in my memory,since independently confirmed and shared by many other complete strangers in the area written up in the Baltimore Sunpapers(or News American). The date and time is approximate,but was approximately the height of summer,l958. I have never had any other sighing before nor since,and did not connect it to UFOs per se because back then they were described as""flying saucers"",and I had never heard of triagular UFOs,only discs or alleged cigar shapes, until the l990s,when photos of the triagular objects over Belgium and elsewhere first came to my attention. Unlike some other reports of triangular sightings,however,there was no central light,but instead merely one small white lite at each apex of each triangle. Other than the absence of a central(fourth)light,what we saw appeared identical to the Belgian triangles caught on film in the l990s. No other detail could be made out with respect to the objects. I've decided to report this after all these years in the hope that if enough people make enough reports,then the scientific community and the appropriate authorities will study these phenomenon seriously. Also,someone should check the archives of the local newspapers for the summer of l958 which should substantiate that many persons reported the same observations at the same time,totally independently of one another. Our group of three had not made any report of what we saw that night to anyone,but were genuinely puzzled at the time,and surprised the next day that so many other unknown  persons reported similar phenomena the previous night at the same time in the same area,over northern and northwestern Baltimore County. In those days Randallstown,where our sighing occurred,was semi-rural and therefore relatively free of City light pollution. It was a warm,clear,dry,starry,moonless night,which may help pin down the time of month,and will remain vivid in my recollection forever,since what we saw was nothing like I've ever seen before nor since,except for the Belgian photos from the early l990 sightings,and was definitely not manmade aircraft due to their flight characteristics:apparent large size,lack of sound,low slow coordinated,level,uniform straightline motion, and other appearance as described above. These two objects continued north not changing speed nor direction until over the horizon.This is all I recall observing,and would have thought no more of it but for the aforesaid newspaper reports by so many others the next day,on the theory that all of us could not be mistaken nor confused at what we saw,i.e.controlled silent low flying triangles in formation,maintaining equal distance from one another,inconsistent with any known technology,nor any natural phenomena whatsoever.The lights did not flash like a plane,nor change color, nor intensity,nor their positions relative to one another while continuing a uniform motion northward of our backyard vantage point.

I wish I remembered more about how old I was and the year, but my guess is I was between 8 and 12 years old, which would make it between 1958 and 1962.  What makes it different is that my sighting was during the day and the craft was on the ground. I was climbing a tree in a neighbor's yard. The land sloped downhill from where I was. From that high vantage point, I could see across a forest that was intersected by a meandering power line that was probably 1/4 to 1/3 mi away from me as the crow flies. There were two sets of lines, and there on the ground was a saucer-shaped disk with a dome on top. The craft appeared to span most of the distance between the stantions so I would guess it might have been 50 feet across. It was a sunny afternoon and the sun reflected off the craft, but it was not polished and shiny-I would describe it as looking like brushed aluminum. I could not tell--or I don't remember--whether it had windows or portholes. The object was not moving at all. After looking at it in amazement for several minutes, I ran home to get my mother. I tried to convince her to come and see what I had seen, but once she learned it involved climbing a tree, she would not come with me. I returned to the tree on my own and sure enough the object was still there.  I do not know why I didn't try to get someone else to pay attention or to see it.  The site would not have been visible from the road and we would have had to hike the power line. The line ran roughly parallel to the road I was on and bisected a road at a right angle to ours. My mother did not drive and it would have been a long walk for me, and a scary one. That argues that perhaps I was closer to age 8 than 12.  Later at dinner, I told the entire family about it. My father said it was probably a utility truck working on the lines. I remember feeling very hurt that nobody would believe me, and insistant about what I had seen. My grandmother was there, probably to baby-sit that evening, and I asked her if we could go to the library and get some books. I do not recall ever seeing any movies or comic books about UFO's before that, but I must have been vaguely aware they were being talked about. From that point on, I devoured everything I could find on the subject.  This has haunted me my entire life. This was not a mysterious light in the sky, but a solid object seen in broad daylight. We are most definitely not alone. Thank you for letting me tell my story. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

In the fall of 1958 or 59, when I was in Junior High School, the following was observed by both of my parents and myself: We were living at 21 West Approach Terrace Drive, in Greenville, R.I. Our property was located on the North to North-west shore of Slacks Reservoir. It was the late fall of the year. The time was between 1030 and 1100 (EST). We saw a bright light through the southern facing windows of our living room. We went outside and observed an object in the sky that was either large enough or close enough to obscure approximately 60 to 70% of the sky to the South west. It was at an azmuth of about 70 degrees. The object was shaped like two dinner plates placed top to top; a narrow glowing yellow-green band was separating the two halves, and a red spot, about three times the width of the band was located on the same seam as the band. The object itself was a glowing silvery-white. It slowly rotated on the horizontal axis, until it was almost round in shape. At that time five smaller objects, appearing to be round or spherical, approached from what appeared to be radial directions, and merged with the larger object. At that time, the object continued to rotate on the same axis as before, a yellow-green light was emitted from the lower rimmed area of the double plate in a fan-like beam. In the space of less than ten seconds the object had vanished into the South-West in an increasing angle of azmuth. There was absolutely no sound at all during the entire episode.  That evening, several radio stations reported that the object had been picked up on the RADAR at the primary commercial airport. The next day, nothing was on the radio or television, or in the newspaper.  I drew a picture of the object and wrote a letter to the Astronomy department at Brown University. My parents and I all signed it.  About a week later we heard a droaning of engines in the sky to the South-West, a dark object was approaching over the water. When the object was very close, bilboard lights flashed the message across the blimp ""Hello Down There."" Just how gullable did they think we were!!!  About two weeks after I had sent the letter we received a response. Supposedly we had seen the planet Jupiter and five of its moons with the unaided eye, taking up an area the size of a large serving platter, with the ""moons"" being about the size of a nickel each, in the wrong part of the sky, and at the wrong azmuth. Once again, just how dumb did they think we were!!!  My I.Q. has been tested to between 160 and 180 on various tests. At the time of the incident I had already built an analog computer, radio equipment, and my own telescope. I was already interested in a number of scientific fields. I firmly believe that we wittnessed a UFO mother ship and five scouts, and that rediculous attempts at cover-up were made by or influenced by the government of the United States.

She told me to look out the side bedroom window which was to the left of the bed we slept in. My other baby sister remained asleep in her big crib in the opposite corner of the room. I rolled over onto my left side to glimpse outside the bedroom window. It was a warm summer's evening, the sky was clear but I do not remember any moon. The view was looking down the street we lived on. There was an old buckeye tree in the front yard of our neighbors house [across the street] 4 houses down. My sister pointed into the sky, saying to look above the buckeye tree. There was no way I could miss it. Four huge white-yellow glowing saucers were hoover above the tree, but at a great distance. I can only say [as I was a young child] that they were higher up than any planes we saw flying [up at Pittsburgh airport]. My sister & I leaned on our elbows and just 'gazed' out the window at this amazing sight. The 'saucers' moved perfectly together in a pattern of four like on dominoes, up, down, sideways but never out of our view. It seemed like this went on for a very long time. We felt the saucers themselves must have been going around in circles[rotating] at great speed because we could see a faint halo towards the middle, fatter part of the saucer. We did not see any windows or flashing lights. They were huge and perfectly formed, not like clouds in any way. Suddenly, they moved/shifted upwards then, at what must have been an incredible speed,  in a direction away from Earth or at least away from us or from our view...they moved so fast as to disappear from our view within seconds of shifting upwards. We both looked at each in disbelief! During this episode, the objects always remained in a perfect pattern of 4 even as they disappeared from view. We told our mother the next day [we stayed quiet as to not wake baby sister and be told off] she told us we were imagining things. Back then, we told very few people as it was weird that no one seemed to believe us or just said nothing.?? So, we just accepted that we must have seen 'flying saucers'[UFO's] from outspace because we heard stories about such things. And, no other explanation fits. My sister and I still agree on this sighting. Had we been older and had a more curious mother, we may have discovered others who witnessed a similar siting at the time. The exact date and time I am not sure of, but I will never forget seeing something moving profoundly fast and in formation with an intelligence unlike that of anything on Earth up in the skies of Ohio. I have had 2 other experience since then. I think once something like this happens to you, you have an altered perception of reality and begin to think more laterally. One was a falling star which split in two as it fell. My husband and I witnessed that in England back in 1986. A rare sighting, I think, but explained. The other was a bright pulsating light I witnessed in the Andes at Macchu Piccu in 1974. This light was again a white-yellowish color. It pulsated light [rhythmic like a heartbeat]. Somehow it woke me up that night. I think it could have been the odd low-level noise it made.  I can only describe the sound as a 'low-pitched' single sound of a gyrating quality. That, and the pulsating light filling up my rear hotel bedroom window had me frozen with fear.  Though I could look out the back window, only light was coming in. I could not 'see' anything. Strangely, after watching this for what seemed a long time, I must have fallen asleep. Next morning when I looked out the back window, there was nothing to see but a steep wall of rock behind the hotel. Very early in the evening the hotel shuts off its electricity. There is nothing above the hotel except a small mountain path. I hiked up the mountain/cliff behind the hotel to see if I could discover where the light source was coming from. Nothing.  The path cast a view across to the temple of the Sun at MP. Make your own conclusions. The only other view is the mountain tops of the Andes and huge butterflies. I heard the mountains produce their own eeries lights. I met another person who also saw what I did that night. He was from Austrialia-doing oil exploration down in the Amazon Basin. We just could not figure it out, as nothing was up there [too high for helicopters in the night, moonless night?] but the hotel and us. The hoteliers saw nothing and said nothing is up there, could be no light, no electricity. It is so dark up there at night that when the electricity is turned off that I could not see my hand even when I placed flat against my nose. That is dark! But, something lit up MP that night. I will never know what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))",,40.9009,-80.8568

It looked just like a bright star except it was moving towards us.  It got much brighter as it drew overhead, about the size of the blunt end of a pencil held at arm’s length. At that moment we felt the truck move. It rose straight up in the air about a foot or two off the ground, floated to the middle of the road, and gently set down. Then the light moved back in the direction it came from and blinked out. My memories of that experience were verified by my friend when I contacted her for the first time more than 40 years later.  The first thing she said was, ""What do you remember about that night?""  We agreed on all the details except I remembered screaming and she remembered laughing.

I was ""helping"" my mom take things out to the car. She was going to take me with her to the new house that evening and I was excited about getting to play in all the new rooms. I remember going out the back door with something in my hand that I was going to take to the car. Mom was still inside the house. There was a very, very bright light. I looked up and there, hovering above the house, was this huge object that just seemed to be made up of very white, bright lights. I have no idea what shape it was and could not see anything but the lights. It was silent except for a strange electrical sound -- zed-zid, zed-zid -- and started to slowly move away from the house. I remember screaming and running inside, terrified and crying. I don't know how articulate I was in trying to get my mother to look outside and see if it was gone. She didn't see anything and couldn't understand why I was so upset. I refused to go outside again that night and lost all interest in going to the new house to play.

He has mentioned this story many times. While viewing the ABC special with Peter Jennings on 02/24/2005, at my asking, he elaborated this story in detail.  My father was a college student in Georgia at the time.  He was travelling to Greenville, SC on US 29.  This was before I-85 was constructed.  He told me that as he approached the Tugaloo River, which is also Lake Hartwell and also flows downstream to become the Savanah River, he came across something strange.  He was driving an MG convertible with the top up, as it was wintertime.  Before he crossed the bridge that spanned the river, he noticed a strange object that made him stop his vehicle and watch the event before crossing.  He saw a large cigar-shaped object that glided ""perfectly"" down river from his left to right.  He described the color as a distinct green.  I asked him if it was a phosphorous green like older computer monitors and he said that it was like that green, only more of an earthy green.  The object ""floated"" perfectly in the same direction.  My dad specifically stated how he noticed the precision of the object's movement.  The object continued out of sight down the river.  After the object was completely out of sight, my dad continued across the river.  He said that there was a car coming from the South Carolina side of the river that also stopped to watch the event before crossing.  He said that the driver of that car also decided to cross once the object was gone.  My dad said that he looked straight at the face of the driver of the other vehicle as they passed.  He described the driver as a white male who had an amazed look on his face.  The two vehicles continued on their way without stopping.  To this day, my dad says that he wishes that he would have stopped and spoken to the other driver.  My dad said that he rolled down the window of his MG while the object was moving in front of him and that the object made absolutely no sound.  He said that it seemed to almost ""absorb"" sound it was so quiet.  His vehicle never lost power throughout the entire event.  This description of events has remained constant throughour the many times that he has told me this.  He is older now, yet still very lucid in his description and would be willing to share this with others.  He is adamant that the event occured in January or February of 1960.  What is interesting is reading the other events concerning a green cigar in the early 1960s.  It is interesting to note that on two separate occasions, we have witnesses similar events at the same time over the last fifteen years while being about ten miles from each other.

As we live in la, we where traving south on the 1-15 and we had either just passed or were just approaching the 210 connection.  What was super strange about this sighting, is that this plane was huge. I would guestimate at least 4 to six times the size of the biggest bomber plane that I have ever seen. To say that it was about the size of a football field would possibly be accurate, but I have no way of accurately reporting the size for sure. This palne was incredible, and my web research it looks identical to the Black mantra or giant stealth bomber other peoples have seen.  What made this most remarkable is the craft drifted, at a very slow speed, that of the speed of a blimp, and maybe ever slower. In direction it seemed to be doing large circles around the town to our drivers side, and it would go way west of us, and then circle back. It seemed to be even holding its position for an instance, but we later realized it was just on a perspective that it must be moving in a direction towards us.  But this object was incredible, it was so massive and flew so slowly I felt it best to be reported here. It may not be an alien space craft, and I doubt it is, but l would bet this remains unidentified for some time.  My wife and I drove at 75 mph for about 15 minutes and the plane was still in view circling the city. This craft was also silent, for its size we expected to here some engine, but when we rolled down our windows we heard nothing. Maybe we were too far away, but I'd guess we were between 1-2 miles away from it. This was all a daytime experience. Thanks for letting me share my fasinating experience with you.

When the light subsided (approximately 10 seconds or so) there were (4) UFOs that came in one right after the other..  Moving extremely fast they came in and were in a group - then one moved to the right and took up a position not far from a star..the other three moved to the left and spaced themselves evenly apart and also became motionless at that time.   They went from being very bright to almost fading out completely and then they would all start to come into brightness again.  A type of synchronized strobbing was taking place with these (4) unknowns.   We watched for approximately 1 hour.  3 disappeared altogether from our sight as they went behind the tall pines in front of us.  The 4th stayed in place not moving - just changing in brightness from time to time.  The interesting thing about this was that the 4th unknown moved with the night skyline.  If we had not seen these 4 unknowns come into our skyline from the flash of light, we would have thought that they were just stars after they took up positions.   Exciting to say the least...

(This report may not fit the defintion for UFO reports, but I include this report since it is an odd event in my opinion; it may not have anything to do with UFO's.)  Navarre Beach, Florida December 12, 2005 starting  at 9:00AM Picture taking didn’t begin until  9:18AM and ended at 9:21AM.  On December 12, 2005, I was in Navarre Beach, Florida working on a construction site erecting a 29 story [level] condo.  At 9:00AM after being on the reed bar slab since 6:30AM,  I came down to the ground from the condo slab for my 9:00AM coffee break.  I was still wearing my polarized sunglasses at the time when I just happen to glance up into the sky and noticed what appeared to be a circular and grayish cloud with a colorful rainbow on the outer skirt of this circular-like cloud.  The barely noticeable rainbow completely encased  the round type cloud  similar to a halo effect.  I was thinking to myself, ""This is unusual.  I have never seen a cloud formation that was so perfectly round; not only that, I never seen a rainbow that was so perfectly round during the daytime, only a rainbow that was half a circle and normally connected to the ground at both ends.""     I removed momentarily my polarized sunglasses to see if I could see more clearly   defined details as in colorfulness in this rainbow that was on this unusual cloud effect.  To my dismay, the colorful rainbow effect was less perceivable than when I was wearing the sunglass and looking thru it at the rainbow.  This unusual cloud formation with the rainbow, kind of reminded me of what I once saw many years ago, when I was looking at the moon on a very cloudy night.  It had a rainbow ring around it when the moon shined through the clouds.  That phenomenon is explainable: When there is a high concentration of moisture within the cloud, the moonlight shinning through the cloud can possibly create a rainbow effect as in a halo around the moon.  When a halo effect around the moon is normally seen, this is usually a good indication that within a 24 hour period, there is a very good possibility of rain occurring in the region. I told my supervisor  who was standing next to me, and I guided him with my hands and pointing in the general direction of the unusual cloud formation with the rainbow on the outskirts of the grayish, circular cloud.  He could barely see with his eyes what I was showing him; yet, he was able to perceive that there was something there with a rainbow effect which was almost unnoticeable .  He joked that it could be a UFO, and I told him that I didn’t think it was a UFO but a very strange event; possibly Eglin experimenting with weather control which is a joke in itself.   I also told my boss as in a joke that is could be a wormhole, and that is how UFO’s were able to travel vast distant, but that was only as a joke; although, it had me thinking a little about it after I said it.  I told him I had a camera in my truck and asked him for permission if I can takes some pictures of this unusual cloud with the rainbow which he granted me permission.  I took 9 pictures with a digital camera. If I didn’t have to work at that moment, I would had taken more pictures and watched this cloud until it could no longer be seen.  Let it be known, there was no doctoring to the pictures that I had taken nor is there any hoax that I know of associated to the rainbow cloud mention above.  Not known at the time when the pictures were taken,  there had been some sighting on November 7, 2005 seen in the general area which is bizarre when you connect those UFO sighting with the odd cloud event.  I  may had witness maybe once in a lifetime an unusual cloud formation with the rainbow effect.  This could explain the event I saw several years ago of changing patterns of lights I saw at night which I originally thought to be a planet or large star.  I’m still searching for an answer for how a cloud can be formed perfectly circular with a rainbow effect.  If it were not for color gray inside the cloud, you could say it was a big bubble, but what could make a bubble that big?",2006-02-14T00:00:00,,

Unfortunatly because of the lights in the parking lot and the distance you cant see the distinct circles, but you can very clearly see a bright bursting line of light blended together, having a quick burst of orange and then slowly fading away (on the left center of the video screen). I waited to try and get another clip but did not see it for five minutes so I gave up.  As we walked into Costco it showed up one more time in the distance to the right of where we last saw it.

I was in my jacuzzi looking at the sky. Solar flares had been in the news starting April 7 and it was soon thereafter.  Exactly overhead I noticed an aberation moving across the sky.  A solar flare I thought.  But after watching it I noticed the well defined shape and that it had a couple of distinct characteristics. It was shaped like a long boomerang, but wasn't quite as angled, and it spanned a substantial section of the sky.  It looked matte black or dark gray. The entire inside edge was very sharp and the center section (perhaps 5-10% of the entire thing) seemed very hazy whereas the rest of the object was well defined.  It moved from south to north to the west of Sonoma as if following the I-5 Corridor  ((sic.  See below.  PD))  It continued north moving very fast, it was about 4 seconds until I couldn't see it anymore as it began to merge with the just-after-dusk sky. It was very high up.  I ran into the house to get my sister and she came out and we both looked. Within seconds we saw two planes together coming from the north. When they got to about halfway between where I first and last saw the object, one of the planes split off sharply and headed west. The other plane continued south. The planes appeared to be at the same height as the object and like most planes that high up, they just appeared as spots of light. In contrast the object had spanned an entire section of the sky which is why I thought initially it was a visual aberation from solar flares. (That could have something to do with an aura, but I didn't specifically see one.)  I went inside and figured the size by triangulation. I think it came out to somewhere between a mile or 2 wide. Somehow the size, height and speed had combined to make it feel very heavy and deliberate, like it was doing surveillance. It made me feel as if I had seen it, but it had also seen me. As if I'd inadvertantly and unintentially had a conscious exchange, like when I catch someone's eye.  I didn't jacuzzi at night for months afterward so I wouldn't be available for another encounter.

The location was in south Cypress, Ca.just east of Los Alamitos Airport. I was walking my dog near the Navy golf course. It was sunny out and the sky was mostly clear except for some cirrus clouds overhead. While my dog was sniffing around a gopher hole in the field, I looked up in the sky directly above me to look at the clouds,when I noticed a bright object that looked like a star sitting there among the clouds.  It was in blue, slightly hazy sky.  It actually was a little larger in appearance than a star. More like a small silvery disk. The pecular thing about it was that it was not moving at all.!!  Yet the cirrus clouds were moving to the east, they were drifting past the object while it remained in its exact spot in the sky. As I continued to watch the object,it occurred to me that it was too late in the morning for a star to be visible in the sky. Stars disappear shortly after sunrise. Thi object looked slightly larger than the star Sirius, but more like a metal disk than an actual star.  It looked silver in color.  It would brighten somewhat then dim in a regular pattern, about every few seconds. I observed this object for around 15 to 20 minutes.It did not move that entire time.My dog was getting impatient so I started walking while still looking up to watch the object.  All the time I watched it, it did not move from its location.   An occasional cirrus cloud would drift over it, sometimes obscurring it from view. This gave me the impression that the object was at least 40,000 feet high,since I think that is about how high cirrus clouds occur at.    From where I stood in the field,the object was overhead at about 70-80 degrees elevation  and at a direction of approximately 10-20 degrees east of true north.  Finally, it was obscurred completely by thicker clouds and that was the last that I saw the object. A Baloon would have drifted with the clouds. This object remained in that spot.  It definately looked metalic, though very far away.There was no sound that I could discern.  Due to the terrorist event of 911 just having occurred a few weeks before this sighting,my mind was not preparred to deal with this wierd event, so I put it in the  back of my mind.  Recently I was reading reports on your website and this experience of mine jumped back to my remembrance. I hope this is of interest!

It first begin when I was watching TV when my wife ran inside and told me to see this object outside.  The way she explained the object, was just not convincing to me.  So I walked outside to see what she was talking about.   My first response was NO WAY!  So I told her to get my binoculars so I can get a closer look.  Boy, all I can say was, ""Oh my this is the real thing, we are watching here"".   So I flash it with my flashlight.  To see what would happen..  But nothing happen, it just kept on flying on.   At one point I thought about shooting this object with my rifle to see what would happen.  Because it was flying at a low altitude. We seen this craft on a clear night.  Also we live out in the country where our nearest neighor is about 4 miles away.  We can see the stars with great clarity.  It made no noise, a black triangle shape and also what was so unique about this feature was, it had low dim lights on each end of the triangle.

My father was looking out the big picture window in the living room at an object in the sky. He called me over and said ""Karen, look, come look at that!"" I rushed over and we watched a black object continually change shapes for about 3-4 minutes.  It was not shiny, not reflective and it turned over and over or changed shapes.  It was pretty low in the sky, not plane height, maybe as high as a helicopter.  It was coming from the direction of the power plant in Sarnia (approx. 35 miles away).  It's movement was meandering and it changed shapes and slowly meandered in our direction.  It would go one way and go the other, didn't go up and down, continued at same height.  It came really close to us and still we couldn't make out a definite shape to it.  It was cute to watch for it's ""unconcerned"" way of moving. Then it's started slowly meandering away from us, changing shapes and moving in it's funny way.  We watched it do that for about a minute.  Then suddenly, it zoomed incredibly fast until it disappeared into nothing.  It moved so fast, it became a black dot, then nothing.  It didn't move up, it just continued moving horizontal but in a linear fashion.  No meandering, just zoom until it was out of our sight. We still talk about it.

At 10:45 on Wednesday, September 14th 2005, my friend Silas and I had finished running on the track at Vinncennes University in Knox County, Indiana. Before I go farther, I should mention that I have a private pilot's liscense for hot air balloons. Thus I have a very good idea of distances and sizes as they relate to airborne objects.  I am familiar with the airspace around the University.  We were laying on the pole vault mat, looking upward, facing the westward sky, and at approximately 10:45 pm (22:45) a large,  cigar shaped object descended from the cloud cover.  The broad side of the object was parallel to the ground, and what could be considered the nose was at approximately 80 degrees to the direction of travel.  Flying no more than 1000 feet agl directly over us, I could tell because the ceiling that night was 2500 ft, and flew directly over us. We were perfectly aligned to see it, as it flew between the moon, (~3 days before a full moon) and our position.  As it flew over us, I estimated it to be about 300 ft. long.  There was a faint purple aura around the margins, and it appeared to spin clockwise at moderate speed.  It appeared to be constructed from some sort of metal, and gave the impression of a brownish color. Moving to the east at roughly 75 mph, soundlessly, it passed over us and came to a complete stop.   At that point, it changed shape into what looked to be a boomerang.  At this point, it moved to the north, back to the west, hovered, would move to the south, then southwest, stop , hover and move again.  It appeared to be doing some sort of manoeuver.  Finally, it changed shape one more time and became a cube-like structure, it began moving to the east again very rapidly.  I was extremely disturbed by this image.  It then disappeared behind a building, and we pursued it on foot, but when we moved behind the building it had completely disappeared. Vincennes University and surrounding is a MOA, and there are scheduled dogfights with F-16 fighters regularly.  I know what these occurences look like. This was not one of them.  I notified the FAA, and was informed that the MOA just hours before was scheduled to be shutdown for dogfighting for the night.   At the last second, the dogfights were cancelled and the F-16s were grounded.  Not more than 1-2 hours after the figure had disappeared, the MOA was active again with airborne F-16s engaging in dogfights. Other people were present during the sighting, at least 200 yds away, but had no concrete view of the craft because the angle between the moon and the craft was wrong.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,38.6389,-87.5276

I live in a rural area and the house is used as a summer residence so my first concern was that the house might be on fire.  Since I knew no one was there I became somewhat amused that the orange glow grew brighter while a shaft of light seemed to emanate upward from the origin of the glow.  I was home alone with my two year old son and I'm also a member of the local volunteer fire department.  Since I was already situated so close to the scene I thought I would jump into my vehicle after checking on my son.  He was in a ""jumper saucer"" and could safely be left alone for a few minutes so I grabbed a fire extinguisher and headed outside for my vehicle. For whatever reason I did not feel that I should call in and report a possible fire.  When I got back outside, the orange glow seemed to decrease however, the shaft of orange light intensified.  I honestly started to attribute this to the house being on fire and the main fuel source starting to concentrate the burn in the middle of the structure.  As I headed to my vehicle to drive over the property, I looked over and saw that that the shaft of light had intensified and reached up to what I could best describe as a large rotating circular spoke similar to a wagon wheel as if I was viewing it on an edge which would make it somewhat of an ecclipse or oval shape. I entered and started my vehicle and drove down my driveway for a distance of approximately 300 feet. I stopped and the orange glow was still present.    At this point I was very aprehensive given that my son was alone in the house but I drove toward the neighbouring property where I could still see the light.

It was in a triangle shape and moved very slow seemed to be black or very dark in color it flew over us stopped hovered above us for some time as if to be watching us. It didnt really scare me I had a feeling it was ok, like perhaps checking observation equipment or something.  It however was unusally quiet, and was flying at an unbelievable height, I couldn't believe it was so close to us and moving so slowly, it arrived with no sound hardly at all and left with no sound above a slight humming. As it left the lights seemed to appear to come on as if on some type of dimmer switch but as it left I felt a very slight breeze thats just how low it was.  That year I went to the VP Fair to see the Harrier to see for myself if it moved in the same manner, the manuvers were the same but the sound and shape were not,  I've often wondered if it was of our own and felt as tho it was now I believe just that after the 2005 sighting in Sidney Texas,it was good to hear he could read the words on it, thanks for the reporting!",2005-05-24T00:00:00,39.0413,-90.15

It happened during the summer, about 7 or 8 years ago, and my cousins and I were bored and so we decided to go see a movie. But before we left, I had to finish up a load of laundry.  Now, our house is the middle house in a cul-de-sac, so when we open our garage door, it faces the cul-de-sac and the street that leads into it. Our washing machine and and dryer are in there, and so when we do the wash, we can see the outside world.  After putting the clothes in the washer I opened the door to the house, to go back inside. The door, is the kind, that when open, it automatically shuts close, real fast. Well, I opened the door, and all of a sudden, my entire garage is flooded in a bright neon lime-green light.  I turn around and see that the entire neighborhood is flooded in this light. Everywhere I looked, everything was covered in this light, as if someone was holding a light, right over our cul-de-sac. I didnt see any object, but after about 10 seconds, of being in light, this huge shadow came out of nowhere and then flew off to the western sky. And then there was this weird wind (like a suction)and the trees blew along with other debri, to the west and then stopped.  The light ""flew"" off too, and everything turned back to normal. I turned around and started to walk back in the house. Now, all this time, the door has been opened. And if you recall, I told you that it was one of those sprung doors, that shut as quickly as it opened. Well, right then and there, the door shut, right over my left foot, ripping up my nail on my big toe.  The Dr. said, the nail would never grow back, because the nerves had been lifted out, but it did, and to this day, my toe has a nail. Something, my Dr. said was a ""miracle.""

We've been in our home since Feb. 2003 and live in a small rural neighborhood on the outskirts of town.  On the Night in question we had just returned to our yard after a leisurely walk around the block with our dog Trina.  The sky was basically clear with only a few small clouds scattered here and there.  We decided to play fetch with Trina in the field behind our house,(5 acres of flat treeless land).  I'm a stargazer and am constantly looking for shooting stars when the heavens permit.  Looking into the northeastern sky, I saw 3 points of light, in triangle form, moving at a steady pace high in the atmosphere traveling southeast. (I am not  too sure on the direction of travel) I pointed the lights out to my husband, he suggested it was a plane.  It may well have been but the lights were not blinking and there was no sound. Like I stated earlier, we live in a rural  area and it is very quiet and dark, with the exception of the occasional car passing.  We both watched the light formation for around 10 minutes. Without warning the lights vanished.  I would like to say that it went behind a unseen cloud but the exact area it vanished at was spotted with stars and there were no clouds anywhere near.  We continued to watch, thinking that if it indeed went behind a unseen cloud that surely it would reappear.  15 minutes later there was still no sign of the object.  The object moved steadily and made no stops or turns.  We were sober, as we both niether drink alcohol or use drugs. Although I have been a believer for many years my husband became one on that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

These smaller, gray, oval shaped objects were traveling at speeds and in a way that.... As I don't really like to be looked at like a fool, I've always kept this story for my close friends and family for a long time but now that I just found this website I decided I should let the rest of the world know what I've seen.  Just for the record, I am Canadian, but now living and working in Shanghai, China, as a teacher. I've been living in Shanghai for now two years and this happened sometime around April 2004. Anyway, I was going to the supermarket with my girlfriend in Shanghai, China, near Jing An Temple area.  All of a sudden, I noticed something like a fireball in the sky. At first I thought it might be a meteor or something like that but as I have seen a meteor/comet previously in my life, I quickly felt it probably wasn't, mostly because of the extremely slow speed this object was moving at.  After looking more carefully, I noticed it looked more like a huge, red glowing object with 3 visible glowing parts and a long red/fire-looking trail.  It was moving very slowly towards west.  Suddenly, I noticed that there were other gray objects moving very fast around it!  Perhaps 2 or 4 of them, I am not sure as many were visible at the same time.  Once again, at first I thought it was something normal, just like jet fighters.  But that's when it got very interesting!  These smaller, gray, oval shaped objects were actually traveling at speeds and in a way that I've never, ever seen in my life.  I think its worthy of mention that I grew up near an airport in Canada and every other year we have this huge air show I always attended.  I've seen a huge variety of army aircrafts in action, including F-15s, F-18s, Vertical take off planes, F-117 (stealth airplanes) and so on so I can safely affirm that in my opinion, there is no way these could have been any aircrafts that the world knows of.  These objects could stop all of a sudden, disappear, show up again, go up, down, in a way that is not possible by any know aircrafts.  Anyways, these objects seemed to move around and follow the bigger, fire-orange, glowing object with a big trail behind it. I could observe this for about 5 minutes before the big object disappeared behind tall residential towers with the smaller objects seeming to fade away as well.  This happened almost a year ago but immediately after the event I went home and tried to somehow put into images what I've seen while it was fresh in my mind.  As I'm a web designer and being very familiar with the Flash software, I decided that the best way to make this look as close to reality as possible was to reproduce the objects in photoshop and animate them with Flash.   So I took a picture from the same place I observed this and put that picture as the background.  I then added the big glowing object and tried to make it move at about the same speed as It was moving.  Lastly, I've added the smaller, oval shaped crafts and tried to animate them as close to the way they moved as possible.  I think the result is very very close to the reality of what I saw that day and I hope I could share this with the rest of the world as well. The only thing that might be slightly different from the reality is the fog, which is difficult to reproduce properly. During the actual sighting these objects were very slightly less visible than that because of the fog. But this is nonetheless a very good representation of what they looked like.

I guess there was.  8^) Commute milwaukee to chicago every weekday and usually get to see lots of crazy stuff on I94.  Most of it makes for a funny story.  On a particular night last year, I was driving north on 94 about 1/2 way through Kenosha county and noticed a green ball of light traveling pretty fast over what appeard to probably east enough to have been over the lake Michican shore line.  It was leaving a pretty long trail, of hazy smoke that I thought had a greenish tint to it as well.  The oblect itself was quite bright as it was dusk and it was very easy to see from the road.  It was also very unmistakebly a very emerald green color.  At first I thought it might be a satalite burning up on re-entry.  But it plain old seemed to big for that.  I watched it for about a minute and then looked back at the road, when I looked back up it was gone ( I assumed it burned up ) It was headed roughly 340 degrees ( Compass ) from my perspective it was around 80 degrees above the horizon, I would guess the alt at roughtly 15 thousand feet.  It was definatly moveing fast.  What I find interesting is that the other reports involve it being visible from dramticly different areas, and running in different directions.  I have retold the story enough since that night to keep the details pretty solid.  Especially the color the trail and the direction it was running and where I was when I saw it.

Dad was screaming hysterically and they sedated him or something and put him in the wall in a drawer.  It was all shiny inside, the best I could say for years was like chrome plating but better quality with round tables and what I called Marble Statues that were alive and in charge.  I crawlled up to the talles and hit it on the foot for putting dad in the drawer and it rageed at me.  I was sucked into it's big black hollow eyes and then we were at home.  Only damage to car was paint burnt off roof and it sat in the yard for years.  I was taken often after that, from my bed at night.  The strangest part is tht all of our neighbours son's were killed at the exact same spot, at least 4 of them. I recently came across an old article about a sighting and abduction from the same spot a year earlier, and indeed it has been documented by several people. The whole townof Maryborough watched what I described as a fireworks show several years later that ws witnessed by thousands of people.  I still have to see a fireworks display that beats this one. Also of note is that at the same time in France at a place called Clunies (coincidence maybe) the same things were going on. I have a hankering to buy some land there and setle and so does my little sister who must have been conceived at about that exact night. In later years as I reached my 20's the little ones changed from the nice little chaps to taller blonde beings after I moved to Perth and these beings came across as sexy and nice but then turned out to be constructs with many inpliments and instruments coming from their bodies, the pain was horrid.

Dad thinks it was some sort of nightclub, of which I still have not found one yet to match and why a nightclub in the middle of the bush (like putting one at yellowstone or something).  No one knows how we got home that night and no-one ever went near the car again till it was sold some 25 years on. The visits were very frequent inmy early years.For some reason the news articles do not mention clunes in Australian article but I made the immediate connection as it was only less than 10 miles away as per the french sightings. It was like fire to me that is how brightly the object glowed outside. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",,,
A solid black cylinder shape moving across the ground then rising like a shadow,Milford,CT,,other,1 minute,"Occurred : 6/15/1963 03:00  (Entered as : 06/15/1963 3:00) Reported: 3/1/2005 3:48:37 PM 15:48 Posted: 4/16/2005 Location: Milford, CT Shape: Other Duration:1 minute",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42622.html,"A solid black cylinder shape moving across the ground then rising like a shadow I was a Police Officer on duty during the 11PM to 7:00AM shift in the central business district. I was operating a Jeep with a canvas top with the top in place.  I had driven half a mile to a gas station where there was a Soft drink machine. I bought a bottle of Coca Cola, and drove to the center of town and into a parking lot with buildings on three sides intending to sit for a few minutes and enjoy my drink. I was backed in near the the rear of the lot facing the street.  There was only a car now and then that was passing by, and the area was deserted and very quiet due to the hour. As I sat drinking my soda, I became aware in my peripheral vision of some kind of movement to my right.  In this direction was a long narrow driveway that rose up from a street below that ran along the banks of the Wepawaug River.  I was shocked and alarmed to see coming up the hill on the ground a deep black ""patch"", about 15 feet wide and 30 feet long.  It had the shape of a large gasoline storage tank of the type buried at gasoline stations, but just the ""footprint"" as it had no height at all.  What really scared me was that my first assumption that it was a shadow of something passing overhead was not confirmed by my frantic look out the window and up, and by the fact that it seemed to be completely opague, that is I could not see the ground under it, and it looked for all the world like it could have been a huge piece of black velvet, and it had that kind of a visual texture.  It was moving toward me very slowly, perhaps less than two miles per hour. I had enough time to really panic and then when I decided to jump out and run, it was too late because it was over me.  I spun around wildly in my seat looking in every direction expecting something to come in after me, but nothing did.  Then I saw that it had passed over me and was again on the ground moving very slowly away from me in the same direction, toward the two story building to my left about 100 feet away.  I again looked out expecting to see something overhead, but there was nothing. It continued moving toward the building, flowed up off the grounf and up the side of the building at the same deliberate slow pace and dissaperaed across the roof and was gone.  There were stars out, no lights in the parking lot, and nothing I am aware of drove by during the minue or so that it took for all of this to happen.  I was too afraid to move for about five munutes, during which time I kept looking around to be sure nothing else was going to happen. I then got up the courage to drive out of the lot at high speed. I was afraid to go back there again for weeks.  I never reported this for obvious reasons (except to family and friends of course), not needing the ridicule that was sure to follow. I was about 22 years old at the time, very wide awake and alert, and not at all tired. I remember it vividly as I was so terrified by it.  A relative (sane and rational to the best of my knowledge, as I believe I am) told me he had seen something like it some time earlier near a swamp in Milford, and we concluded that there might be some connection to water, as what I had seen did come up the hill from an area close to a small river.  One thing that stands out in my mind is that I remember questioning my own sanity  halfway through, when the thing was over me and I could not see any sign of it, hoping that was the end of it, but then the shock of seeing it reappear as it continued away from me, and the fact that it took enough time that I had a good opportunity to reconfirm what it looked like the last time I saw it, and the fact that even as it climbed the wall of the building, you could not see the building behind it, and it did not in any way seem to be a shadow, but a solid ""thing"" of some sort.  I still make no conclusion about what it was, but I do know I have no desire to see anything like it again, at least not when I find myself in such a vulnerable position.

I awoke my wife (now ex) and told her I was going out to see what was going on, all the while I was aware of a loud humming sound, similar to an electric turbine noise.  I grabbed ny .303 rifle and some shells and a flashighlight and proceeded to open the door to the side yard, the moment I stepped outside the light disappeared and the noise suddenly stopped, I walked out into the yard and there was not a thing to be seen.  During the time the light was on I had looked out of the rear bedroom window and noticed a large doe deer in the backyard under one of our apple trees, I shone my flashlight in that direction while outside but she had gone.  I should point out that our houses were on a remote road gravel with the nearest neighbor some 300 yards away, there were no other neighbors within a mile in either direction.

We stopped the car to drop off our friend on 42nd and I street, across from the old Shortstop Cafe.  It was dusk.  My brother and I looked up and saw a saucer-shaped object with a dome on top, about 100 feet in diameter, lights around the edges. It was probably 200 feet above the maple tree in our friend's yard.  My brother told my dad, who proceeded to yell to everyone in the neighborhood.  This was in the early 60's before air conditioning was prevalent, so many people had the solid exterior doors open and heard him through their screen doors.  Most of the neighborhood reacted to my dad's yelling about seeing a flying saucer by coming out and seeing for themselves.  It made no sound.  All we heard was the rustling of the leaves in the tree, and the oh-my-god's of the people.  It hovered quietly for seemed like an eternity - probably 5 minutes or so.  It then dashed southeast probably a half-mile or so within a couple of seconds max, then zig-zagged out of view.  Dad had a camera in the glove compartment of the car, but chose not to take pictures of the UFO, in fears that the police force would not look favorably on it (I guess there had been reports that had been refuted and reputations consequently questioned).  No one can convince me that I did not see a UFO that evening.  It was not an airplane,  helicopter or weather balloon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

The object disappeared over or into one of the clouds; I wondered if it was a weather balloon.  And I suppose it could have been, except that it came back out from the cloud to its previous position.  This motion was repeated twice again, then it failed to reappear.  I had the distinct impression that it was trying to hide.  Since the clouds were small, I watched for perhaps better than ten minutes, waiting for the object to reappear on the other side.

I went outside to put dog on leash. It's very cold out, probably in the minus degrees.

I do and very quickly go out and start filming.  It is huge at first in my viewfinder then recede on it's own like it knew right away I had a camera.  My hands are shaking a bit but I am keeping camera as steady as possible.  Throughout the entire sighting till it fades away I always have the object in the viewfinder. It appears to rotate and is really a very large object. It recedes back away from the viewfinder at a gradual rate until it just disappears by fading out!  This all happens in about 2 minutes. I have the closeup button pressed all the way within a second or two of beginning filming and it stays like that till it completely fades out.  Then about 7:40 pm I went out again and saw a plane in the same vicinity as the object I had just filmed so I filmed that, then pointed the camera around for reference and showed the huge moon (in the completely opposite direction of the object).   Where my home is when I use the compass if north is 360, E is 90, S is 180 and W 270, then the object was at about 240 and the moon at about 30.

It was one of those cold, slightly windy nights so I would stay out for a few minutes and observe, and then come in the slider to warm up for a couple minutes and go outside again. (because I was close to the warmth and wasn't dressed really properly)   On about the third time I went outside and looked up I got a glimpse of three objects, moving very quickly from north-south zoom over our townhouse complex. I saw the objects for perhaps 2 seconds as they passed through my FOV visually. I ran upstairs and out the front door but at the speed they were travelling I knew I'd never catch a glimpse. This is what I know I observed about these objects:  1. There was three of them 2. They were all travelling at the same speed 3. Two of them were closer then the third in the formation 4. There was no blinking lights 5. They made NO sound as they passed overhead 6. They had a orangish glow about them 7. They flew very fast 8.

I'm a Captain of a tugboat and was returning to my dock after finishing a job.  I was heading outbound on the St Johns River entering Trout River Cut on a NE course.   The weather was poor all day with rain and wind and the weather at the time of this sighting not exactly perfect with rain squalls and wind.  As I turned into the cut I could make out one white light up ahead about a mile and a half off of my bow slightly to starboard.  I figured it was probably a small vessel that I would keep an eye on.  As I got a little closer I notice two lights, one on top of the other, like the mast lights of a tug with a tow so I gave a security call on my VHF with no response.  I checked my radar but it was obscured with the rain and was, "" all greened out"".  The lights seemed to be stationary about a mile or so ahead of me and seemed to be at or just above water level.   About a minute later I was becoming concerned about having to meet a tow in this narrow channel in this kind of weather, so I decided to shine my spotlight at the lights.  I did this to make the other vessel aware that I was heading in its direction and to also try and see if I could tell what kind of ""boat"" I was about to meet.   As soon as I hit the lights with my spotlight it made a Bee-line right for me at a pretty good pace.  I immediately turned off my spotlight and thought "" Oh great, I just blinded a Navy Helicopter pilot from Mayport"".  But as the light came closer more white lights appeared kinda in a line with the center light brighter and the lights out to the side of it dimmer.  I got this weird chill up my spine and thought ""Holly Crap its a $@#!@^% UFO!""   It passed  my tug down the starboard side at about a 40 degree upward angle.  It was probably about 200 feet off of the water heading rapidly SW.  As it passed I could make out a dark triangle silhouette with 6 to 8 white lights in a V shape on the underside.  It was fairly large , about the size of a bus.    I watched as it passed and the silhouette against the low clouds looked almost saucer like from the back.  In few seconds it was gone heading towards downtown Jacksonville.  I never heard a sound. I have ran tugs for a while and have never seen anything like this.  I have never believed in little green men or any of that other stuff but this shook me up.  I had 3 other crewmen on the tug with me but 2 of them where off watch and sleeping and my engineer was making his rounds.   It spooked me so much I had my engineer sit with me in the wheelhouse the rest of the trip.  I did not tell him why, just that the weather was bad.  He could tell I was shook up and I brushed it off for fear of him thinking I was seeing things.   I've heard other mariners say they have seen things but I always didn't really give it much mind until now.    As soon as I got home I went online to look for information and am amazed at all of the similar sightings.  I now have a new prospective and I'm a little uneasy about what I might run across while I'm at sea. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Witness 1 was driving W-bound on Hwy 98 near Navarre when he observed a formation of 5 bright white lights in the dark WNW sky.  He continued to watch the formation of lights in an attempt to identify what type of aircraft they were.  As he continued driving W, he realized the formation (described as sort of a diamond shape) wasn't moving, but just hung in the sky at approx 35-40 degrees elevation.  Since he was driving, he couldn't remain visually fixed on the formation, and after approx 10 mins of glancing while driving, he glanced back and realized the lights were no longer there.  He did not see them depart, but claims he had only looked away from the formation to the road a matter of a few seconds. Witness 2 was also driving W-bound on Hwy 98 near Navarre and observed a similar formation of lights.  He at first assumed they were AFSOC helos on a night training mission, but after several minutes of driving realized his helos were still there, in the same angular, diamond-like formation, and the lights continued to hold position, hovering at what appeared to be very high altitude.  He said as he continued his drive W he doubted his helicopter formation theory more and more, especially when the formation broke apart.  He described the formation break as a one-by-one realignment into almost a straight line, with some decending and some ascending, then the light on the far end of the formation suddenly veered away from the others and vanished.  This pattern of breakaway continued for the next minute, until all the lights were gone.  He has no explanation as to the source of the lights, but is very familiar with flares and other air-ordnance which could cause illumination, and stated ""These lights were under controlled guidance."" Witness 3 was driving N on Hwy 87 after turning from it's intersection w/Hwy 98.  He witnessed ""several bright lights"" through the trees off to the western sky.  He at first thought they were stars or planets, but as he got more glimpses through the trees, he said he realized they were ""way too bright"" to be either stars or planets.  He then also assumed they were a formation of helos doing night ops, and didn't pay much more attention until he turned W-bound off Hwy 87 onto East Bay Rd just south of Holley.  That was when he saw the lights better and re-evaluated them as ""unknown.""  He only saw them for a minute or less after turning onto East Bay Rd before each light ""took off like a bat outta hell"" and the lights winked off, one by one.  He said he believes there were four or five lights in all. None of the above three Air Force flyers reported seeing other aircraft in the sky during their incidents, and all three reported the times at somewhere between 18:30 and 18:50, lasting from 5-10 mins in duration.

My sons came running into the house talking about lights in the sky, so I went out and ran over to an E-W street w/them for a unobstructed view.   What we all (a couple neighbors also came out and witnessed them) were five bright lights (amber-colored) which were holding steady in the shape of a giant ""W"" up in the night sky.   The formation was approx 25 degrees abv horizon, sky was clear and dark (1.5 hrs after sunset.)  The lights held position, evenly-spaced, for approx 5 mins, during which time I ran back inside my house to get the video camera, but battery was dead!    At one point, watched a small, civilian plane approach the formation, then turn away and circle a couple times before departing.  From our perspective, believe the plane was closer to us than the bright lights.  When ""W"" formation broke apart, they did so one by one, starting w/furthest N or right side, turn away, then vanish after a couple seconds, then next one, and so on.  Next day, I spoke w/military contacts who researched and told me no milair was up over the Eglin reservation in NW Florida at time of sighting.   Am a retired USAF Special Ops aviator w/nearly 5,000 hrs of flight time in a wide range of fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, and I can't explain what we watched that night.   Also, learned several active duty AF people witnessed the lights that night and couldn't explain them, either.  As a former journalist and military aviator, I consider myself pretty level-headed and thorough. ((ADDENDUM #1 OF 2 TO ORIGINAL REPORT)) Formation of five bright amber lights held a hover in ""W"" formation over NW FL Mon 7 Nov 1840L (Addendum to earlier report) Witnessed a formation of very bright, amber-colored lights holding a ""W"" formation and hovering at steady altitude approx 15 miles distance, directly west of our location, angle of elevation approx 25 degrees from horizon.  I am a retired AF Special Ops aviator w/nearly 5,000 hours in a multitude of both fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft.  I've seen flares, SAM and air-to-air missile launches.  These lights were none of the above.  They held formation for approx 5 mins, then one by one, broke formation and disappeared w/in a few seconds of each other.  There were no milair in the area (Eglin Military Reservation) at the time of sighting (I checked w/base) but one small civilian plane did fly into the area during time of sighting.  It flew N to S, crossing in front of formation, then circled a 180 back N until it was clear of our view, then did a 360 before departing back to N.  We all felt the small plane was closer to us than the bright lights, since we could see it's red and green wing beacons and white anti-collision strobe.  The bright lights were evenly spaced and held perfectly still in the ""W"" formation for the five minutes I saw them. ((END ADDENDUM #1))  ((ADDENDUM #2 OF 2 TO ORIGINAL REPORT)) Multiple AD USAF witnesses report formation of bright lights hovering over rural Santa Rosa County FL Addendum 2 to earlier report - This is a compilation of three additional witness accounts who are active duty Air Force flyers who did not want to be identified. Witness 1 was driving W-bound on Hwy 98 near Navarre when he observed a formation of 5 bright white lights in the dark WNW sky.  He continued to watch the formation of lights in an attempt to identify what type of aircraft they were.  As he continued driving W, he realized the formation (described as sort of a diamond shape) wasn't moving, but just hung in the sky at approx 35-40 degrees elevation.  Since he was driving, he couldn't remain visually fixed on the formation, and after approx 10 mins of glancing while driving, he glanced back and realized the lights were no longer there.  He did not see them depart, but claims he had only looked away from the formation to the road a matter of a few seconds. Witness 2 was also driving W-bound on Hwy 98 near Navarre and observed a similar formation of lights.  He at first assumed they were AFSOC helos on a night training mission, but after several minutes of driving realized his helos were still there, in the same angular, diamond-like formation, and the lights continued to hold position, hovering at what appeared to be very high altitude.  He said as he continued his drive W he doubted his helicopter formation theory more and more, especially when the formation broke apart.  He described the formation break as a one-by-one realignment into almost a straight line, with some decending and some ascending, then the light on the far end of the formation suddenly veered away from the others and vanished.  This pattern of breakaway continued for the next minute, until all the lights were gone.  He has no explanation as to the source of the lights, but is very familiar with flares and other air-ordnance which could cause illumination, and stated ""These lights were under controlled guidance."" Witness 3 was driving N on Hwy 87 after turning from it's intersection w/Hwy 98.  He witnessed ""several bright lights"" through the trees off to the western sky.  He at first thought they were stars or planets, but as he got more glimpses through the trees, he said he realized they were ""way too bright"" to be either stars or planets.  He then also assumed they were a formation of helos doing night ops, and didn't pay much more attention until he turned W-bound off Hwy 87 onto East Bay Rd just south of Holley.  That was when he saw the lights better and re-evaluated them as ""unknown.""  He only saw them for a minute or less after turning onto East Bay Rd before each light ""took off like a bat outta hell"" and the lights winked off, one by one.  He said he believes there were four or five lights in all. None of the above three Air Force flyers reported seeing other aircraft in the sky during their incidents, and all three reported the times at somewhere between 18:30 and 18:50, lasting from 5-10 mins in duration.

While looking south at the moon, at about SSE, there was an object that was was Very Bright, way to bright to be star or planet and way to bright to be a plane sitting stationary (we are right in the fly way for an airport so we know what planes look like coming in ).  I called my wife and had her come out and she also witnesed the object.  The object was there tell I finished my cigerette.  When I went back out about about 15 minutes later it was gone.   I probably would not have reported it, but noticed some one in MTKA MN had seen what sounds to be the exact same thing (and where I was looking was right where MTKA would be) but there sighting seems to be a little later. Whatever it was, it was BRIGHT. ((NUFORC Note:  We note that the planet Mars would have been in generally the same area of the sky that the witness indicates above.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I have already sent a report on this, but wanted to mention a mistake I made. The object I seen was SSW. Would of there been possibly a star in this area? I was looking directly South. The moon was out and this object was was about halfway between the horizon and the moon and about 15 degrees to the right. Exactly where the MTKA sighting was on the same date. Not that I was seeing the same object. But it was really something to see. If anyone could just give me friendly email to let me know, it would be very much appreciated. I Have always been very interested in UFO's ever since as a child at the age of about 13 me and about 6 other kids were out in a swampy area in Minnetonka, where I grew up. We used to go out in the cat tails and and pat down a circle and hang out together. One evening it was getting dark, and we all decided that we should probably get going. We all stood up and, when one of my friends looked up and said hey look at that! I looked up and to my surprise was three star looking objects in a triangle. the wierd thing is that this tringle of three star looking objects were so high up that they looked to be up in space, and also that they were moving at a slight angle straight up into space. As far away as they were ( if you held out a marble in your fingers that's about how spaced they were), the triangle had to be so far apart I can't even begin wonder how far apart they were to make that triangle. They just kept moving almost staight up into space tell we couldn't see them. This all happenend in a matter of about 20 to 30 seconds. Very impressive.

I didn't know where to send these photographs I took during the comet [Machholz] fly by in January of this year (2005). These were to be it's final appearance nights from my vantage points in Southern Miami along Biscayne Bay. In fact, all shots were taken of the Southern view from my apartment terrace.  Take note that Turkey Nuclear power plant would be also due south of this vantage point.  I am not sure what significance that would have on the objects I saw but I just wanted to mention that in this correspondence.  I have compiled a lot of the photos together after viewing them carefully. I didn't want to be mistaken about this.  On that night, of January 7, 2005, I was preparing to take photos of the comet with my two digital cameras. I had also set up my telescope in hopes of getting some real close shots. It was about 8 or 9 pm and I thought of just testing the cameras out before actually viewing with the telescope.  Without a flash, I proceeded to take several consecutive shots using all settings of SQ, HQ, and SHQ  to determine what would give me the best clarity of the moment. I also took shots with a flash as to bring in the buildings across the lake. This dark and light exposure would give me a perspective of distance. If the flash proved to be too bright to capture the comet and it's surrounding stars, I was going to refrain from that usage and just concentrate on keeping the camera as still as possible on the tripod and hope for the best. As the results will show, I got more than I expected to. I downloaded the first set on to my computer to view and possible see if I caught the right detail of the comet. The shots without the flash were scanned and then I got to the pics that used a flash.  I saw something odd in the pictures. Some sort of cylindrical shapes were showing up. ODD...........I never saw that before and I have taken thousand of pics at the night sky. I have an Olympus program on my computer that enabled me to magnify, clarify, and view the objects at closer range. They appeared to be circular in shape with a distinct indentation at an angle of the sphere. Now where did I see that before.  The memory of the first Star Wars episode came to mind and I was thinking back of that same shape exhibited in the film. DEATHSTAR. Now that was real strange. As I continued to scan the photos, I saw that there was not one object but several, ranging in size from distant to close enough to touch. The flash of the camera must have reflected it's fast light on these objects and for some reason produced the image or should I say images.  All the photos I have included are original and without tampering of except for enhancement of the shots themselves. I needed some answers on this because to me it is just too unexplainable. As I researched further on the net, I found some comaparisons that are just too coincendtal. And then, not too long after these pictures were taken, an event of captured moons of Saturn..........was it Saturn or Jupiter?....... Were shown on several sites and news pages of a moon that looked very similar to the shapes I had captured on that cool night in January. I hope someone can clarify this data I am sending you. Have these objects been around all the time or have they just appeared for my benefit? Is there something going on (not again), that the human public is unaware of? And why are there so many? Usually a person can capture a UFO or whatever, and it's a single image of one object. Sometimes you might see two, three, or even four. But this many in one area of the sky. My sincere hope is just to get this information out to the people so they can decide for themselves and the experts can debate over what they really were.",2005-05-11T00:00:00,25.7741427135084,-80.28951850011829

I have witnessed at least 15 unidentifiable objects since 2000. All have had similar characteristics but no other definition than they look like stars. What has made these objects unique to other things in the sky is either their sudden appearance and dissappearance, pulsing or flashing light sources and even their movement.  I will however will post my last sighting as I can still remember the details of what happened that night better than other times and wish to not use any more space discussing them on this post. (I promise, I will see more). ;)  It was between 1:00 am and 1:10 am when I was outside of my house staring up at the sky. It was then when I noticed something awkward in the sky south of my visual point. The sky was as clear as it could be in this suburban neighborhood when I noticed an object glowing brighter. This object looked very much like a star, but I caught the fact that it wasn't there a few seconds or minutes before actually noticing that it was not part of the sky map that I had in my current working memory.  What kept my interest in observing it as I mentioned in the paragraph above was that this ""thing"" was glowing in slightly faster pulses than a regular star. It slightly moved vertically, came to a pause and then for some even odder reason, it looked like it dropped (or spilled) sometype of gaseus or liquid material the same color as this ""star"".  I wish I could say it was a trail of its movement, but this stuff came out of it after it was stationed for a few fractions of a second.  This thing was reddish in color, in fact it was similar to Mars but much brighter. When this fluid or gaseus like substance spilled, I became slightly nervous thinking that it could have been a supernova.  Immediately as I heard my father coming towards the door, I called him to run out as quickly as possible to witness this thing with me.  He made it on time to see the remaining activity.  The gaseous dropping was gone, but the object remained, however the pulses began to accelerate.  As we were watching these flashing pulses, the object either began to drift away or shrink. Nevertheless, I can agree with anyone that it was fading away, and it did until there was no visual of it. We did not remove our eyes for not even five approximate seconds when this object began reappearing in the same position that it dissappeared in. The light from the object began to increase in brightness or size (or both) again. The flashes returned until it reached it's approximate original size, and seconds later it gradually began to dissappear again.  This was not the first sighting I have had. This is also not the first sighting I have had with the company of a witness either.  I cannot draw any conclusions or judgements that this object was any type of spacecraft, however, this and others similar that I have witnessed hold no other place than to be anomolies of some sort, or they can be purely a perceptual construct of something entirely natural.  It is very easy to say that compared to any airplanes, helicopters, fireworks, meteors, comets, flare guns, or any other objects I have seen these sightings I've had separate themselves from anything else I have seen that's logically explainable. This last object like the others was much higher and brighter than other areal objects for its distance.  The stationary positions and their slow movement separate them from things I am accustomed to see in the air as well.  My background is fairly simple. I am a 32 year old hispanic male. I live in the city of Carson. My hobbies are amateur radio, programming, networking, and Unix operating system hobbyst. I work as System Administrator, and a computer engineering major at Devry University. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The 5 and 805 freeways split very near the base, just to the north and west of the base. The 805 runs nearest just under the flight path while the 5 runs near the coast and its 5 or 10 miles to the west of the base.  On the night of 2/12/05 the 805 freeway was closed for several miles north and south of the base. From the 805 you can see the base, from the 5 you can not see the base. All traffic was diverted to the 5 on Sat. and Sunday nights.  I have no idea if there is a connection but my thoughts are that if they were testing something there and didn't want people from the freeway to see it then they would close it off and divert traffic. They did this on several weekends. What was odd about this is that there is a short section of the 805 that is being repaired near the Mira Mesa exit. There was no reason to have the detour go as far as south as it did. The next connecting freeway was 7 or 8 miles south of the 5 and 805 split. So both the north and south bound sections of the 805 were blocked off for 10 miles, 3 miles north of the base and 7 miles south of the base.  It made me think, why?  Now I read what that guy wrote and wonder, maybe? ((NUFORC Note:  If anyone can provide more information about this alleged traffic diversion, we would welcome an explanation of what happened there.  We have no reason, at this time, to assume that the traffic diversion had anything to do with UFO's.  PD))",2005-05-11T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

The V formation had 8 or 9 lights and used up a huge area of the sky.  Each ship had an intense orange light shooting up into the sky. When the orange light was on, there was no blinking white light. The flight pattern would change, like geese flying in formation, when the first in line backs off to let another move up to the front.  We could see the lights for at least 5 minutes.""

Two would flash, then more would come, they would turn their orange lights on. I saw them from one side of the lake to the other.""  He was able to see underneath the craft and made a sketch of it.  A view of the bottom shows a square craft with one large light off-set to one corner.  The 3rd witness said, ""I saw beams of light shine up, down, at each other.  There were quite a few.  I've seen UFO's from a distance and was still skeptical, but this, there's no doubt."" The 3 fishermen were quite spooked, packed up quickly, started the boat, and got back to the dock right away.  The lights were last seen going out of view towards Meredith. Note:  The 3 had seen many ""shooting stars"", probably a dozen, earlier in the evening.  They had marveled at seeing so many.

I made my morning coffee and went to let my dog outside. I am a smoker, so I was sitting at my patio table having a cigatette. The day was clear. The sun was shining. There were a few clouds in the sky, but most of the sky was blue. It was like any other morning. I heard the bus pick up students for school and leave, after that, it was pretty quiet, just a few crickets. I don't think I would have ever noticed the UFO, if it had not been for the jumbo jet I heard coming from somewhere in the sky. I automatically looked up to see it. The jumbo jet came from the front of my house, which is the East. My patio set is in the backyard, so i couldn't see the jet at first. What caught my eye was a very large rectangular shape. It was perfectly rectangular, had no wings on it at all and there were also no lights on it as well. What I thought was so strange was that it had absolutely no sound. Its color stood out because it looked very shiny against the sky. Almost a whiteish greyish color. I could still see it completely as it passed the few clouds in the sky. It was moving very slowly in a very straight path from South to North. I could still hear the jumbo jet getting closer and I wondered if the pilot of the jet would see it as well. As the jet approached it looked as though the 2 would collide. The jet was coming from the Southeast to the Northwest. I thought to myself, ""Some air controller is going to get his warning for the year."" I waited to see what happened. It looked to me like the jumbo jet just made it under the rectangle. The rectangle never swayed, it kept its same path and speed, as did the jet. I watched the UFO keep its path South to North. The jet, I think, would have probably landed at the Atlanta Airport. As the object got closer to the North, I could barely see that it had a very small bubble on the East side of the craft. It was just enough for me to know that it, on the other side, was not perfectly rectangular. I smoked my whole cigarette, watching it the entire time. I lit another cigarette and kept watching it. I noticed that the jumbo jet was so far away that I could no longer hear the noise from it and it was quiet again and I still heard no noise from the rectangualar object. There was no trail behind it. As I looked at it in the sky, I figured that it was about 1 inch long and somewhere between 1/4 inch in height, maybe alittle less. My dog had no reaction to it at all. I watched it until I could no longer see it. The only time it was not above the tree line and in clear view was when it was going to the North  and getting farther away. It was still visable enough to see the small bubble on the East side of the craft. I never thought to go inside and get my camera, although I had PLENTY of time to have gotten it. I am so sorry that I didn't snap a picture of it, but the thought never came to my mind until my boyfriend asked why I hadn't. I could have had 100 pictures of it because it was moving so slowly. As for my background, I am a homemaker at the moment. Engaged to be married and have been in Acworth, Ga. for almost 2 months now. We moved from Clarksville, TN. due to my boyfriends job transfer. I am a woman, 35 years old and have a 13 year old son. The night before, I had a full 8 hours of sleep and started my day as any other, getting my son off to school. I was not taking any medication for anything.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,34.05107468354431,-84.67985569620254

It went in all directions, kind of slowly, like it was watching us.  We kept our eye on it, and continued to the store.  There is a mall on the way to the store (Northtwone Mall) with a street that goes around it, so we turned to drive around the mall, that way we could drive slowly and keep an eye on it.   It followed us of course, and seemed to get closer.  There were people at the mall, about to go to the movies, so we asked them if they saw it and 2 guys said yes.  This is the first time that you could see the shape of it because it was getting close.  It was kind of a saucer, but there seemed to be some kind of gear hanging out of the bottom, like landing gear, and lights.   We stopped at the corner of Detroit and Alexis and it turned slowly and hovered down Alexis Road.

"Ball of light traveling at a high rate of speed over Keflavik Iceland, circa late summer 1998.",Keflavik (Iceland),,1998-08-15T19:00:00,circle,6-8 seconds,"Occurred : 8/15/1998 19:00  (Entered as : 08/15/1998 19:00) Reported: 4/28/2005 12:19:57 AM 00:19 Posted: 5/24/2005 Location: Keflavik (Iceland),  Shape: Circle Duration:6-8 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43676.html,"Ball of light traveling at a high rate of speed over Keflavik Iceland, circa late summer 1998. I was walking with a friend down a side street in Keflavik Iceland in late August 1998 to go to the movies. The street was very wide, so I had an almost completely unobstructed view of the sky.  As is my habit, I looked up at the sky because the sky is very beautiful there, especially in the late summer. Although it was about 7:00 PM, it was still completely light out with no stars or planets visible, the sky still a brilliant azure. There were a few scattered clouds.  Suddenly, I saw a ball of light, but it was moving. It seemed to alternate between yellow and white in color, and it seemed to be quite high in altitude. I want to guess about 20 to 30 thousand feet (?). Because of the altitude, it looked to be about double the size of Venus, but not as brilliant, though it was bright.  I could not see the actual shape, or if it was an actual craft, but it did appear circular. The shape remained constant, though the colors seemed to change.  The main reason for this submission, though, is the rate of speed with which the object traveled.  I first noticed the light when it was a little less than halfway across the horizon, almost directly overhead.  It was completely out of sight in about 6 to 8 seconds.  It also had a very flat, straight flight pattern, totally different from what you would see if you were watching a jumbo jet flying overhead, which tend to appear as if they are dragging across lazily the sky, hardly moving, and at an angle to the horizon.  Speaking of jumbo jets flying at about 20 to 30 thousand feet, they seem to take forever before you lose sight of them, and they travel at about 650 MPH.  Though I do not possess the mathematical expertise to calculate it accurately, I am pretty certain that whatever can race halfway across the horizon in less than 10 seconds at that altitude must be able to move at an alarming rate of speed.  If it was something man made, I hope it is in the American inventory.  As with my one other sighting, I was in a state of what I like to refer to as a calm astonishment, unable to speak out to my friend about it. I believe I mentioned it aterwards, but the response was pretty lackluster, as is often the case. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2005-05-24T00:00:00,,

Everything depends on where you live and are watching from. Please read this full document and visit my domain for more information. Millions in the Western Hemisphere are watching this portal since my August 27th Press Release thanks to KOMO Channel 4 Seattle, WA    The red UFO images are only to show where to look, you will only see, with your eyes, three very small, glowing red alien security craft that are there 24/7. They look like laser dots, if you’ve seen a laser pin, that is all you will see, if you can see them from your location. As the earth rotates to the south, this location stays in its location under the Star Arcturus. It can be seen by other countries during spring, summer, fall and winter. Ask your local weather news station when it will be available for viewing in your area.  Thank you for your request. I’m very sorry; the news Press release miss quoted what I can/will do: I will send information to you, so you can find the portal; I will not send my PowerPoint presentations over the internet to anyone. If you want to see my PowerPoint presentations, I’m the creator and the MC which will explain what is taking place and how important it is, all humans on Earth must know something is taking place. I will gladly perform a presentation to your Town/Township/County/City/State/Country anywhere on this planet. We can discuss the cost plus transportation/lodging. Please contact all News agencies, TV Studios and request an Event Coordinator to open an event to the public in your town/area.  Three red glowing alien security vehicles are controlling what I call “UFO Universe Freeway Portal” which myself and many others have been watching since 1968. On August 24th, 2004 they showed up and have closed down this portal and have stopped mother ships from dropping off/unloading their planetary ships. This also means, the UFO’s that are on Earth, can’t leave, which is another problem.  If you want to know exactly what is taking place contact me by email, the location and contact information. I have the equipment to show 100 to 100,000+ attendees. Please make calls, use your local yellow pages and find a good venue location, or call a Florist in your area, they are knowledgeable for event locations in your area. Thanks again – enjoy watching the heavens, may it open your eyes*** Email: fantasiapro@fidalgo.net  The following images are from my presentation, which will last 2 – 2 ½ hour.

Copy this, laminate it: Fax/Email/Scan/Use for meetings/friends/family/UFO Believers    You have to have good eyes to see these ships; they’re very small and are hard to see, they look like red laser dots. The Entrance is @500KM above Earth. The layout for the Triangle with the center being the portal opens at @500KM It only lies over, looks like they're at the Stars, they're not, when watching them, they park sometimes lined up over Muphrid, or will travel up and around Arcturus making it look like they’re ""at the Star location"". It's an overlay, which looks so real, has if they are next to the stars. You have to be in a dark area, not in a city or around bright street lights If you can SEE red in a black/dark area you should be able to see them, (Persons who can’t: Welders, Red/Green blindness and Diabetics #2) You can only see them, if you have a direct line sight of the Dipper The Big Dipper is moving North over Canada for the winter/actually, the Earth is rotating southerly. This Portal stays in its position. Binoculars; were made for daytime, not looking for something that is @500KM away, in complete darkness. Telescopes aren’t working well because of such small red dots and they’re not sitting around to have their picture taken (electronic/motorized scopes can’t move and follow them), has the Earth rotates, the location is constantly moving, if you have a tracking telescope, that helps, but the UFO’s are moving.

Metallic Ball at WPG air show  The date given is my best guess the year could have been +or- 1.  II could obtain the exact year from old friend who lived at address, but if anyone wants to check into it further it was on the first or second Day of the Winnipeg international air show.  My Brother, a friend and myself were watching the air show from another friend’s balcony. It was the top floor (14th?) facing east. I was on the balcony having a smoke and watching the ""Snow birds"" do there routine. They broke formation and one flew past the apartment (approx height and distance to follow).  As it did I caught sight of what looked like a metal flake that came off the plane. (This was not in the area prior to the plane passing by)   After watching it for about 4 seconds it became very apparent to me that this was not a piece of the plane. It was round like a beach ball (refer to following beach ball description) 6 feet in diameter and very shiny.  There was no light except for its metallic reflection. Picture one of those beach balls that is divided into 8 different colored sections, now remove 3 of them. The larger side (5 slices) was bright polished metallic in color. The 3 missing sections were just that, missing and you could see the inside of the shiny side, which appeared dimmer. I yelled for everyone to ""get out here and see this thing before its gone"" they came out expecting to see some part of the air show, but all had the same ""what the H@#l is that"" reaction I did. It was aprox 500' or more off the ground (snow birds might be able to provide better distances) and about 1000-1500' (3 or 4 residential blocks) away. It was very clear what we were seeing, the sky was blue, only a few nimbus clouds and a moderate wind (20 kmh? could check airport weather for exact info)  It rotated consistently about 1 per second giving it a pulsating look. It remand fixed at that point in the sky for about 2 minutes, then began to move straight up over the course of 20 to 30 min (still rotating) completely unaffected by the air currents that day. We watched it until it was no longer visible.  I would like to include here that myself and one of my friends both saw what looked like 2 specs (very high altitude approximately 5 min prior to losing sight) These specs moved very fast side by side formation from the SE to NW as they passed the ""ball"" they made some sporadic movements then continued NW and out of sight over the apartment we were in. (It is very possible that the specs were a trick of the eye from looking up at the blue for so long however we both saw them around the same time do similar motions) I am sure that more must have seen this as thousands were watching the air show that day and the plane I was watching would have led others to look in that direction not to mention the pilot himself might have seen it.  I will include here the areas of the city I am referring to but If necessary can be removed. We were located in the ((apartment name deleted)) east phase ((floor deleted)) floor. The object would have been over Thompson Dr between Portage and Ness ave. (1 or 2 block radius but possible further out)  The plane was moving in a NW to SE direction.  I feel this sighting must be looked at closer (daytime sighting, with the possibility of multiple witnesses, in multiple locations.)  I have included legitimate contact information. Please get in touch.  Drawings and maps can be provided if requested. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",2005-05-24T00:00:00,49.891260040733194,-97.15285022403258

Then he said ""man, that bird is really high!"".   With that I looked up to see a triangular craft moving S.E. at a very high rate of speed.  The object was between layers of Cirrus and Altostratus clouds, or between 8,000 and 15,000 feet.  It moved in a straight line from directly overhead to beyond the horizon in approximately 30 seconds.   A commercial airliner passed by at about the same altitude (using the couds as reference) a few minutes later, which helped to verify our altitude estimates and moved like a slug relative to the speedy object.  I am certain that we are visited, but more certain that most sightings (like this one) are military craft.  What a wonderful cover for our spy agencies!

I noticed that the big cumulo-nimbus cloud in front of me suddenly lit up.  As I looked up, I saw about six or seven circular beams of light decending down through the cloud. They were all in a perfect circle and rotating counter clockwise (from a ground perspective). They fanned out away from each other slightly. They took up most of the whole cloud...very big...it was hard to estimate the size of the source, but it was quite large and the lights would have had to have been very strong to penetrate that far. I know because I have been a Professional Commercial Photographer for over 25 years.  The object was behind the cloud because the light source was strongest at the top and disipated as it fell through the cloud....I would guess a couple of hundred feet below the cloud.  During this time the lights continued to rotate at an even moderate rate.  After I had viewed this for around 20 seconds, the whole thing, still rotating, did a pitch and yaw manouver and then slowly ascended back vertically, lighting up the whole cloud again as it departed.  The size and behaviour of the light source ruled out any aircraft that I know as I have worked in very many aircraft and helicopters.  Although at no time did I see the object itself, the combination of vertical movement, rotation and pitch & yaw was most unusual. As a photographer, I know that the light was decending through the cloud and not reflected from the ground or from any other source.

The events that transpired that night I have only ever shared with my wife; who the other Marine has shared it with I do not know, but we never spoke of the incident or reported out of fear.   I have been in several combat situations, but this was the most terrifying moment in my life.  I reluctantly share it now as I have tried to never think of it after I made it through that night. We were on duty that night at the main armory for that area of base.  We had been on this post quite a lot and had become familiar with the surroundings inside and out.  We were locked into the perimeter after the last Marine that worked in the armory left, as we were every night.  We had no key for obvious security reasons. I was the first to see it.  It crested a hill approximately eight hundred meters to the east of the armory.  I thought it strange but we were on a military base so it could be anything.  As the object moved closer I realized that it was something I was unfamiliar with and not another marine or piece of equipment.  My gut was that something was very wrong.   At this moment I called the other Marine over to see what he thought.  We radioed in to the guard HQ but could not adequately describe whatever it was and they felt it to be no threat so the response team was not sent.   It approached at a slow enough rate of speed that we were coming up with all kinds of explanations from hummers to snipers but as it got to within a hundred yards we realized that we were in trouble.  The trip from the top of the hill took approximately eight to ten minutes to this point.  We immediately locked and loaded and took defensive positions. The object was not like anything I have ever seen so to compare it to anything would be pointless but I will do my best to describe it.  It was a sphere, a ball of glowing blue light.  It was not bright, it did not shine.  The best way to describe it is that it was a fluorescent blue ball of light that could move.  The glow of the light was slightly more intense in the center, but I would not say that it was the source.  It was translucent and I could see no object or anything that would lead me to believe that it was solid in anyway but it had a definite shape.  It was positioned about 15 feet above the ground and was about three to four feet in diameter.   I don’t know if it actually got smaller as it approached because it looked larger when it was further out.  There was no sound coming from the object.  It stopped above the front gate guard shack for a few seconds and then proceeded toward the armory.  At this point I almost fired on the object but fear of what it might be and what might happen, and the thought that I was going crazy, made me wait.  From my observation I really don’t believe there was anything a bullet could have harmed.  Have no doubt that had it come closer to me I would have fired anyway.   The object continued toward the armory until it came to a point above the center and then began to move downward.  I could not see the object actually enter the armory as the perimeter fence prevented us from moving back that far, however we knew it was in the armory because the inside of the armory began to glow the same blue color.  At this point we tried multiple times to raise someone on the radio but all attempts failed, not due to equipment malfunction, but because the ((deleted)) on the other end fell asleep.   The glow coming out of the window on the front door seemed to get brighter and darker, so I assume it was in motion inside the armory.  Three and a half hours after I first saw the object it raised up outside the armory and continued directly upward at a much faster speed than it approached.   We waited for a brief while and decided together not to tell anyone as we wanted to avoid the repercussions that sharing this story with anyone, especially our chain of command, would bring.  We did watch in fear as the first armory Marine showed up at 0500 and walked inside, as we had not told him what had happened.  Nothing seemed to be out of place or harmed so we kept quiet.   This is the first time I have shared this full story as I have only told my wife that I saw something while guarding an armory that scared the shit out of me.  I can only imagine that what ever it was was checking out the weapons inside as there were thousands of them and many different types.   No harm came to me or my fellow Marine.  I AM POSITIVE beyond a shadow of a doubt that this was not gas, a light trick or some kind of light coming from Venus.  Believe me when I tell you I wish it was.  I was not amazed.  I was locked in a very secure fence with something that I did not feel I could protect myself from and I had no idea what it was.  I was petrified.

It was just hanging there, about 30 deg up on the horizon. The brim was jet black in color and the crown was a cream color.

At first I couldn’t see anything, but then I saw a group of objects that I at first mistook for birds. They looked about the size of a dinner plate but as they descended and grew larger I could see that they were in fact discs.  They were dull white in color and rising and falling as if they were riding a wave and going very slowly. They looked to be approximately 5 to 6 feet across. Estimating their true size was difficult as I had no idea how high they were.  I counted 9 of them, and as they leveled out in a very ragged two abreast formation, one then turned and went away to the south west, but when it reached a certain point it just pure and simply dissolved into nothing. I was absolutely amazed at what I was seeing.  I then turned my attention back to the others and focused on the next leading disc and it dissolved in the same manner.  At first it began to go black at the front then turned into deep olive green and as it was turning at the same time I could just make out a bulge at the top before it dissolved into a cloud of black dots.   Like pixels on a computer.  There was no flashing lights or any kind of noise. And all the while their speed never varied, each one of them disappeared at the same point in the cloudless blue sky as silent as they came. The whole episode lasted for about two minutes.

It was late at night last September, and I was at our family's cabin outside of Pine Bush, NY (home to much UFO activity in previous years). I stepped outside for some fresh air and to look at the stars as it was a very clear and dark night. After a short while, I noticed a strange flying object appear in my line of sight (a lot of trees on the property), moving in a straight line northeast to southwest. It flew at medium-to-low altitude and at a consistent rate of medium-fast speed, nothing outrageous. But what was strange was that it seemed to be rectangular, with approximately 6-9 dim reddish-amber lights placed at odd positions around the craft (not symmetrical), and it flew entirely silent through the still, cold, autumn night air. The Orange County Municipal airport is about 10 miles away, and we see all kinds of private aircraft and ultralight homebuilt planes fly over during the day. But they all make plenty of standard aircraft engine noise, and at night, always have the required symmetrical lighting and flashing strobe light. Though I did witness this in the dark of night, the rectangular craft did not remotely appear to be any kind of conventional aircraft whatsoever. Most importantly, it was totally silent with strange non-regulation lights. I am a 48-year old artist, musician, graphic designer, and arts educator from New York City, so I feel like I am visually literate. I am a fairly recent newcomer to this small summertime bungalow co-op here in  Pine Bush, though my wife's family have been members for 20+ years. While I have not witnessed any previous UFO activity in the 5 summers I have been coming here, nearly all long-term co-op members have UFO stories of their own to tell from back when this whole area was a UFO hotspot. One woman and her ex- both insist that about 15 years ago they were physically restrained in their beds during a ""close encounter"" and witnessed a saucer take off out of the neighbor's field. I am only filing this report now as I recently discovered your organization and web site, and just today read someone else's account of a flying rectangle.

Lewis at the time, I don't remember which. I can't recall the exact time and date, I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to find out, I'm fairly certain it was October.   My neighbor and I were outside talking and he remarked he was watching the F-16s or whatever they were doing circles around what I guess was the Puget Sound area.  We were guessing they were circling because GW was in town and the whole terrorist threat and all that was (is) going on.   As we looked over the roof of my apartment which from my position is south to south east, we both saw three orange circles that seemed to dance around and change formation in random order. They changed places but never intersected, very quickly, while moving east.  I didn't see them disappear, as I took my eyes off them to tell my wife to come look, I asked my neighbor, ""Did you see that?"" and he said ""Yes."" I said ""What WAS that?"". At first I thought the jets were chasing it or it was chasing the jets, but it was too hard to judge the distance. It looked like it could have been 100 feet away or 2 miles away. The reason I couldn't judge the distance, I think, was because it was unlike anything I'd ever seen in the sky.  They weren't like lights because the edges were crisp, or at least not blurry, something in between.  They didn't glow so much as they were just ""on"". It was hard to tell if they changed shape as they maneuvered because they moved so fast. They looked very close at first, because of their clarity...but they made no sound, and so I reasoned that they could not be close. I think they got smaller as they danced away, it was hard to tell. It all happened so fast. Maybe four seconds. I then reasoned it may have been a reflection off my glasses or something but my neighbor saw it too. I got very excited about what I just saw. I told my wife I saw a UFO or ""something"". My neighbor and I tried to figure out what it could have been, and came to the conclusion it must have been a UFO, as it was unlike anything we had ever seen. Right after it all happened, I went back outside and looked up in that direction hoping to see something more, but after several minutes I thought it foolish to think I would see something like that again in the same place in the universe. To this day, I cannot accurately describe what they looked like- not bright like a light, no discernable three dimensional shape except circular; almost like putting a flashlight to a piece of clear-orange plastic, but not glowing(?).    When I say ""danced"", it was not a zig-zagging movement so much as it was a quick and fluid motion, so fast I didn't see a pattern to it.  They seemed to randomly switch around positions in a very, very tight ""formation"" as they moved in a group.  Proportionately, if they were billiard ball size, the ""formation"" never got more than, if even, five billiard balls across in any direction.  The whole thing was over so quickly, I imagine it may have been only two seconds, I really don't know.  Two days ago I talked with my neighbor and recalled that night and we both agree we have no idea what we saw.  He is from what I know of him an average and honest guy,  maybe 10 or 15 years older than I am.  I have never asked him if he has ever seen a UFO, but he seemed to me to be fairly accepting and not so surprised as I was.  Kinda like, ""Yep, there's one right there.""  The people I work with would laugh at me if I told them, although my family did not.  Although I may have marked it on my calendar (which I have since thrown away), and I don't recall the exact day, I'll never forget seeing whatever it was I saw.

I must have been there at least half an hour when I saw the big, metalic saucer flying overhead. I just froze the watching it fly over me, it was strange. You could see it had a metallic glint and at the same time it was sort of transparent, so that as it moved you could see the stars above it, but as though they were being sort of reflected from the bottom (even though the stars were above it). It was sort of like a when you put a magnifying lens close to you at a distance to something. And stranger yet was that it was flying quite low, I was on a balcony (and I was'nt to high up) and it was just like two average houses high above me...  It flew by, leaving me there staring and shocked. I went inside to make sure the two kids where ok and minutes later my mom entered with her friend. I told them about what I'd seen and they told me about something strange they'd seen in the sea. They were lights, but not normal. And they sort of sank into the ocean and disapeared.

However, when I was looking straight up, a movememnt in the peripheral feild of vision in my right eye made me look towards the western sky, at a degree of 60 from the western horizon. The sky was cloudy due to a cyclone in the Arabian sea. But, luckily, a small linear break in the clouds allowed me to see a V-SHAPED/Boomerang shaped UFO which was visible in that hour only because of the lights , circular, atleast 6 of them under its structure.  It was moving from west to east.  Speed was about that which normal airliners take over cities.  It made NO NOISE AT ALL.  Inspite of that flying at cloud level (clouds during cyclones are somewhat low in altitude) , there was no engine noise/ no noise due to aerodynamic disturbance.  Its size, I estimate it to be bigger than a boeing747.  Shape, and illustration of the UFO , I am submitting a jpg file by email to this site.  And I am almost sure that the UFO which I saw was not a secret military aircraft.  Reasons: 1) the Noiseless flight. If it were to be using a jet engine, even if the engine was hidden inside the airframe, it would have emitted some sound, flying at that low altitude.  2) The big light emitting circles under it. Why would a 'stealth aircraft' have such lights underneath it? the meaning of stealth itself if challenged if a stealth aircraft travels over a highly populated city like Bangalore, that too at low altitude, that too with light emitting circles under it.

AS WHERE IT WAS AT THE TIME WAS IN THE FLIGHT PATH OF A LOCAL SMALL AIRPORT, SEVERAL TIMES AS I WATCHED IT A SMALL PLANE, PIPER CUB WOULD APPROACH AND THE CRAFT WOULD DECEND TO A ALTITUDE THAT PUT IT TOO LOW FOR ME TO SEE IT, AS IF BEHIND TREE LINES. AFTER THE PLANE PASSED IT ROSE AGAIN AND SLOWLY MADE ITS WAY TOWARDS MY DIRECTION. I WAS RIDING MY BIKE BACK FROM THE STORE DURING THIS TIME.

AT THIS TIME IT WAS NO MORE THAN A BASEBALL FIELD IN HEIGHT ABOVE ME.AS I LOOKED AT IT, IT APPEARED TO BE METALLIC, AND HAD LIGHTS AROUND THE EDGE. I CAN NOT REMEMBER NOW IF THE LIGHTS WERE SPINNING OR NOT, BUT I DONT BELEIVE SO. WHAT STRUCK ME WAS THAT THE DOME PART OF THE CRAFT SEEMED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF WINDOW. I SAY SOME SORT, BECAUSE THEY SEEMED METALLIC BUT SOMEWHAT TRANSPARENT. I COULDN'T SEE INSIDE BUT COULD SEE LIGHT AS IF A LITE INERIOR AND THE SILOUETTE OF SOME BEING.

THEY HEARD THE COMMOTION AND ALSO SAID THAT THEY HAD ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS. WE WATCHED IT FOR SEVERAL MORE MINUTES AS IT MOVED FROM EAST TO WEST AND BACK AS IF SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING OR LOOKING AT SOMETHING. AT THIS POINT THE SKY WAS PRETTY DARK AND THE MOON WAS FULL IN THE LOW EASTERN SKY. THE CRAFT MADE A FAST TRACK UPWARD AND TOWARDS THE WEST, THEN MADE A INSTANT TURN EAST AND WITHIN  A SPAN OF LESS THAN A COUPLE SECONDS AT MOST IT  WAS ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE HORIZON FROM EAST TO WEST AND OUT OF SITE. I WILL  SAY THAT WHERE I LIVE AT THE TIME WAS JUST OUTSIDE OF WHAT WAS THE ORLANDO AIRFORCE BASE. WHICH LATER BECAME ORLANDO NAVAL BASE. IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOME MILITARY EXPERIMENT, BUT I HAD NEVER AND TO THIS DATE, STILL HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING THAT MOVED THAT FAST, TURNED ON A DIME AND DISAPPEARED SO QUICKLY. ALSO, I HAD SEEN BLIMPS IT WAS NOT ONE OF THESE. IT NEVER HAD ANY SOUND THAT IT MADE. EVEN WHEN IT LEFT SO FAST. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT BROKE THE SOUND BARRIOR, BUT NO BOOM WAS HEARD OR THE SOUND OF AIR DISTURBANCE.ANOTHER THING THAT AFTER THE FACT AND AS I GOT OLDER IS THAT I NEVER FELT ANY FEAR, EVEN THOUGH I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS WATCHING ME AS IT HOVERED ABOVE ME.

Several of my brothers and sisters were with me when my mother brought us food shopping.  She had been driving one of those old stationwagons that had the back seat facing out the back window.   It was summertime, I remember because the back window was wide open.  We were on our way home and I don't remember which of us were sitting back there but as Mom made a right turn we were facing the Wanaque reservoir.   All of a sudden, as Mom made that turn, we were staring straight at a silver disc hovering not more than 30 feet above the water, only about 50 feet away from us.  I remember all of the kids screaming at Mom to stop the car.  I just remember all of us screaming, but it wasn't really fear.  More excitement, I believe.   Well, Mom had to drive up the road a short ways so that she could turn the car around, but by the time we got back there, it was gone.  Mom did see it in the rearview mirror when she heard all the commotion we were making.  The disc was about 50 feet long, shining silver and silent as it hovered.  I nor any of my family reported it.  I'm really not sure why.   For some strange reason, maybe because we were all so young (I'm second youngest of six)none of us discussed the sighting for years. I've talked to a couple of my siblings about it when we got older.  We all remember it the same way.  I went to the Ringwood library to see if they had any information or old news clippings about that event. As it turns out, many people saw the same thing.  UFO's seemed to make an appearance for that entire weekend.  People from all around would park there cars around the reservoir day and night and many reported night sightings.   My mother, who has since passed, remembered men in dark suits but she wasn't sure what they were doing there or how they knew what was going on that weekend.  She was never approached by these men.   A few years ago, I read a book-Above Top Secret-by Mr.Goode and sure enough, he had reports in his book about the Wanaque reservoir sightings. Since then, I have spoken to a few ""old"" Ringwoodites about whether they had ever had sightings and to my surprise, many had.  But none had seen a daylight sighting. Only the night sightings.

The large bright glowing oval object moved silently parallel to the ground, just above and beyond the top of a tree covered shale bluff on the other side of a small river we were camping at. The object lit up the area as if it were early dawn, tree frogs became earily silent. When the object was directly in front of my tent opening, it stopped for perhaps 4 or 5 seconds and then decended steadily in at a 45 degree angle behind the shale bluff. The light then suddenly went out at about the time one might have expected it to have ""landed"" on the other side of the bluff. The light did not fade out, but went off as if someone had flipped a switch. The size of the object is difficult to determine, but gauging from the the size of the trees in the area and the short distance to the bluff, I would estimate it as being somewhere between 50 to 75 feet across.

It could move very slowly or very quickly but either way it moved without making any noise.,Dushore,PA,,disk,5 minutes,"Occurred : 10/1/1965 21:00  (Entered as : 10/01/1965 21:00) Reported: 3/6/2005 1:10:37 AM 01:10 Posted: 4/16/2005 Location: Dushore, PA Shape: Disk Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42743.html,"It could move very slowly or very quickly but either way it moved without making any noise. In 1965 I was 21 years old and worked for GE in Utica N.Y. in the radio receiver department.  I earned a two year degree in Electronic Technology after I graduated from high school in 1962 and went to work for GE.  Later I worked for AT&T at a Microwave Relay Station.  AT&T transfered me to a Satellite Earth Station where I worked for 17 more years.  I retired from AT&T after 32 years service.  I have never smoked a cigarette, never did drugs, and I have never a had a beer in my life.  I have two daughters, one is an OBGYN doctor and the other is a speech pathologist.  They have had to listen to this account since they were old enough to understand it.   This is what happened, nothing has been added to make a better ""story""!  What follows is the truth as I lived it.   It was Sunday night and I am not sure of the exact date.  I was returning to Utica, N.Y., where I lived, after a weekend home with my parents in the Loyalsock Creek area of Pennsylvania.  I had just purchased my new TR-4 car and was going north on Route 87 about 21:00 at night.  About an hour into the trip, I noticed some lights off to the right of the road.  I traveled this route many times and knew that the only thing in that direction was an empty field and what we call a mountain here in Pennsylvania.  The lights made me curious because they were red and green and flashing like the old railroad crossing once did.  The only difference was one side was green and the other was red.  If I had to describe the colors for someone, I would say they were ""Christmas Red and Green"".   I slowed down and looked right and decided I had plenty of time so I would stop and satisfy my curiosity.  My first thought was that I was looking at someone working on the mountain side, maybe cutting lumber, but that didn't fit.  Next I thought it could be a helicoptor, but this was 1965 and we just didn't see that many of them.  I stopped my TR-4 in my lane of a two lane highway.  This was a very remote area at that time and I wasn't worried about traffic.  I looked at the lights and wondered just what this could be?   It was about 200 yards away from me and looked to be about 100 feet up the hill.  I shut off my car and let the headlights on so if that rare bit traffic would approach, they would be able to see me.  A Triumph is very small so I was able to reach over and roll down the window without getting out of the drivers seat.  I leaned over and put my arms on the open window and turned my head to hear what sound was coming from the lights.  No noise at all, except for the sounds of the October night.  I looked at the red and green flashing light and wondered just what was going on over on the hill.  I can't remember which side was green and which side was red.  As I sat in my car trying to figure out just what it was, that I was looking at, I became aware that it wasn't on the mountain side, like I first thought, but in front of the hill and above the field.  This soon became very clear to me because what I was looking at had started to move.  One thing people have the ability to do is determine if someing coming towards them is going to go left or right or directly at them.  The lights were coming directly at me at about 50 feet above the field.  I remember thinking ""Wow what is that"", when I became aware of two very obvious conditions.   First, this thing was 50 feet up in the air and was moving very slowly directly towards me!  Second, it was completely silent!  No noise at all!  I remember thinking that nothing that size could be in the air and moving towards me without making any noise, it just isn't possible.  It was about 50 feet wide and 10 feet high, I would guess.  And I hate to say it because this is the point when people start walking away, but it was saucer shaped.   I watched it approach me until I realized that it was coming very slowly directly at me and it wasn't a blimp or helicoptor or plane or anything else that I have ever seen.  At that age we tend not to be afraid of anything and think that we are 10 feet tall and bullet proof.  It took a lot to get me afraid in those days.   At that point I started to think that I wasn't in a good spot since this thing was very slowly going to be right on top of me in a very short time.  Whatever I was watching was also watching me!  I decided to get out of there fast!  I rolled up the window and started up my TR-4 and put it in first gear and stepped on it!  I just had time to put it in second gear when I realized that there was, what I thought at the time, another one directly in front of me.  It was just off to the side of the road above the guard rail and about the height of a telephone pole.  I thought, there are two of them!  I quickly looked back to the center of the field to find the other one and it wasn't there.  I realized that the one I had been watching move so very slowly towards me had moved about 150 yards and came to a complete stop in about 3 seconds.  There it was with those red and green lights flashing and it was only about 50 feet above the road.  I looked back and forth again, yes it was the only one.  It couldn't have moved that far and that fast and been able to stop in 3 seconds.  It did all of that and never made a noise, complete silence!  All except one noise, my heart was beating so fast and hard that I could feel it in my throat.   I have never been that frightened in my life before or after that night.  My first thought was to hit the brakes and not drive under it.  It didn't take me long to figure out that if I hit the brakes and stopped I would end up parked directly under it.  I made a quick decision to shift to the next gear and drive under it.  I remember looking out my windshield at this metal object with the green and red flashing lights as I drove under it!  I drove the next few hours to Utica without looking into my rear view mirror!  I don't know if I was so frightened that it would be following me or if I had just been that shook up.  One thing was clear, for some reason I wasn't going to look into my rear view mirror for any reason and I didn't.  I have a few regrets in my life, like most people, but the one that is at the top of my list is that I drove away.  I wish today that I would have gotten out of the car and waited for whatever it was to get to me, at least I would have known exactly what it was.  Very few months of my life have gone by that I didn't think about what it was and what happened that night.  I was within 50 feet of this object.  I had a really good look at it.  It wasn't a reflection from an airport 500 miles away.  It wasn't swamp gas!  It wasn't a star or the moon!  It was real and fast and silent and close.  And yes the one that makes me feel the worst is when someone looks at me and claims that I made it all up or that it was a dream that I remember or some other total nonsense.   Very strange isn't it, we both think that the other is talking total nonsence!  One thing is certain, nothing back then could do what that object did and nothing today can do it either.  And unless some government has had some really great technology that they have kept secret, it didn't come from earth.   Many years back I was having my yearly physical and at the end of it my doctor asked me if anything was bothering me or if I had any problems.  I looked at him and said yes I do have something that has bothered me all my life.  Out came the whole account of the events just as I have written here.  I asked the doctor if he could use some method to take me back to that night to find out if anything more had happened?  He asked me if I had trouble sleeping or working and if I was happy?  I said no and everything was great.  He said that's the reason I won't do anything.  It could only harm you.  He said ""I believe every word that you have just told me and I wouldn't tell anybody what you have just told me"".   I didn't speak about it for many years but I am 60 years old now and I just have this feeling that I would like someone else to know the secret that I am convinced of.  I hope I don't end up wishing I had followed the doctors advice.  A lot of people wonder if something very strange is going on, it is!  The problem is, there are so many nut cases out there that nobody believes it when they hear the real thing.  When I think about it, what a wonderful way to cover up what is going on, just keep putting out stupid accounts or faked pictures and movies and soon nobody will believe the truth when they hear it.

The speculation was that the vehicle was being illuminated by the sun at the particular elevation, thus making it visible.  This meant that the vehicle would be over 50000 ft above sea level to be visible.  This incident simply confirmed to my father what he had full believe in, that life did exist outside of planet earth.  For the rest of his life until his pasing at 98 years of age, he tied this sighting to an event that took place in 1924 when he did most of his flying up the coast of British Columbia.  That year his comrade was lost in Sept  on a flying patrol up the coast to Prince Rupert, and they set out to try and find him in an old Cutris H2SL flying boat. After a day of unproductive searching they flew into an olf fishing village at Bella Bella, where they had fuel stored, and a wharf.  They tied up for the night in the small harbor, and were awaken at 02:00 hrs by the sounds of gushing water.  In the harbor, lit only by moonlight was a killer whale, with floating bebris nearby.  My father armed with his 3030 went down to the warf where the whale has made his way along side.  They made eye contact for a few seconds, a profound moment in my fathers life, the whale retreated leaving the debris exposed, where the log book of the downed flying boat was retrieved. The ebbing tide then took the rest of the debris out to sea and the whale disappeared.  The search was over, however this event which I was told about since I was a kid, coupled with the UFO sighting in 1966, convinced by father that the forces which produced the UFO where the same as those that directed the whale to the village.

It was the summer of 1953-4-5.  We were 12-14 years old. One of my buddies' sister was watching tv in their 2nd floor apartment and three of us decided to scare her by climbing up on the porch from the ground below.  The porch looked out over the Potomac river skyline where planes approached National Airport on their landing route.  It was about 8pm.  Two of us had gotten up on the porch and were lifting the last guy up when one of us saw this ball of light coming out of the southwest sky towards a plane coming in for a landing,  along the river, from the west.  We dropped our buddy into the bushes below in our awe of the event but hauled him up right away and sister came running out asking what was going on.  We all watched in amazement as this ball of light went around this moving plane (maybe 100 to 150 mph landing speed) in a huge circle, then shot off in the same direction it had come from and disappeared in a split second.  The whole incident took about 2-3 minutes.  We were so excited we began yelling to people around the community and calling friends and relatives on the phone.  I don't remember what reaction we got from those folks but we looked in the papers (Washington Post, Daily News, Wash. Star) the next day and found one small article, buried in the A section, about the sighting that claimed it was a meteor out of its orbit.  Well there were 4 of us who knew what we saw and none of us ever heard of a meteor coming out of the sky, making a circle, then shooting back out again.  I've probably told this story 5 or 6 times in the past 53 years, when someone's brought up the subject, but have never reported it or written about it before now.  I'm sure there were others that evening that saw this happening including the pilot, crew and passengers on that plane. I did lie out at night with friends in the late fifties to watch the sky and saw interesting light formations (not airplanes) flying around as well as Sputnik orbiting the earth.    That's my experience with UFO's. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",,38.907575087012276,-77.02499886426087

Just a month ago (mid-February 2005), my mother and I saw what could be this thing’s twin in looks and movement.  When we saw it there was a little breeze out, so we tried to think of earthly explanations for what we saw--pool or hot tub cover, construction debris, tarp, a super-jumbo sized remote-controlled helium toy, but nothing quite worked because the wind wasn’t that strong, the thing was at least as big as my van, and the thing seemed to be moving slowly and intelligently, and often against the breeze -- not just getting tossed around by it. When we first spotted it, I had just picked up my mother from her apartment near the east edge of Stanwood.  Sitting in the parking lot, we saw it coming up from behind some big fir trees that were some blocks further east from us (there are fields and woods out that way).   The thing banked, showing us a big dark disk that I thought was at least as wide as my Chevy Venture van was long.  The disk then spiraled up higher and leveled out above the fir trees.  We could now see that while the disk was dark on the bottom, it was a metallic silver on top, and when viewed on edge the disk was thicker in the middle - slightly more pronounced near the center of the silver side.   It banked again, so we moved the car to a different spot where we could watch it, overlooking the east edge of the high school football field.  The disk continued to wobble and rotate along the edge of town, bank and spiral, level out, hover, taking its time working its way along the east edge of the Church Creek housing development and city park as it headed toward Highway 532.   As it got closer to the highway and the grocery store/strip mall there, it went waaaaay high until we could barely see it as a bright silver point against a big cloud bank.  Lost sight of it then.  The whole sighting lasted around 7 minutes.   I'd still be tempted to think we saw some sort of wind-driven large piece of trash except it didn't behave like it was affected by the breeze.  It seemed to be on some sort of sightseeing trip! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",2005-05-11T00:00:00,48.2124,-122.2846

As it started to get out of our vision, a jet was coming toward us from the north (it had a fuel trail as a jet does), these two objects were going to cross paths and were nearly side by side at one point. The jet was high in the sky and tiny (although you could tell that it had wings), and this thing was four or five times longer than the jet.

Looking east through large picture windows, I saw what I at first thought was a helicopter at a distance of about 5 miles. What intrigued me was that for an object that I thought was the size of a common traffic helicopter, it was moving incredibly fast. After comprehending that a common helicopter could not move to quickly, I began to think it was something else. I observed it for about 5 minutes or more. It seemed to move forwards and backwards and up and down rather erratically, not with the motion that one would expect from a helicopter, certainly not that of an airplane. It appeared to be hovering in that it had no specific direction. Assuming that it was about 5 miles away, which would have put it over southern Bellevue, I estimate that its movements were limited to about 200 yards, but without any pattern to the movement. It moved sort of like an insect would. The object appeared to be black, with no discerbable shape. As mentioned, I observed it for about 5 minutes, perhpas more, then turned away.

I was standing outside behind my house watching the hawks fly around when I noticed a jet fly over.  Being a Commercial Pilot I am always drawn to watch them fly over.  As I was watching the jet a object to the jets left caught my eye.  By the way I have 20/15 in one eye and 20/20 in the other.  This object was circular in shape and appeared to be at least 500 ft to 2000 ft AGL depending on its size, which was hard to to determine. If it was 500ft it was around the size of a washing machine, if it was 2000 ft it was around the size of a truck or van.  It was a color between orange and gold in color.   This single object was hovering above the hill behind my house.  It would move side to side, no more than three or four times its width to each side.   I thought, Ok, I am seeing a hawk at a high altitude flying around in a tight circle but it wasn't a circle it was side to side.  I thought to myself a hawk isn't round or gold nore can it fly side to side so what is that?  About that time T-0 to T+20 sec. at T-20 it stopped and was completely still and remained frozen hovering there from T-20 until T-40 in between that time I rubbed my eyes to make sure there wasn't something in them.  There wasn't because I noticed it was still there frozen in the sky.  It seemed to glisten once.   I had a tree and a hill as a reference point as I am aware of the fact that without them objects can appear to move.  Anyway from around T-40 to T-60sec it started moving back and forth again.  Then from T-60 to T-80 it stopped and was frozen hovering there again in the same spot as the previous times.   Sometime around T-80 it accelerated from velocity V-0mph to its full observed speed of what I later estimate conservatively 180mph within one second V-180mph.  So T-80 to T-81 and V-0 to V-180.  OK?   I watched it move and pass behind the tall tree behind the house that doesn't have any leaves so I could still see it and it went at the same speed and altitude over to another hill that is over a half a mile away and stop/hover.  When it stopped it seemed to slow from V-180 to V-0 at a slower rate than it accelerated not by much though but it was a noticeable difference, my guess is 2 or 3 seconds V 180 to V-0.  It flew from point A to point B in less than ten seconds which are the basis for my speed estimates.  T-80 through T-90.   If the object was higher than I estimate, then the distance and speed would be much more than I estimated.  Anyway it stopped over the second hill and hovered there for another 20 seconds T-90 to T-110.  Then it moved back and forth again ,T-110 to T-130sec, and stopped frozen hovering there for about ten seconds T-130 to T-140.   Around this time it flew pretty much dew south from point B with the same type of velocity as before V-0 to V whatever speed ( fast ! )in one second and went out of my sight over the horizon of hills to the south which took around 5 seconds so T-140 to T-145sec.  The next day I called KBNA ATC and talked to the controler on duty the day before.  He was interested in my sighting but said that he hadn't noticed anything strange on radar that day.  I have flown privately and commercially for twenty years and am aware of all known aircraft and this was not one of them.   I have a BS degree in Aerospace and with a minor in Psychology.  I am 37 years old.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.",2005-05-11T00:00:00,36.13170004240882,-86.7768134860051

We asked a passer by to take a snap shot using my 5.2 Meg Pixel Sony digital camera and my brother also asked the person to take a snap shot with his camera.  Firstly a picture was taken using my camera and approx. 10 seconds later the same snap shot using my brothers camera.  It was a lovely day and nothing unusual was seen by any of us during the walk of the wall.  When we got home, we were keen to look at all the pictures we had taken.  It was then, that I spotted an object over the mountains taken on my camera by the passer by.  The object is clearly visible and in the distance over the mountains.  I have showed a number of people, and they are mystified what it could be.  I had no intentions of reporting it, until a work colleague told me their had been a number of witnesses who had spotted an object which was reported in the local press.

On the evening of last Saturday, Sep 17, 2005, I decided to go out to eat dinner at my favorite Chinese place in Newnan GA, a medium size working-class town about 40 minutes south of Atlanta GA on Interstate 85. I had just arose from a 45 minute nap, and felt relaxed, with a little grogginess from the nap. I left my home in the extreme north tip of Coweta County, driving South on Fisher Road. I turned right onto Hwy34 and started going West to Newnan GA. I arrived in the vicinity of Andy Lewis car dealership around 740 PM EST, which is in the eastern part of Newnan. I stopped at a stoplight there. This is a busy part of Newnan, and a busy time of the week, and there was quite a lot of traffic going both ways through the junction. While sitting there, at the light, facing West, waiting for the light to change, I noticed someting moving up in the sky. I could see it through the top portion of my car's windshield.  The movement caught my eye. The object would have been a little further North and West of my position.  It was about at the ""1:00 High"" position, using the old WW2 terminology. It appeared to be a couple of  thousand feet up. It was shaped with an oblong or short-stubby-cigar shape. It was moving from right to left (North to South), at a moderately slow rate. It did not look like a bird, helicopter, large plane, small plane, or anything else I've ever seen. In disinct contrast with the hazy fading summer afternoon light, the object's color appeared to be a solid very dark or black color. I could not detect any patterns or lights on the object. Nor did the object emit any light, or any other extraordinary emittance. It was just up there, moving from right to left at a lesurely pace. I did see the object turn or sort of bank once or twice, and then its shape changed from the stubby oblong shape to a distinct circular shape, like a Frisbee or dinner plate. When it banked back the other way, I think I saw 2 stubby fins on the top. Due to its height, the hazy quality of the light, the objects extremely dark color, and my lack of binoculars, it was impossible to see any further details. I also checked my watch, and it was 7:44PM EST. About this time, the traffic light changed, and my lane had to move. I continued driving west. I did not see the object fly off, zoom away, or disapper, but my automobile reached the point where I could no longer view that part of the sky through the windshield. It was more or less directly over my position, at that point, and I could not see it. At no time did I feel afraid or threatened, just very curious. I continued driving West to Walmart where I withdrew some money from the ATM machine, and then decided to drive back to where I had seen the U.F.O., to see if it was still there. I did not feel afraid, or threatened, just very curious. By that time, it was 8:00 PM EST. I drove east, on the same road, looking out the windows and scanning the skys for the object. I continued looking for the object as I reached the point where I had been a few minutes earlier. I drove on past that spot, and kept on going, still looking. But the object had dissapppeared, and I never saw it again. I then made a U-turn, going on to my favorite Chinese place, where I enjoyed dinner. AFter dinner, I went home. My background? I am a 43, almost 44 year old, white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, unmarried male. I have a Bachelor's degree in a technology field, and have been in computer systems admin for about 19 years. Some people have called me a ""smart guy"". I work a 40 hr/week job as a computer systems administrator for a major branch of the Federal Govt in Atlanta. At the time of the sighting, I was in a relaxed, typical Saturday afternoon frame of mind. I was thinking only of pulling out some money, and then eating Chinese.  ""UFO's"" were the **furthest thing** on my mind. I consider myself a ""realist""; I do believe that many UFO's, perhaps most can be explained by a reasonable rational explanation; yet I also recognize a spiritual dimension that can manifest supernatural out-of-the-ordinary occurences and that cannot be measured with instruments. This is the first real UFO I have ever seen with enough clarity to report it; yet I am not a ""UFO nut""; I never read UFO books, or magezines, or anything like that.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,33.39435520361991,-84.76770678733031

I was out late and was looking at the stars.I was alone the first time.I seen a bright light sort of like a Street light but much brighter.This caught my attention cuz up in the hills I,m from they are no street lights.It seemed to be dancing on the next mountain over.I stared at it and a wierd feeling came over me. Istared for a while then a couple of other lights came out from within it.These lights did not seem to go to far from it.This went on until I went back inside.I said nothing to nobody.My friends would not belive me anyways. Over the next few months I seen the lights again a few times.Then on one night.I had to tell someone.I brought a couple of friends outside with me.I showed them and they were scared.Here is the wierd part,For some reason I knew I could call them to me if I wanted to. Please I'm not insane,this is the truth.I told my friends that I could and they laughed at me.Then I looked at the lights and began calling them with my mind.It was strange.I have always been perceptive or intuitive.This was something on a different level.Some how,some way I knew I was being heard. After about two or three minutes the small lights went back inside the larger one and it began coming towards us.I must have been in a trance cuz the next thing I knew my friends were yelling and pulling me towards the house. I remember the light was coming tords us.The funny thing is I was not afraid.On several other nights the lights were there.The seemed to be doing something.The hills they are on are not inhabited.I feel like I should have at least checked out the area but what harm were they doing. On a Different note.One night my friend came running in and pulled me outside and the lights were flying in formation.This time way up high and extremely fast.I moved away not to much longer afterwards.I seem to have a connection to something cuz I feel like I know something inside myself.I just thought I would share what happened.

I kept wondering if anyone else on the road with us could see the thing.     I called the FAA in Atlanta, I believe, and they recommended I call air traffic control in Jacksonville to see if anything had been reported.    No one offered any explanation.     I have never seen anything like this again.

It was like a fireball only it was white with hints of blue, which indicate that Magnesium or Aluminum was being burned with possible traces of Copper.  The burning thing was huge and traveled very fast towards the ground.  It was far away, we couldn't tell how far, but we couldn't hear it.  The size of it would be the size of a pea held about 18"" from the face.  We watched it disappear behind the treeline (trees were primarily spruce and birch).  Once it went behind the treeline, there was a quick flash of light.  No sound, no physical effects from it hitting the ground.  We drove around, thinking that someone had shot a flare from a flare gun.  But, no one was up.  The temperature outside was about -10F or so, perhaps colder, so it's no surprise that no one was outside.  The next day the radio news broadcast reported that a meteor had fallen somewhere outside of Anchorage and had been cleaned up by the military.  Anchorage is a little over 400 miles south of North Pole.  This seems like a poor coverup for whatever really happened.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,64.7783,-147.3371

I could not enter the time appropriately.  The system would not let me enter it.  This happened at 8:35 p.m. above a Hotel swimming pool, in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.  I was there attending a NAMES Project seminar (AIDS memorial quilt) and the last class of the day had ended prior.  Everyone else in my group went out for the night, I opted to stay at the hotel, swim and eat.  It was evening and I was alone in the pool.   At the far end of the pool, was a bar with bartender and a man and woman having drinks.  They were the length of the pool plus some away from me, they were on stools, laughing and talking with their backs turned from me slightly.  They were under a canope and could not see the sky from where they sat.  I had done a few laps and was leaning up against the shallow end of the pool, looking up at the sky.  There were other hotels on either side of me.  If I looked directly up and a little to either side I could sky..until seeing the next tall hotel building.  Perhaps you are familiar with this strip of hotels along the beach.  Anyway, I was leaning back against the back of the pool, relaxing and looking up.  Mind you, I don't drink and see well at night.  I need glasses for seeing up close at night, but I could see the stars just fine.  I noticed, suddenly, to my right (the direction of the beach)  there was were 3 ""stars"" moving in an exact triangle shape above my head.  TO describe their pattern it would be two on the left and one on the right... so that it made a triange shape.  I hope that makes sense.   I watched them move across above my head, slowly until the shape was directly over my head above.  I remember thinking ""my gosh, look at that.. and I looked down at the people at the end of the pool and looked back up again thinking.. if I stop and call them, I may miss this.  I want to see what this is...   Anyway, the triangle formation (the star looking objects) stopped then (it was almost as if I knew it was going to do this before it happened) the two stars on the left came together and touched briefly, made a slight spark and then went back into the original triangle shape.  Then slowly moved back off the right, the direction it originally came in.. until it disappeared over the hotel roof tops.   It was not a solid craft, but three distinct ""stars"" for want of a better word, that were travelling, slowly, in a triangle shape.  There was no sound associated with this at all.  When I told my friends of this the next morning, they say ""ya, right ((name deleted)), were you wearing your glasses?"".  What I am wondering, is was there any other report of this being seen, in March in 1999 in that area?  I can't have been the only one looking up in the sky that night and seeing this..  What I didn't realize is how close Fort Lauderdale is to the Bermuda Triangle.  I hear things like this happen a lot in that area.

I got home from work and got out of my car.  I heard a strange beeping noise and started looking around.  Then I saw right between my house and my neighbors house was a silver craft just hovering between both houses.  It was approximately 40 feet off the ground.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing and just stood there frozen.   Then it slowly, very very slowly, moved over the street where I was standing.  It stopped about 20 feet in front of me and was about 30 feet up (it was slightly below the height of a street light).  I stood there for about 15 seconds just looking at it in awe.  It had a very smooth exterior and had 3 circular white lights underneath it shining down.   As for the placement of the lights underneath the craft, imagine a triangle with one light in each corner of the triangle and the triangle being underneath an aircraft.  I hope that makes sense.  Then, I freaked out and ran inside my house and grabbed my brother.  He came out and as we ran into the street,  it sped off into the distance, slowed down for a few seconds and then sped off again.  I could tell that it still was fairly low to the ground - probably 100 feet high.   I watched it go until it disappeared.  A s for the beeping noise that it was making, there was a beep, then a 1 second pause, then another beep, then a 1 second pause and so on.  It never stopped beeping.  It was so loud that I was surprised none of my other neighbors ran out into the street to see what was making the noise.   Also, the craft came from the South East and moved to the North West.

It was around June that I began going to DBCC (Daytona Beach Community College). I didn't have a car yet, so my mother would pick me up from night school around 9:00 pm.  On this night, we were chatting as we took the back route home from my school. We were driving down Williamson Blvd, which is a long and twisting road that is rather undeveloped for the area, but the occasional apartment complex or convenience store can be found. Thick trees are on both sides of the road. I live in Ormond Beach, so Williamson was a straight shot to Hand Ave without having to stop at so many lights. It is a very well known street, and there were quite a few other cars on the road in both directions.  As we were driving home, I looked out the passenger window to see these giant triangular air crafts flying low. I squinted and said, ""Mom, look at these planes. They are shaped funny."" She couldn't look up until she came around the bend. When she glanced up at them, she slowed a little. ""Oh my god, they're black triangles. Is the government testing something new?"" She asked me. I shook my head, but didn't take my eyes off them. I counted four. I remarked, ""Look at how low they are flying. You'd think that if they were testing something new they wouldn't do it here."" My mom commented on the time of night, and the thick forestation on both sides. As I watched them, I noticed that they had a weird way of moving. Focusing on just one of them, it flew straight...then stopped....went backwards....then stopped...then to the side and stopped, all without changing the direction of the ""nose"". At the blink of an eye they could go from being completely motionless to down the street.  Going 45 mph. with only my window half down, there was no audible sound coming from the four planes. I thought that was extremely odd, considering how close we were to them. I saw one do a slow nose dive into the woods until I couldn't see it anymore. I was prepared to hear a blast, as I thought it was surely doomed. As far as I've ever known, those woods are completely blanketed with trees, but I've also heard there are also small retention ponds somewhere in there too. Apparently, there must have been a clearing back there for the plane to go down like that, only to emerge a few seconds later unscathed.  To the best of my recollection, there were no lights on the planes whatsoever. Being at night, and the planes painted pitch black with no lights, they were obviously meant to go unseen. If it weren't for the moon, light pollution, and the scattered lights of homes and businesses, we would not have seen them at all, and we certainly would not have heard them.  My mother weaved slightly as she tried to drive and gaze up at the same time. We watched them play in the sky. They came so close to us at one point, that I had to crane my neck up to see the whole craft. There was no particular formation, and they didn't seem to have any real destination, until they all turned and sort of drifted in the opposite direction than we were heading.  My mother returned to her normal driving as I twisted in my seat to try to get one last peek at them. The last thing I remember was that even though they were shaped like triangles, the sides were flat and the edges looked like they were sanded down a little more round. The ""nose"" looked rounded too. Since then, I've looked at photos of the Stealth and other interesting air crafts and none of them have had the shape or contour of the four we saw that night.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,29.191653301886795,-81.03306603773584

Avon is located South of Rochester NY and East of Buffalo NY.  We had just entered Route 20 where it separates from Route 5. We were heading west.  This is a 2 lane road through a large open field, and a route I regularly travel.     My friend wanted to show me how his new high powered green laser pen worked when pointing it at the moon.  The moon was at about 11:00 and fairly low in the sky.  My friend put the laser up to the windshield so we wouldn't get back splash from the laser into our eyes.  He pointed it at the moon.  A second or two after pointing it in that direction suddenly the laser hit an object flying by the moon but relatively close to us, maybe a couple of miles away at most. When it hit the object the light from the laser began sparkling and spashing in all directions as if it had hit a prism or similar object of glass.  I thought he had hit the side of a plane and told him to shut it off as we would get into trouble.  After he turned it off, there was nothing in the sky except the moon.  We looked for a plane but nothing was there.  There was enough background light from Rochester and Buffalo to allow us to see an object as large as the one we had seen.  Note I was still driving, perhaps 30-40 mph.  We thought this was an abbarition and he again lit the laser.  This time nothing happened when he shown it at the moon.  By chance he moved it around and at the same elevation, but now about 1 oclock he again hit the object.  He followed it for a moment, then shut it off.  We realized that there was something there that did not reflect light as any airplane we knew of might.  Also it was not visible to the eye except with the aid of the laser.   We became a little shaken and I hit the gas and got out of there quickly.  It was cold that evening and so we did not open our windows to listen for sounds. Because the object was only visable with the laser, we could not determine its size, and because the field is mostly open we had no reference point to be sure of the size or the distance from us.  Still knowing the ability of the laser to light a large area a couple of miles away, we knew it had to be relatively close.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,42.9002,-77.7473

Anyways, we were on our way back home coming down Main ST which turns into Hwy 107. We were on our way down the hill in town in the 25MPH zone. We were approaching the bridge which turned into a 35mph zone. My Dad was driving and I just happened to look up through the moon roof(slightly tinted) and saw a silver, round shaped craft above the vehicle. It wasn't hude or anything but it was hard to tell how big it was since I couldn't tell how high it was away. But by the looks of it and amount of detail, it was very very close...I thought a few hundred feet tops. I had to make absolutely sure it wasn't a relfection or something off a pop can in the car or something so I opened the moon roof completely and there it was....in plain sight. I quickly looked at my Dad and told him to look above the truck. He had a big smile on his face when he saw it, but he focused more on keeping the vehicle on the road. I watched this craft float side to side and doin small curved motions from the right side of the vehicle to the left...then back a ways...then zip forward. From underneith the craft I saw what looked like segmented plates, piled on top of each other. It zipped around above our car from Main ST to Hwy U which I think is like 4-5 miles...maybe more. But anyways, this craft followed us right outta town into the 35mph zone....around a big curve where this road basically turns back into a highway and then around another curve into a 45mph zone, and around another curve into a 55mph zone. I couldn't see any markings or anything..but I could see the segments very clearly...and the very bottom segment looked more like a thimble than a smaller plate. As we turned on Hwy U towards home, I whipped around in my seat and looked out the back window only to see this craft flying about 80-90 feet above the ground, altering its course about 45 degrees to the left(West). This is when I could say that, if this craft didn't change altitude, then it was about 20-22ft in diameter max, and about 12-15ft in height in the center max. The craft made absolutely no noise. I am very very curious to know how many other people saw the craft above our vehicle that day, as there were other vehicles on the road that day. It was still pretty much completely light out at the time this event took place. I am sending a mspaint picture I whipped up of what I saw through the moon roof the entire time. Also, the roof was completely open just as a reminder, so it wasn't a reflection. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2005-09-02T00:00:00,,

It was not raining where the objects were spotted, as the rain was still over the mountains at the back of the photos. I was able to record them on several photographs. I've ruled out any lens flares, as there was no direct light hitting the camera, and there was no water on the lens. I've taken several thousand photos with this camera and have never seen any thing like this before.

Its size and speed was hard to determine, not knowing exactly how far away it was, and because there was nothing I could compare it to, I could not make a determination.  It seemed to be anywhere from about 20 feet to an undetermined length, and it seemed to be doing anywhere from 10 miles per hour to an undetermined speed, and it seemed to be anywhere from 100 feet high to an undetermined altitude.  If I had to guess I’d say it was about 50 to 100 feet long and about 200-500 feet above me, and was traveling at about 40 miles per hour or maybe a little faster. But this is just a guess...it could have been bigger but it was impossible to determine.  My first impression was that it was a bunch of Canadian geese flying in ‘line-abreast’ formation, because I had just seen (a minute or two earlier) a ‘V’ formation of them flying north.  However upon closer examination, what I saw was not a group of individual birds flying in a line, abreast, but it was a solid object.  I then thought it must be a piece of black polythene or polyethylene caught in the wind like a kite.  However upon closer examination I was able to determine that it was solid and ‘plank-like’.  It kept its rigid form and in no way fluttered or flexed or was jostled or buffeted or affected by the wind or breeze.  It held its course and form. I say it looked black because at that time of evening, it was silhouetted against the sky.  It could have been some color for all I know, but it appeared to be black.  I noticed two small ‘bumps’ on the leading-edge of one end of what I’ll call this ‘wing.’  These small protuberances for lack of a better definition (other than ‘bumps’) were not exactly the same size but were almost the same, and were immediately adjacent to one-another.  My thought was that if this was some random piece of junk caught-up in the breeze, then it would not be completely symmetrical, so I immediately checked the opposite end of the leading edge to see if there were bumps there also.  I saw that there were an identical set of bumps in exactly the same place on the other end. This object looked like a board, flying sideways up the highway above me. Not exactly streamlined for sure.  In fact it was the most un-aerodynamic thing you could imagine. Certainly not something that would work in a wind-tunnel. I could see clearly that it had 90 degree corners and features.  It had no perceptible camber nor rounded edges.  It was not ‘airfoil-shaped.’ It had no anhedral nor dihedral nor sweepback. Its form and the speed it was flying defied Bernoulli’s principle.  It had no separate fuselage nor engines nor tail/empennage nor visible flight-control surfaces, no external anti-torque devices, neither did it display any lights or markings.  No perceptible intake or exhaust, no props, jets or rotors, windows, vents nor antennas. There was nothing attached to it nor hanging out of it. What I saw was unlike anything I’ve seen, heard or read about.  Just picture a giant, black, symmetrical board moving in the sky, steadily in one direction. I could not relate to it in any way except to feel (mere speculation here) that for the lift and thrust and weight factors of aerodynamics, it must utilize some undisclosed type of technology such as magnetics for propulsion/stabilization and to overcome gravity, and ionization of the atmosphere to overcome drag through the air.  I was unable to hear any sound from the object, because I was inside my car amongst traffic in the fast lane.  There were a couple of vehicles pulled-over on the side of the road at this point, but I didn’t really take my eyes off the object long enough to see if the occupants were watching the unknown flying object also.  What surprised me the most was that I didn’t hit my brakes and create a major traffic jam or accident, but rather just calmly thought: ""Now that’s curious.""  Some have talked about dimensional shift, dematerialization technology or thought projection, but I can’t go there at this point because it’s a little beyond my paradigm. I’m guessing the duration of this sighting was about 20-30 seconds from the time I first saw it off in the distance to the time we both ‘closed’ on each-other and it went overhead while I craned my neck, and pressed my face to the windscreen to watch it as long as I could before it disappeared in my blind spot overhead because of the roof of the car.  Even though the thought seemed ‘silly’ to even contemplate from the scene I was witnessing, I consciously looked to see if there were any wires or poles supporting this object as the suggestion crossed my mind that maybe all it was, was some object hung over the highway, and the movement was due to a ‘relative motion’ illusion.  There was nothing I could see to support this idea at all. Besides the object was moving relative to the highway also.  I was as conscious and lucidly awake when I witnessed this event, as now when I’m writing this description of the event.  I have no idea what it was, nor do I have the slightest clue if it was our technology, or where it came from.  I’m totally at a loss to explain what I saw. Kinda cool though.

I used to climb to the top of North Mountain every night for excersize. Coming down one night, I saw what I first thought was an airplane, but it came closer and it looked like it had slowed down quite a bit, ruling out an airplane, at which point I thought it was a helicopter and became alarmed (sometimes police helicopters fly over North Mountain park, which closes at 11:00 PM, I did not want to be ""spot lighted""). I was eyeing the aircraft very closely to see if it was in fact a helicopter and because it was approaching North Mountain.  It was flying very slowly at some point, and I was looking directly at it, trying to make it out against a black sky. I caught the first glimpse of its shape, it had lights on it, like a helicopter would, but the rear of the aircraft was square.  I became very confused, trying to figure out what kind of aircraft was 'square'. Also, it was very quiet, helicopters make a lot of noise, even from a distance, this one wasnt making any noise at all. I continued to stare at the aircraft, caught a second glipse of it, and the shape looked definitely square from the back end (couldnt make out the front end because of the lights on the aircraft). At this point, I became nervous, I was starting to panic, I moved into a dark area off the paved road under a small ""ridge"" to keep myself from being seen.  The aircraft flew nearly overhead from where I was standing, and it literally dipped down towards the gorge area, flew back up a little and circled around the peak across the gorge (this was the peak where the radio antennas are located). The aircraft must have not been more than 50 feet from me at one instant. It was black and sqare shaped aircraft, made a quiet turbine machine like noise, I had no idea of what this was, but it was ""right in my face"", so to speak, and I was mortally terrified. What went through my mind in that instant was not good, I was really scared, I wanted to run away at full speed down the mountain towards the apartments where I lived. I just wanted to get out of there, quick, but I also realized that any movements might cause me to be detected by whatever that aircraft was.  After the aircraft circled around the North Mountain peak, I did not see it again. I was worried that it might circle back around, but it didnt. I somehow consoled myself by thinking that whatever that was, it was not looking for me. After a few minutes, I started back down the road briskly in an effort to get to the other side of the ridge, so if it did circle back around then I would be obscured from its path. On the way down, I considered calling the police when I got back to my apartment, but then I realized that I wouldnt have been taken seriously.  I continued to climb North Mountain after that, but only in daylight hours. I didnt think running into something like that would ever happen again, however, the incident had shaken me up pretty badly and I did avoid climbing up at night after that.  Previous to this incident, I did not believe in UFOs and when somebody mentioned it I would go so far as to get upset and try to prove to them that they do not exist and it is impossible by the laws of physics to cover great distances in anyones lifetime.  After witnessing this, it is obvious to me that they do exist because I saw one, although I dont understand it or how it could be possible. But I still saw it. i can speculate that maybe the reason why it was flying over that area was because of the radio antennas? At any rate, I had a close up visual of the aircraft, it was not a helicopter, and it could not be anything else because of its extremely low altitude at the final moment of the sighting. Aside from the fact that helicopters are obvious and make a great deal of noise, not even a helicopter would fly that low in that area because of electric lines that go across the mountains (danger of hitting an electic line).",2005-09-02T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

She pointed over above these houses across the street, and there was a triangular shaped U.F.O hovering over a house! It had multi-colored lights around the bottom edges, and it was HUGE. We knew it wasnt a plane because of its shape, and we werent anywhere near the airport. Plus, it wasnt even moving at all, it was just sitting there. The light turned green, so we drove up about another 80 feet, and pulled to the side of the road. It was right across the street from us...such an awesome sight!

Olhei para todos os lados para observar se era um reflexo de outras luzes no vidro do carro. Mas, não.  A janela do carro estava aberta. Observei melhor em volta, para comparar com as luzes de torres de TV que existem naquela redondeza. Também não eram. Talvez fosse uma corda de luzes presa a algum avião. Fiquei tão intrigada e curiosa, que fiz uma loucura: parei meu carro no acostamento, para observar melhor. Eu estava sozinha, e não deveria ter feito aquilo àquela hora da noite!

I assume the object must have made some type of sound [although I do not remember the sound], that caught my attention so I looked up to see it.  I cannot give an exact date, but it was seen sometime between the middle of June and the middle of August in 1966. This is when I was attending a summer camp at the Valley Forge Military Academy in Wayne, Pennsylvania, about fourteen miles west of Philadelphia.  The time of day was, as I recall, late afternoon.  At that time, I was standing near one of the barracks/dormitories {I believe it may have been Wheeler Hall] of the Valley Forge Military Academy. I believe this was the barracks where my dormitory room was located.  At the time, I was ten years old; I would turn eleven in the Autumn.  I did not notify anyone of the siting. It went so fast, I had no time to call anyone. And, since the vehicle was gone after a few moments, it did not seem to be of much value to tell anyone.  Since the object looked like a rocket or missile, I assumed it was of terrestrial origin. However, I did wonder why a rocket or missile was flying over suburban Philadelphia.

It was a warm summer evening, clear sky, no clouds, after dark. Others present were a neighbor aprox 20 yrs old, also my mother and grandparents were present. we observed a very bright light as bright and large as a 747 landing light would be if the plane was maybe 2000 feet up.  (no airports within 200 miles of that location) brighter than any star in the sky and made no sound. the strangest part of this sighting was the flight pattern.  it started in the south west coming from what would have been new mexico and flew in perfect uniform stair steps making sharp 90 degree angles  as it flew diagonally across the sky from southwest to north east in the direction of main and vermont.  if you held your arm out full length and measured the distance each stair step covered, it would appear about the length of a finger.  Of course how far in miles that would be depends on how high it really was flying above the earth.  To my knowledge there was no flying machine on earth at that time that could make 90 degree turns repeatedly in mid flight other than a helicopter, and if it WAS a helicopter with a light as bright as the one we saw, we would have heard the sound AND seen more than one light. the same goes for a plane, if it was a 747 or other jumbo jet with that bright of a light we would have heard sound, and no normal airplane jet or otherwise could turn a perfect square corner let alone do it repeatedly in short succession. we watched as it went all the way across the entire sky diagonally and dissappeared in the far north east. I reported it to both the police and the newspaper. There was an article in the paper the next day saying that there were similar sighting across the united states the same night, in the corresponding states to the ones that would have been covered by the flight pattern that I observed. I have been interested in UFO phenomenae all my life since my early teens, and have never seen any other reports of this strange stair step maneuver. if you have heard of any other reports like this I would very much like to know.

We were playing baseball in the baseball field behind our grade school.  There were about 8 of us.  There is woodland beyond the school ground for many miles.  We saw a very bright orange spherical object, over 1/2 the size of the moon at about 40 degrees above.  We stopped playing baseball, stood and stared as it was so strange.  Nothing anyone would normally see.  Five of the kids ran home in fright as all of us and they thought it was a UFO. It was hovering above the trees in the horizon, looking south.  Three of us, the eldest of the 8 kids there and best friends remained and stared at the object for about 15 minutes.  We were only 13-15 years of age then.  It appeared to be about 2 miles away.  The object moved very erratically, hovering and then moving at an incredible speed away from us then back towards us then to the left, right, up, down and at different angles. This was no weather balloon or man made object.  It glowed orange.  After about 14 minutes of this since we first spotted it, it started to dart away extremely fast as it got so small in a 45 degree angle, then shift back and forth, zig-zagging its way to the point that we could not see it any more.  A few years ago I met my friend who saw this, he said to his wife, ""See, I told you so, that I saw UFO and that I was there too.""  No one ever believed him and I try not saying anything to anyone as I feel that anyone would think I am 'not all there'.  I am a very rational, intelligent person and somewhat skeptical of these matters, difficult to convince, yet I have seen it and am now left still perplexed, bewildered and confused about it all.

Me, my younger sister and Mother and Father had gotten up early on this August day (1:00 am) to pack up our car to start a week's long vacation trip out West through seven states.  As we were packing up the trunk of our 1963 Chevy something caught my eye in the yard next to ours.   Back then the yard to the left of our house had a large apple tree growing in it.  Now I never would have even glanced at the blackened yard or tree.  But what caught my attention immediately was a small red orb just sitting there half way up in the tree facing our driveway.  The red light did not reflect on the leaves.  It was a dull red color.  Well, when I saw that light the hairs went up on the back of neck and I was immediately spooked.  And I think everyone knows when they are seeing something that is unnatural and shouldn't be there.  And because I was a kid and my father was packing up the car with military precision I didn't say anything about it while we were finishing up loading  the car.  As we were backing up the darkened driveway I was so frightened I didn't look at the light but I knew it was still there.  After about 20 minutes of driving we got out on the highway and I said to my Mom, ""did you see that light in the tree'?   She said, yeah I saw that what was it?? She added that maybe it was the light up on top of the telephone pole.  Back then the poles had glass transformers on top and when they had an overload they would turn red.  Well I thought maybe that was it and forgot about it.  When we returned from our trip a week later I looked at the tree and the spot where the light had been was just about 5 feet above my head.  The transformer is about 20 feet away from the tree and 25 feet above it.  So that could not have been the explanation.  Since this happened I have read that sometimes UFO's send down small red balls or orbs and maybe they are observation things.  It sure did look like it was watching us and we interrupted whatever it was up to.  And I know this light did not belong in that tree.  I never saw anthing like that ever again.

A good friend of mine who I have known for 10 years, recently told me about a UFO he saw in 1967.  Since he is an artist, I asked him to draw me a picture of the UFO, which he did, and which he gave me permission to post, and which is attached here. Here is the story as related to me by him on Sept. 9, 2004. (Bear in mind, this incident occured about 37 years ago!): My friend was living in Whittier, California in early Spring, 1967 (approximate date).  He was with his wife over at a co-worker's house for dinner, and after dinner he and his co-worker went out on the patio of the house in Whittier, and they were standing there, leaning back slightly, at about 7:00 pm - 7:30 pm, (it was dark out) and they were talking about work.  He and his co-worker were both electricians, and they had been working together that day.  Their wives were in the house at the time. As they were on the patio, the UFO (depicted in the drawing) flew by, going from south to north, approximately as depicted.  It was travelling at approximately 100 mph to 200 mph, at a steady, uniform speed, and was totally silent.  (No engine noise.  No noise at all.)  It was in the view of both of these gentlemen for approximately two seconds.  It was approximately 500 feet long, approximately 100 feet diameter.  There were hundreds of windows, or port holes, approximately as shown, which were approximately 3 feet in diameter and approximatley 10 feet apart (10 feet spacing).  The windows, or port holes, were filled with bright white light.  The UFO was travelling approximately 100 to 125 feet above the ground.  It was approximately 150 feet away from these two observers. It was dark out, but my friend got the impression that the UFO was silver in color, although he is not sure about that.  He was close enough to the UFO that he would have been able to see ""passengers"" in the windows, or port holes, if there had been any ""passengers"".  No ""passengers"" were observed in the windows or port holes; only bright white light.  Both individual witnesses observed the craft as described.  Immediately they went inside the house to tell their wives what they had just witnessed and to report the UFO to the Air Force, or to the police.  However, when they went in the house they observed on television at the time was a news story about some kids who had released helium balloons with Aluminum-foil attached earlier that morning near Griffith Park, and it created a big traffic jam on the Golden State freeway, and many people had reported this as UFOs.  As a result, my friend and his co-worker decided not to report the UFO because, in view of the news story on television about the kids' balloons and the resultant UFO reports regarding the balloons, because he and his co-worker decided that their report would probably not be taken seriously. He remarked that the general shape of the UFO was that of a blimp, however in every other respect (speed, size, silence, hundreds of brightly lit windows, etc.) it was definitely not a blimp, or any other kind of conventional craft; it was a ""UFO"". All of the data above about this incident (size, distance, speed, location, etc.), which occured in 1967, was provided to me by my friend - in response to my questions - on Sept. 9, 2004, (~37 years after the event) and are approximate only, and are ""ball-park"" estimates given to me by him.  So, if the sketch does not agree exactly with the dimensions provided, this is why.  (Also, I would like to add that -in my opinion - memories of short duration of significant events that happened a long time ago can still be somewhat accurately remembered.  For example, did you ever break a neighbor's window as a kid with a baseball?  Can you still see the baseball shattering the glass?) **************************** Something bothers me about all of this: I cannot understand ""helium balloons with Aluminum-foil attached, released by kids"", causing a major jam-up on the freeway, UFO reports, and major news coverage!!! Here is what I speculate: There was major UFO activity in that general area (southern California) that day. The UFOs were reported, and the UFO sightings caused a major jam-up on the freeways. Disinformation was then released by the government in the form of a fictitious ""made-up"" story about kids with balloons and Aluminum foil (similar to other fictitious reports released by the government regarding ""weather balloons"" and ""swamp gas""). The UFO seen by by friend and his co-worker may have been related to the other UFOs reported earlier in that same day. And, there may have been others who sighted it who did not report it for similar reasons to my friend and his co-worker not reporting it! (I doubt that this was an experimental military craft; why would it be flying so low over a heavily populated area?!  Experimental military craft are usually tested out over the desert, or ocean, away from people.) (As I have stated, this is just my speculation.) So, I would like to ask these questions: 1. Has anyone ever seen a UFO with characteristics similar to this, anywhere? 2. Does anyone know anything about news stories of UFO reports in 1967 near Griffith Park (in southern California) causing traffic jams on the Golden State freeway? (There have been many thousands of UFO reports throughout the past half-century or more, but this one seems to be a little bit different!)

Around mid April, 1967, Myself, Father, Brother, Uncle, Brother In-Law, Cousin and his Wife were on a week long fishing trip to Lake Seminole, where we made camp about 300 yards below Chattahoochee Dam. The Apalachicola River runs free from the dam to the Gulf of Mexico. We were mainly fishing for bass. They lay their eggs in the rock bed below the dam in early summer and are easy to catch when they are on the bed.  One particular day a storm was passing through in the afternoon and it was not until after dark when the storm began to break. Because most of the day had been wasted, we decided to do some night fishing. All of us loaded into two boats and we set anchor about 50 yards below the dam. We had been there about an hour, catching fish and having a good time. We were not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol.  My cousin got everyone's attention and instructed us to look to the sky. We all thought it was lighting and turned our attention back to fishing when my cousin said ""no, keep looking"". The following 5 or 10 minutes, I really was not aware of how long it lasted, was to be forever etched in my mind.  I will tell you what I saw only  Even though everyone's account is basically the same, what I saw will be a first hand account, not what I heard from someone else. This is what I experienced.  What appeared to be lighting was the glow of at least 2 objects very high in the night sky, partly obscured by clouds that remain from the storm. A few minutes later the sky was clear and the objects could be seen clearly. They would appear and disappear, stop and start instantly. Accelerate quickly to speeds unknown. Not knowing the altitudes makes it difficult to guess at the speeds. Near the end of the sighting there were just 2 objects moving in formation, precise formation. What appeared to be at about a 45 degree angle, they began to move downward in our direction. They looked like 2 meteors in slow motion, moving much slower than before. They were round, glowing bluish white with tails like meteors have. Very bright! Then simultaneously they began leaving vapor trails. Very large vapor trails, 4 times as large as known aircraft would make. Then, the unbelievable...a 90 degree turn, then another, taking the 2 objects back and away from us at which point they vanished, leaving the 2 identical vapor trails for the winds to disperse. The vapor trails remain visible for about 15 or 20 minutes.  I would like very much to know if any other sightings were reported at that time. Others had to have seen what we saw that night in the month of April, 1967. Until someone can explain to me what we experienced, I will consider it a ""UFO Sighting"".  PS: I would appreciate you letting me know if anyone else saw these objects.",,30.6497,-84.799

It had three lights on it with one on each corner.  We all saw it at the same time, as did many people over the whole city of Fort Smith, Arkansas.   The radio station started reporting on it after many calls.  A well-known preacher in Fort Smith was praying about it, and the radio station had everyone gather at the Pepsi or Coca Cola bottling plant and there were at least 1000 people gathered there who had seen the object/objects all over the city.  The preacher also was there and it was quite an event.  It was in the news for a couple of days, and then some hokey story about a weather balloon was released and suddenly the story was cold.   In the past few years I have spoken to people who did see it and remember it well, and we all remember the event and wish we knew more about it.  The craft we saw could move very suddenly very fast and just stop and hover in the air.  No one had ever seen anything like it.  Last year, I heard from a man who had been stationed at Fort Chaffee (just southeast of the city) who was looking for people who remembered the event.  He said he had never gotten it out of his mind.  He is out of the service now and lives in Florida.  I would love to know if anyone has reported this at this website or remembers it as I do.

I am estimating the date and time based on where we lived at the time, and the fact that I was wearing a jacket. I was 10 years old at the time. We lived in the 9xx unit on Olson Highway, in Minneapolis MN. My mother had sent me out to find my younger brother because it was getting dark. I remember that I had a jacket on, it was cool (and dry) but not cold, late September or early October. I was gone about 1/2 hour, and by the time I returned it was almost dark, and there was no one else in our front yard area. I had just entered edge of our front lawn, and was about 30 feet from the front door of our unit/apartment. As I entered the front lawn, I do no know why, but for some reason I had weird feeling, that something was above me. As I looked up, traveling due north at a slow rate of speed, I saw two round disks. They were left of me at about 10-15 degrees from vertical and in front of me by about the same amount. I could therefore not have seen the objects out of the corner of my eye.  One distinguishing characteristic was that their bottoms, which is all I saw, appeared to be on fire. This did not appear to be a form of propulsion. It was almost exactly like the appearance of the bottoms of the saucers in the movie Independence Day.  However, they were much higher, with the appearance of about the size of a silver dollar held at arms length. They did not seem very high, possibly about a mile high. I'll just add that the fiery bottoms are what one might expect as a result of friction with the atmosphere if such an object entered the atmosphere at a high rate of speed.  I immediately looked towards my front door and tried to yell to get the attention of someone inside, but I could not yell. I looked back up and the disks were moving at the same speed. I then ran into our apartment and tried to speak, but still could not speak, and after about 5 seconds, I headed out the back door with the family behind me. However, the two disks were no longer overhead. I still could not speak, and we went back inside our apartment. It was about another 10 seconds after I was inside before I was able to speak. I ""blurted"" out, ""I saw a flying saucer"". I was unable to speak for a total of about 2 minutes, and the only way to describe it is, it was as if my brain had a mind of its own. In my mind/brain, it was like someone had pressed a 'fast rewind' button. When I tried to speak, I could not interrupt what was going on in my brain. I had to close my eyes and concentrate real hard, and was eventually able to regain control and speak.  I never saw anything like it before or since the above event. I also never (before or since), had a problem where I was unable to speak like that. At the time, I was above average in intelligence, especially in math. Before the above event, as opposed to being someone who was fascinated with outer space, I don't recall having any interest in it at all, which changed after the above event. I have told a few friends over the years, but it is not something you can prove, so why bother. However, my mother did call the airport, who indicated they had received no other reports.

I felt like going next door and waking up the girl who lived there, and telling her to look out the window.  But I was afraid to even go into the hallway.  So I watched the object until it left.  Who knows how long it was there, could have been about 30 seconds to a couple minutes.  My mind was racing so seconds could have been minutes.   I have no idea how far away it was, but it was just over the city.   The saucer was highly luminescent or polished, a silvery color.  It was illuminated, but I never saw lights per se.  When the object left at a fantastic speed, I saw what appeared to be sparkling dust slowly sifting down. I remember thinking how beautiful it looked.  I have never been able to believe it was from a different planet.  Could it have been a hologram or a photo of some type projected onto the sky?   Don't know.   There was never anything in the paper about it, and my friends, the ones I told, were very skeptical.  Still, I didn't tell everyone as I didn't want to be known for seeing it.  And I didn't want to be mocked, which is what I may have done if it had been someone else. I was glad for the experience, but wish there had been an explanation.  Maybe someone else in Syracuse saw it that night, and like myself, was too shy to come forward. I know it was not a dream or an illusion.  I had not been drinking as it was a school night.  That's about all I can remember. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))",,43.05037092436975,-76.157063697479

The date above is approximate as this happened to me some 40 years ago. A friend & myself were duckhunting on the extreme North end of Lake Champlain. We were standing waistdeep in the water in front of our duckblind setting out decoys in preparation for the morning hunt. My friend said ""look at the funny ring around the moon tonight"". I looked up. It was a perfectly clear, calm night and you could see all the stars.  Off to our left, close to the town of Philipsburg, Quebec was a strange object with a glowing ring around it which in some ways did resemble a full moon. However, the actual moon was plainly visible directly in front of us over Vermont State. I said that's not the moon, the moon is over here in front of us.The object seemed to stay stationary for some minutes then it approached very rapidly and positioned itself directly above us. It also appeared to be much lower as it appeared to increase in both size, an intensity of the glowing ring around it.  I said lets load up our shotguns because we may be shooting something other than ducks this morning. We grabbed our shotguns from the boat and both loaded up with SSG... equivalent to Double O Buckshot. My intentions were to rattle some buckshot off from it if it got too close!  The object remained stationary, directly over us for 5-10 minutes. Then, it seemed to rapidly...and I mean rapidly... evaporate going almost directly straight up into a perfectly clear, star-filled sky. The actual moon was still plainly visible in it's original location. I then realized that the hair on the back of my neck was standing straight up. I have never experienced this feeling either before or since.  My friend turned to me in astonishment and said how are we going to tell anyone about this? I said forget it, if we tried to tell this to anyone they would think we were both either idiots or worse...totally crazy. Whatever it was, I am definitely convinced by the speed it left going practically straight up that it was not from this planet! It made me a firm believer in UFO's. This is the first time I have ever reported this incident. I do not know if my friend has ever reported it or not. I have not been in contact with him for some years.

A friend and I were watching TV when around 5:27 he went out to the balcony of my apartment for a smoke.  I live up on a hill on the border of Golden and Lakewood that overlooks Denver and its suburbs to the north.   He knocked on the window for me to come and look at something.  I am a MUFON Investigator so I watch the skies often.  He pointed out a bright greenish light in the sky to the NNE.  It was just sitting there perfectly still.  I thought it looked very strange so I grabbed my binoculars.  He then pointed out that there were actually 4 objects.  All of them were still.   That looked even more interesting so I grabbed my video camera.  Once I got out there with the camera they began moving.  When I got my camera on them there were three left.  The forth had moved off to the east.  When I began video taping one object began to move off to the east, and one to the west.  The one to the west then came back moving to the east.  Then while filming the remaining light, which was perfectly still, just its right and above it another light lit up.  Soon after, the bottom light lit up very brightly.  When it got very bright, it appeared like an angled disk shape.  It then began to move to the east like the rest and dim out.  All of them did this when they flew easy and as they got dimmer they also began to blink.  The remaining light did the same thing.  It began to get extremely bright, and then it began moving east.   Here again it would get dimmer and begin to blink.  This can all be seen on the tape.  As it moved to the east, I noticed yet another light appear the same place the last one had appeared.  This one was dimmer and began move to the east blinking immediately.  When the tress got in the way I stopped filming.  However, we could see at least two of the light off in the distance over Denver.  Then after a few minutes they began to fade too dim to see.  At this point I called the Director of Investigations to let him know what we saw.  That call was made at about 5:55. While on the call at about 6:15, my friend could see another light appearing in the same spot they had appeared before.  I got off the phone and went back with the camera, however right when I got the camera on it, it faded very dim.  My friend saw another one of them over Denver that was lighting up very bright again.  Again once I got the camera on it, it faded out.  Because I thought they might be reacting to the camera I put it away.  A couple minutes later another light appeared where the others had.  This time, this one stayed still.  It looked like it actually was two light side by side.  As it sat there another light began to light just below it to the left.  The light appearing looked very disk shaped through the binoculars.  After 30 seconds or so as it finally seemed to be finished appearing or whatever it was doing and they both moved to the east.  One headed east over Denver, the other seemed to keep a regular distance from us and moved in an arc to the east with us in the middle.  Once it got due south of us, it just seemed to hover out there.  We then noticed one out over Denver.  This one seemed to be east of downtown and it had two lights, one at either end.  It moved south and appeared very large for as far away it was.  I would say about half the size of a dime at arms length.  The light towards the front was brighter, and eventually the light at the back began to pulse.  It eventually dimmed out.  We could see one of the light heading east still, but after a couple minutes it began to get too dim also.  At this point the light to the south was no longer visible either.  In total we saw nine of these objects and got seven on tape.  You can look for yourself, but it does not appear that these objects had the characteristics of any known craft.  The closest would be a helicopter, but that would not explain why some appeared to come out of no where, and why they seemed solid at first.  It also would not explain the apparent disk shape.  Two other things I would like to note, although they seem extraordinary is that they seemed to react to being video taped, and they seemed to intentionally blink to mimic airplanes.

The weather was overcast with occasional light rain, not many other cars on this stretch of the two lane highway. I noticed a peculiar whitish light off to the front left of where I was traveling, it didn't look like a conventional aircraft and it wasn't moving at a steady speed. I continued to watch this light, and at the same time was looking for a safe place to pull off to the side of the road so that I could take a better look at whatever this thing was. After driving and watching this light for approximately 2 minutes, I found a safe place to pull off the road, I stopped the car and got out to take a better look. The actual shape of the 'craft' could not be easily determined, and the distance was difficult to determine also, since there was nothing for reference. The light was a pale shade of white and constant, and it appeared to be traveling in a northerly direction, at irregular speed. I was now looking at the object through 10x50 binoculars, always keep a set in my car for work related activities. I could make out a shape that resembled a sort of triangle, but with no definite shape, but occasionally, I could make out three distinct white lights on each 'point' of this triangle shape. Funny thing about this object was that there was no noise whatsoever. After watching this thing for a total of about 5 minutes, a car with two older men in their 60's pulled off the road in front of me and quickly backed up to where I was standing. They were both extremely excited and wanted to look through my binoculars, which I turned over to them almost immediately. By this time, the object was still visible with the naked eye, but not as clear as a couple of minutes earlier. After about one minute, I could not see the object, either because it was too far away, or because it had traveled into the somewhat low cloud layer. The two guys and I all agreed on what we had seen, as being something of a triangle with no noise, and again, I cannot even begin to estimate the size of the thing because I could not judge the distance. I hold a Commercial Pilots license with instrument and seaplane/multi=engine ratings and have been flying since 1976, and former CFI and CFI-II. I know what aircraft look like and their flight characteristics, etc. This was no ordinary aircraft, ordinary aircraft cannot stop in mid flight and change directions almost simultaneously. Well, that's all I have to report. I'd like to talk with any other people that may have observed this object, and hopefully somebody snapped a pic or two.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,,

It seems to be the same object.  Yes, I am an amateur ufologist and that is why I am somewhat hesitant to report what I have been seeing.  I do not want it to be assumed that I am just another wacko.  I have went out into the back yard many times, wanting to see a ufo but have never seen anything that strange-just alot of commercial or military aircraft.  Anyway, my first sighting of this object actually occurred on 11/22/05.  My girlfriend works at a local grocery store on midnight shift.  I pick her up from work at 6:00 am everyday that she works.  I usually leave the house around 5:30 am.  I was traveling on U.S. Rt. 11 as I usually do from the town of Pulaski, through the town of Dublin, to Radford where my girlfriend works.  On route to pick her up, as I approached the town of Dublin, I noticed a golden colored light in the western sky.  I assumed it was Venus, although it seemed unusually bright and I had never noticed a light in the sky that had a ""golden"" hue. (Mars usually appears to have an orangeish or reddish hue and does'nt sparkle or twinkle as this object does).  I thought to myself that this could be a star, but it just looked ""unusual"".  The sky was crystal clear and of course, at this time of morning it was still not yet daylight. The light appeared to be stationary. I got to the parking lot of the grocery store and looked in the general direction that I had seen the ""light"", however, the lights in the parking lot were too bright and therefore obscured my view of the sky.  I picked my girlfriend up and we proceeded on Rt. 11 toward home. I had told her what I had seen and asked her to look around in the sky. As we approached Dublin, we saw the light again. It looked like it was in the same position. We could not discern a clear ""shape"", just a sparkling golden light. As we got closer to the light it looked as if it had iridescent qualities to it. We kept an eye on it and as we were headed in the opposite direction as when I initially saw it on my left, it was now to our right. As I was driving, I could not continually watch the light as my girlfriend could, but I saw what I can best describe as a ""white or silvery ball"" drop from the object. My girlfriend subsequently saw a total of 3 or 4 of these ""balls"" or ""spheres"" drop from the object. Again I was driving and could not continuously view the object. As we got closer, the object seemed to get larger and seemed to be directly overhead (directly above Rt. 11) as if it had moved from being on our right. I still could not discern a defined shape to the object, although my girlfriend said that it indeed seemed to have a ""saucer"" shape. To me, it seemed that the object had a changing or morphing shape. We eventually passed right under the object and as we did I had somewhat of an uncomfortable, foreboding feeling. As I was afraid I was going to cause a traffic accident trying to observe the object, I pulled over at a grocery store parking lot in the town of Dublin about a couple hundred feet up from where we had passed under the object. I turned the car around so that I was facing the direction where we had just seen the object and to our astonishment, it seemed to have disappeared. Since that time, I have kept my eyes peeled but saw nothing like it until the morning of 12/21/05 at 5:50 am on my way to pick my girlfriend up from work I saw the ""golden light"" again as I was approaching the town of Dublin. But this time as I got closer to the object the golden appearance of the light dissipated and became two seperate lights, one being white and flashing or strobing. The other light was on the other ""end?"" of the object and was a steady red color. The sky was super clear and I also noted that the object was to the east, opposite of the position I had seen it on the previous occassion. I proceeded down Rt. 11 to pick my girlfriend up in Radford. I had to wait on her to get off work as she did not get off work at exactly 6:00 am. I attempted to spot the object but as before, the parking lot lights' brightness obscured my view of the sky. We went through the drive-thru at the McDonald's which is very close to my girlfriend's work to pick up breakfast to take home. I informed her that I had seen a ""UFO"" again and asked her to keep her eyes peeled. As we approached the town of Dublin I could see the ""golden light"". I asked my girlfriend if she saw it and she confirmed. As we got into the town of Dublin and closer to the object, it again did not appear to be ""golden"" anymore. Again I saw a white flashing or strobing light on one ""end"" and a steady red light on the other ""end"". However, this time there appeared to be small white lights (steady) in between the strobing light and the steady red light. My girlfriend also confirmed what I was observing. The object was still in an easterly position and was on my left as it had been on my right on the way to Radford. I again pulled over at the same grocery store lot as I had done previously on 11/22/05 and pulled the car back around to point in the general direction of the object. But this time we could still see the object and it once again looked golden in hue. We observed it for only a few seconds before it started to move toward the now rising sun on the eastern horizon. We observed the object moving in this direction until it moved behind a building in front of us and we could no longer see it. The object did not seem to be moving very fast, but was moving nonetheless. I almost forgot to mention that it only seemed to be about 500 feet above the ground both times I have observed this object. I would find it hard to believe that no one else has observed this anomalous light in this general area, as Rt. 11 is a heavily traveled highway, even in early hours of the morning, as people are commuting to work. Possibly no one else is looking toward the skies as they are pre-occupied with their commute to work? Anyhow, thanks for your time---I tried to be as detailed w/descriptions as possible. Thanks again.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,37.1283,-80.5935

It was orange. It had a rather long (what looked like) fire flame following it. To be honest, if I heard on the news that what I saw was an airplane that blew up in the sky and was on fire as it descended, I would believe it. Granted it had to be a rather LARGE fire as I could see the item on fire and it was WAY up in the sky. If it was space garbage, It was HUGE space garbage as the tail was long, almost like a shooting star that went real slow. It fell downward. I saw all of this with a nake eye.  It traveled very slow. It was not a plane ""smoke"" trail. I called my employees at the Hoover office. THey saw it as well and could not guess what it was as none of us had seen anything like this before.

Approximately 1830 pm I pulled out of the company parking lot after work.  This company is located in Wolf Lake, Illinois.  I started for home turning left out of the company heading south on Highway 3 heading approximately 17 miles to Illinois 141 which heads west across the Bill Emerson Bridge into Missouri.  I noticed a very bright light in the sky that on first glance appeared to be a very bright star.  I went approximately 4 miles south and kept glancing at the light which was at approximately 3 o'clock out my passenger side window and noticed that the light appeared then to be moving south and was paralleling at what appeared to be the same rate of speed.  I was driving the speed limit which was 55 miles per hour for that highway.  The light was very bright and as I continued south the light almost seemed to wobble as it moved through the air.  My best quess at it's was maybe 1500 to 2000 feet off the ground.  The light seemed to almost stop at one point and when I would slow down it seemed as if it would too.  As I got further south the light appeared to speed up and eventually I was watching it at about 1:00 o'clock out of the windshield.  I watched it all the way to 141 and I turned due west on 141.  The light moved further south and west and it appeared to move over the Lonestar Concrete factory just south of Cape Girardeau and at that point I thought it must be a plane or chopper because this is the general direction of the Cape Girardeau Airport.  I never saw any aircraft blinking lights, it was a solid light with an erractic flying behavior.  At this point the light came back toward highway 141 and again seemed to parellel me as I crossed the Bill Emerson bridge.  I continued west toward Interstate 55 which is approximately 4 miles once you cross the bridge.  The light was south and slightly west but was moving back to the north as I neared the interstate.  Once I turned north onto I 55, the light then moved at a high rate of speed and again seemed to be parelleling me as I proceeded north on 55.  The light got much closer at this point and the appearance of wobbling as it moved was very visible and it began to take shape which was like a bell shape and at one point I could see a very distinct blue sphere of light encircling the bell shape.  I continued north bound now very intriqued as you can imagine and I kept my speed at 50 to 55 miles per hour because now the light was in 9 and 1000 o'clock window out my driver side door.  My intended exit was the Jackson Missouri/Fruitland exit which is my exit to go home in Jackson.  This is approximately 10 miles from Cape were I got on the interstate.  The light was very bright and would speed up and slow down and even hover almost as if it was regulating it's speed to keep up with me.  At this time I tried to call my wife to ask her to step out of our house and see if she could see the light although I doubt she could because the light was to low. I exited off I 55 and turned left heading back south into Jackson.  Now the light was about in my 12:00 o'clock position, very bright with the bell shape and the blue sphere.  As I drove south I tried to call my wife again.  This distance from the interstate to my turn off into my subdivision is approximately 4 miles.  The light then moved slowly to the west and I intentionally did not turn off at my subdivision because I wanted to see were the light would go.  I watched the light drift over the Jackson City Park which is near my house.  I then turned due west on route D in Jackson and drove about 1 mile turning left or south on to Broadridge.  The light drifted in front of me heading west and slightly south. There is a water tower on that side of the city and it made a great reference point as the light moved west of the tower.  I then turned immediately off of Broadridge onto a small dead end drive called independence medical street because it gave me a great viewing vantage point.  There were very few city lights to make it difficult to see the light.  The light then stopped south and west of me and south and west of the water tower.  It took on that distinct wobbling behavior and was very bright with the blue sphere intermitenly visible.  It should be noted that when I was on 141 I rolled my window down to hear if there would be any engine noise.  There wasn't.  And when I was watching the light from the last vantage point, I turned off my lights, turned off my truck, took the keys out of the ignition and I got out to watch and listen.. There was never any engine noise. At one point I turned my lights on and off and the light seemed to get brighter as if it was actually coming closer.  It stood stationary with only the wobbling effect and the appearance of moving slightly side to side.  It never moved for twenty minutes.  Finally the light appeared to move south and west and I lost sight of it.  I know it wasn't an aircraft (airplane or helicopter) nor was it a star or anything else like I've ever seen.… ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know for certain what the witness observed, but we note that Venus is VERY prominent in the southwestern sky, at present.
