There wasn’t a single cloud in the sky.  I noticed something about half way through the cigarette, a little tiny light in the sky appeared from the right side of the Eastern night time sky.. My first impression was “It’s probably a plane”  But I noticed the tiny orb that looked EXACTLY like a star,(And had no flashing lights of any kind)  It was moving across the sky a little faster than an airplane usually fly’s.  The altitude of the orb seemed way too high for a plane to physically reach. There was absolutely no sound around whatsoever. The orb traveled towards the left side of the Eastern skies, moving in a strange pattern, I guess the most accurate word for it would be “Semi-Zig Zag patterns”  After watching it for a good 2 minutes, It slowly disappeared as it made a turn going even HIGHER into the nighttime sky. (At this point I knew for sure what I saw was NO airplane, & certainly NOT a comet)  The object was also both accelerating and slowing down a few times, but not drastically.  It shined a bright light that made it look like a “perfect star” about half way through the sky.  Then slowly began to fade towards the end of the second minute.

Sunday 030313 about 22:30 there were no stars in the very dark sky. I watch the sky all the time and there I saw a triangle or christmas tree shaped large lighted object. I could tell it was rather large yet it seemed to be really up high so it must have been big. It had several very very bright lights all around on it that were very white and a blue tint that looked almost like they had a pulse and shimmer. I couldnt stop looking at it because it was so unusual and beautiful and it never moved like a plane, rather it just stayed in one place with the exception of a little adjustment now and then or at least thats what it looked like. I am not sure how long it may have been there before I saw it but I watched it for about 20 minutes and left for a minute or two and when I came back it was gone. Monday 030413:  I was outside again about the same time 22:30 and again not a star in the sky that was visable to me and I was amazed to see this same beautiful triangle shaped object back and this time there were three and they were all exactly alike, it looked like every detail. The beautiful very bright lights, the shape and the distance from my view was they were all the same distance apart but placed in a pattern in the sky.  When I looked at them I had two of them in my sight but had to turn my head a little to see the third.  They were evenly spaced from one another. I may have seen a very dim 4th one further to the West out further closer towards the Great Salt Lake. I was so amazed at them all being a like and so beautiful and bright. I did notice at one point that one of them seemed to turn a little so thata its tip was not in line like the others like it had been. They just looked like very beautiful lighted christmas trees. I could tell the lights were also very lar! ge because you could see some distint circles. I felt like they were up really high yet they were big. The lights were also very clear and bright without any haze. I left for about an hour then went back out and saw that one was still there just oved a little bit but still very bright and the others were very dim like maybe now further away or something. I watched them for about another 20 minutes and got cold and went to bed. I was in Sunset looking up and out towards the Western sky.  The brightest one looked like it was almost over me but the others were little scattered to the West.  The Great Salt Lake is out to the West just a little distance away.",2013-04-12T00:00:00,,

They came back from the other direction this time and then again crossed back across the sky.  They seemed to be in pursuit of something, but we didn't see anything.   Suddenly we realized that they were both heading toward the exact same point.  It looked as if they were going to collide!  It really felt like we were watching an action movie!  After appearing to very narrowly miss each other, one of the ""objects"" began to zigzag.  It was a very strange sight.  At this time both of them crossed the sky again and flew out of sight. While we watched them disappeared we saw another different kind of craft appear.  We didn't see which direction it came from and it was almost like it appeared out of nowhere.  It didn't make a sound like the others had, and it was traveling in the opposite direction.  It was obviously huge!  It was very high in the sky yet was still twenty or more times the size of a star.  It had lights--three prominent ones that seemed to form a triangle.  The lights seemed to alternate with blue in one spot at times and red and white at other times.  It made its way smoothly through the air.  It was a totally different looking form of flight than the other crafts we saw before.  We watched until it disappeared, which felt like forever. I immediately went inside and sent out a text to close family members(at the risk of sounding totally crazy) and informed them that we had just seen a ufo and what looked like military jets attempting to intercept it.  I expected to get a few ""lol"" responses, but instead got a phone call from my sister who had also seen a strange occurrence in the sky probably 45 minutes before us.  She described seeing a large object in the sky that she couldn't quite place, and said that it just disappeared right before her eyes.  It startled her to the point of calling her husband right away. What we saw tonight was unlike anything I've ever seen.  I felt sick to my stomach and there was a sense of urgency in the air.

I was riding in a car (minivan) with my mom, my little sister (nine), my little brother (nine months) and my two younger sisters in the back, both under five, fast asleep.  My mom has always kind of ridiculed my belief in UFOs (I’ve seen one before), so I at first thought she was joking when she said, ""I think I found your UFO."" After she said she was serious several more times, I finally looked out a window, and saw nothing.  She described what she saw to me, she said she saw three little glowing orange lights ahead of her, much bigger than stars.   I looked out my window, and to my side I saw one as well.  We travel a lot very near to the Denver Airport so we both know what airplanes look like at night.  We live in rural Colorado so we both know what stars look like at night.  We were driving over La Veta pass at the time, and there weren’t many stars in the sky yet.   My first guess was airplane, but it looked absolutely nothing like an airplane, once I got a good look at it.   My second guess was ball lightning.  But there weren’t any clouds, and it hadn’t rained in a good week.  I was almost completely at loss. The more I thought the more I thought they were TRUFOs.  They disappeared one at a time, until they were all gone. I’ve seen helicopters at night, weather balloons, and all sorts of things.  I thought it might have been swamp gas but (Heh, heh) rural (not to mention dry) Colorado owns no swamps, and they didn’t look glowing.  I (luckily) remembered what I should do, though, and caught the time; 8:15 PM, March seventh, 2013.  Please give me any helpful information to explain this!

I was out on the rooftop of the garage to my apartment complex in Country Club, Miami looking at the fireworks because one can get a great panoramic view from up there. I had been watching the fireworks for about 40mins so I knew pretty much the patterns/details of the various groups of fireworks from around the neighborhood. I noticed 3 orange-red lights flying about 8 miles away I would estimate.  They flew at the height of a plane about to land but their trajectory was horizontal, they flew much slower than a plane at that height and they made a triangular configuration.  I am pretty sure they weren't from the same object and that their formation made it seem like it could have been a triangular object. I went into my pocket to grab my ipod touch to take a video but i forgot it in my apartment and they went out of sight behind some buildings. This lasted in all approximately 10-15 seconds f! rom the moment i noticed the strange lights to when they went out of sight. I went back to my place to say goodnight and take out the garbage, but I found what I had seen so strange that I grabbed my ipod and went back to the rooftop.  I spent about 20mins looking at fireworks and then I saw the strangest thing I had ever seen.  About 2miles away (pretty close), another complex was having a display.  These were the closest fireworks to my location. What i thought was another firework rising to explode was the same colour fireball I had seen earlier, but much closer and brighter. Imagine looking at fireworks shooting upwards…..naturally, you'd expect it to explode as per usual; this orange-red fireball kept rising and rising and then started coming in my direction. I kinda froze a bit then remembered I had my ipod and took it out nervously to video record it. I got about 4 seconds of it before it turned sharply to the right behind my building, but because I was on the rooftop I! was able to run along the top to see it in view again. It was! travell ing horizontally and then started making circles around where the fireworks were exploding. I listened very carefully to hear if it was a helicopter (with very weird bright orange lights) but couldn't hear anything. my battery to my disgust went dead and I only got a few seconds of it. I was so disappointed. After that, I saw the same thing happen again: a bright red-orange flare-like light come up out of where the fireworks were going off, not explode and then change direction from upward to horizontal to circular. This time the light was clearly pulsing, but randomly. It wasn't a predictable pulse, sometimes very very bright, other times very very dim to the point where you  could barely see it. I saw this 4-5 more times after this but these times the light (which was always alone) was just in the sky moving horizontally, then circling back around. It felt like deja vu each time and I kept saying out loud, ""what the fuckkkk is that thing"" I came down from the roo! f and walked as far as i could in the direction of the light (which was gone by now) to see if I could hear any noise like a helicopter which is the only explanation I had that made any kind of sense). There was not one photon of white light however, only orange-red and no sound. So I decided to google ""Fireball July 4th Miami"" and a combination of other key words and I came across this website. I actually sent my friend a text message after I saw the very first light at 11:27pm. This was the text: 11:23pm ""Dude r u looking at fireworks? "" 11:27pm ""I'm sure they're gonna be a lot of UFO sightings tonight esp since millions of eyes r in the skies. I swear I just saw the weirdest light in the sky. Thought it was a firework going up as usual but it didn't explode then started traveling horizontally. I got some of it on my ipod video. I followed it. It was bright red like a flare but traveling like a plane and pulsing, not blinking then it just faded and disappeared. WTF?!?! :s""",2013-07-05T00:00:00,25.7741427135084,-80.28951850011829

They were very close to each other like they were in formation; the objects were coming from the East between Portland and Mitchellville Tn to the west towards Springfield Tn.   After they started to gain altitude one more came from the same direction and the first two got very dim and disappeared into a cloud.  After the third ball of light gained altitude a fourth came from the same direction in the same manner.   These bright balls of red/orange followed the same flight pattern except for the first two that flew together.  There were a total of six.  As far as the timing in between each I can’t tell you, but they were coming one after another and right before they would disappear the next one would show up.   For about 13 years, I use ! to live on the edge of the Dunnellon FL. Airport, were they trained acrobatic planes and I have never seen any normal planes fly that close to one another.

This report is what my cousin told me today she witnessed last night. Port Angeles, WA - UFO Sighting, July 4, 2012, Midnight, stars out, no clouds, no wind. I was standing on my back deck looking South (towards the Olympic Mountains) at a neighbor’s fireworks when something caught my eye and I looked a little East where I saw 2 red spheres above the tree line and below the mountains’ ridgelines.  There were no stars behind the spheres.  The balls were uniform in their brightness and color.  They did not emit an aura.  They were simply red lights each about the size of a basketball I would hold in my hands. Identical spheres kept appearing one right after another at a regular pace until I could see 12 altogether.  I heard no sounds other than the few remaining fireworks going off.  All 12 spheres were equally spaced in a straight line moving slowly to the North.  After about 3 minutes the 2nd and 3rd sphere moved out of line forming a triangle with the 1st one staying in the lead.  The remaining 9 stayed in the same straight line behind the triangle and did not decrease or increase their distance from one another. I went in to get my roommate so she could see this too.  By the time we got back to the porch we saw the last two leave our field of vision at what I judge to be over the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  This whole sighting lasted about 5 minutes and at no time did I have to tilt my head to watch the progress of these red balls in the night sky. Afterward I went to the internet to see if any information might be there to help explain what I had just seen.  I was shocked at the quantity of reports.  Both my roommate and I are senior citizens who do not regularly pay attention to this sort of thing.  The following is a video link I found that is almost identical to what I saw except that the balls of red light I witnessed were much, much larger.

I was seated in my van, facing approximately NNE, at approximately 8:53 PM, Friday, 23 March 2013. The air was lit up to the left (and West) of me by the stadium lights at the nearby Hayfield High School. As I was backing up in my parking space (at the curb in front of my house) in order to clear another vehicle parked immediately in front of me, some movement in the sky to my upper left front caught my attention.  Something was moving across the sky low, from West to East, but not particularly fast. Suddenly, it turned yellow-orange and then disappeared down behind the trees (and house) to my right front. I think it was flaming out as it disappeared, but I’m not 100% positive!  It was visible for a few seconds, although it seemed longer at the time!  PARTICULARS  I was facing N 47 degrees, 06 minutes 15 seconds E (according to my house plat!)  I was looking up at approximately 10 degrees (from horizontal) at the center of my field of view (FOV). I noticed the object at 30 degrees to the left of center line of FOV. I lost the object at 35 degrees to the right of center line of FOV. Trajectory was fairly straight, at angle of 3 to 4 degrees to my horizontal, up on left to down on right. Trees in front on me were about 480 feet away, at right angle to centerline of my FOV.  The house behind which I lost sight of object is about 145 feet away (2-story, split entry model). Time was approximately 8:53 PM. NOTEs:  I got into my van as I was heading to local 7-11 store to purchase lottery entries (Mega Millions and PowerBall), which I do at about the same time every Tuesday and Friday evening. When a police officer came to the neighborhood at approx 8:11 PM and we were IDing the time of my observation, he said his Sergeant had sent out a message at 8:54PM to all officers alerting them to be on the lookout for anything unusual. I had reported the sighting, but because of the altitude, color and speed I thought it was something local (i.e., something other than a meteor) because all I had ever observed were shooting stars and meteorite showers!  I offered to the police that I thought it might have come down not to distant from me!  Therefore, we didn’t want to rule out possibility that it was a nearby event!  Later on 10 PM news (local FOX, Channel 5) they reported that there had been a meteor event, seen from North Carolina to New England, and someone had report seeing it from Frederick, Maryland. The news added that it was not unusual for observers to think meteors in the atmosphere are than they actually are, but meteors usually stop glowing before reaching 5 miles high because they have slowed so much by then. This morning, on the NBC news (local Channel 4), they showed a still B&W photo from Maryland and reported that it had been seen from Florida to New England and the colors were bluish and greenish to bright orange in Maryland. I concluded that I picked up the object as it was slowing from higher speed (whitish-bluish) and turning to yellow-orange.  So the observer in Frederick, MD area and I were likely seeing the same thing. I think the news gave the time as being around 8 PM.

Recently I saw something unexplainable, on March 24th, at approx. 8:30pm, I was in Waldorf, Maryland, driving on Mattawoman-Beantown Rd in moderate snowfall, when I saw lights that appeared to be a small plane landing with its landing lights and I saw a red blinking light, although I thought I was weird because there is no airport near there, as I drove further up the road I noticed that it was hovering and not flying, I thought surely its a helicopter and I must have mistook the search light for landing lights.  As we drove under the object, I could clearly see a Black Triangle with three red lights on the bottom that alternated flashing in a clockwise motion, no two light were on simultaneously, also there was a light at each corner that resembled a car's headlights but searching in a sweeping motion.  I exclaimed WHAT IS THAT!  My 13 yo son stopped playing his tablet and looked at  the object and said ""Wow that is weird""…  As we drove down the street the object stay pe! rfectly still until we drove out of view.  My girlfriend who was driving could not see the object as it was above the passenger side of the vehicle.  She asked if I wanted to turn around and go back but my fear of being spotted trumped my curiosity.....  After seeing it I drew a picture of it  which I can email to you as we'll as a map diagram where this took place. On March 30th the object was spotted again approx. 11-1130pm in Waldorf Maryland on English Oak Court.....This time the object flew overhead near the house off a friend of mine. I was not witness to the second event, but my friend that lives there witnessed the craft with two others. I've known this man since 5th grade and I'm a 31 yo man and he doesn't lull pranks or lie about these types of things..... I'm writing this to whom it may concern because Waldorf Maryland may currently be a UFO Hotspot...Learning about Space a technology is a hobby of mine and I fully believe in life on other worlds but these craft could be secret military craft just as well as other worldly vehicles. I have very little knowledge of MUFON but you may have more resources than me to be able to catch footage of one of these things.. I would like for my friends, family myself to remain as anonymous as possible but I am willing to respond via email or phone of any inquiries, until then I will try my hardest to get a picture of this object, because it isn't just lights in the sky...

Two orange flames silently crossing the night sky.  My friend was outside smoking a cigarette around 11pm while talking on his phone when he spotted an orange object just under the full moon, following a straight trajectory across the night sky. 5-10 minutes later the exact same thing happened and he ran inside yelling for me to come outside to see it.   It obviously resembled an orange flickering flame, circular in shape.  It was about 1/10th the size of the 11pm full moon, silently crossing the sky, heading from our perspective due north.  I expected the object to get smaller, like a glass balloon with a flame inside it, drifting up into the night sky.  This however was not the case.  The object stayed the same size, traveling a straight line, and appeared to be around airplane altitude or possibly outside of the atmosphere.   It's hard to grasp an object traveling at such an altitude yet having a magnitude perfectly visible to the naked eye, it would have to be of astronomical size.  It did not look like reflection, it looked like a bright circular orange flame.  It took a little more than a minute for it to travel behind the skyline.  My friend confirmed that the first one followed the exact same trajectory.  We were both sober.  This is baffling and so far defies explanation. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.

At first I didn’t pay much attention until they seemed to be on a path of  possible impact, they were too close to be typical aircraft as we live 30 minutes from an international airport and I am very familiar with normal air traffic patterns.

It was the same orange color as the old orange monochrome computer screens from the 90's.  It was coming from the Northeast and heading South.   When it started moving south it slowed down as one plane flew past it. It looked like the the amber object was going to hit the approaching plane.

I know it wasn't my mother or father they were at the door as I could hear them, I became afraid because the only people lived in that apt were me,mom and dad.   Anyway I felt the skin on my thighs and arms( being a child I slept in underwear and tee-shirt), the skin was like a slim jim(beef stick) years later this is the only thing I could associate with the texture of the skin and dark brown, it was not male or female, skinny, small oval shaped head, large black eyes in over sized sockets, I didn't see a mouth, now my eyes were opened, but I was calm, no fear.  I woke up that mor! ning sun shining, I never spoke of it until I was 38 yrs old.  However I do have the ability to see things and places that I have never been before but can describe them.  Once when I worked at a plasma center a client had lost his ring, I told him to go home and look on the floor behind a nightstand in his bedroom, I just said it, he came back and asked me how I knew.

This occurred when I was a child (about 8 or 9 years old) and could have happened in the summer of 1969.  I was camping with my family in Upper Lisle Park but was alone fishing in pond in a somewhat secluded area about 1000 feet south of Upper Lisle Rd. and 300 feet west of Whitney Point Reservoir. I was facing north at dusk as the craft came directly over me and continued moving north at a speed I would judge at about 5-10 miles an hour.  I watched until the trees to the north of me blocked my view.  I ran back to the campsite thinking everyone there would have seen it and would be talking about it.  However no one was, and afraid of being ridiculed,  I did not tell anyone that day of my experience.  I figured since it flew just above the trees, the trees must have blocked their view.

I believe it was mid-day around 11 or noon.  Just outside Gypsum, past the high school, there was a small farm with a ranch house and barn on the left hand side of the road (we were headed East.)  While driving, we noticed a strange metallic oval/sphere that was hovering over the farmhouse.  It was about 20 – 30 feet above the house and seemed to be floating.  The metal of the object did not have any reflection and was hard to make out any detail.   The object was not large, perhaps the size of a small car (VW bug).  The main thing that was odd was the way it moved.  It made no noise, and the object’s movements didn’t make sense or seem to apply to the laws of gravity and physics.  It floated, and then hovered above the farm house.  Then, suddenly, the object shot up into the sky extremely fast.  Its speed was faster than anything had ever seen before.   Afterwards, my husband and I looked at each other with stunned faces and said, “What was that?”  And then for some reason, we discounted it and never talked about it again.   I had completely forgotten about this occurrence until a few years ago.  I have no idea why I didn’t report the incident or tell anyone else what we saw.

I then noticed one star just to the 1 to 2 o'clock position of the aircraft when it suddenly shot towards the rear of the aircraft, then circled around behind your craft over to it's 9 o'clock position. It trailed and traveled with the aircraft in a parallel motion tracking and pacing the aircraft for approximately 1 to 2 seconds and then it faded and disappeared.

While quail hunting with my brother in Eastern Maricopa County, Arizona, I had the following sighting:  It was approximately 1 pm on a clear, sunny day.  There was not a cloud in the sky.  We were hunting in the desert about 1 mile east of Hwy 87 and North Forest Rd 68, approx. map coordinates are loc: 33.526389,-111.389722.  The day and month are uncertain; it was quite some time ago.  However, I do know it would have occurred during the Arizona quail hunting season which runs from mid-October to mid-February. We had decided to break for lunch at our campsite.  After lunch, we were sitting in lawn chairs facing west.  The sun was high, there was nothing obscuring my view of the western sky.  I would approximate the temperature was in the low to mid 70’s.  The horizon I was facing was actually a line of low mountainous terrain which ran along the western side Hwy 87.  There was also a low mountainous horizon further to the north. My brother had decided to pull his hat down over his eyes and take a short nap; I simply sat in my chair taking in the view.  What happened next was simply shocking. From over and behind the mountain range I was facing to the west appeared what I can only describe as a huge rectangular mirror.  Its size was incredible; it had to be at least a mile in length.  The truly bizarre aspect was it seemed to be rotating as it moved across the sky.  Its dimensions appeared to have the ratio of a sheet of printing paper, lying on its long side.  It was rotating on its central axis, so the effect was that I could only see it when the side rotated and caught the full reflection of the sun.   As it moved in a west-to-east trajectory, it rotated so I could only see the entire rectangle shape at certain points across the sky.  The object “flew” across the sky to the north of my position in a straight west-east line.  The things I were unable to determine were speed, altitude and size because of how quickly it disappeared from my view, but it was huge and it was fast.  The whole thing lasted no more than 10 seconds, and by the time I thought of saying something to my brother, it was already gone. I only report this because I am fascinated by the subject of UFO’s and have never heard of this type of sighting before.  I only recently became aware of this site to report what I saw.

Anyway, I was carring munitions out to the flight line, I stopped to do a FOD check before entering the flight line when a black diamond shaped object flew over the flight line and runway.   The runway runs east to west and the object came from the north heading south.  I would say it was the size of a large suv.  It had no wings and made no sound.   This thing should not be flying.  It was in the middle of the day, nice clear sky, it couldnt have been over a 100 feet high and maybe a couple of hundred feet in front of me.  I just stood there and watched it fly south until it was out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2014-01-10T00:00:00,,

I got dropped off on the main road and walked all the way in by myself to camp alone. The spot is just south of the city limits of Sedona, off of  highway 179 south.  There is a side road I cannot remember the name of you take east, and it follows a river. I was 18 at the time, and I guess I was very fearless, because I would be scared to camp there by myself now.  I did not believe in aliens at the time, to the degree that I do now. One night, while camping out on the river with not a soul around for miles, the weather looked like it was going to begin to storm.  I was sleeping on the ground, under a tarp out in the open.  I secured my tarp, and dug a trench around it to collect the rain away from my sleeping bag. Before it started to rain, I saw a very bright circle of light, that looked oddly close, and not outside the atmosphere, but rather inside it.  Sure enough, it start to move around, and vanished behind a mountain. I dropped to my knees in overwhelming fear.  Then the thunder storm came with loud thunder and heavy rain.  I remember laying there in paralyzing fear. Thinking back on it, I hope I wasn't abducted that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

UK 2008 It was mid-summer in 2008, I estimate around the time of June around 10pm at night. Myself and a friend of mine left our home to grab some food from a nearby chinese takeout.  As we walked along the road, I glanced up into the sky above the restaurant and noticed 5 solid orange lights, in a diamond/kite formation silently hovering. I estimate the distance to these crafts from ourselves at approximately 250m away, we paused in our tracks and simply observed what was happening.  The two points of light on either side of this formation(the left and the right respectively) began to slowly move towards each other, in a very smooth and seemingly controlled manner, passing each other and becoming stationary in each others original position (essentially these two lights cross paths and swapped sides on this formation), around 60 seconds later they reverted back to their original positions before disappearing, leaving only 3 lights remaining. These 3 lights began descending to what I would estimate approximately 100m in height above us, and began moving down the street towards us, passing over head.  The formation had became somewhat of a .. ""convoy"" following one after the other in single file.  The first of the 3 lights passed by approximately 50m and as it did so, the solid orange light emitting from the first craft, simply turned ""off"".  Now that the glare of the lights were gone, we could see a circular craft of some sort, silhouetted  against the night sky, it was rotating anti-clockwise very slowly.  We could tell the craft was rotating due to the fact there appeared to be some kind of components on the exterior hull, slightly darker in colour than the craft itself.  The craft was a silver raw metal kind of colour, as it continued by we stared at this craft intently but strangely enough.. without blinking or turning away, the craft vanished.  It didn't whiz off at high speed, or make any jerky movements, it was there and then it wasn't.. The second and third craft did exactly as the first craft had done, it moved over our heads around 50m away from us with the lights turning off at the same point as the first craft, the same type of craft was seen silhouetted against the sky, spinning anti-clockwise very slowly, with the same outside markings as the first craft. It too simply vanished while looking right at it, as did the third craft moments later. There was absolutely no sound, no humming or vibrating which also puzzled us both. My friend observed everything I did, standing no less than 2m away from myself on the corner of the street. I am fairly certain these were not Chinese lanterns, as their path of flight and movement appeared to be extremely steady and controlled, I do not believe paper chinese lanterns can move in a controlled manner, they're carried by the wind and these objects were clearly not affected by the wind.  In hindsight, I do not know why I did not attempt to take any pictures or evidence of this encounter. The reason it's taken me 5 years to make a report of this sighting, is for two reasons:  1) Every time I bring up this encounter with anybody, friends, family, strangers, I am subject to ridicule and people questioning my sanity.  2) I have struggled trying to locate the proper authorities to report this to whilst living in the UK. I thought about reporting to an American organisation however I was unsure if it would be accepted, given I am not residing in America nor did the sighting take place there.

They would send forward jets in a step like-pattern (jets at several altitudes and coming in from both sides)and get fairly close to this thing before it would disappear and reappear away from the main pack of jets.

That was when I saw what I thought was a jet coming from the northwest (I'd seen many that afternoon), illuminated by the setting sun, going toward the southeast at a great height, If I had to guess,15,000 feet.  I watched for some time as it grew closer, and larger, but, still at a great height, heading southwest...

At that exact moment, like they read my thoughts, this,, what I thought was, a jet - a tiny vehicle way up high- with its contrail (shorter than usual for a passenger jet).  Suddenly, this ""jet"", made a 90 degree turn directly up (it did not stop and turn, it did not curve upward, it just made a 90 degree turn in continued motion directly up or out, and away from earth) stopped emitting the contrail, as it went up, it began glowing as a bright orange fireball and as I watched flared blindingly bright two or three times the size of the vehicle itself.  After flaring up so bright, perhaps 5 seconds then, the orange quickly started to fade, and as the orange light faded, I could make out a disk shaped craft then, this craft just faded away, and there was nothing but the brief horizontal contrail remaining where it had been traveling before it turned upward and disappeared.

Upon arriving at the lease I saw lights moving about the tree's.  I took several photo's and video.  Then the lights began moving at me.  I was concerned but figured I would discover it was something explainable.  That was not the case.  As it got closer I could see parts of the craft. The top looked like a disk with a compartment underneath it.  It was absolutely silent.  It was within 50 yards of me.  I knew if it was a helicopter I could have heard the blades chopping through the wind.  I looked up and saw the disk shaped edge of the craft about to move over my head.  I had a gut feeling it was time to hide.  I came off the catwalk on the tank battery and hid behind a separator after I shut the tank valves to stop the loading process.  A white light came on inside a compartment under the disk.  There were objects in the light but no movement.  There was a red glow next to the compartment.  Like red taffy stretching out like it was being vented but had the appearance of light.  I snapped a picture with my cellphone and it occurred to me I may have to throw my phone if something comes for me.  I was relieved when the craft backed away.  There was the sound of an approaching jet. A F-16 looking jet passed right above my head.  The craft went dark before it reached its location.  The jet circled back and left the area. I could still see the jet lights when the object reappeared over the tree's.  There was a series of 4 light clusters circling my location.  One of the lights appeared from the North and was going to pass right over me.  I knew my camera memory was getting full. What looked like a flickering airplane light revealed it was something hot reacting to the air moving across it.  There was something big coming out of a steam or fog.  It was massive and looked like rock.  I believed it was a giant meteor.  I watched as a wall of solid rock passed over my head. I coul! d feel the air getting hotter.  It looked like it was at least ! 300 yard s wide and much longer. I believed there it would impact the ground a few miles past me.  As it passed over I could see what looked like impact craters.  Then I saw what appeared to be a large tube. Then I saw another one.  The whole thing slowed and banked upward to the east. It slowed to an almost stop and then took off at a 90 degree angle to the west.  It accelerated so fast it made what looked like twin vortex's underneath it.  I thought I might not get the opportunity for a shot. I struggled to find this huge thing in my view screen.  I finally just pointed the cameras eye at the thing and hope for the best. Luckily the craft banked back to the east and was coming straight back at me. This time I could see the top side of it. It had many light sources and building structures and even huge flares burning brightly.  The area the most light up was well above the crafts surface. I could not tell if was on a tower or simply hovering above the crafts surface.  There were glowing blu! e power lines strung across the surface. I was getting frightened again it was coming at me. It slowed and went to the south of me without banking this time.  It circled to the south of me and exited to the North on the east side of me.  As it climbed in altitude I could see the 4 light cluster I had noticed before its pass.  I finished my loading process. I told my friends and family about what I saw. I was leaving the location with my eyes glued to the sky.  My camera memory was full.1 mile down hwy 206.  I could see a light above a rural home.  It was just sitting there not moving.  I was concerned for the folks living in the home.  I stopped my truck. I shined my spot light at the craft.  It was too far away to see the crafts shape.  The craft started moving slowly.  The bottom of the craft was a triangle shape with lights embedded in the triangle framing.  The inside of the triangle was visible.  It looked like the inside of the hood of a sports car.  Interlaced tubing and turbo ducting.  It looked very elegant and high tech.  It drifted off a ways then the lights could not be seen anymore.  I wanted to drive my truck to the house to check on the people but could not get my truck into there driveway.  I talked to the people later and they knew nothing of the events of that night or had seen anything strange.  They said they would look for landing signs in there fields.  The images of this event are not high resolution but nothing short of amazing.  The video of the large craft has yielding still frame images that can not be explained.  We have identified alien architecture, creatures, buildings, and believe there is a refining process going on with unwanted products being burned off through flaring.  We have identified star field backgrounds of the craft that give it an enormous size and prove it was in the area spotted in the night in question and of a clarity level for that area, location, and time.  We seek the radar imagery for this amazing discovery.  Any help in this area would be greatly appreciated.  We will provide video and! still frame images of this event.

Although, the craft, I had seen in the past, was loud, very loud, and this one, utterly silent, I believe, it was the same craft, or same type.  I watched it, until it moved beyond line of sight behind the trees and apartment building next door, in our complex.  About a half hour later I went to sleep..  At 5:10am, I was then, awakened by a very loud, low vibration.  I did not get up to see but, having seen this craft many occasions, I attributed this, less than 3 hours later, as belonging to the same craft, and went back to sleep.  I don't know if they are just interested in the area, ! which just west of my complex is very sparsely populated gor seversl miles, or me, or both but, I have had repeated visits, I hope will continue, and from the stepping up of their visit's, I believe this to be true.

I know for sure, it was the night that the tv show, ""V"" was going to air it's new mid-season, an hour before that, the tv froze on a single picture, and I heard that same loud sound which I heard in my 11-25-10 incident report.  It is a distinct, sound, coming up from the east going westward, and this time, I figured by God, if it is a UFO, at least I am going to get out there to look: (see below regarding the 11-25-10 incident...). I opened my door so I could see through the storm door window and there, floating over my apartment building coming into view heading west, was the  typical saucer shape craft.  It actually had the same sort of curved shape at the ship in the tv show from the 60's Lost In Space, your typical disk.  There was a black raised disk on the top, grey metallic in color, with a row of lighted squares in a ring around the craft - estimating from that, assuming these were half to three quarters the height of a man it was 3 floors, red constant lights on either side right and left, the craft did not rotate, and the bottom half looked much the same as the top but, no ring of windows, it had one white flashing beacon below in the center bottom, this light capped the bottom.  I would guess its width at 75 feet - 100 at most, height was I estimate a third to half as high as it was wide.  A very disc like craft, the entire sky around it seemed to glow a bluish grey light, like moonligh! t, which lit the craft quite well allowing me to see the detail of it, a grey silver lead like colored craft on a lighted background, the light surrounded and went with the craft. The object was at the height about equal to the building next door stood on end, no more than twice that in height...  Pacing it off, later in the spring, I estimated it's altitude at a little more than 250 feet, 500 feet at most, and I watched it as it passed down range until it went behind the building next door's roofline, this is a guesstimate but, perhaps 1000 feet away at the farthest when it was going out of sight.  When overhead, it was maybe 30 feet away to my south east and 250  feet overhead floating westward. As I said, this craft was so loud, though I have since seen it operate in silent mode.  It was almost as loud but not quite, as what I heard in the 11-25-10 incident  (see below) because, I figured it was hanging, right above, or resting on, the roof, the first time.  It had to be the same craft, or same type, by the sound if it, this is so loud, it sounds like the sky is tearing open when your right next to it (or in my case, I believe underneath it) t! hough that 1st time I did not see it. This time, though I did not have a working camera with film, I grabbed a small red laser pointer I had, and pointed it at the craft.  It did not react, so I began flashing it back and forth, this was when (I require glasses to drive and read signs and was not wearing them), I noticed that in what I thought at first was lighted squares, there was actually shapes in them and moving slightly, these were figures of living beings, I am fairly certain.  This was when I got the impression/feeling, that it was not a good idea, like they did not like this, flashing my laser around but, I was desperate for them to see me.  That was when as it went out of sight, I had the impression, given or otherwise, of course they saw me, that was why they were there, to let me, see them.  I feel rather bad about this, I have since read, that they do not like camera flashes, so, I doubt they liked my laser at all. I have since, seen this craft several times, and each time it has been either at a distance, behind the tree line to the west, or at a fair height overhead but, at no time has it come close again (each sighting was at night and it was not glowing like that, so it is harder to tell the height).  I hope someday, I can apologize in person, for the laser, maybe someday they will permit me a low pass again and I can get a few pictures the next time.  Previous Hearing Report; believe same craft... On Nov 25th, at 12:20am Thanksgiving morning of 2010, a morning when there was no snow to speak of here, in Holts Summit Missouri but there were fall leaves, on the ground...  I was watching my usual Thanksgiving movie marathon, laying on the couch in front of my front window (just fyi - the windows faced west) probably starting it around 10pm, I fell asleep about 11pm more or less, awakened suddenly some hour later, by the sound of someone walking around outside my apartment in the leaves.  This is not unusual but, we do have sidewalks and at that time of night, it is a bit strange, knowing each one personally, most of the people here then, were not ordinarily, walking around at that time of night and would not have been outside the windows of my unit. Being a bit sleepy yet, I opened the drapes and looked outside.  Seeing nothing, I thought perhaps, it was a squirrel, we have a number of large ones that live in the area.  I was, as I said, half sleepy but, moments later, when a small white light appeared over the center sidewalk between my 4 plex building and the 4 plex next to it, at a height of about 15', it caught my attention in my peripheral vision through the sheer drapes I had up at the time.  As near as I can figure, it must have been moving to this point, which is what caught my eye...at that moment it burst into the brightest white light I have ever seen, a blinding flash of light, with sparks trailing toward the ground which went out, at that exact moment of the flash, I felt, as much as saw it, like; ""zzzappp"" a very strange occurrence which I will not ever, forget.  I jumped at that, extricating myself from the blanket I was under, moving to the front door, which was at the end of the couch by m! y head, perhaps 30 seconds had elapsed since being awakened... I was about to open it, when I thought, wait, I have no idea who or what is out there, so, I carefully draw back the sheer curtains, look out again, and could see nothing.  I reached to grab the door handle and was about to turn it to open the door and go outside, when a loud roaring sound fired up, this was immediately over my head, like it was on the center of my roof area and it honestly, was so extraordinarily loud it scared the hell out of me.  It was like someone tearing the sky open!!!! Now I am a grown man, at that point in my late 40's, and do not scare easily but, this was many times the sound of the space shuttle launch on tv, so loud it vibrated in my body and I could feel it, so loud, that I immediately dropped to a crouching position thinking perhaps the nearby Nuclear Power Plant that had blown up (a flash and roaring boom, it sort of, fit), expecting to be dead in a second I remained crouched down scared half to death but, it just got louder, and louder and then, this immense sound, began to lift away from my apartment roof...  This 'loud sound', did not go west, east, north, or south, it went vertical, straight upward, and continued doing so, putting distance between it and me.  This was the first moment that I began to comprehend that it was something other than the nuclear power plant... As this thing lifted away it quickly got softer, then faded completely in about 15 seconds,  yes, I should have gone out and looked but, it was gone so fast, had I gone out, I doubt I would have seen anything, and I honestly, it all happened so fast, the entire event being perhaps 2minutes in length, and I was truly frightened at first.  Even as the craft departed, I stood there, hand on the door knob, trying to dummon the courage to go outside, I never did.  It may be easy to say ""I would have gone outside to look"" but, in that instant when this, loudest sound I'd ever heard, like being underneath a booster rocket of the space shuttle, was probably 20-25' from me, over the top of me, you can't think, you just react and the natural reaction is to duck down and hide... The next morning I carefully walked the grounds but, could find nothing.  I asked around that day, all the neighbors, except the little 98 year old woman next door to me, whom was napping at that time of the afternoon, and no one said they saw anything.  One or two, said they had heard loud jets lately, and one woman said she heard, a low flying jet, late the night before...whether they saw anything and are unwilling to admit it, I can only guess. It was a couple of days before I had an opportunity to speak to the little old lady next door but, when I did, she said; ""Ohhh good, you heard that too"", that morning after midnight, she heard an extremely loud, roaring noise, and got up, went to her door and opening it, saw ""white smoke rolling at her away from the fence which boundaries the north side of the property (about 25 feet from her front door), immediately shutting her door, she returned to her bed and covered her head, terrified, she said.  I told her, I did not blame her, ""it scared even me, I have never heard anything so loud"". The really strange thing about this incident, well, one thing, was if this was a craft that landed or suspended over my roof, who was walking around outside my window while I slept.  Had they been inside?  Was I abducted, and have no memory?  What exactly was that, bright white flash?  Why, did I feel it?  Since then, I have seen this craft, in fact they are quite regular visitors now.  Are they interested in my area, in my apartment complex? In me?  I have many, questions?  No answers.... I have since this time, seen several craft which were, also loud like this.  Maybe the same craft, many times...  I know UFO's are generally silent, which is odd but, this craft or one's like it, though unseen on this occasion, returned many times, the next time, I did clearly see it (ie: above 01-04-11 sighting).  I had throughout my years seen lights way up in the sky moving oddly, blinking, etc., however, nothing I could absolutely say was a craft, or a UFO, until 2011. A friend and I were talking on our cell phones and I related this incident.  Before hanging up, I happened to say, I don't know what, it was, but, I really would like to see one up close, I did only a couple weeks later, perhaps they were listening?",2014-01-10T00:00:00,38.6296,-92.1027

My cousin and I had been in Pushmataha county on the Kiamichi river to a spot where, 2 months prior,  we had a violent encounter one night with a 15' tall hairy giant that most people call Bigfoot.  He tried to kill us by pushing a large tree over and we barely escaped with our lives.   After this encounter we began returning to the area with the intention of eventually killing this thing with assault rifles.  Once we determined where the creature was hiding out during the day we were preparing a plan of attack to sneak in and try to take this thing out.  One day while we were in the area we made contact with the creature through tree knocking.  I knocked and he responded with knocks followed by an angry howl.  For people not familiar with these creatures, they use tree knocks to locate each other or communicate with each other in the woods.  Anyway we waited around until about dark, but the giant didn't come out of the woods on this day, so we decided to leave since!  We didn't have night vision equipment.  On the way home we were on the highway between Talihina and Buffalo Valley when I saw a strobing light about a mile back in my rear view mirror.  I instantly thought cop and looked down at my speedometer to see how fast I was going.  As soon as I looked back up I remember hearing my cousin say ""What the hell is that"".  To my shock, there was a strobing ball of light about the size of a basketball beside the car.  It was keeping pace with the car and was about 3 feet from the passenger side window.  After following beside us for about a mile, another cars headlights appeared over a hill in the opposite lane and the light instantly shot straight up in the air.  We looked up and noticed that the ball of light went to a larger craft and the craft continued to follow us.  I decided that this had to be related to the Bigfoot creature and they could be following us in an attempt to find out where we live.  We ended up staying out most of the night driving around and this UFO continued to follow us for around 3 or 4 hours.  It finally quit following us when I pulled into a driveway near Wilburton, OK., which is not where I live,and turned off my lights.  We returned to the encounter area the next week and instead of encountering one creature, there were 3, anyway this is a story for a different site, but I am convinced that entities from another world have an invasion going on and all hell is getting ready to break loose someday soon.

I never saw the craft again.   The color was tan just like the craft from Star Wars.   I know the shape, because I had a model of the craft that I never finished.   Imagine my surprise to see this!

This day there were 2 ladies processing my return, which is unusual since normally it's a one-on-one transaction.  The three of us were standing next to the car and going through the routine process which includes questions like ""did you replace the fuel"" and so on. I always hear planes flying above that location, as the place is located at the foot of the runway.  This time, though, I heard a very strange sound that was somewhat similar to a jet but sounded ""broken"", as if it was digitally altered to sound like special FX for a movie. It was like a loud ""swoosh"" sound that appeared to go by in the sky above us.  The sound moved in the same direction as the planes normally do as they land, that is, westbound towards the ocean.  Instinctively, and immediately, I looked up and scanned the sky from my right to my left, following the sound, only to see a clear blue sky with absolutely nothing in my entire field of view, as far as I could see in all directions, except for the late afternoon Sun.  I have seen many planes fly above my head at that location before, and sometimes I look up and sometimes not.  This time, the unusual sound drove me to immediately look up because I was curious to see what kind of aircraft made that strange sound.  But with the sky being empty, in the end the only thing that caught my attention was the fact that one of the ladies processing my car return, who was standing in front of me and facing my direction, did the exact same head motion that I did, except she was going from her left to her right, so that we were both scanning the same section of the sky at the same time. At this point, the other lady said, ""That didn't sound like a plane, it sounded like water!"".  I understood what she meant - that it sounded sort of like a wave at the beach, or a cross between that and a jet plane flying by if you can imagine what that would sound like.  It was her interpretation of the sound, just as I gave my interpretation above. So this is not a report of a ""sighting"" per se, but I believe I heard a UFO instead of seeing one.  Right after the fact, I remember thinking to myself that the simultaneous head motion of the lady standing in front of me made me feel validated, and that there was no reason to question myself about whether I really heard a sound that appeared to come from an invisible source. For the record, I am an IT Consultant and I travel for work.  I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. Although I'm not adverse to being contacted about this event,  I believe I have provided all the information available.

Last July we had our biggest group see the light we had all seen it a few times to that point and had gotten made fun of for it.  My friends house is a few blocks from Kipling and Colfax, and this night they had a few other friends come over to celebrate the night. We went out for a smoke at around 11 pm, then one of my friends noticed the light was back. It is very very bright, brighter than a star probably on the same scale of takeoff lights from planes which we see coming from Denver International Airport all the time.  But there was no blinking lights to designate which side of the plane or helicopter was facing us.   It started at a 30 degree angle with the horizon and very slowly moved south, there is a utility pole out back so we used it for a point of reference if we stood still.  It got past the pole in about 40 minutes, then it sped up to a planes speed, then shot off to the distance.  We see these lights every few days, usually just one slow mover then reaches a point and takes off like a fighter jet.  I used to work near Buckley AFB outside everyday so I'm very used to seeing jets do maneuvers overhead and the sound they produce.  This orb of light hasn't made a sound ever.  But we have seen it make dips, loops, and sharp full speed turns.  We have watched it take 3 hours on the path down the horizon to the north judging location on tall trees then just gain speed and disappear on the horizon.  And one time it even got close enough you could feel warmth on a freezing night on a 2012 December night, it also appeared like there was something pulsing down an aura on it.  There were times when it would glow slightly red on the top of the bright white, then little red balls would move downward around the ball of light then combine at the bottom and disappear.  It still looked small but I had the feeling if I threw a rock 40-50 feet up I would of hit it.  We have no idea what it is and our phones and cameras won't register it.

One clear, rather bright (it was around summer time) night, my girlfriend and I witnessed something neither of us will likely ever forget.  It was a typical night for us; we had just gone out to dinner and returned to her house at around 9:00PM.  Getting out of my car, my girlfriend pointed out what she thought was a crop duster in the distance to me.  We stood in her driveway just staring at the thing for quite a while as it flew in our direction.  As it got a bit closer, we realized something rather important:  it wasn't making any sound, and crop dusters are fairly noisy machines (not to mention crop dusters do not typically operate at night).  As it slowly came closer, we continued hypothesising what in the world it could be.  At one point, I even said ""it looks like a helicopter flying sideways or something"", to which my girlfriend replied ""yeah, but I don't see any blades, and it isn't loud"".  She had a good point there, a helicopter would have been rather deafening, but it was still across the street quite a distance from us at that point, so I figured there was still a chance it would be louder when it got closer.  Eventually, the thing flew directly over our heads only roughly 100ft from the ground.  Despite being in such a close proximity to us, the craft made only a very low, very quiet humming sound and produced no wind-- it just sort of glided over us at a very constant, very slow speed.  Whatever this object was, it was perfectly rectangular in shape, very thin-looking in proportion to its width, and had two equidistant white lights (one on each side of the craft) which faced forward rather than downward almost like circular car headlights.  Sadly, the thought to take a picture or video of this thing did not even cross our minds until after it had disappeared behind her house.  I know this sounds crazy, but we honestly did not even think to get any form of evidence of this thing as it was in our sight (plus, it was at night, so any picture or video would probably have looked like a dark blur anyway). I am not claiming that this was uncountably an alien UFO, but whatever it was, we saw it.  We saw what we saw, and nothing can change that.  It was amazing, it was breathtaking, and for some reason we were completely unafraid. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I haven't stopped scrutinizing every brightly lit star in the night sky that wasn't sharply light or was too large and seemed to be within the atmosphere.  Most of my observations of the stars that seemingly appear large also carry with them atmospheric haze as though they appear to be within the earths' atmosphere leaving me to believe they are not stars.  The one star that I found questionable always appears in the same spot in the night sky. I got off work at 2pm December 19th (Thursday) and went Christmas shopping with my wife.  It had been hazy weather through the week but on thursday I noticed we had clear weather.  We had been out shopping for around 6 hours before we decided to head home.   Around 8:20 to 8:30 we pulled into driveway of the apartment complex facing west.  I would guess that somewhere between south and southwest is where I originally spotted one of my stars of interest.  That star decided it wanted to put on a show when we came down the driveway that night.  I noticed it was lower, closer (brighter), and was brilliantly lit with changing colors.   As soon I saw it I told my wife to slow down before we park so I could point it out to her.  As soon as we both observed the star(ufo) it began to slowly move to the left (Southwest).  I asked my wife to circle the driveway so I could see what it was going to do.  As soon as it stopped moving we began to inch forward and we stopped to noticed that it began moving again slowly to the left towards the tree line behind the apartments.  Again it stopped.   We inched forward again slowly only to stop again to notice it moving slowly again almost as if in response to us noticing them.

It was cold so I checked it out for about a minute.  They were in the south, which I thought strange.  They were very pretty as it was perfectly straight lines of every color shooting straight down, across the entire south eastern horizon.   After a while, I convinced my daughter to come see but she barely peeked because of the cold.  I noticed then that the lights were exactly the same.  Shouldn't northern lights have moved by now?  I watched for a bit, then noticed that almost to the north, after a big dark space, there was a much larger beam of blue light.   After a half hour or so of periodically checking, I decided to take pictures.  The intensity and color isn't there, but you can most definitely see some of the beams.   I told my husband that the lights were still there and hadn't changed so he checked them out again.  We decided then that it was certainly not northern lights.  We came in and when he checked a while later, they were all gone. Two days later, I told an acquaintance about them and she excitedly told me that she had a friend by Edmonton (300km north) posting about this on Facebook.  She also said that two friends of hers by Lethbridge (200km south) were also posting about these lights.  They were also certain it was not northern lights.  So what was it?  I am speculating something either very large (cloaked behind the mysterious clouds on an otherwise clear night), or it was many, many something's.  To be seen so clearly over 500km, it had to be from space.  Also, I could see that the beams did not touch ground; they came from above.

The thing that caught our attention most was a dull blue light emitting from the craft suddenly intensify to a very bright blue light as it climbed as accelerated Southward on a heading completely opposite of our heading as we travelled North.  The craft travelled a distance of what I can best guesstimate as 20 miles in about 30 seconds, then slow to nearly an approach-speed which airliners hold as they enter a final approach into a major airport. As this craft came into our 9 O'Clock position we looked closely for any strobe lights and marker lights which are required under FAA regulations, and to our suspicions their were none, the only light we noticed different from the blue light, which was visible from all the angles we were able to observe, was a faint white light at the aft end of the craft which was an uninterrupted light (not a strobe like we see on conventional aircraft). As the craft passed us we noticed a change in heading, it made a turn to West by South West, but there was no swoop to this heading change, it appeared as if there was some form of thrust vectoring involved, because the turn of nearly 75 degrees was almost instantaneous.  The object was visible for another 15 seconds and appeared to accelerating as it began to cross the Great Salt Lake, but we lost sight of it due to a complex series of overpasses at the Legacy Parkway ~ S.R. 89 ~ I-15 Junction of Farmington, UT.  When we were finally clear of the interchanges we all tried to regain our view of the object but it was gone.  The estimated distances we witnessed this craft cover are, to my best abilities at finding a number, exceed 50 miles, and this observation lasted approximately a single minute. Though it was very cold outside the car I had the foresight to attempt to get an auditory account as well (mostly because I was very interested in finding out whether it was a jet propulsion system or something else) so we rolled the windows down to listen for anything we could possibly hear.  We live near Hill AFB, Salt Lake International Airport, and Ogden-Hinckley Municipal Airport, and as a result we are very used to hearing and seeing a vast number of different aircraft. This craft had no sound which we could hear, given we were traveling at 50 to 55 m.p.h. and there was some wind noise, but we know that if the craft had a jet turbine system such as an F-16 Falcon or an F-22 Raptor we would have heard the engine(s) and definitely seen the afterburner(s) because this craft was well over mach at it's fastest observed velocity.  Also, there no sonic boom, there was no disruption to the atmosphere - at all. The origination of our sighting placed the object at the same latitude as Hill AFB, however, it was roughly 5 miles West of the base.  Also of note is that Salt Lake International was using runways 34 L and R and also 35, which would place all approach aircraft in this same line of travel, but this object was not in the pattern, (the elevations were far too low at the beginning, and far too high at the end of the sighting.)  There was no possibility of having been in the Salt Lake approach pattern due to its turn to traverse the lake. I also must emphasize heavily that the object had some seriously advanced vectoring technology to its propulsion, from the initial 2,500 foot climb and then the turn it made to the West toward the lake, both maneuvers were made with surgical precisions and were as fast as a Color Guard Marine snapping a salute to the Ensign.",2014-01-10T00:00:00,,

I initially thought it might be a tower light on a hill, but it wasn't blinking, and as we got closer it became apparent that there were no hills; a large, radiant orb hovered high above the freeway against a clear and starry sky.

For the next three minutes, as caught on video, we watched it from the side of I-5, facing northeast, where it silently floated around Jupiter to the left of the Orion constellation, putting on quite a show.  Our limited iPhone cameras did a poor job capturing what we actually witnessed, missing the star-filled backdrop, the nearby farm house, trees, and horizon, and not really capturing how pretty and bright it was, which was significantly brighter than Jupiter and maintained a steady luminosity throughout the duration of the sighting, apart from its slow color changes (mostly blue, violet, and green, with a bit of red and yellow appearing briefly as it shifted colors).  It also seemed to emit two very faint searchlights pointing downward a couple of times, though I couldn't be certain.   After a couple of minutes, it floated down toward the earth and drifted slowly toward the southeast behind some trees, perhaps disappearing into the nearby river valley, or perhaps simply disa! ppearing. I took some still photos, included at the end of the video, though they all look different, suggesting either the limitations of the iPhone 4S camera (such as one photo that looks like blurred movement) or that the object was changing shape as it moved. This is my third UFO sighting since 1995, and my first nighttime sighting. I don't know if it was manmade or not, though I suspect most UFOs are.

When I was 14, I lived in a tiny town in utah and had not heard of ufo's, although this was not my only experience in that town.  We lived in the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains.  The cemetery was a high hill in the center of town (still is), and all of us kids liked to meet up (in summer) after the parents were asleep, on this hill to tell scary stories.  We slept out in our sleeping bags in various friends yards, all summer...then would head up to the cemetery when the coast was clear.   It was always various numbers of us, never the same.  This particular night, about 5 or so of us..can't remember exactly who all was there anymore, were telling stories when one of the kids, pointed to the mountains and said, ""what is that""…  We looked, it was against the mountains to the east, large, metallic, and saucer shaped, with colored lights flashing off and on in a circular direction.   At first we were afraid and stood up to head for home.  One of the boys said, ""They already know we are here, so no point in running.""  We sat back down and continued with our stories.  We were not afraid any more, but still occasionally monitored it.  Eventually, after about 45 minutes or so, someone noticed it was gone.   We finished our stories and went home.  I don't remember any of us ever talking about it again.  When I look back on it now...I wonder at how we were so nonchalant about it...and how it was that one of us said...""they know we are here...""   Our ages at that time were about 14 to 16.  I was 14 at that time and moved away with my family when I was 16...never saw those kids again.   I have seen other ufos and other phenomenon in other places over the years.

We heard a loud noise and saw a thing in the shape of today's stealth jet.  It was silver, with black windows.  It was the size of a medium size car and was able to maneuver in a small area as we were in an area with lots of trees and another small house near by.   It came low, close to my little sister and hovered.  I was on the steps of the front porch and she was in the yard collecting acorns.  I thought it might take her.  Neither of us moved.  We felt no wind or any thing.  I don't remember it being too loud at that time.  It stopped for a time then whooshed away in same direction it came from.   We ran in and told every body about it.  They paid no attention.  We went across the street and talked to a neighbor lady.  She said she heard a noise but may have just said that to make us feel better.  If the two of us had not seen and remembered it, I would think I dreamed it.   We remember it pretty much the same.  My sister was frightened to be alone for a long time.  It was before TV and I only knew it kind of resembled my cousins toy jet.  I had never really seen a jet or even an airplane at the time..

I happened to look up and saw a disk like shape with big multi colored (red, green, yellow) lights moving around its outer edge.  It was just quietly floating over the trees that bordered our back yard.  So it was low to the ground and big.  Its position was still and in a slight angle, left side down, right side up.  It seemed as I stood staring at it…it was staring at me.  I wasn’t frightened.  It was interesting.  Then it just moved on.  That evening I told my father what I had seen. I think of this occurrence from time to time and mentioned it to my father not to long ago.  I was surprised that he remembered.  He said he had been impressed by my “serious earnest” as I described this sighting.  He knew I believed what I saw. I’m an “Army Brat”; my father is now a retired Col.

I can only guess at its height but, 5,000 feet perhaps, I see it and from indoors, I use my Cannon Powershot 2500A Camera and try to make a video but, in the LED screen, can see nothing through the dirty windows, so I go outside, but cannot see it in the screen (I was so excited to have it coming overhead and a camera this time (I think in my excitement, I had zoomed all the way in while inside and couldn't see the craft in the small area I had zoomed in on, although this video does show something in a few frames, an expert should review).    So out of frustration, I stop the video, as soon as it saved the recording, I change to still photographs... Then looking up again, I notice the craft doing something odd, nearly overhead now, it's dropping little ""stars"" every one half mile to every mile, is the only way I can describe this activity.  These little lights, drop away from the craft, and move in their own way, off away from ithe main craft, then seemed to vanish or go dark.  Some go south, some east, some west, some even rise up equal to the main craft, before falling off their own direction (thus they were not just dropping but under control). The little ""stars"", I do manage to catch some of these in 4 pictures..,  Although it is not much to see, just little white specks of light... but, upon zooming in on the photograph with the camera, these look like little white boomerangs, some kind of craft, or probes, or drones, is my guess.. The main ship had the same two red constant lights on either side, white flashing light below but, though it was a disk with the curved front, maybe because it was so dark I couldn't make out the same curve to the rear, yet, for a moment almost directly overhead, it seemed to me, to be indented to the back?  Like it had the backside open or retracted, and this, is where, these little stars, or boomerangs, were being launched from or departing from, Not sure, like I said, it was hard to see in the dark and that altitude. The craft continued its normal flight path to the east, dropping these little ""things"" as it went in a regular pattern, it was visible from the time I first saw it fir perhaps 2 minutes. I don't know what these little boomerang things are but, if I had to guess, I would say that they are little drones of some kind because, on New Years Eve around 11:15pm.  I was opening the door to look out through my storm door because every so often I hear jets and this craft at altitude sometimes sounds like a jet until, it gets close, where it is far louder.  During hearing one if these, I opened my storm door and for a split second, I swear, I saw, a boomerang shaped lightly colored object (not lighted, it was only illuminated by our dim yard lighting) some 3-4 feet across, and perhaps 8-12 inches front to back, and 1 inch or so in thickness, about 25 feet from my apartment, right in front of the apartment building across from mine but, as soon as I got the interior door open to see out, I spotted this thing and it went zipping silently up and over the roof of the building next door and out of sight, I only saw this thing, for really, maybe,, 1.5 to 2 seconds at mo! st.  Clearly, it did not want, to be seen, I am certain of that... They are watching me, I think.  I hope, that this, is a, good thing. because if not, I am in deep trouble.

So it's tradition for our household to make it a point to go see a movie on Christmas day. The last few years we've been getting to the latter showings but we got to a show mid afternoon this year.  By the time our film was over it was dusk and by the time we got home it was dark.  My street is caddy-wampus, so the front faces north and east.  And if you look polar north, neighboring trees block the horizontal view.   Well as soon we backed into our driveway, we all took notice to a strange grouping of orbs all glowing orange traveling in the night sky.

I filmed it with my older Samsung camcorder, which has an 8mm cassette tape.  I have a 2 minute and 40 second recording which I don’t know how to copy, convert or forward to anybody.  It is a shaky video, but is a very clear image showing what seemed to be a ball of fire transforming, reshaping and at times, exploding into a very large entity, then imploding, only to shape-shift again. It was quite a distance away from us.  At times it looked round like a planet, until it exploded into multiple parts and shapes and got very large.  It was white in the center, with some noticeable green and was a pink or purple color around the edges.  It was not metallic, or dome shaped or triangle shaped.  It appeared to be organic in matter. We actually watched it for about 20 minutes.  At times it went behind clouds and was not visible to us.  It was traveling from the SE to the NW at a slower rate of speed.  It was not “streaking” across the sky.  (I researched some videos of the ISS, which seems to travel NE in an upward direction.  This traveled NW, going downward).",2014-01-10T00:00:00,46.0939,-87.216

I was in West Palm Beach, at the Hilton on Singer Island, for a very important job interview, the next morning.  Myself and three others were interviewed to be the executive team to start a hotel chain for the King of Saudi Arabia. I was alone that night as my room partner had his own evening plans.  He was also one of the interviewees. I went down the beach about 1/2 mile to a restaurant and had a beer at the bar. I only finished half of it because I didn’t want any chance of effects the next morning.  I walked back down the  beach to the hotel, which was right on the beach.  Our room opened to the beach.  I sat in the sand to think and gather thoughts about the interview.  I was staring at the ocean when I saw what looked like one of those search lights that you see crossing the sky, shining out from the horizon.  I thought there must be a ship with a light out beyond the horizon.  But then the beam of light broke off from the horizon and traveled toward me and land.  It was now a beam of light flying along by itself.  I watched it approach and as it did the beam resolved into disks, as it got closer.  I presumed the light was from the crafts reflecting the suns light from around the globe. As they approached I was able to see about 40 to 50 disks flying in a group sort of formation.  As they approached land the formation changed to two lines with ships within the lines, and turned south.  There was about eight large ships and the rest smaller...about 1/4 the size of the larger.  I could see the stars through the formation.  These crafts appeared to be in space, not in our atmosphere. As they flew overhead I saw one of the smaller disks fly to or into one of the bigger ships.  When the formation reached over land they turned south as if to follow the beach south.  They continued south and as they did, they changed back into the wider pack formation. Their resolution faded back into a glowing beam and they disappeared south. Right about the time they were passing overhead my room mate got back.  I could hear him and so I shouted for him to come quickly.  He did but not in time to see any more than the beam of light traveling south. This was a crystal clear, warm night.  What I saw was clear as could be and there was no mistaking what I was looking at.  My demeanor was calm, sober and totally clear headed. What I saw changed my life.  I’ve never had any doubt as to what I saw and the memory hasn’t faded.  I reported it to a group who’s name was an anagram from Ohio.  Teroco?  Or something like that.  I also did a report on the Sci-Fi Channel website, around that time. I’d love to hear from someone about the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

When I was a teenager, my parents and I were heading to the symphony when we saw an extremely large black rectangle or triangle ufo outside our house. The symphony started at 8pm.  My dad never wanted to be late so we left a little after 7pm to make sure we made it there in plenty of time.  Our house is on a small hill near the end of our block.  It was twilight to dark.  As we left the house and started walking down the front steps down to our car – we saw this black object floating just barely above the tree tops. It was enormous and hardly moving.  It spanned from one end of our block to the other end.  I don’t know how long our block is but the object was more than the length of our block and there are 6 three story colonial houses between our house and the end of the block and the object was long enough to cover them all.  It was wide covering houses on both sides of the street.  The object was also tall or thick (maybe one story or more thick) and not aerodynamic at all.  There is no way that should be flying.  It was so large that we could never see the far side of it.  We really only could ever see 2 sides of it so it could be a rectangle or a triangle. We walked down the steps and into the middle of our street and stood directly underneath it.  It was very close nearly touching the tree tops (large oak trees in our neighborhood).  It was a matte black and blocked out the sky from our view because it was so massive.  It had lights on the underside -some large, some small, but the lights were dull and not bright.  I can’t remember where the lights were but know some were different colors.  The side of the object had a window like opening which had dim lights. With an object flying so close, it should have been loud but this object didn’t make a sound but you could sort of feel it in your chest.  Even blimps make sounds but this object just didn’t make a sound. We stood directly underneath it for several minutes looking up and then it slowly drifted up the side street next to our house.  It went from moving straight ahead to moving at a 90 degree angle without turning.  We kept walking with it up the side street while it was directly overhead.  It was gliding so slowly that it was easy to keep walking with it. We could have kept walking with it but my dad said that he didn’t want to be late for the concert and we had to go.  In the end, we watched the object for about 15 minutes.  I didn’t want to go but we did.  When we got into the car, I asked my dad what it was and he said that he didn’t know and didn’t want us to talk about it ever again.  I tried to bring it up several times and he made it clear that we were to never discuss it.   Years went by without talking about it– when my dad was dying I asked him about it and he couldn’t remember it happened.  I thought maybe it was all in my mind so a few years after my dad died I asked my mom if she remembered and she did.  This made me both relieved and uneasy.  We’ve talked about it several times since then.  My father was a physician, my mother is a nurse.  I am a medical researcher. While I wasn’t afraid while we were watching the object (it was oddly peaceful), those moments seeing it have haunted me almost every day since.  I’ve been uneasy sleeping at my house since that initial night and have had to sleep with a light on only when I’m there.  Every time I felt the slightest low hum, I rushed to my bedroom window to see if it is there. I’ve since moved away but my mom still lives there.  I moved to a very large city and oddly I sleep better in this large city than at my childhood home. I can be contacted by an investigator if needed.

The ranch was a large ranch, almost 1000 acres, and was out in the middle of nowhere in eastern Central California, Fresno being the closest large town (city) about 35 minutes north.  My UFO story begins one night during harvest that lasted three days.  (Wine grapes are harvested at night when the fruit’s sugar is at its highest.)   My experience started one night about 2am while I was out watering down the roads driving a large tractor and that pulled a large water tanker that sprayed water onto the roads to keep the dust down during harvest.  I was at the eastern most edge of the ranch listening to my Sony Walkman (I think I was listening to Boys to Men…), when I noticed a red light out in the field to the east of me, looking out towards the Sierra Mountains.  This red light did not look too far away, probably out about a half a mile.   I was driving south and was watching the red light thinking it was helicopter and pondering how strange it was that it was out in the field.  Then I noticed the red light was coming closer to me and I began to get nervous.  Never for a moment did I believe this was an alien craft, but rather a helicopter piloted by humans that were about to fly over me, and even harass me out in no-mans-land.  The red light got closer and closer, and suddenly when it was about 100 yards out, the red light turned into a bright white light, shining in my direction.   I was then positive these people in this helicopter meant no good and wanted to harass or even harm me, so I put the tractor in high gear and took off back to the office that was nearly two miles away.  I got back to the office and began to recall what occurred and it was then that I began to realize or ponder if what I saw was actually a UFO.  I never saw the helicopter, nor did I hear it, all I saw was the red light coming towards me that suddenly turned white which gave me a very formidable feeling.  Absolutely creeped out I didn’t go back out to the vineyards that night! and fel l asleep in the office. 	The next day I didn’t think too much about what happened and went back to work that night watering down the roads as I had the night before.  I remember staying out of the eastern most portions of the ranch and staying close to the harvesters where all the workers and machines were hard at work.  It was then that I had the most bizarre experience of my life.  I was watering down one of the main roads where the gondolas dumped the grapes into the bins of the big rigs to be taken to the winery.   There were four harvesters that night; one would start down a row followed by the second, third, and finally the fourth.  As the fourth harvester went into the vineyard, I was approaching from about 50 yards away.  All the bright lights of the machinery and tractors lit up the area and there I saw hovering over the harvest about 40 feet in the air and 100 feet from me a dark gray circular spacecraft about the size of a large SUV.  It appeared to wobble in the air and it was shaped like two bowls glued together with a short cylindrical top.  I could see rivets and round nodules protruding here and there, something you would relate to sensors.  I could see no windows, just dark gray metal and its alien characteristics.   Terrified, I began to get my tractor closer to the workers wanting to point out what I was witnessing, but something inside of me made me pull away from them, fearing they would panic by seeing the hovering craft.   Remembering that moment I don’t think I have ever been that genuinely scared before or since.  Again, I raced back to the office and played sick so I didn’t have to return to work. 	The third day, still pretty frazzled from the previous night I was out and about the ranch on one of the ATVs, feeling rather safe from the daylight I was looking about the sky, and there high in the sky above the riverbed that ran along the vineyards was the craft.  I was far enough away where it didn’t frighten me so I stared for a moment when almost instantly flew off into the distance disappearing from sight. 	There you have it, my UFO story.  To this day, 20 years later, that memory still boggles my mind.  Did I actually see a UFO?  Did I see a spacecraft piloted by or operated by intelligent beings from another planet?  What exactly did I see?  Did that really happen?  I suppose I will never really know.   I’ve told my story to people throughout the years and I’m pretty sure they look at me like I’m insane.  Once I told my social psychology professor about my experience and he said I was in a wakeful dream state and it was all a dream or hallucination.  I know what I saw really happened, I know what I saw was real, but it is still hard to grasp what seeing such a thing really means.  If what I saw was real over that three day period, then that means the reality in which we live in is very different than the reality that our society has been brought to believe.  All of which is fascinating. 	Thank you for reading my about my experience! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2014-03-18T00:00:00,37.0771,-120.2738

I was driving back from Memphis.  It was erly in the morning I was tired.  I accidentally crouched north insted of going 40 west.  I took the first exit I could and decided to take that highway.  I'm driving ten minutes and I pass a house on my right in a valley it was lit like daylight.   I stopped because I'm woundering why.  I back up looked down the drive way it just was bright. In the middle of the night?  No I got to check this out.  So I got out and closed my door softly I didn't want to wake my girlfriend who was sound asleep.  I walked around the back of the car witch is sitting in the middle of the road.  I stoped listened crickets were chirping the tree frogs were crying for rain lighting bugs were lighting nothing was out place except for the two story waltons looking house lit up brighter than day!   So down the drive way I start slowly I get maybe ten yards and stop I don't know why.  I crouched down and then I saw what was bothering me.  It wasn't that the house was lit up brighter than daylight it was lit up inside and out bright inside and out.  WHAT how in gods name?  Then I crept a couple of feet and saw what haunts me to this day.  I saw a light round soft light then I started looking for the out line of what was holding the light.  It was a triangle shaped hole in the starsand it was big the light was the size of the house.  I was close anuff to toss a rock and hit it.  To say the least I was in aw.  To say the most I was in heaven because I'm a skeptic if I don't see it I don't beleave it and here it was something I can't explain.  let me qualify my next statement I am ex-military I worked on helicopters 68 be 10 was the job.  This craft was stable had no hum wine or rumble silent.  Im takeing this all in I'm seeing a large craft not man made wow!   My girlfriend woke up and started yelling for me I told her to come to me.  She got out car grumpy and started to where I was kneeling.   When she got to me started to speak and I just pointed to the light.  I must admit that was stupid because she started screaming when she saw the light we got run!  I asked her how they flew that thing here though space and a long way how did she think we could out run it in a car?  That made her stop and think she was scared unbelievably I wasn't.   I said lets look a few more seconds just then it got crazier a woman floated out of the light and in thought a coosed window.  I told my girlfriend ok I'm done get in the car this to much.  And we got back in the car and left.,2014-03-18T00:00:00,,

I saw the first one when I was pregnant with my four year old daughter, needless to say my life has never been the same.  I have always had the sightings in brood daylight, they are very shiny and big, the closest one is when my sister saw it with me.  We were driving down a little road in Spotsylvania, she was driving, I was in the passenger seat.  I looked out of my window I saw one way up, almost to be following us, I said look, she tried but she couldn't see it, it vanished, then on her side it was back she saw it this time, but then just as fast aa it had appeared it vanished.  Then we were coming to the end of the road where we could either go left of right, we stopped at the stop sign, and right in front of us, just above the trees, not more than 50 feet in the air, was the object, just hovering, so bright, we could barely look at it.  It stayed there for atleast two minutes, we got out of the car and just stared at it.  Then it went straight down, then straight up, and vanished right in front of us..  If there is someone out there that really wants to know what is going on, then ask me, test me, do whatever you have to.  I never believed in any of this until it kept happening to me.  Now I believe with all of my being.  I believe that they somehow foolow me, taunt me, know one else sees them, why?  Spotsylvania is hot bed of activity.  I want someone to investigate me, prove me to be a liar.  It is very hard for me to go against everyone else when they say that it is not real, because I see them, and they are very real.  Ask my sister.  If somebody out there can help me, please do.  I am a single mother, I have no money for a good camera, or video camera, but I tell you even if I had the pictures of what I have seen, who would believe me.  I see what the people have seen above Mexico, in the multiple sightings, but no one believes those pictures are real.",2014-03-18T00:00:00,38.19920215053764,-77.63315268817205

I was taking some shopping bags out of my car trunk at the apartment complex where I live (near the University of Arkansas campus) when I noticed moving lights at the edge of my vision.  I was closing the trunk lid when I sighted the group of 3 orange/yellow lights/orbs moving overhead from my right to my left.  The orbs displayed a bright nucleus of light surrounded by a softer glowing aura of a paler shade.  The orbs were arrayed in a loose single file pattern moving overhead from the south toward the north at an altitude one generally see's a single engine prop plane fly at.  If one held a pencil eraser at arm's length and noted it's perceived diameter the orbs would have been of a like diameter.  The light emitted by each orb was consistent and didn't flicker and was surrounded by a translucent aura as mentioned previously.  There was no noticeable sound coming from the orbs and the night sky was mostly clear with only a few diffuse clouds overhead.  The orbs were moving along at a brisk and steady pace.  When the orbs finally passed by me I could see that each had what appeared to be a pair of “afterburner” like lights/emissions trailing behind them as they moved toward the northern horizon.  The 3 orbs finally disappeared from my view.  Then I again looked  toward the southern sky and was surprised to see a group of 5 more orange/yellow orbs coming towards my position headed along a similar flight path.  4 of the orbs were grouped in a broad non-linear cluster but the 5th orb was much higher in altitude periodically obscured by some wispy clouds underneath it.  As the group of 5 orbs passed by me they too displayed what appeared to be rear mounted jet-like afterburners in their wake.   All 5 orbs disappeared shortly into the northern sky.  This group of orbs made no sounds as they passed into the distance.    As a side note I was fortunate to attend a lecture by Dr. J. Allen Hynek (Project Bluebook) in the early 70's and e! ven spoke to him briefly.  I found his presentation both fasci! nating a nd thought provoking.  I'm cautiously skeptical regarding unidentified lights and this is my first time seeing an odd aerial display of this nature.   I've witnessed a couple of Chinese lantern launches in person and these lighted orbs were unlike the lanterns I saw on those occasions.   These orbs were quite a sight to behold.,2014-01-10T00:00:00,36.04787185185185,-94.04453777777778

We instantly we shocked as they were not commercial aircraft and flew in a coordinated manner and shifted to a rectangle, and then an oval.  If I had to guess they were 500 meters in diameter.  It seemed like there was a shape or form within the lights but it was impossible to tell for sure.  They traveled south of the city and at about where Boeing Field is they ascended vertically through the low cloud layer and vanished.  During the ascent we saw a commercial airliner fly under the lights.  We observed them for about 3 minutes, and during this our neighbors, also returning from a dinner, pulled up and saw the same (their oldest child was terrified, as was mine). During this a 5th orange light appeared from the same area and followed an identical flight pattern and vanished.  Attached is video I took for about 30 seconds when my wife told me to grab my phone.  I was excited and should have spent more time taping.  During the episode the entire sky appeared to briefly flash white, which is on video.  About 10 minutes afterwards I was still watching the sky and believe I saw a fighter jet fly over the city.  A work colleague I told the story to says they heard a fighter jet fly over their Bellevue home.  My neighbor who also witnessed the event says he was traveling north from the Federal Way area and had seen a number of military helicopters flying in the area.

In December of 2007 I had a newspaper delivery route that I did every night in my car for several years.  One night, around 4:30 am, I was doing my normal delivery route when I drove around a corner that approached a cul-de-sac.  Just as I turned the corner and was facing the cul-de-sac head on, I saw 4 wide blue beams of light that looked like they were coming from the sky to the ground, spanning the distance behind 2 of the homes at the end of the turn-around for the cul-de-sac.  I slammed on the breaks to stop and look at it because I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.  A few seconds after I stopped the lights disappeared as if someone flicked a light switch. All 4 beams were cut off at the top at an even level, so I have to assume they were actually coming from the sky to the ground.  I couldn’t see anything in the sky above the beams, there was no noise, and none of the homes had any lights on anywhere.  Behind the homes was a wooded area with no other homes built up behind them.  I can’t explain what I saw, and I have no other witnesses to it other than my Pit Bull that I took with me on my route, and she’s not talking.  I’ve never told anyone about it because I know how people react when you tell them about strange stuff like this, so I kept my mouth shut all these years, but it has been driving me crazy to this day wondering what I saw.  I had that route for 2 years and have never seen it again, but it always used to creep me out having to deliver to those houses after that. I’ve never heard of anyone reporting a sight like that yet.  I’ve heard of maybe one beam of light, but not 4 all at the same time, the same width and height, and all instantly shutting off at once.  But the beams were a very bright blue and almost looked solid.  You couldn’t see through them.  Even the trees in the background couldn’t be seen.  The beams had a slight V-shape to them, with the widest point at the top.  They didn’t disappear into the sky, but seemed to have a source about 20 ft. above the homes, all leveled off at the same height, but I couldn’t see anything above the homes that would have been shining down or a light source.  It was just black night sky.  It all happened so fast that it felt like when I came around that corner and stopped and how everything suddenly shut off so fast, that it was something that wasn’t supposed to have been witnessed.

It was only maybe 2 or 3 yards away from me and 100 feet high so I could see it plain as day. I got out of my seat and walked as close as I could to it and I watch it slowly move north over top of some houses and then it just vanished.  I witnessed it for approximately 1/2 minute before it vanished.  It was not a plane, nor a fighter jet as it had no wings.   The ship was shaped as a triangle and I could see indents and/or grooves on the ship.  It was like a metallic black.  It was huge.  It was the size of a baseball field.  It made no sound and it had no lights.",2014-03-18T00:00:00,49.50352448979591,-115.76461224489796

I am sorry that I just found your website. I stumbled across your site after a simple Google Search of:  ""5 Triangular Shapes in the Sky"". I have been alarmed about what I saw flying over my house a few years ago. I am a U.S. Navy Veteran, thus I KNOW high speed aircraft and, what I saw were NO Aircraft!  I was outside in my driveway in roughly 2011 (forgive me as it has been a couple of years so I do not exactly remember the year, since I didn't lend much credence to it at the time), but, I happened to look up in the sky and saw 3 different 6-triangle shaped lights moving VERY FAST across the sky.  There were NO Red & Green lights that would indicate any aircraft.  I live near an airport so I am used to seeing airplanes flying either overhead or very near my sightline.  These were simply white lights.  These lights were moving so fast that I literally didn't have enough time to grab my cell phone to record them moving.  There are NO aircraft that move THAT FAST! ,  Plus, I have seen the pictures of the SAME lights that I saw, but, what I saw, there was a group of 2 sets of those lights that over-lapped each other.  Meaning, and looking up and moving West to East, and number the lights from front to back, and left to right, 1 first row, 2-3 second row, 4-5-6 third row, when you see the first set of 6 lights, the second 6-set of lights were in synch, but,  the 2nd row of lights (light #2) overlapped the original 3rd set of lights at light number 6.  Then the last set of 6 lights followed behind. Again, these lights were moving way to fast to be ANY aircraft!  I have been trying to find something like I saw and your website has EXACTLY what I saw, but not in the cluster that I saw flying over my house. I wanted to try to find out if there was a ""fighter squadron"" flying overhead at that time but, there would be NO reason why a ""fighter squadron"" would be flying over this location at that time of night, and flying faster than the speed of sound, which is the ONLY way ANY objects could be flying that fast. Plus I had no idea HOW to investigate this. Thus, I just keep this to myself until I saw the images on your website. I hope that someone has an explanation to what I saw.

I then looked above the church and saw what looked to be about 50 to 100 feet in the air, three golden lights in a triangle formation hovering and rotating counter clockwise.  After a few seconds of witnessing this strange phenomenon, I saw grey spheres begin to form around the lights, and I started to fade in vision and found myself looking at the floor of the car.  The driver and passenger assumed it would be a good idea to instead of stopping the car to drive to the nearest exit and get on the opposite side of the highway to get a closer look.  By the time we came to the other side of the highway, the lights were gone.  All three of us got out of the car and tried to collect ourselves.  I looked to the parking lot and I saw an SUV pull into the parking lot of the church with the light! s off, and what looked like a husband and wife get out.   The husband had a video camera but the lights were gone.   Also, on the highway there was a man who seemed baffled at the incident as much as we did.  There were no other cars on the highway.

I was standing north of the corner of Scandia Street and Stanford Ave. (exact address omitted).  I was looking southwest.  There was a bright orangish red light almost hovering; but moving slowly toward me.  At an arm's length, maybe 2 to 4 fingers above the house/garage roof across and one house south of me.   After watching it 30 seconds or so, two slightly bluish white teardrop spheres of light fell from the orangish red light straight down.  They seemed to be going faster than if they were just falling.  Shot down followed almost immediately by the second one.  They were not beams of light; but lighted objects or spheres of light much longer than wide.  These bluish white lights were a color I can not describe accurately; but laser-like would be the closest description.  Not only laser-like, but even more vibrant than laser-like.  This light seemed like it had depth or maybe partially transparent; but brilliant.  I have never seen anything like them.  They were not round orbs, teardrop or at least much longer than they were wide in shape.  Again, they did not seem the fall; but were propelled downward.  They were not lite all the way down, but winked out before they went below the roof top southwest of me.   Anyway, I was excited, to say the least.  The orangish red light then turned in a quick motion and was heading almost away from me, slowly.  It started to fade first, and then pulsed on and off and then was gone.  It didn't seem to dart away fast; but seemed to wink out.  This was now about 1 minute from when I first saw it.  Then 4 minutes later, the orangish red light appeared again.  This time it was slightly further away but moving quickly towards me again.  When it got to about the same place the bluish white lights had ejected from it; it even got a little brighter.  It again, arced! away, or turned 180 degrees and quickly went away, or faded out as it moved away.  I was never scared.  I keep thinking about those bluish white lights.  They are kind of engrained in my memory.  They were such a unique shape and brilliance.  In terms of distance away, I am not sure how to judge distance.  A mile or two?   Anyway, not a few blocks away.  I first filled out a form for MUFON on Christmas Day.  A couple of days later I was contacted by an Investigator who seemed to think these were Chinese Lanterns.  Well, I live about a mile from the beach in San Diego.   A couple of months ago I almost had a Chinese Lantern land in my yard.  So, I have seen Chinese Lanterns.   My sighting on the 24th was not a Chinese Lantern in my opinion and for a few reasons.  Number one, the orangish red light went out for about 4 minutes.  If this was a Chinese Lantern, it would have dropped quickly to the ground in that period of time.   But instead, the orangish red light came back on at the same ! elevation after the 4 minutes.  It wasn't a second Lantern as I would have seen it also.   Secondly, the orangish red light did not move like it was adrift.   And thirdly, the bluish white lights that dropped or were propelled from it.....well, that was interesting.   I said earlier that I am not sure of the distance this sighting was from my vantage point.  I have learned since my first report that the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Storage Facility is 1.5 to 2 miles southwest of my vantage point.   Just thought I would mention that.  Sure wish others had also seen this event.",2014-01-10T00:00:00,33.775680842911875,-117.95888314176244

It was very late and my husband and I were in bed (as were all the kids) ...we lived in liberty at the time in the middle of the woods (and old campground and we turned the main lodge into a house.)  We were woken up by a bright light shining on the side of the house our bedroom was on and coming through our window it lit up most of the room. My husband is ex military and is not only trained himself but has trained his dog very well and that dog obeys him no matter what they are going to do (hunting etc.)  So he throws some gear on and tries to go outside to see who is shining a light on our house but the dog refuses to leave the laundry room to the point where my husband was trying to pull him out by his collar and he wouldn't go with straight fear in his eyes.  My husband decided to come back in, lock back up and get the phone ready for the police.  He shined his flashlight out the window back at the light hoping if it was some punk kids with a spotlight they would realize were not some abandoned lodge they can party at and there were people living in our house but the light didn't budge. At this point we realized the light was coming from somewhere in the trees (about halfway up a full grown pine tree) and we were a little nervous because this area is so heavily wooded there's no way it could be some punk halfway up a tree with a spotlight powerful enough to light up the whole side of our house that bright.  We watching this light for almost 2 hours still debating calling the police but not wanting to sound insane if the light was gone when they got there then it just started turning....stayed right where it was but the light turned 180 degrees (still in the middle of the trees) and ""drove"" straight through them just like it was a car on a road and there was not 100 trees blocking its way....we watched until everything was dark again.  We didn't end up sleeping that night and the next day went out and looked for any sign of anything but came up blank...everyone we told thought we were crazy so we stopped talking about it but I feel the need to share!

There was no sound relating to the objects or their movement. The two lights were following the same path and were in single file, about 12” apart in sky. After 3 minutes the first light completely disappeared. About a minute later the second orb did the same thing. After another minute or two what we thought was the first light reemerged distantly “down” the sky and to the NE, where it stayed and “twinkled” from light orange to white to orange.

Other friends saw the same thing and we would love others to comment on what was in the sky?!???  First off - ((name deleted)) we love love you!!!  Please watch this video. Santa in the sky or something very strange!!  My daughter and I were coming home from my parents after we missed going to church - which is very strange for our family on Christmas.  We were driving almost a block from out house and we saw this bright light low in the sky.  It was glowing kind of like it was on fire and then started blinking red light. It went up in the sky with no sound at all.  Right after that 3 more followed and then those 3 got into a triangle formation.  They all went up into the sky as fast as a b-1, but without any noise.  We of course were freeking out!!  I had already pulled the car to the side of the road and parked and videoed the first couple.  Then they went up into the sky and disappeared!!! Just like that. We were dumbfounded.  Another guy came and watched and police cars and we all were videoing it.  Then the same thing happened again with 3 more then 3 more and then 2 more.  They all had this really bright light and then red blinking and then in less than a couple of seconds went across the entire sky and disappeared completely!!!  My friend who lives up the hill from me saw the same thing.  We are all totally freaked out and so excited!!!  My daughter, 14, Skye thinks for sure it was Santa - I don't know I say aliens??? Who knows but really this is just so cool!!! Christmas Eve in rapid city sd - so bazaar!!! I just had to show you - because our news around here does not cover any news and certainly will not cover anything that isn't explainable. Hope you check it out.

After more research, I have now ELIMINATED the thought of one of these 4 filmed objects in the sky of possibly being a recent sighting of a red meteor shower because they move downward and these had no tails, these objects were going sideways from west to east.  I ELIMINATED the thought of one of these possibly being an orange chinese lantern because if they are carried by the wind, the winds were going SW that day and at the time recorded, and these objects were moving SE.

On bicycle. Location:  just outside of Charleston AFB, housing dev.  Called Hunly Park (all gone now).  State road (think SR 626) was edge of houses, then pine forest,  Then AFB.  Never allowed into that forest, was scared, could hear shooting of hunters, etc.   This happened either in the spring, or the late summer after the heat, was very temperate climate.  At dusk.  Sky to east was indigo blue, sky to west was tangerine orange.  NO CLOUDS.  And no stars yet.  Maybe one or two, but no stars for the most part.  Wasn’t that dark yet.  For some reason, 50 yrs ago everyone came home at same time, went in to dinner same time, did homework, took bath, went to bed same time.  I was OUT when everyone else was “in”, so totally alone.  No cars in the development, don’t remember any cars on the state road that I could see from my stopping point on the bike. As I passed a “ditch” that I liked to play in (young boy) I looked to the left (east, darkest part of sky) so I think that’s how I saw this thing in the sky that was actually a little BEHIND my casual forward facing field of view for riding a bike.  Road was empty, safety not top of mind, so glancing around, saw this thing. Stopped the bike, put feet on ground, watched it.  This thing was literally a FIRE BALL.  I mean it was close, (estimate 1,000 to 5,000 ft up).  I went back as an adult 35 yrs later, everything looked SMALLER, so, trying to correct for youthful “point of view” perceptions.  If I extended my hand, and placed the object between my thumb and forefinger, it would have been a little smaller than a dime held at arms length. It was moving from EAST to WEST, heading directly towards the Air Force Base air space.   There was NO SMOKE.  I could see the actual DEFINITION of flames covering this ROUND, GLOBULAR object….like a rubber ball on fire…so it wasn’t MILES high.  Another thing that makes me feel it was fairly low was that as it CHANGED COURSE, very abruptly, multiple times, with NO curvature or deceleration; those changes were immediately reflected in my perception of the “ground” it covered between changes in direction. I would say that the changes by degrees were about10-15 degrees, in opposing directions, from left to right.  It made about 6 course changes in the 30 seconds it was visible to me, as it passed almost directly overhead.  Another way to say how I calculate that course deviation, is that as it was directly overhead, and it zigged and zagged band and forth, if it had STAYED on one of those new headings, it would have passed out of sight on the horizon about 10 to 15 degrees DIFFERENCE from the FIRST HEADING of my 360 circular view of the horizon all around me, so I think that means a 10 to 15 degree change in course heading?  As I got older and studied, I learned about INERTIA, and how something of mass CAN’T INSTANTLY change direction without the expenditure of enormous amounts of energy to overcome inertia.  The changes in direction, the zig and zag back and forth of its’ direction of travel, was INSTANT. Imagine the old original video game PONG.  Like ping pong. Remember how you could play with TWO paddles, hit the white dot on the screen with your back paddle, and as the white dot proceeded towards the other side of the screen, you could place your FRONT paddle in the path of the dot and it would INSTANTLY continue forward on a different “heading”?  So, imagine an INVISIBLE pong paddle that this fireball passed through, about 6 times in 30 seconds, covering a little more than 60% of my overhead view (I saw it when it was about 40% already traversed the airspace of the Eastern horizon, heading to the Western Horizon), each time it passes through this point, it changes heading by 15 degrees with ! no “curving”. This is another reason I felt it was fairly low.  If it had covered 60% of the sky from east to west, almost directly overhead, in 30 seconds, and been WAY HIGH, I would not have been able to see FLAMES well defined, licking along the surface of this globe.  The “speed” and distance would have smeared my perception of flames into a single color, and I’m sure a much higher speed needed to travel the “distance’ to the horizon in 30 seconds or less would have produced some kind of trail of debris and a visual TAIL of fire……this was not the case. I could SEE this thing was a GLOBE. It made NO SOUND.  There was no smoke trail.  The flames were “licking” to the rear of the direction of travel, as though the air itself was sweeping the flames to the rear, but the “rear” of the ball, as it travelled, was not distorted into a TAIL of fire….it was ROUND, it was completely covered in flames (red, yellow, orange). I feel it was fairly low because the forward momentum of an object traveling VERY HIGH and there fore VERY FAST to cover the sky so quickly would have taken an IMPOSSIBLE amount of energy to change direction almost INSTANTANEOUSLY 5 to 6 times in 30 seconds, and that also the PERCIEVED changes in direction and the DEGREES of travel between changes in direction would have been MUCH MORE, and therefore even less possible to be happening.  Very hard to put into words. As I watched it “descend” over the pine forest to the WEST, heading into the sunset, directly towards Charleston AFB air space, it seemed to be descending, not just moving beyond my view of horizon. Imagine a small plane, only 5,000 feet up, flying almost directly overhead, and heading to the next nearby town.  As it got farther away, it would LOOK like it was descending, when it might only be flying LOW and at a constant altitude.  It’s just YOUR POINT OF VIEW from the ground that makes it look like it’s getting “lower” as it passes over trees that are 100 feet away from you across a road you are on, and the highway adjacent to it (that’s why the tree tops of these pine trees (less than 20 feet tall) were 100 feet from me. So, I figured, “this thing is going to HIT THE GROUND!”.  So I literally braced my feet on the ground, waiting for the inevitable FLASH in the sky, rumble in the air, earthquake, whatever a 9 yr old would think of as a BIG CRASH result……and I waited, and waited, and it NEVER came.  No flash, no sound, no vibration. I looked around (now the sighting was 3 minutes old, what I saw, and the wait for a crash). NOT A SOUL to be seen.  Everybody had their lights on, just finishing up dinner, watching the evening news, whatever.  No kids out, since they had no business outside. All the people in this housing development were YOUNG military, with YOUNG kids.  Most kids were under 10 yrs old, so no playing outside after dinner.  There was no high school (was K-5th grade school nearby I attended). I thought to myself “Nobody will believe what I just saw”.  I went home, didn’t tell my mom, or either of my brothers what I saw.  I developed an INTENSE interest in UFO’s after this, driven by my sighting and what happened about 18 months later… there was a ruckus on my street with dogs barking, pounding footsteps and shouting outside, our walls literally SHOOK as several people STAMPEDED by our front yard.  They were young military men (neighbors in their early 20’s) who claimed to see 3 UFO’s just 200 feet from our house, zipping ALONG that state highway next to the development.  They said there were two balls of light coming from one direction, one ball of light from the opposite direction (they said one was red, one was white, one was blue).  They said the single ball of light passed between the other two lights, they all then swooped up into the sky, turned white, and remained stationary pretending to be stars.  I must say, as a child, this seemed exciting, but differed A LOT from what I experienced, but I do remember these guys being REALLY SINCERELY excited, and that the man with the yard that abutted the state highway had hunting hounds in his yard, and they were going CRAZY!  He came out with his gun, thinking somebody was harassing his dogs, or an animal (possibly rabid) had come near them…..just as these 3 young adults came thundering onto his property (small yards, really) yelling LOOK UP LOOK UP!  At which point he did and I recall him saying he thought he saw “some lights moving” that he agreed “got lost” in the stars.  I had run out and followed whoever had thundered past our house, not knowing what was going on, and seeing a man with a gun confronting other men who were panting and excited and pointing at the sky made me afraid, so I saw this, heard their comments and sincerity, and went right back home.  It was unsettling, and I had nothing to add, since I saw NOTHING. Anyway, I find it hard to believe that Charleston AFB has no knowledge of this incredible, fiery ball of matter that changed direction with no “curving”…simply immediately changed course.  Also no sound, no smoke, and no GIANT CRASH I was expecting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",,32.80388723163842,-79.9688566101695

Once that happened, it slowly raised up.  We then all ran to our large picture window and watched as it slowly just went up toward the stars and actually eventually blended in with them.

On or about June 15 in 1996, at around 2:30-3:00 in the morning;  My brother, his girlfriend (now wife), a longtime friend, and I were on the back roads between Gillette WY and Lusk WY towing back my brothers' old Ford pick-up truck with a tow bar.  (No one had to be in that vehicle, we were all in the towing vehicle, an older Suburban.)  It was very late and we were all very tired.  My brother and his girlfriend were laying down in the back seat talking to each other.  My long time friend was driving and I was in the passenger seat.  My friend and I were talking about the events of the day trying to pass the time.  We were heading south from Gillette on our way to Lusk.  I was looking out the passenger window at the horizon (this would be towards the west) enjoying the dark almost uncanny calmness of the night sky, when on the horizon, (I would assume a couple miles away, there are lots of hills and momentary turns) I saw what I thought was the spotlight on the front of a locomotive on the horizon.  I didn't think much of it until within seconds, it became brighter and instantly was within 100 feet of our moving vehicle.  It shot from the west to the east, moving through our headlight beams, and this part is very hard to describe; it was like a spinning disc (?) with multiple colored lights (red, blue, green) and when it crossed in front of us it seemed to bounce(?) and flip over (it was a horizontal spinning disc(?) coming from the west until it ""bounced"" in front of us; it ""bounced"" vertically on it's side flipping over to the other side, and continued spinning to the east over the horizon.  This all happened in seconds, but it truly felt like we were in slow motion.  My friend who was driving and I immediately looked at each other and said, ""No ((deleted)) way!""  My brother an his girlfriend started to freak out, (they had only looked up after it had crossed us and we had passed it because the lights were so brig! ht it lit up the entire cab of the vehicle.) they were able to! see it shoot over the eastern horizon.  We had to stop and pull over, it was very weird, it felt like SOMETHING had happened.  But all that we knew was we just saw something VERY weird.  It almost felt like I had been running a long distance. I was out of breath and shaking.   We stopped got out of the vehicle and smoked a cigarette, all the while my brothers' girlfriend wouldn't get out of the car and was crying.  We were all in a daze wondering what ((deleted)) was that?  My brothers' girlfriend was telling us to get in the vehicle and get going, we were still all so dumb-stuck that I really didn't know quite what had happened.  We got back into the vehicle and continued on down the road, all of us not talking much and my brothers' girlfriend sobbing in the back seat.  When we finally reached our destination, we were almost 2 hours behind schedule.  No one really said much, or thought much about it other than ""what a weird night"".  We never said much about it, until a few weeks ago I was at my brothers' house, and we were talking about weird stuff and this came up.  The weirdest part of the whole situation was that we had a ""lost time"" incident.  And I don't know, but there's this part of me that says something happened.  I was never into the esoteric or paranormal until after this experience. Anyway, I have been an avid C2C AM listener and always heard the UFO guy say that it doesn't matter how old the sighting was, they wanted it recorded.   So, that's my story.

During the summer of 1949 I worked as a transit man on a survey line for the Civil Aeronautics Administration which was beginning the development of the Fairbanks International Airport.   On a clear day in July, in a sky void of sound or activity, there appeared an enormous metallic saucer-shaped object directly above my line of sight, but at a great distance from us.   I shouted to my two chainmen and pointed to the object which was approaching rapidly until it appeared directly above us, but still at an altitude higher than any aircraft I had ever observed.  Its size was enormous.  I imagined it would cover several city blocks in size.   It was visible for about a couple of minutes before it made a sharp right angle turn and climbed out of sight.  Only one of the chainmen saw the object.  The time of the sighting was about eleven o’clock in the morning.   At noon it was time for our break and we headed back to the survey station where the sighting was discussed with others.   By the end of the day our story had reached the military at Ladd Field and when we arrived back at the station we were approached by an Army officer who interrogated us separately regarding the sighting.  When I was asked how high it was I responded that it was at least at an altitude of 30,000 feet.  The officer asked why I would choose that altitude and I said it was because I knew of no aircraft that could reach that altitude. I am aware that this was a very early sighting but understand that your organization is nevertheless interested in recording all reliable sightings, and since I am now in my eighties there is no time like the present to report it.

The insertion of ""California"" as a county name was not intended.  It was an interesting technical error as I had inserted ""no county"" in that column.

Thank you for forwarding the very interesting story regarding the sighting from the Eklutna area.

This report may be long overdue but I can recall it as though it occurred last summer.   It was mid August 1975. I was watching over and taking care of chores at my stepfather and Mothers 22000 acre Beef cattle and Quarter horse ranch.  My stepdad had gone to our summer range at Greys lake Idaho to ride through the herd at that place.  The ranch where this event occurred is a remote Desert mountain ranch in northwestern Box Elder County, Utah.  There is not, nor ever has been any electricity at this"" Fort"" ranch.  It is isolated and even now quite primitive.  The 15th of August 1975 was very dry and very hot.  It was about 90 to 95 degrees F. at just before 12 midnite.        My mother was home, 80 miles to the east of where I was, she at our Logan Utah guest ranch, located on the Logan river..  The crickets at the Promontory Fort Ranch were chirping very rapidly outside the Bedroom window.  One can calculate about how hot it is by the speed that crickets chirp. that and I had inside-outside thermometers.   I was laying on the bed in the houses only bedroom reading a book.  The ranch cowdog  a Border collie was plopped down right next to me on the rug to the side of the bed.  I was reading by the propane powered lamp on the wall above my head.    I was 22 years old at the time,and I had 20/10 vision in both eyes.  This ranch is located 20 miles south by southwest of Thiokol Chemical Corp, where several stages of Intercontinental missle boosters and their propellant was made for the United States air force in support of continental defense/strategic Nuclear weapon systems, and later on, the NASA space shuttle solid rocket boosters. (1950 to 2005)  Now known as ATK space  systems and related subsidararies     The crickets stopped chirping.  The dog started fidgeting.  The dog started whimpering then whining this eerie mournful, pitiful cry, it got intense.  The poor animal began to exhibit terror at someone or something that was approaching. absolutely panic stricken.  Then, it started to paw and dig into the wallpaper and plaster of the rooms corner.  It tore clear through to the lath and was frantically pawing to get through even that.  I could not hear any sound, except for the freaked- out dog.   Then the horses started to act up and they became terribly agitated.  The horses whinnied and snorted.  They squealed and stampeded around the round corral that they were in next to the barn.  The barn was south of the ranch house and slightly below the main house about 20 yards away from me.   There were four saddle horses all of them geldings.  All of them gentle, with no previous signs of skittishness or jumpiness.  These working cow cutting horses were about as Bombproof, bullet proof dog-gentle-reliable as a mount could get.  At least before this incident.   They were desperately trying to get out of the corral and could not quite jump over the tall fence made of upright railroad ties.  I remember thinking that a rocky Mountain Cougar might be stalking my horses, so I retrieved all of t! he ranch weapons from their cache, loaded them and lay them squarely on the bed.  I short time earlier, maybe two months, a bobcat had been on the tin roof of the barn and had to be shot off, lest he sprang on the peafowl and chickens   That was another thing, none of the ranch chickens or peafowl seemed to be anywhere around and I didn't see the black cat that was usually hanging around the porch.   Then there was this light.  The light was a  bright red orange.  It was more than bright, it was intensely bright, it was shining in from through  the west window.  I went over to the window to look.  I was nervous and had a vague feeling of apprehension about the situation up to now, but then I saw it.  It was a saucer.  A FLYING SAUCER!  the damn thing was positioned a little over a block to the west of the house.  It shone bright red orange.  The light was just glowing right out of the steel skin or whatever metal it was.  This thing was hovering about four hundred feet in the air.  It floated silently. there were no rotors. There were no propellers.  There were no jet engines, no rocket thrusters or any visible means of how it moved.  I estimate that the craft was 300 feet in diameter.  It was fifty feet high and believe there was a dome or protrusion on top. I did not see any beings or creatures. there were no windows or portals visible. It looked exactly like the shape of two tin pie pans hooked together into classic science fiction  Flying Saucer shape.  The strong light that it emitted cast shadows from the cedar fence posts , the fence line, the sagebrush and the greasewood all around and under it.the entire desert alkalai floor was lit up bright as day under and around it .there was a large alfalfa haystack near where I first observed this ship .The haystack cast a large grotesque shadow by this things light.  Again, it made no sound, but its presence and possibly whatever emanated from it scared the hell out of the dog ,the horses and me! I was crying, sweating profusely , and ready to pee my pants all at once. what wa! s most terrifying to me was, as I looked upon it   I suddenly knew it was watching me and it was aware that   I was there. THE best description of what it was... and this is deeply ingrained upon me; a living machine. It didn't just strike me as being evil IT was evil. Malevolant not friendly or here to help mankind. also I just knew this thing was capable of killing with no qualms. I just knew this and other things about it, it communicated via telepathy , and I didn't like it. I didn't like it trespassing or being there at all and the living intelligent saucer read my mind enough to know that I would fight and resist  if I could. I may have been abducted . I do not think I was but I might have been. I don't know how long I stared at it maybe  a few minutes. suddenly it floated over the house and as it did, the tin roof on the barn and bunkhouse rattled and so did all the dishes in the pantry then it shot off to the southeast end of the ranch to the pasture we call the ros! ebushes .it is a boggy wetland of marshes cattails and deed we! t and dr y sand .     many wild rows of rosebushes grow there.it is on the shoreline of the great Salt Lake located on the north end of one arm of the lake. this Craft hovered above the rosebush pasture twelve mile southeast. It moved from overhead to the rosebushes in much less than half a seconds time. The next development was two U.S. Airforce Jets approached from the Northwest.  these two jets in formation flew over the house at 1210 a,m. so low that the jetwash stirred up dust in the yard after they went by.  Probably didn't help calm the horses down any as they passed either.  They were F-105 thunderchief Fighter bombers,  nuclear capable. before these heavy bombers got much past the house,  not even within 11 miles of the saucer, it shot right straight up and winked out.

I watched these lights and noticed that the lights would be lite for a few secons then go Out.  Not all at the same time.  I watched for a while and more lights came out from behind the trees headed west.   These lights were strung out about 10-15 (from ground view) inches long and five accross and they were escorting a mother ship.  I called my grandson and his friend out (5th graders) to see the UFO's fleeing the hurricane.  They became afraid and ran into the house.   Neither will even speak about what they saw that night.

No Wind, Clear sky and lots of stars visible, the water was also calm, so hearing was optimal. Time was approximately 01-02 am. I was on my way towards my friend when my eyes caught a moving silhouette, on the top part of the island.  It was walking very calmly almost like sneaking. My immediate thought was that this was my friend, and I thought he was going to pull a prank on me.  So i said to him, (the shadow/silhouette) YOOHOOO!.. by the time i ended this Word, it stopped and turned only its head towards me.   I had with me a flashlight, but my friend has numerously times discussed with me since i ruin his nightvision by blending him, so i didn't turn on my flashlight, after a glimpse of 3 seconds, it began to walk towards the heavy bushes, and i thought to myself, WHAT THE HECK IS HE DOING!?   So i went up to see where and why my friend was doing this, because it made no sense that he was going in to that place...upon arrival i saw my friend came up the same path that this being was headed, and I jumped and was both horrified and surprised, and asked him...Did you just run Down again towards the water, after just being here`? He replied no, and he noticed that i was worried.   So i told him that we are not alone on this island. This island is very small, we could walk around the entire site in 5 minutes. I will Place a map so that you can see it. We searched the entire island  meter by meter with a 4500 lumen flashlight that is very powerful. I am or at least was a sceptic, to both aliens, or other entities, upon this incident, Ive spent many hours if not hundreds of hours in the woods for several years, and nothing has ever been this intense, and at the same time, so mind bugging scary, due to the fact that I can not explain what I saw and at the same time I know what I saw, something that could resemble a humanoid, it was dark, and I could not see any colors, or any sign of clothing that would normally protrude or break the line in or out of a silhouette. Also the horizon was bright, due to some twilight in the distance. I know that this could not be any human, because it vanished out of thin air... If someone had escaped by swimming, we would definitely hear it. Or even see him or her when we inspected the island.   Same night, when we went to our tent, we were woken up by a pulsating vibration. Im a guy who sleeps very heavy,  but this vibration managed to somehow Wake me up in a matter of minutes.  it was not normal and i think my brain must have picked this up as a ""threat"" or something unusual. My friend also woke up from this. To make further example of how heavily i sleep, my friend started shooting at geese's flying over Our tent, and i did not wake up even though he fired his shotgun, 2-3meters away from the tent in a 80 degree angle above it.  I have no clue what this vibration was, but Norway is NOT known for having earthquakes also previously noticed a lot of light movements in the sky in that area. I have done research to find some concrete answers but nothing adds up, except one thing... The description of the white tall aliens. The silhouette from one drawing drew my attention to articles about them and i find it very intriguing to my experience. I have thought about trying to see if I can get any contact With this ""being"" or entity, if its still there. I have also thought about putting camera there for 2 days, to see if i can Catch some footage.    It is a place that often has lights moving on the sky, some go about at an arch and some look like satellites. Sometimes there are small flashes that moves rapidly from one point to another and sometimes the lights tends to respond to the flashlights. Its not uncommon to see lights descend or ascend while they slowly look like burning out, in a way that it looks like it disappears or burns up. All of the lights that I have observed with my hunting buddies, was before this incident at this Island. The silhouette was tall, thin, and normally sized head. Im an artist and often draw paintings and drawings, I could share this if needed. My friend is 6fot 3inches.  From what I can remember and going through the scenario with my friend it had to be around 6ft 3- up to 6ft 6inches tall, I saw it from the torso up, as it was to black to see the legs.  My friend did not have his shotgun on him, but I was wearing mine on my back while I was fishing at that time, as I don't like leaving the gun alone.  In a phone discussion with my friend I told him, whatever it was that I saw back then, it was at your stance and it was interested in you or possibly checking you out.

On the evening in question I was traveling northbound on 95 approaching the Aramingo avenue exit.  I saw to my right several slowly rising objects from the northeast in my peripheral vision.  I then focused my attention to the objects. I counted approximately 12-15 of them.  The objects appeared to be triangular in shape with a solid orange color.  There were no visible navigation, beacon, or strobe lights, which are required on all civilian aircraft, and usually on military aircraft as well.  I did not hear any sound from the objects, although I was traveling at highway speed and only briefly put the window down.  The objects slowly gained altitude.  I would estimate from approximately 150 ft AGL up to 12-1300ft AGL at which point I lost visual reference due to traveling in the opposite direction. They appeared to originate from an approximate heading of 040º magnetic on an outbound of approximately 235º toward the downtown area.  It appeared as if they remained in a tight formation of 2-3 craft in front, at a slightly higher altitude, 4 in a roughly arrow formation, and the remainder flew in sequence.  The overall formation reminded me of the uneven arrow which geese fly in when heading south for winter.  My passenger also witnessed the event and she continued to maintain visual reference while I returned my attention to driving.  I could see the objects in the rearview mirror for approximately 2 more miles until I exited the motorway.  Sky conditions on the evening in question were approximately 8 miles visibility, no cloud bases, and a light (&lt;5knots) wind.  There was no snow on the ground at the time, there was no snow falling at the time, nor were there reports of snowfall in the area.  I reviewed temporary flight restrictions, which would notify airmen of any launches or abnormal flight operations, and found none for the evening in question or the surrounding week.  My background is in aviation, and this is unlike anything I have seen in my career.  The lack of sound and slow speed makes me of the opinion that it was not a formation of fixed wing aircraft.  The lack of sound, abnormal lighting, and elevation also makes me skeptical that it could be a helicopter fleet.  I have made this report several months after the fact only because I did not get around to it and also because I have recently seen several videos online, from Philadelphia, which show almost exactly what I saw.  Having seen those, my opinion is even more so that what I saw was indeed abnormal. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

With the height seeming to be 500-700 ft or about a little higher than a cell tower, I could not make a outline of the craft.  Just the four lights.  Heading towards the side of it getting on 40 it seemed to be moving very slowly at this point and by time I was passing it's path behind it it seemed to have rapidly picked up speed and changed direction to northwest. Now when telling the very same people I talk to everyday, including my wife, immediately there's a look like uh huh yeah right.  So with that in mind... when I was on the on ramp for hwy 40 and I was heading towards the side of the craft, I saw what appeared to be a small rectangular door opening.  It was behind the middle white light and off centered.  I took it as a door because the dim glow grew as such from a door opening.  I could not make any details out from what was inside just that the dim glow was indirect.  I don't tell anyone anymore but figured I should atleast report it. I was captivated at first as much as anyone is by a low flying plane but when realizing something is different about what I was seeing, I didn't want to pull over, fumble with my phone for a pic... all I wanted to do was observe and figure it out.

He noticed what he described as a ""star"", but with the sun still out I told him it was probably Jupiter.  I ran into the house quickly for about a minute and then came back out.  He was still fixated on this object, so I looked up and found it difficult to locate.  When I did see it, I noticed a small, rather unremarkable point of light just lingering there so I thought nothing of it.  It was almost directly overhead, the light was constant, and the weather was clear. After another minute or perhaps less, my brother said it was moving so he ran to grab his binoculars.  I found it harder to locate this time as indeed it had changed its location.  It was moving approximately ENE across the sky, but not particularly quickly, more like drifting across.  Now I knew it wasn't Jupiter so I went to grab my spyglass.  I asked him if it might be the ISS or a satellite but he said no as he was looking through his binoculars.  He couldn't make out the actual details of the object as it was difficult to focus on it with cheap binoculars, much less the fact that it was drifting across the sky.  It appeared to be slowly drifting faster until it was no longer there!  It was still overhead at the moment of last sighting and then we couldn't locate it any more. I'm not sure what this could be, and I'm pretty sure there's an explanation.  I'm sort of a skeptic when it comes to UFO sightings but am open to the idea of government/military experiments or atmospheric phenomena as explanations for most of them.  For this particular sighting, neither of those make sense to me.  If anyone has more information, I'd love to know.",2014-01-10T00:00:00,37.3388420218894,-121.88970568836406

Sometimes it looked circular, other times it looked octagonal.  It looked like a large pulsating, living, organism.  ! I stopped filming and went home where I noticed it again, low on the horizon just above the tree line but far away.

I was stationed in Afghanistan from Spring of 2005 to winter of 2006.  In my first few months, we were put along the Pakistan/Afghanistan border to stop Taliban from having free travel across country to country.  It was the hot spot of the country at the time.  We had observation posts (OP) all along the border.  Each having from one squad to an entire platoon stationed on each OP. My squad was stationed on an OP right in front of a big plain the locals called the ""Dashteh"".  Put along a ridge line we watched over the border.  24 hours, someone was always on guard obviously and we would rotate through our company of pulling shifts, OPs, patrols and time off.  So we were low on sleep sometimes but I was not at the time.  I was well rested. A Special Forces soldier that we were stationed with told me of how there is absolutely no light pollution which is why at night we could literally see every star the naked eye could see.  We could even see satellites....just small white dots of lights that moved along in the sky, orbiting the earth.  Simple put, they looked like moving stars that did not flicker.  They were easy spot and very common.  Looking at the sky at night you could easily see 2-3 of them in 10 minutes....and shooting stars.  We saw plenty. I was pulling my guard shift one morning right before the sun was rising.  When I was woken up for my shift, it was dark, when my shift was coming to an end, the sun was beginning to rise (Early Morning Nautical Twilight).  The sun was not up yet but it was starting to shed light to begin the day. Nearing the end of my shift, the moon was still out and I saw, what I assumed, was one of the satellites I have already seen so many nights before.  For some reason, I kept my eye on it.  I watched it for about 30 seconds or so before it did what it did.  It slowly moved along in the sky, just as all the other satellites did that I watched.  It cruised along, directly under the moon moving from South to North.  The moon was nearly full and from where I sat, two adult hand widths above the horizon.  The second the light got on the North side of the moon, it's speed changed to drastically fast, shifted directly up 90 degrees towards the sky, shot away in a straight line, straight up, and faded away in about 1 and a half to 2 seconds.  From start to finish, it's flight path was like a capital L.  I asked if any of my squad members saw what I saw but no one else was awake.  It felt unreal and I was very frustrated that I was the only person that witnessed it. Where we were at was absolutely deafening silence.  If you stopped breathing, you could actually experience being deaf.  The craft made no sound or anything of the sort.  It didn't flicker, change shape, or change color.  It stayed constant (a small white dot of light traveling South to North) until it got on the North side of the moon and shot away.  The only thing that changed was it's speed and direction.  It did not leave a trail. Now, I am a skeptic with ghosts and UFOs and what not but I do not see how what I saw is explainable.  No human aircraft can make that sort of maneuver let alone move at that sort of speed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2014-01-24T00:00:00,,

Sunset had been just about 18:30.   As it was turning to go N, it banked and the bank of lights turned with it.  It looked like one quarter of the lights from the ships from Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind.  I assume these were entirely terrestrial, but am including this report in case any others saw them.  We were under wind advisory conditions and I can attest to 40-45 MPH winds and this would be a mean feat for any aircraft, especially lighter than air ones as these must have been.  They were going too slowly to have been regular planes and almost looked as if they were some kind of advertising gimmick.  I should note there is no military flight path nor event center I know of for miles.  I followed this craft with the eye until I could no longer see it.  I picked up my girlfriend (waiting about ten minutes) and immediately told her about the sighting.  As we went back toward W HWY-10, another craft, exactly the same, came over the crest and I had to stop the car to give her a good look at it.  Wind gusts were really getting high now, but the highly-lit craft (mostly white) with its bank of very bright lights took a similar flight plan and didn't seem to notice.  No effects on car, radiation or otherwise.  It did not occur to me to try to take video of either craft, if I had been very alert, along with traffic, I might have gotten blurry video that may have looked like a very new type of aircraft.",2014-01-24T00:00:00,39.0001002739726,-95.25458794520547

First hand.  I did not know of this site as I have never looked into UFO reporting websites.  I was told to go to MUFON and have not sent any other reports.  A UFO researcher told me what I saw was a falling satellite, but I disagree.   Here is my report:  My friend and I were going to the gym on the night stated in the report.  We were walking out of my house and I saw something on fire behind a huge tree across the street from my neighbors house.  It was just passed the 4th of July, and in TX, people set off fireworks around this time constantly.  I thought it was an aerial firework, the tree hid the rest of the flames, so it was not seen for maybe 10-30 seconds.  My friend and I were outside talking then all the sudden the object cleared the tree.  I said ""What ((deleted)) is that?!"". I am legally blind, so there are many things that I cannot recognize right away that my friends always tell me what an object is.  My fiend had no answer.  We watched it for about 20-30 seconds before I realized I had a smart phone with a video camera.  The video I took, which will be pasted below, does not do what even I saw, justice. What we saw was just what I described as this.  When you light a match, and hold it sides.  This object was on fire. We could not see anything other than the flames.  The sky was very dark, hardly any wind and no clouds in the sky.  I would say this object was about 400-600 feet in the sky.  It was hard to tell how big or small it was.  It was not enormous to say the least. It started at E/SE, then moved across the sky finally going upwards to the NE.  The entire duration was probably 3 minutes.  I stopped the camera once it was going away.  Towards the end of this sighting I heard helicopter blades, but they were behind us on the opposite side of the sky. In the NE direction, about 3-4 miles away is a small tiny airport where only small helicopters and crop dust planes go to and from.  This is where the object went, but went upwards.  I called the police and they were concerned that something was on fire and could land in a field and catch fire.  We have lots of dry land that go up quickly so that was their concern.  After we called them we decided to go out there.  we found nothing except the police riding around looking around like we were.  I later called them back, they said they contacted the little airstrip but nothing was going or coming.  I called our local news station in Corpus Christi and they were not interested. I did tell the police that I had video footage of this object, the dispatcher was excited.  She sent the officer that went looking to come look at the video.  He could not explain it. Here is the video.  From what I saw with my own eyes, which my friend can conform is that this thing on fire.  It was going across the sky.  The flames never stopped and it kinda seemed like there were 3-4 flames.  The flames were shooting up, never sideways. My cellphone had about 25-30% power left, after only filming this object for over a minute the phone did run out of power very quickly.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aARI4vBDVZ4  Thank you !",2014-01-24T00:00:00,27.865,-97.2001

Just as it was beginning to get dark I noticed some pulsing lights coming up from the direction south beyond Hawkins Creek within tree top level-(est. 600-700ft. away) from my slightly elevated position. I was already walking westerly and a short moment later it appeared that the formation of blinking lights, UFO's(12-15) were going to be slightly west of my location.  The HPS lights on the towers had just illuminated moments before and I'd only walked about 200 ft from the office building while passing under a light tower to get a better unobstructed view. They were in a loose single file formation, some slightly higher, lower, or farther and closer. They seemed very close to me without any sounds being noticed or heard.  Perspective wise they were maybe the size of a finger or thumbnail held out at arm's length. The illumintated craft were each pulsing unsynchronized, first two beats warm red colored light near the center bottom surface of the craft, then two beats of a rose color somewhat wider spread out further, then lastly two beats of a ruby red color illuminating the furthest across the bottom surface.  The light pattern would repeaton each craft again and again evenly about every 5-7 seconds to complete.  It wasn't entirely dark yet and I couldn't see anything on the topside.  It seemed that the larger ruby colored flashing beats best revealed the overall oval shape of the UFO. The UFO's were more visible to see farther away when approaching, because when I thought to start counting them, they were less visible and fading out fast at the front of the formation traveling away from me towards the northwest.  I thought maybe the event had ended when I turned around shortly before spotting 2-3 more of the same craft following the same flight path, spaced much farther apart, moving about the same speed, within about 20-30 seconds behind the main group.

Blanchard, Louisiana, is in the middle of nowhere in Northwestern Louisiana.  Just as I was trying to figure it out, the lights all moved at once to the right in the sky at an outrageous speed.  They zipped to the left and diagonally to the right again, all the while keeping in a triangular formation.  The lights were white and very bright; their light drowned out the light of the stars.  They were moving so fast it was hard to keep up with them.  No sound came from the lights at all. It was very quiet. 	My friend and I watched in amazement and a little bit of terror as well.  It was so strange; we both had never seen anything like it in our lives.  The lights decided to zoom towards us; they seemed so close that I thought if I reached out I could touch them.  But before I could do that, the lights sped off into the distance and disappeared.  It was a truly amazing experience.

I have thought of this event over the years and for some reason I cannot forget that night.   I was returning to Dallas from a trip from Louisiana with a backhaul.  As I normally do I was heading northbound on highway 69 north from Lufkin, TX, heading north toward the city of Rusk. As I usually do this time of night I would take a break on side of the road just north of a small town called Wells, TX.  I would take a sleep break just north of town where highway 69 would open up from a two lane road to a four lane highway.  It was about 1 am in the morning when I would first stop and I had planned to stop for only for 15 minutes.  I would go into my sleeper, close the curtain, and go to sleep for a bit longer than I had planned.  I remember something waking me up and I had a feeling of something strange or abnormal.  I would come out the sleeper to look around to make sure no one or nothing was happening to my trailer as I would be responsible for it having stopped in such a remote area.  I then remember looking out the passenger side window and seeing brightness out the corner of my eye.  I then looked to directly out the window and I could see a bright yet dim light hovering over the tree line in the distance.  I had stopped before in areas in Louisi! ana next to oil refinery plants plenty of times before so I was thinking it was just the tower that burns off the gas from their refinery process.  As I continued to look at this light I realized the light didn’t burn like the flames I had seen at those plants yet it was illuminated like soft burning light bulb you have in your home. I then started to look around to see if anyone else was around seeing the same thing I was but no one was coming from the north or southbound direction of the road.  I remember trying to see if this object had a shape of any kind but all I could see was the light coming from it. It seems to give off a little light over the trees but not enough to be extremely bright.  I then tried to figure out how far away the object was but all I could see was a field that seems to be about 200 yards from the trees and I can say the trees look to be about 25 to 30 feet tall at most.  I was going to try to get out the truck and try to walk closer but the field had a fence around it and also had cows in it as well.  The object didn’t move at all or anything it just sat over the trees. I had heard of many companies in the area drilling for gas and I thought it could have been a light tower in their working area but the light wasn’t giving off any light that could lite up an area.  I continued to watch the object and I then rolled down the window and then turned off the truck to see if I could hear any sound from the object or anything around it.  It was complete silence except for a little cold air blowing from time to time.  The object’s light didn’t pulse or anything it just was a constant light glowing in the night. As I continued to watch the light it would glow for about 5 more minutes and then all of a sudden it just went out.  No noise or movement it just went out without warning.  I sat there for a few more minutes to see if the light would come back but nothing at all came back.  I would then try to write details of the event to the best of my knowledge and at the time I didn’t have a phone with a camera on it.  To this day I have no idea what I saw that night but for some reason it sticks with me to this day.  Because of that night I would carry a cell phone with a good camera on it just in case I would see something strange again.  I cannot be sure if the date was correct but I do know that the time was correct because this was the time I would always get back to this part of Texas from Louisiana.  I truly wish I could find out what that was or even if anyone else had seen the object as well so I wouldn’t think I was just seeing things.

I had just left for work and as I proceeded down the road about 1/4 of a mile from my house I could see bright lights through the trees to my right.  I live in a very rural area with a lot of trees.  I thought nothing of this since there are a lot of small private airports near my house and I always see small planes in this area but not usually right over the trees or near the high tension lines.  As I approached the clearing where the high tension towers are I saw a giant craft approaching.  At first I thought it was a military cargo plane that was on the wrong flight path and way too low.  It was at least fifty feet wide and had five bright lights across the front but no strobes.  As it got closer I could see that it was no plane.  I stopped my van and got my cellphone and frantically tried to get it into camera mode as it approached to no avail.  It passed directly over my head at approximately 100 feet from ground level.  This was easy to measure since it was up twice as high as the high tension towers.  It made a very low rumbling sound but not at all like a military cargo plane.  I know what they look and sound like as they pass overhead as I have done work at the FAA in A.C. and at McGuire Air force base.  I could clearly see an aqua/blue colored light in the very center underneath the craft.  It was pulsing slowly but again, no strobes.  And I could also clearly see that it was in the shape of a triangle not a plane.  It glided slowly away following the high tension lines. It was see by another person who was driving on route 55.

I walked outside to my back patio about 9:15 PM on 12/31/13 (New Year’s Eve) and looked up at the sky.  I immediately spotted a single light-orange orb in the southwest part of the sky moving northeast at a moderate rate of speed.  It didn’t appear to be at a high altitude –maybe a couple of hundred feet above the ground (although I’m certainly not the best judge of distances).  If I were to have held up my thumb, it would have been just a bit smaller than the size of my thumbnail.  It passed to the west of me and I followed its path as it headed northeast until it disappeared. It was extremely bright.  I saw no blinking lights around it, as you see on planes. It had no form, like a plane, simply a brilliant ball of light.  And, what struck me as the strangest thing of all, was that it was completely silent. My husband and I spend many nights outside on the patio star-gazing.  Since we are very close to the flight path of Louisville International Airport, Bowman Field, and a TV station that has a helicopter landing pad, my husband and I are very familiar with all types of aircraft at all levels of altitude.  Even though we live relatively close to the city and the light pollution can sometimes be a problem, we can also spot satellites as they pass overhead. Despite our familiarity with the aircraft/spacecraft that fly over our home (we’ve lived here for 8 years), I couldn’t identify this as anything I’d ever seen in the past.  I remember asking myself, “What IS that?”  When it had disappeared (after being visible to me for about 45 seconds), I walked back inside and mentioned to my husband that I’d just seen something that I’d never seen before in my life.  I wondered silently to myself if I’d seen a UFO. A few days later, while checking the Internet, I found reports of people in California on New Year’s Eve spotting light orange orbs of light that were completely silent.  I was stunned.

Much like the events that I have read about the other sightings of lights, or fireballs, these lights that we had anticipated watching were suppose to be methane gas bubbles rising from the earth/swamp near Lake Wappapello.  These lights lit up within five feet near the edge of a wooded area and approximately five to ten feet from one another.  There were three that began as multicolored, red, blue, orange and white.  The first one danced out into a nearby field and faded dimly after lighting up bright orange.  Minutes later the other two repeated nearly the same actions only to fade out and completely disappear.  The first light lit back up-approximately ten feet from the ground-back to a beautiful bright orange, and danced around in the field for what seemed like minutes.  We ruled out the possibility of these lights being methane gas (bubbles) because they never ascended more than fifteen feet off of the ground below it.  The light blinked back out once more, li! t back up bright orange and with almost lightning speed flew out into the road in front of us a mile to a mile and a half away.  It stopped and sat there hovered over the roadway for some time and then sped off quickly to our right out into what appeared to be another field.  As we hurried away the light appeared again down a dirt road to out right, but seemed as if it were following us. It then danced out beside our vehicle once more, (bouncing almost gracefully) into the empty field, keeping up with our speed of a minimum of 40 mph to finally dim and disappear one last time.  We observed these lights for what felt like an hour.  We arrived at the area just after dark around 6:30-7:00 pm the night of the 20th. We headed straight home (a 45 minute drive), not paying attention to the time until around 1:00 am the next morning when we were nearly home.

Because someone local reported a very similar incident and on the same date and time I chose to report what I experienced, too. I was outside of my home in the driveway before 12:00 noon cleaning bird poop off my car, when all of the sudden I heard a very loud boom.  It sounded like the sonic boom from an aircraft.  The windows in the front room of the house also shook like they can with loud thunder.   I recall looking around quickly to see if anyone else was out to corroborate or if there was anything unusual in the area or in the sky when a second later I felt the ground beneath me shake.  It was a short rumble that lasted about one second.  I thought it was an earthquake because the ground definitely shook.  First the boom then the shaking.   I looked around and saw nothing unusual and waited several minutes to see if it would happen again or if something else was going to happen but nothing did.  I was surprised that neighbors who were home did not come out to look around because it was that impressive. The local fellow who reported a similar event on this same day and time was in Miramar which is a good ten miles southwest from where I live.  Amazing!   I know that they are dredging a tunnel in the port of Miami.  A neighbor said that because the ground in this area is solid coral rock it might be possible for the shock wave to travel this far, 25 miles!  I really don't know about that but I suppose it is possible.  What is odd is that the boom seemed to definitely be an above ground event. I have not known earthquakes to be preceded by a loud boom.  I would really like to know what happened.  If you have any information on this event please let me know.   Thanks.",2014-03-18T00:00:00,,

They flew in single file formation about 30-60 seconds apart.  They made no sound and had no strobes or other lights that you would typically find on commercial aircraft.  All five of the lights faded in a flickering manner and disappeared in the same location.  They appeared to be very high in altitude and might have been climbing at the time they disappeared.  I've been watching aircraft fly over Huntington Beach at night for more than 30 years and I've never seen a set of lights like these from this location.  I'm also sure they were not Chinese lanterns because they covered too much distance in a very short period of time.

We were hunting. Witness 1 asked me (W2) if he was looking at the ""evening star.""  I replied no it is to early after I looked to the SW evening sky.  He stated ""no over here"" and pointed to the NE direction.  I looked and explained I was looking at a jet which was climbing to the south from Portland, Or.  I asked if he was stupid for asking about a jetliner and W1 responded no over there! I looked in the direction he was pointing and noticed another jet passing under a blinding bright evening star looking object.  I was stunned to see a jet descending directly under the object.  From where I was standing the UFO was directly on top of my position of observation.  The distance from myself and jetliners was I would! say 30k in feet give or take a few feet.  The UFO was higher than that and I can only guess the distance from the aircraft flying right below it.  I am saying all object had to be in the 60k feet range, guessing at best.  I told W1 to ""grab glass"" and as I glassed the object with my binos I could not dial in a clear sighting. I remembered my Bushnell spotting scope 16x32x50 and was able to dial in a fuzzy disk which I could tell why it was sparkling by the sun as it was wobbling. As I dialed the spotting scope in tighter I was able see an irregular geometric shape on the bottom of the disk as if it was an exhaust port.  I passed off the scope to W1 and he looked and confirmed my sighting, turned called out that's it I am calling it is a UFO and I responded with nope IFO.  I asked W1 to fire up his camera and by the time we did that the saucer was no where to be seen.

This is the 3rd sighting for people residing in my home in 2013. Willamette Valley is hot this year!  What I am wondering is I know that if I was standing almost directly below and the airliners were right underneath as they passed the saucer could the pilots help but not see the craft.  There was no indication that they deviated off there flight path but flew right under the saucer both ways.  I am sure both jets were outbound and inbound Portland Or.

I got out of my car and right there in the intersection I'm filming this orange ball of light.  Zoomed in it was the same orange pulsating disc that almost appeared to be an organism, like it was alive, making small jumps, up and down and sideways.  I filmed until it got out of view.  There was a black Jeep to my left and when I noticed the window was open a bit I yelled to the two people inside""  Look a UFO"".  They were oblivious to the event but then looked up and said ""wow"". Now it continues to get crazier.  From the same exact direction, same altitude, here it comes again.  Orange ball of light to the naked eye...zoomed in, orange pulsating disc, no sound. It wasn't moving fast and wasn't moving slow, just a steady pace.  If it was on the road I'd say maybe no more than 50 miles an hour, if that.  And low and behold, behind the first one comes a second one, orange ball of light.  This time the jeep had left and there was a young girl in a subcompact sitting at the light. I yelled ""look at the UFO"" and she also looked up and said something.  WOW, people need to pay attention to their surroundings.  This second one was slightly lower than the first, silent, orange orb traveling in a SW direction. I filmed this one also.  These orange orbs did a flyover at Little and Ridge rd. at least 4 times. Later that evening around 10-10:30 pm while walking down Alico pass where it intersects with Starkey blvd. I saw two orange orbs flying low but this time they were pretty far away.  One was flying a little lower than the the lead one, and it soon disappeared from sight.  I did get video of this episode but it was far away and only for a few brief moments before it too disappeared from view. I'll put my hand on a stack of Holy Bibles what I'm saying is true.  This was the most exciting sighting I've had recently.  Actually, I've seen a few unusual craft in the sky lately.  Not sure why and I'm not crazy because video doesn't lie.  I will be making a short documentary about my sightings and posting on Youtube.  I'll let you know when this happens.",2014-01-24T00:00:00,28.24270049382716,-82.67723901234567

I was driving in a northerly direction, about 20 MPH, and saw lights moving in a southerly direction.  They were so distinct that I quickly stopped to observe them. So I'm looking to my left (west) and I see these strange lights moving pretty fast, not supersonic but I'm guessing about 720 mph.  (See below.)  They were 6 of them, in a formation that changed as they moved.  It initially looked like two in the lead, side by side, two following in a straight line between the two leading, and two more in the rear that were side by side.  The formation appeared to change as they moved along.  They appeared to come closer to the earth, then moved up in height and veered toward the west, disappearing into the night sky.  This whole thing took place in a period of maybe 2 minutes or less. I was cursing myself for not having my camera, which I almost always have, but then thought I might as well do what I can with the iPhone. They had a strange light that looked like an umbrella, actually more like an inverted U,  and they glowed with a bit of orangeness.  There was no flickering.  And they looked nothing like an airplane.  I wondered if they could be helicopters and cranked down my window and there was no noise, from anything, even on the ground.  There was no traffic and it's a quiet area of Portland.  Besides, I've seen many helicopters at night over the years and these were much higher (I'd guess maybe 1-2 thousand feet) and were moving in a way that was unfamiliar to me. I am including the pictures I took with my iPhone4S, with explanatory notes.  I have not edited these pictures at all. This first shot was taken at 8:35:27.  I don't know the source of the light pollution on the right of the picture.  The objects were heading southwesterly and beginning to ascend. This second shot was taken at 8:35:32.  An expert on speed/distance might be able to calculate the speed of the objects by comparing the movement with the times shot.  I'm guessing at distances but looking at the map, am estimating they would have traveled from an area around Windham, Me, to somewhere around Waterboro, Me.  in the approximate 2 minutes I watched them.  This would put their speed at 720 miles per hour if I'm right. The third shot was taken at 8:35:50.  Note the comparative distance traveled in 18 seconds.  Speed?  See above. This last shot was taken at 8:36:41.  This was 51 seconds later and the first two of the lights had ascended, moving towards the southwest, and disappeared in the night sky. Finally, the time from the first shot to the last shot was 1 minute, 14 seconds.  If they were traveling 720 miles per hour, this would mean they covered about 35 miles while I watched, including about 45 seconds before I started taking the pictures.  This seems approximately right. My background:  I have a Bachelor's Degree from a 4-year, accredited university and am 71 years old.  I am a professional photographer, and tried to copy pictures of the event taken with my iPhone.  I didn't have my DSLR with me.",2013-12-23T00:00:00,43.67350846153846,-70.2808476923077

The lights looked like they were part of a large full circle, but I could not see the full circle because of a roof hindering my full view of the sky.  They were slow moving, if I had to guess… about 20 mph, they were silent, and seemed relatively close, i.e., they seemed closer than a small plane would fly.  I remember staring at them from inside and wondering what they could be.  Finally, I stepped into the courtyard to get a better look.  I stared as long as I could until they moved over the roof and out of my sight. The direction it seemed to come from was northwest and heading to southeast... or just west to east.  However, I cannot be sure because I only saw a portion of the full circle (if there was a full circle.) There was a slight variation in the distance between each orange light, too.

Wasn't fluffy but rather short and precise, as if it had been drawn by a ruler. I continued to observe as it moved forward and began to descend diagonally at a fast pace, with a sharp descent. It was headed toward the flat top of a small mountain or very tall hill, approximately 3/10 of a mile away. As it got close to the ground, maybe 500 yards in the air, it appeared to tilt so I could see the shape and thickness of the craft just for a few seconds, and then it disappeared completely.  It just grayed out like a protective covering went over it. The shape when it tilted was modified triangle, with elongated dome on top.  Based on the shape shown for an instant, it possibly could have been an Air Force Stealth fighter, as I have seen one in 1990s, at an air show, near where they're based.  But there was something about its shape, platinum-like sheen, and quickness of movement that seemed completely unlike the Stealth. I wondered what was on top of that hill/mountain.  When the light changed, and I proceeded through the intersection, I looked back in my side mirror, when I got enough distance away to see that high, and it looked like a regular house up there. I also had gazed around while stopped at the light, and could see no one else looking up.  I concluded that the greatest likelihood was that this was an UFO.  No blimp could have looked like a precise line, nor could it have moved that quickly to descend.  \  this slash shows  the  direction and sharp angle of the descent. Ps.  On dec 5 returning again from Princeton, I noted that the hill/mountain had been flattened on top with no remaining trees.  All other viewable terrain was untouched mountains covered with trees or else commercially developed below tree line.  Where the craft descended was the only available field away from people and buildings, and without mountains and trees.",2013-12-23T00:00:00,37.391,-81.0417

It looked like several concentrated, ball-shaped fireworks had gone off but were just hanging in the sky and not falling or fading.  In the video you can see that the orbs come together, and form a tight triangle.  It looked to be like they were descending.  At the end of the video I enter a line of trees as I start to descend French Hill and the orbs can't be seen. They seemed fairly close to me, within a mile or two.  Low altitude, again, like fireworks.

At about 9:30pm on Christmas day  I was walking the dog in a northerly direction up our street and noticed at a distance what appeared to be a low flying plane or helicopter except that the light/s were very unusual (the sky was clear and the temp was about 60 degrees F).  It was flying at a low altitude about a mile or two in front of me in a SSE direction.  It gradually circled west and flew directly towards me from the east.  I figured it was a police helicopter or similar but there was no sound.  By this time I was returning to my house heading south back down our street when it flew directly overhead heading west.  I fully expected to hear some kind of engine noise but there was no sound whatsoever. It was mostly a bright red light and moving at about 75mph like the speed of a helicopter.  I witnessed this for about a minute or two until it disappeared heading west towards the coast.  I hurried back down the street to my house thinking how I was going to explain this to my wife.  As I approached the driveway I looked up and there it was again heading east to west but slightly north of me, not directly overhead.  I rushed in to the house and persuaded my wife and son to quickly come outside so they could witness it too.  Sure enough they saw it as clear as I did the first time and the three of us watched it fade into the darkness heading west. I figured it may have circled around twice but it is quite possible the second sighting could have been another identical object because I never saw it circle back from the first time.  I went and fetched my binoculars and stayed outside for a while but never saw it again.  It is hard to determine the size of it but the closest thing would be a helicopter. It was mostly red with hints of orange and yellow like a fireball but it flew smoothly and slowly like a light aircraft.  I am retired, educated and well traveled and was skeptical about UFO's until that moment.  I am still trying to convince myself it was a man powered craft but the evidence supports the UFO theory.

I was driving home with my three year old son and eight year old daughter.  On the right side of the sky, I seen a vertical curved strip of 5 orange lights distantly in the sky.  They stayed on for about 2 seconds.   Then on the other side of the sky I seen another vertical strip of 5 orange lights curved towards where the other lights were, light up.  Both sets of lights were the exact same distance away, they did not flicker or change their position.  They were a mirror image of each other.  My eight year old daughter asked me what they were.  I had no idea what to tell her.  The second set then went out and the first set came back on, then that one went out and the second one came back on for about 2 seconds, then went back out again.  Each time they lit up they never stayed lit for more than 10 seconds each time.  I pulled over turned on my flashers and watched and waited. There was no sound associated with these lights, a! nd the road was unnaturally empty of traffic and people, even considering the time of day.  Nothing happened, so I pulled back out behind the first vehicle I'd seen sense I pulled onto the road, a truck, and continued to drive.  Less than an eighth of a mile down the road the first set came back on again, same location, same distance for about five seconds.   The truck in front of me slowed to almost a stop and I knew that they had seen it too.  The truck then turned on its flashers drove slightly down the road some more at a slow pace, then pulled into a small closed restaurant and just sat there.  I drove by the truck slowly and the man had his head sticking out of his window watching the sky.  That was the last time the lights lit up and I continued to drive home stunned by what I had seen.  I have never seen anything I could remotely come close to calling a UFO, but I have no explanation for what I seen that night.   My three year old still talks about the lights in the sky and my eight year old fully believes that she saw angels that night.",2014-03-18T00:00:00,39.1669,-83.5655

I was in my backyard which is on the north side of my property.  I observed what at first I believed to be fireworks ascending from the west.  I observed a reddish glow with what appeared to be a yellowish fireball in the center.  Being Christmas I assumed that one of the neighbors had lit a firework, as they do on holidays. This light continued to ascend and moved in an easterly path almost directly over my backyard.  It maintained an elevation of approx. 150 feet and continued in an almost due east direction.  The speed of this object was slow, guessing about 10 to 15 miles per hour.  I observed this object as it went further away from me until it appeared to fade into the low cloud cover about 1 to 2 miles east of my location. The shape of this object seemed to be fluctuating a bit, but mainly appeared to be of a cylinder shape.  The description I gave to the local police was that it kind of looked like a red jellyfish with a cluster of 2 or 3 fireballs in the center of it floating across the sky. At one point as this object wavered there appeared to be lines extending from the top of the cylinder down the sides in a uniform manner.  Similar to the tentacles of jellyfish.  However there was a defined bottom to the lines almost like a veil. It almost appeared that the red aura was from the illumination of the center fireball cluster. I'm not sure of the size of this object, but I roughly guess that the top to bottom length was about 5 feet and that the diameter was about 3 feet.   Oddly, there was no sound detectable by me.

I saw a bluish solid circle of light hovering over the tree line.  It was hard to determine the size relative to the trees but as I was travelling 35 mph and it didn't appear to move...it seemed large and motionless.  I immediately felt apprehensive to the point of dread.  I told my passenger to look and as he looked up, the object shot down to the ground...which scared him and me too.  We went to the Allatoona boat ramp to see if we could see what had fallen out of the sky...but it was cold and creepy and we didn't see any evidence of anything out of the ordinary.

I have always felt safe living in this area, but now I find myself much more cautious...and now I'm keeping the gun close by. In relation to the moon, if the moon was a quarter the circle of light was a nickel. The brightness of the object reminded me of those annoying blue halogen headlights and was definitely not a natural light source.  It didn't look like any aircraft, balloon, Chinese lantern, or drone.   The moonlight made it possible to see that there was no other craft attached to the light.  It just hung there like someone shining a superbright flashlight into the world from somewhere else.   The object dropped at a speed that seemed inconsistent with falling.  It was so fast it was like someone ripped it down from the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2014-01-10T00:00:00,,

We were facing south and it was not near the sunrise. It was seen at dawn but it was almost daylight.  We were deer hunting and could see to the end of the 20 acre field it flew over with no problem. The glowing stopped before it went behind the trees so I assume it burn up or broke through the atmosphere.  It did not seem to fizzle out it just stopped burning and was still about the same size as when it started. The sighting lasted about 3-5 seconds.,2014-01-24T00:00:00,39.0245,-82.6212

So I went out to see what was up. It was noon and the sky was absolutely clear of clouds. I observed was a spherical object moving across the sky, coming from the SE, headed in a NW direction. It was moving at a steady speed, slower than a satellite, maybe as fast as an airplane that was REALLY high (so I am guessing around 500-800 miles per hour).  The object appeared to be higher than most aircraft fly around here, but still definitely within the atmosphere.  It was extremely shiny.  It glinted a lot as it reflected the bright noon-time sunshine.  The light it reflected was white, which gave me the impression that the object was silvery and metallic.  It was hard to make out any details other than light, but because it was so evenly reflective, it seemed like it must have had a smooth surface. The object moved at a constant speed across much of the sky, about 75 degrees above the NE horizon once directly overhead, all the way from the SE horizon until almost to the NW horizon, in about 5 minutes time, until it stopped and just sat in one spot about 25 degrees above the horizon for about 10 minutes.  It still seemed round and very shiny.  I thought it was a single light, but my husband and my daughter thought they could sometimes see two ""lights,"" very, very close together.  It glinted a lot, like the object or the surface was moving ever so slightly, even while seemingly standing still.  There was never a time when there was not light reflecting from the object; it just changed in intensity, like a silver beaded windchime blowing in the breeze (but without any visible change in direction). After a bit, the object started to move again, toward the South, at the same speed as before. It soon went behind my neighbor's trees, from my vantage point, and the object was so far away and it was so bright outside that I couldn't find it again.  After a bit, the neighbors lost it too and went back inside.  During the sighting, there were no other aircraft in the sky (which is not very common around here, since the Spokane Airport and Fairchild Air Force Base are only about 10 miles away). However, about 10 minutes after the UFO disappeared, I noticed two airplanes in the sky (with an obvious airplane shape to each of them, as opposed to the UFO), and both left distinct contrails. The UFO had left no trails at all, even though it was traveling at jet speeds.  The UFO did not give off any sound that was audible to me, but neither did those two airplanes, so it doesn't mean the craft didn't make noise way up high. If I were to guess, I would say this object was larger than a Boeing 747, but not more than twice as large.  After the sighting, it seemed like there was more airplane traffic than usual, but it may just been because we were looking to the sky more than usual. Again, we live close to an airport and a base, so airplanes are common in our skies.  The thing that makes this sighting stand out to me is the fact that the object had been moving in a NW direction, stopped and hovered in one spot for several minutes, and then started moving in a S direction. No airplane I have ever seen can hover like that, nor does it look round. Drones have wings or arms for rotors, so they should look more irregular than a sphere, and they shouldn't be as large as this was. No helicopter I have ever seen appears to be silver and round and that large when that high in the air (one would have been a speck). The ISS and satellites do not stop and then change direction.  I have never before seen a UFO and I was so shocked by this sighting that I watched, dumbfounded. I was worried I wouldn't be able to locate it again if I went for my camera, plus I wasn't sure if my camera would capture more than a glinty speck because the object was so far away. After the fact, I regret that I didn't dash quickly for my cell phone and get a video of this so as to share it with friends and family.",2014-01-24T00:00:00,47.68357629392971,-117.38633105431309

I saw a huge circular metal craft with lights on the bottom.  It silently was hovering over my side yard at a slight angle so that I could only see the bottom of it.  It was just above the poplar tree tops along the border of our property.  I got a very close up look at it.  The bottom was slightly convex and a matte colored dark metal.   There were what looked like semi opaque tempered glass panels on the bottom.  Similar to a bathroom window.  You can see light but glass is not transparent.  Those panels are where the amber lights emanated.  They were on constantly but yet had a slight pulsating flicker to them.  For some reason, although I don't know why, I thought it was due to the power source of the craft.   I saw it for approximately 15 seconds as it hovered silently.  Then, faster than I could blink my eyes, it took off at a 45 degree angle to the west.  I was so terrified and will never forget what I saw.

At that height stayed there stationary for 3-4 minutes.  Then it started to descend very slowly making an “s” shape back and forth motion. I thought it might be a firework but when it got down to just above the ridge line it stopped descending and made a more exaggerated back and forth motion.  It stayed in that state for 7 to 8 minutes. At this moment I could see the sphericalness to it and the colors of green, blue, and orange swirling around.

My daughter took the dog out to the side yard for a walk and came back in stating she had seen a bright orange, steadily-glowing ball of light moving slowly across the sky from approximately SSE (well above roof-level of houses across the street) and moving to Due East.  She said this movement took approximately 60 seconds. She said it then stopped and suddenly disappeared and reappeared several (roughly 20) degrees North and continued to move in a northerly direction at the same pace as before (she came in after another 60 seconds of watching it).  My estimation of the time is different than hers as I thought she had been out there for nearly twice the amount of time she claimed, so you can decide between the two or average it to 3 minutes total.

We have a hospital and helipad not 2 miles from our house (a few blocks east of MO-71/I-49 and a few blocks south of MO-58)and several small airports within 15 miles, so they are truly common.

I immediately attempted to confirm that it was an airplane, but no other lights or a structure was visible.  And if I recall correctly, the light did not appear to have the typical brilliance of aircraft lights, nor did it appear to be a craft just within the cloud layer, with its main light source diffused, and perhaps the other lights obscured, by the clouds, thereby giving it the appearance of a single light object; it did appeared as one object, i.e., an object of light, and I am quite certain it was below the clouds and not passing through, or thinly veiled by, them; so it was probably not the International Space Station.  It may have been a plane, but it seemed too close, below an overcast that was reflecting some of the ground-based lighting, for it not to have been discernible.  I did not perceive any sound emanating from it, either; from the beginning of the observation, I felt uneasy as I intently watched this light/object and sensed I was possibly witnessing somet! hing not man-made.  The quality of the round or oval light brought to mind the descriptions of plasma radiating UFOs.  I kept a constant watch to note if it stopped and/or changed directions, or perhaps pulsed, but it simply continued on its steady pace, becoming dimmer as it became more distant until it finally disappeared below the tree line to the northeast.  The observation probably lasted less than a minute. I estimate the line of travel to have been a line passing through the Tampa Bay area, across the northern Orlando area, which is where I was, and on out to the Atlantic Ocean somewhere between the Kennedy Space Center and Daytona Beach.

UFO Report  I am writing this down for the first time in my life.  I am 57 yrs old, these things I swear by all that matters are true and did happen to the best of my recollection over the course of my life in Corpus Christi, Texas. 1st contact with strangeness: 	The summer of 1967 was very hot, muggy as I recall.  One day in June or July of that year 3 men dressed in black suits, white shirt, black ties and black sunglasses appeared (actually I saw them walk up the steps) on my houses front porch at the screen door.  They knocked and stood very erect and still together.  They looked like candles as recall, they were not the same height, but they were very thin, tall and very white.  Their hair was white or blond and appeared plastered to their heads with wavy plastered curls on their foreheads. 	I came to the door and asked what they wanted.  One of them bent down and stuck his nose close to the screen door at eyelevel with me (I was 10 yrs old) and asked me…”where are your parents?”  I told him that my folks were away at work and he said….”Well, they should be home, tell them we came looking for them.”  This was sort of not done in a nice manner and rather scared me.  My big sister (she was 13 yrs old) and in her room, I backed away from the door and yelled out her name to come to the door.  They turned around to walk down the steps to their car, a long black Lincoln or what looked like a crown Victoria.  I turned to look to see if my sister was coming to door.  It took me 3 seconds, no less no more to do this and when I turned around back to the screen door to look down the porch at the men walking to their car to get in it, they weren’t there, they and the car were gone.  I never saw them get in the car, I never heard the car start nor did I ever see the car drive away down the street. Over the following years, I had 3 more strange events happen to me,",,27.717500161812296,-97.40525129449838

In September or October 1975, six members of my family and I were at the northwest edge of our 300 acre farm.  We were below the canal road skinning out two deer.  It was about a four mile drive from our house up the valley and along the canal road to this spot.  It was getting dark. As the guys were skinning out the two does, my cousin, sister, and I were hanging out near the car.  I noticed a car coming down the winding canal road.  I called to the guys that a car was coming.  We watched as the two car head lights came closer.  The lights came to the last curve just before where our car and pickup were pulled down onto our land off the canal bank. The lights did not go around the curve, but gradually rose into the air and continued to pass overhead.  I don't know how far past us or how high it went, but in just a short time the lights faded out and were gone.  We realized that we hadn't even heard any motor or engine running.  It was silent.  It may have been too dark, because we didn't see a vehicle or airplane body.  All we saw were the lights. A couple days later, the game warden came and fined my brother for shooting does during buck season and took the meat.  I don't know how they found out. We were at the north end of our property.  The lights came along the canal from the south going north.  We were standing facing east watching the guys taking care of the deer.  We turned to look south to watch for cars.  The lights left the canal road and were heading east when they faded out. My father had lived on this farm for 25 years.  My brothers, sister, and I had lived there since we were born.  My cousin had been living with us for about a month.  There were 3 brothers, 3 sisters, and my mom who were not with us at the sighting.",2014-04-04T00:00:00,,

On February 27th, 2014, at approximately 1930-1935hrs, I Mr. ((initial deleted)) and Ms. ((initial deleted)) observed two lights moving across the dusk sky heading in a northeastern direction.  We both had just arrived home and I was making an observation of the how there were multiple chem-trails in the evening sky that were going east to west.  This is not uncommon as we live in the north eastern part of Indiana and it’s a common occurrence, I believe we are on an air-route for Detroit, thus explaining the high volume of airplanes.  As we were searching the entire night sky I first observed the lights coming from the southwest and heading towards the northeast. What caused me to question these lights was the fact that they were moving across the sky in tandem, staying in what seemed a constant spacing and being in close proximity to each other.  I held my hand up and would estimate that they were two inches apart.  If the sky line is 180 degrees, we first saw them at about 120-130 degrees and finally lost sight of them at approximately 20-30 degrees.  My observations lasted between 3-5 minutes until I lost sight. Also the other strange observation that I witnessed was the fact that the two lights were not blinking as compared to all of the other 5-7 planes that were blinking in the night sky.  The first of the two lights was dim and the second light was twice as bright.  The second light also would flare up very bright, every 20 seconds or so. Thank you for your time.

Then I thought it could be a hoax, but then as the yrotated in fixed orbit with each other, the top most light ball, very rapidly went upwards and away from the other 2 lights, then the lower 2 lights leveled out to a flat plane, then as it became level with the horizon, a single red light began to blink between the 2 white lights that were left behind.

The objects didn’t seemed to be moving towards us after a few moments  but moving away maybe about a 90 degrees turn running parallel to the aircraft on approach to SLC and getting smaller but rising up still holding the original shape and color and still in tandem.  The objects were fading fast and loosing color while rising up going in the same direction as the jet liner on approach .

Approx. 2 miles off of Interstate 55 and exit 246 (""North Batesville""), numerous unidentified flying objects were seen.  Me and my Father were outside, and upon looking to the North (directly North), we noticed multiple lights over a vast field on the North side of Highway 35.  We immediately got our video camera and prepared to take video.  By the time we cut the camera on, and then got back outside to bein filming, the object(s) started moving.  They seem intelligent, as they began to span out as we started recording from our backyard. The objects move extremely fast and are much larger than an airplane.  The Panola County Airport is down the road a small distance and we see airplanes and helicopters all the time---  This was neither.  I have no knowledge of any aircraft that can go from a dead stand-still and move a couple miles within seconds.  And the G-Force would be unbearable, in my eyes. The objects also can stop on a dime and begin traveling in the opposite direction.  They are some form of intelligence. After getting a couple of video clips, the objects slowly vanished one by one.  They seemed to, flash and burn off.  It was at one point four different lights visible, all of which appear (through camera and binoculars) to blink a red, white, green/blue pattern.  The lights seem to move independently.  In addition, at the beginning of filming, we noticed a motor vehicle driver was stopped, facing North, on a road meeting Highway 35.  I believe he/she observed the lights also, but after a few moments, they left the scene going Westbound on Highway 35 towards Interstate 55.  Last year near this time, we experienced the same lights, and their was atleast 4 witnesses at that point. We were unable to capture video last year, and are and were shocked we captured the clips this year.

But I know what I saw, and so does my Father. And if you do not believe me, my video will prove, if nothing else, what we seen.

About a minute or less after I heard the loud sound in the sky, saw a bright falling thing that at first, I thought was a star I could make a wish on, then when I saw it was green I thought it was a plane going down.

I was skeptical to file this report, but was not skeptical at all about what I saw. I came into my kitchen a little after 3:00 am to smoke a cigarette.  I was immediately amazed at how bright the moon was, and how clear the sky was.  I was looking out the window through only a screen, and immediately noticed a twinkling light in the low western sky.  I immediately thought it was extremely bright for a star.  It was twinkling blue and white, with the intensity of lighting or magnesium being burned.  After about a minute, the object seemed to break into a tightly bundled grouping of about 5 lights, in almost a cross shape.  And then the object began to move. I immediately dropped my cigarette, and opened the screen on the window to get a better look.  The object started SLOWLY creeping west towards Feeding Hills and Southwick.  So whoever filed that Southwick report on here, I just want to say thank you.  And I'm with you, we definitely saw a UFO, and it was truly amazing!!  And I have pictures of it.  Albeit very crude ones, but when you zoom in on these pics, the object is a saucer shape, there is no question. The object then began to emit orange lights, as well as white and blue.  It was making strange vertical movements, meaning straight up and down in the sky profile.  This incident took place at 3:10 am, it was very cold out.  There was absolutely no noise, and the object moved slower than any plane could possibly fly.  I watched the object until 3:28 until it completely disappeared behind the tree line. I was not gonna report this, but have been monitoring this website the last couple of days to see if somebody else had saw it.  So again, whoever you are, thank you so much for filing that Southwick report.  You have no idea how happy I am that I'm not alone.",2014-01-24T00:00:00,42.0655,-72.6271

They caught our attention, so we drove in the direction of them, and were on a north/south street (Jackson). There we saw three, bright, round orange balls above us in the sky, moving from south to north.  They looked like they were about the height that a helicopter would fly.  They were a solid, bright orange, with no flickering, and made no sound.  They flew parallel to each other, came lower, then flew apart, went higher, then back together – we thought they might collide, but then they suddenly changed directions and flew off very fast.  One went northwest, one went northeast, and it looked like the third one just went higher in the sky.  There were a lot of trees, so we lost sight of the ones that went northwest and northeast, and the one that went higher in the sky disappeared from our view as w! ell.  We did stop our vehicle and get out, and as the “objects” flew, they were totally silent.  It was about 7:05 p.m., and the whole viewing lasted only a couple of minutes.  We didn’t get any photos or videos – we were actually too awe struck watching and trying to figure out what they were, and by the time I was in a position to take a video, they were gone.  So we continued around several blocks to Outer Drive, and headed east.  Over the trees along the south side of Outer Belt Drive, we saw one more bright orange light. It appeared to be somewhat higher than the others we had seen and was moving very fast in a straight line from south to north – I would say it was moving faster than you would see a plane fly.  We didn’t stop that time, as there was no safe place to pull over on the road in the dark.  I have never witnessed anything remotely close to this.  I searched online and saw a several videos posted by people who have experienced similar sightings in other parts of the country. I'm positive it was not a plane or helicopter or meteor -- it was something very out of the ordinary.  Drones? UFO’s?  Hard to tell…",2014-01-24T00:00:00,42.50055538461538,-96.37649128205128

I called the Ottawa airport and reported it to the air traffic control tower but they didn’t see anything in the sky.  Weird occurrence…  I checked in the distance and there was a plane but it was way too far away to create what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was about the same size as the moon and had two smaller circles of the same color that pulsated outward and then inward towards the object continuously.  The object was observed in the late evening  at around 8:30pm in the night time sky.  No sound was heard from the object. Upon having a conversation with this inmate about the UFO a few days later, a corrections officer local to the area overheard our conversation and called us over to mention that her daughter had seen the object and that many residents in the area had contacted the police department to report it.

The sighting occurred as it was getting dark in a wooded, acreage-residential area on Bridges rd.   The property was a couple of acres of clearing surrounded by stand of trees approx 30 ft tall.   The sighting and later occurrences still to this day bother me. Stepping out of the residence, facing what I believe to have been due North, a really distinct silence fell over the area.  No insects, dogs or any sound (very unusual many dogs and insects), the silence actually felt strange and was largely indescribable.   I stopped and began looking around, right above the treeline to our right (East),  probably within 100ft, was a black triangle with lights (not beams just small lights).  It was moving very slow, just barely clearing the tree tops.  So slow actually, that it should have fallen right out of the sky, it made absolutely no sound, there was absolutely no sound, period!  It was dark in color and had various lights, almost airplane like, except none flashing.  I cannot recall the exact color of lights that were present but they were multicolored, perhaps red, white and orange. I excitedly exclaimed to my friend to LOOK!  He exclaimed various swear words and amazement.  As I glanced at him I noticed that he was not looking in the same direction, as I followed  his gaze I realised that there was another craft dead ahead, slightly further away.  Both were headed North excessively slowly with no variation in course and appeared to maintain continuous distance apart.  We watched them until they were out of sight. I can't remember if all of the local dogs were barking before the silence, but after the craft were out of sight and the silence was gone, it was as if someone turned the mute button off and all the local dogs went nuts.  The insects of course were making noise everywhere also.   Right as we began debating whether this could have been  military aircraft, the roaring roters of multiple helicopters (not sure how many, at least 2 or 3) came in low, just screaming, headed dead on in the direction of the craft.  It was incredibly loud and certainly everyone around heard it.  If all speeds and directions of the parties were maintained they would have caught up quickly. I have spent time in Guam, Hawaii and Pensacola where there is a very large navy aircraft presence.  I have even seen a Stealth Bomber in broad daylight before they were generally allowed to be viewed (when Korea was lobbing missles in Japan's vacinity).  I have been around constant helicopter and hornet fighter traffic, I currently live in predator drone testing grounds and have been seeing those for years, saw one land recently (they make noise).  I have never seen anything like what we saw, especially the silence, every fiber of your being tells you something is wrong when the world shuts off like that.   I have never seen helicopters pushed as hard as that day either, I was afraid for the pilots.  Furthermore, I have common sense and understand general physics... at least as we know them. A couple of side notes.  I developed a nodule on my thyroid soon after the experience and I believe it to be related.  I would not approach or watch these things too long.  Furthermore, there were creepy occurences at the residence there for sometime after and maybe even still.

I was outside with my dogs when I heard a military jet.  Because of my rural upbringing, I still look up every time I hear a plane and since I'm 46 yrs old, I've seen a lot of different planes.  I know by sound what type of plane is flying over before I see it.  I live below the flight path between Duluth International Airport and the Minot North Dakota air base so there is a fair amount of ESE to WNW air traffic over my area, though most of it is pretty high in the sky. I could tell by the sound and the flight path that this was a military jet of some type and since it was about the time that there was talk of deploying more troops to Iraq, I'd been seeing and hearing military jets fly over more frequently in the previous month. I looked up in time to see the jet headed West and at the same time, a small red light caught my eye as it came from the South, perpendicular to the path of the jet.  The red light was the same size as the satellites that I see, and I couldn't see a definite shape.  The red light did a 90-degree turn to the West alongside the jet, and followed the same flight path. I have watched the sky all my life and know the difference between stars, satellites, and meteors, and this was like none of those.  I've even seen some meteors that were quite spectacular, including a double one that was bright green, and I knew that wasn't a UFO. I shoved the dogs inside and yelled for my husband, who had to bolt up a flight of stairs to get outside where I was, and he agreed it was nothing like he'd ever seen before.  We watched the plane and the red light until they were out of sight on the horizon.  The jet wasn't low in the sky, but a lot lower than the passenger planes that fly over this area, and even at night it was unmistakably military.  The red light kept pace with the jet the entire time.  I just kept on wondering what the heck it could be and tried to think of a rational explanation. I guess it was unidentified, it was flying, and all I can say is that I know what it ""wasn't"". Even if I'd had a camera on me at the time, it wouldn't have photographed well, unfortunately.",2014-02-07T00:00:00,47.3862,-93.3964

At first I thought it was coming from a power line following the same direction, but quickly realized it was not, and it was so unusual (I am an Aerospace Engineer and multi-engine rated Private pilot) that I had to pull over to watch it.  We both observed it for several minutes as it appeared to continually/slowly move South and increase in altitude.  When it was approximately overhead, it appeared to quit moving laterally but continued to rise until it was out of site.  We did not hear any sounds emanating from it and saw no other aircraft in the area.   I contacted the nearest airport's (North of the sighting area) manager the next day to ask if he knew of any aircraft departing the previous evening or of anyone launching a Chinese lantern from the airport area; he didn't.  I also Googled to see if I could find anyone reporting what I saw; I found nothing.  So, I laid it to rest, but was so mystified that I entered the date in my PC's calendar, so when I just discovered this website, I was able to check out reports for that date.

My UFO siteing occurred yesterday morning at 1:30 AM while just beginning of US-84 E/Hwy 84E (130 mi. from 2nd st.Exit)---a second siteing of the same craft occurred on the same highway 2 hrs.later 25 mi. from 2nd st exit(105 mi.from 1st siteing)..... Here's my story: I was driving from Reno, NV to Temple TX. (I had a 13 wk. medical Pediatric cardiac ultrasound job in Temple,TX. beginning  12/16/2013....I left Reno at around 10PM.... When I arrived at the above mentioned hwy.location..I noticed an ""EXTREMELY"" bright clear light about 45 degrees above the horizon flashing on and off consistently at 2 sec. intervals....Estimated distance from my location is at less than 3 miles.  I had a fully charged high end camera with me which has 1080i high definition video and (40X)ZOOM capabilities in case of an accident while traveling. I took out my camera and began a 25 min video consisting of ""MANY"" 40X CLOSE UP ZOOM SHOTS""...What the zoom shots revealed was:  1) The object was perfectly circular and pulsing consistently on and off extremely bright clear light flash pulses of light every 2 seconds.  There were random sporadic finger-like projections occurring at a rate of approximately 3 to 6 times per minute ! where streaks of light was projected equidistant from the center of the primary perfectly circular light center.  These additional light features created various geometric configurations ranging from pentagonal star formations to multiple other  nondescript star burst configurations....On multiple occasions smaller burst manifestations appeared to be taking up different- but proximal space simultaneously as if being in two place at the same instant....I kept zooming in @ 40X and out quite often during the 30 min. video....2)  In the 40X zoom mode I was clearly able to demonstrate an additional space craft unit attached (docked to), or may have been part of the non illuminating portion of the original craft. When the bright burst of light pulsed- a secondary connection could be seen as a result of the illumination...The connection is clearly demonstrated as being connected to the craft and the connection point is identified at the location of 9 o'clock on my video pics.The shap! e of the connection is cylindrical like a waste basket. To wat! ch and o bserver the  multiple finger-like highly illuminated projections from the central illumination was sensational...like 4th of July spectacular visuals.....3) The pulsing spherical object with connections at 9 o'clock remained in stationary, motionless orbit during the entire filming of the 1st siteing---There were two siteings: After 25 min.of the videoing the 1st siteing...I felt I had videoed all the features possible, so I put my camera away and continued my journey...Well,105 miles down the same hwy, (25 miles before the 2nd st exit), I saw the same object in the sky only now it was on the same hwy. only 2hrs and 105 miles later...It was the same object with exactly the same manifest ions....I  took a brief video documenting this later siteing. As I videoed the second siteing, the craft moved directly on an intercept course with me..where I was outside my car on the road.within a minute the craft had intersected my line of site and was now hovering in a stationary pattern! still 45 degrees above the horizon , but only less than 500 yards from my line of sight reference. It really appeared as if  it were preparing to land. I held my ground and prepared for any eventuality..It remained in stationary orbit at that location, Finally, as I turned onto and away from the craft to continue my route to Temple,Tx. where I am now. I could see it moving away in my front windshield....Bottom line: I have seen seen a UFO documentary....and I believe the craft I've seen and videoed has been seen on TV before...But now I have much greater resolution pics/video of it....Currently, Have 35 min. of high magnification with 1080i pixel definition quality definition of  a UFO which is for the first time irrefutable....This is the definitive link: I want to be paid $$$$ for this video. I have 30+min. video of it....I would like to sell it....Anyone interested in it?...I know any ID of the teller of this story is prohibited...but this is exceptional....The best def! initive video ever!!! !OK, I'll take an ""exceptional&quot! ; chance : my contact for this video is: userq9750@aol.com        userq9750@aol.com....highest bidder gets the video...REAL DEAL....",2013-12-23T00:00:00,,

I have seen military flares being dropped before and there was no question that these were military flares being dropped from an aircraft.  This was not the actual sighting, but I wanted to note that this was a little unusual as I don’t see flares being dropped often personally. At 6:35pm, literally about 9 minutes after seeing the flares being dropped, I observed to my left side (which was in a northerly direction) 3 bright, stationary lights in the sky in a semi triangular formation, which I estimate were at around 15,000 feet elevation.  They were very high in the sky.  At this time I had pulled into a gas station and was stationary and not moving while at the same time observing these lights.  The only reason it had caught my attention was that I had never seen a formation of lights in this manner shining so brightly, not moving, and completely stationary.  The brightness could be compared to the star Sirius, which is considered one of the brightest stars in the sky at night.  At first I thought that these 3 stars were stars/planets, and I was trying to figure out what constellation it was.  About 4 minutes later, the 3 bright lights completely dematerialized and were gone.  I was not able to track them moving at all, they just vanished without ! any trail whatsoever and  disappeared. That area of the city where I had observed the lights has no tall structures or communications towers that could have been the source of the lights, and I was not able to observe any FAA lights that are mandatory for all aircraft in US airspace.  That area is completely level, and the mountains are much further to the west.  The simply appeared as stars in the sky, and then they just vanished.    At this moment I am unable to attribute this sighting as any natural phenomena, as the formation and the brightness of the lights, and then observing them dematerialize was, to me, anything but natural.

We had just moved some furniture from Mt Shasta and were relaxing before heading back to his house in Redding.  I had witnessed many strange occurrences out there in the past; but this was by far the most unnerving and terrifying.  My senses were always heightened out there, way out in the woods, five miles out on a dirt road and 12 miles more to town on the highway.  My intuition told me to look out the window, and I saw a mist forming across the road about 20 yards away.  It was a warm summer night so this was unusual.  Over the course of about ten minutes, I looked twice more and the mist had thickened and expanded to about 3'x5' up on a dry grassy knoll at tree line.  It was not a full moon but the moon was bright that night. We decided to leave and when we went outside the mist had transformed into a chrome or steel colored, metallic, robotic looking, somewhat humanoid form.  It appeare! d to be sitting Indian-style in the grass. Sitting, it was still 5' tall. It had a barrel-like torso but not as round.  It had a head and a face, but is face lacked definite features. I immediately knew it didn't belong there and I freaked out.  I yelled at it, and told it that it did not belong there, and that it had better leave. I threatened it with violence.  I was too terrified to run inside and grab my shotgun, so we jumped in the old gmc pickup.  For clarification, I asked my friend 'do you see what I'm seeing?!  I turned to look at him and could only see the back of his head as he was looking out his driver's side window and said 'I don't know , I'm watching these ones over here'. I said let's get the hell outta here! He started up the truck and we high tailed it down the driveway, which turned right along the grassy knoll where I saw the first one. I looked and here is the first one levitating in its Indian style position towards us. It made lurching, lunging actions towards us but never raised any arms or anything; but it's face h! ad turne d into a terrifying metallic scowl.  I was yelling as I watched this thing through the passenger side window.  I told my friend, 'It's after us!  Haul ass!'  He stepped on the gas but the truck kept lurching towards the deep ditch on his side of the road.  It took everything he had to fight the wheel and keep the truck in the road.  This went on for about 300 yards down the road.  We drove fast for another 2 or 3 miles without incident. I told him to stop the truck just to be sure it wasn't a broken tie rod or something.  I inspected under the truck and found nothing wrong. We continued to hwy 299 and finally headed towards Redding.  Strange thing is, by now the sun was coming up as the sky turned from night.  Where did 5 or 6 hours go within a frenzied 5 mile drive down the dirt road through the woods?  The next day my girlfriend accused me if having a hickey on my abdomen just above waste line. I indeed had a mark resembling a birth mark or hickey about an inch wide by two inches long! .  It faded after a few days.  My friend refused to ever talk about that night again.  It was the most terrifying night of my life.

Then the light moved for a bit and in a couple of seconds all flew away in diferent directions, in a couple of miliseconds they were gone.",2014-04-04T00:00:00,,

I had an experience in 2006 that had a major impact on my view of reality.  I don’t tell many people about it, but thought that if it might aid your research that I would share it with you. On June 6, 2006, I went out into my back yard to have a cigarette.  I went outside at about 11:00 pm.  Three hours earlier there had been a thunderstorm that went through the area.  I am a bit of an amateur astronomer, and I truly enjoy viewing the stars at night.  On this particular night, the sky had been washed clear by the storm and the western night sky was gloriously filled with stars.  I remained outside to let my eyes acclimate to the darkness so I could see the stars better.  The arms of the Milky Way were solidly visible.  I must admit that I was a little excited. At about 11:25 pm, I noticed movement to the south about 20 degrees off of the ecliptic.  There were three white lights in the shape of a triangle, moving in concert from south to north.  I smiled, amused that the sky was so clear that you could even see satellites passing overhead.   Suddenly, the thought occurred to me that satellites don’t travel in packs of three.  Perhaps the International Space Station I rationalized.  Satisfied with this rationalization, I continued to watch the lights steadily traverse the sky.   As the lights reached approximately the center of Corona Borealis (although they were much higher in the sky), there was a brilliant white/blue flash.  The flash was elliptical in a vertical orientation.  The flash was so bright that it faintly illuminated the entire neighborhood.   I did a double take, unsure of what I had just seen.  I looked at the spot where the flash had occurred, and one light was continuing on the original trajectory to the north, at the! same speed as before.  One light had disappeared, and the third light had reversed course and was headed south.  It appeared to be (the best way I can describe it) “dripping” blue sparks and traveling in a jagging fashion.   I watched it in disbelief for about 15 seconds and then returned my gaze to the light traveling to the north.  Just as I acquired its location, the light sped to the horizon, covering roughly 1/3 or the sky, in literally the blink of an eye.  It disappeared beyond the horizon, out of my field of view.  I quickly looked back to find the light that was traveling to the south, and it was no longer visible. I ran into the house, excited at what I had just witnessed.  I was headed to the bedroom to wake my wife, but reason got the best of me.  What was I going to do, wake her out of a sound sleep to tell her that I saw lights in the sky that aren’t there anymore?  Logic settled in, and I returned to the back yard. I anxiously stared into the sky, sweeping the path that the lights had followed.  Nothing… I remained outside, enjoying the stars once again.  About 10 minutes later, two lights appeared, traveling along the same route as the original three.  They were side by side, and seemed to zig-zag periodically.   I figured that perhaps my eyes were becoming fatigued and that it was my eye movement that gave the appearance of the sudden jerky motion.  I used a 4x4 post on the deck for reference and watched them carefully.  They were indeed zig-zagging periodically.  There was no discernible pattern or time period that seemed to accompany the sudden jerky movement.  Perhaps these were satellites or the ISS I rationalized.   They continued on at about the speed and perceived elevation of a satellite.  The two lights continued, side by side, from south to north until about 10 degrees above the northern horizon.  Suddenly, both white lights glowed brilliant red and zipped off in opposite dire! ctions, one headed west, and one headed east.  Nothing else happened in the next hour, and I retired to bed. I realize that this is a little late to the party and probably won’t do you much good in your quest.  But I really did have to tell someone that wouldn’t judge me as some kind of whack job.  It was cathartic even though it probably wasn’t of much use.",2014-04-04T00:00:00,45.75458535031847,-108.50157707006369

To give a little background i was seeing strange lights in the sky for about a month before this date and would brag to friends that i was seeing multiple UFO's at night and at various locations wherever i was at.  I told a friend one night that i bet we would see strange lights at his house and what we saw that night changed out life forever.  It started at 9pm and we saw 3 strange white non blinking lights that flew through the night sky in strange directions then would simply vanish.  We observed these lights a few more times then around 1am we said lets look one more time for the lights then go to sleep.  Here is where the report gets very interesting and the real UFO appears.  At first we didn't see anything and thought maybe we should just go to bed, then we all saw a bright flash of light to the West in the sky.   We all asked each other if we had seen the same thing and then it happened again, only this time the flash appeared in the sky illuminating some very high clouds that seemed to appear out of no where.  Then in awe all three of us experienced one more bright flash in the sky and then three bright white stationary lights appeared behind the flash!  This flash would illuminate the sky and were owing from this disk shaped UFO with three lights at the top not flashing, and had a red and white chasing light that would flicker across this UFO.  Now the whole time this is happening, nature around us is going crazy! the birds at night are never loud and this night when this event was happening, it sounded like over 1000 birds were squawking and making loud sounds.  None of us could talk as this UFo started to slowly hover towards us at about 100 meters in the sky while never making a sound itself.  This continued for about 15 minutes then it stopped and almost at the speed o! f light vanished in the sky without a sound.  All three of us ran in the house after this happened and couldn't sleep.  We know we saw something spectacular that night and remember it to the day.  Also a strange side event was that i called my girlfriend shortly after seeing this and she picked up the phone immediately.  She was crying about a very vivid nightmare she had about alien abduction!  Now I had not told her what i saw in the sky that night yet so it was a very weird coinsidence that she had a dream about aliens.  I don't know but everything that happened that night was so strange and makes me wonder what is really out there that we don't know about yet!",2014-04-04T00:00:00,44.52863971962617,-88.04377663551402
Very strange circular craft clearly seen at close range by two people.,New Haven,VT,2009-11-13T22:00:00,circle,1 minute,"Occurred : 11/13/2009 22:00  (Entered as : 11/13/09 22:00) Reported: 3/30/2014 1:25:18 AM 01:25 Posted: 4/4/2014 Location: New Haven, VT Shape: Circle Duration:1 minute",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108199.html,"Very strange circular craft clearly seen at close range by two people. My girlfriend and I went on a date on Friday, November 13, 2009.  Directly after dinner, we drove to a rural but not uninhabited area to look at the stars.  The night was cold, so the sky was very clear.  We parked on the side of Hunt Road, a dirt road in New Haven, Vermont , sometime between 8:00 and 9:00pm.  There are houses and farms along this road, but we selected a spot where the road crests a hill, bends, and runs through a couple of wooded areas.  This helped to block any lights from nearby houses.  Hunt Road runs parallel to and one-half mile east of Route 7, a relatively busy 2-lane state highway and the main north-south road on the western side of the state.  With houses around, and a busy road less than a mile away, we were secluded but certainly not in the middle of nowhere. 	We sat on the hood of my 2000 Chevy Malibu and looked at the stars for maybe 45 minutes to an hour.  We saw several shooting stars during that time.  We got cold, so we decided to go home.  We got into the car, and we were talking about shooting stars. I turned on the vehicle.  Just as I finished putting on my seatbelt, I saw something off to the left in my periphery.  When I looked, I saw an object above the trees at about 9-o’clock, directly out the driver-side door window.  I would estimate the altitude of the object at around 200 feet, and it was at a distance of about a quarter mile.  I immediately realized that it was very strange, and that I had no idea what it was.  A part of me may have already thought that it looked like the descriptions people give of alien craft.  Almost as soon as I saw it I said, “What’s that?”   My girlfriend had already seen it, as well, and she said, “I don’t know.” 	 As I said, when I first saw the thing the thought immediately popped into my mind that it looked something like a stereotypical “UFO” with a few peculiarities.  I then had the realization that of course alien craft do not exist, or at the very least that it was very unlikely that I was staring at one, so I began to try to figure out what it could be.  An airplane? A balloon? A reflection? A remote-controlled toy?  All of these things were easily ruled out almost as soon as they came up, leaving me staring at the object as it passed from the driver-side window to the windshield.  My girlfriend and I were hurriedly discussing what this thing could be, but we kept coming back to  ‘What the heck is that?  Look how it moves.’  I don’t remember if either of us said that it looked like an alien craft, but I know that we were both thinking it. 	The thing passed in front of the car, and it became clear that it was going to go behind some trees.  The leaves were down and it was just a row of trees, so it would still be possible to see the light moving behind the branches, but we would no longer have an unobstructed view.   By this point the objects flight-path brought it closer, and it may have been one eighth of a mile away.  My girlfriend said, “Follow it!” I said, “Are you crazy!” It moved directly in front of the car, and I reached down and flashed my headlights at it four or five times.  My girlfriend said something like, “What are you doing?” in a way that implied that I was bringing danger upon us.   It began to move behind the branches just as I was finishing the last flick of my headlights, and then it abruptly disappeared. It should have been visible through the branches.  I stepped on the gas and sped past the row of trees, and behind it was an open field.  The craft should have been right there, floating over th! e center of the field heading toward the mountains, but it was gone.  There was not even a light in the distance.   We sat there scanning the area and the sky, which we had an excellent view of as we were on a hill.  The thing had completely disappeared. 	The object itself was shaped somewhat like a circular ibuprofen tablet.  It had flat sides and a slightly curved top and bottom.  The top was a very slightly tighter arc, and so protruded a little more than the bottom.  I believe the object was 40 feet in diameter.  Against the sky, the color of the object was a dark gray. I could see its outline very clearly.  I saw no evidence that in light the object would have been shiny, but I suppose that is possible.  I saw three rectangular lights on the flat sides that seemed to me to be windows. The lighted areas were completely opaque, and I could not see into the object at all.  The lights were all the same color, a very vibrant and yet very soft yellow.  The object did not spin around, but as it was moving diagonally to us I did see the light nearest the rear of the thing move more in front, and the light nearest the front moved around behind it somewhat due to our changing angle of view. 	The strangest aspect of it, and the thing that for me rules out almost everything except for alien craft was the way that it moved. I cannot describe it to you accurately.  It moved forward and up in one motion (in ratio about 2 or 3 parts forward, one part up), and it did this in irregular “spurts”.  The spurt would be a sudden motion…no acceleration at all, it was just suddenly moving forward and up. The spurts were very short, sometimes there were three of them in one second, other times there might be 2 seconds between them.  These are maximum ranges, as there was no discernible pattern or rhythm to the timing or length of the spurts.  In between these pulses of speed, the object coasted (forward and slightly down).  Again, with no deceleration period…the object was just suddenly moving slower.  It sounds as though that would look jerky, but there was an odd fluidity to it.  Put these together, and it did not move very quickly.  It did not coast as an airplane does. It lost al! titude slightly when coasting, but there was definitely something of a hovering characteristic to it. Its general speed was not constant.  The moment that there were three spurts in one second, the thing lurched forward maybe 100 feet, but it did this in a very quick, yet intermittent fashion that is impossible to explain. It was very, very unique.  It made no noise at all. 	After it disappeared and we were then unable to locate it where it should have been, my girlfriend and I agreed not to talk about it on the drive home.  The time was suddenly 11:00pm. I don’t want to say that we were missing an hour or two of time because I have misjudged time in the past, but we both wondered how it had become so late.  I do not believe I was abducted.  The plan was to get home, each make a drawing of what we thought we saw separately, and then compare.  Our drawings were identical in every way but one. I was under the impression that if we had seen it from above, it would have been a perfect circle, while she was under the impression that it would have been oblong.  The drawing of the object that I have included is the drawing I made that night, about an hour after I saw it.  The map I drew is very accurate and to scale.  Later, we researched UFO’s a bit to try to make sense of it.   What we saw certainly fits in with other UFO sightings, though I have not seen a UFO photo anywhere that fits perfectly with what I saw.",2014-04-04T00:00:00,44.1377,-73.1673

My mother was driving and I was sitting behind the passenger seat which was empty.  My little brother was sitting behind the driver's seat.  We were on the interstate 90 in New York state and we driving home, which was 3 hours away driving east towards Albany, NY.  Although it was around the fall, it was still day light outside.  The sun was lower in the sky but not near the horizon yet. When sitting in my seat, I was looking out the rear passenger window.  Then I decided to turn around in my seat and look out the back window.  When I looked out the back window I saw what looked like to be a big fancy building.  At least that was my first perception.  But when I looked at the bottom of it, I noticed it was hovering right over this farm area on the I-90 in the air.  It was at the height of a tall building that you would see in New York City.  This object was about 3/4 of a football field away from me while I was in the car. It was a crescent-shaped object that was the width of about 20 airplanes.  When you see airplanes in the sky they look small.  Now imagine 20 airplanes flying wing tip to wing tip. It was that wide, so wide that I could look under it and count the other three lights that were on the other side of this craft.  It was gun metal black and six curved lights on it.  They lights almost looked like windows but there was a glow in the air surrounding these window-looking lights.  There was also a ""black rectangular shaped intricate engine-y object"" that connected to the middle of the inside of this black metal looking crescent.  The middle of this rectangle had a curved gate the bordered around the middle of it. I sat there and watched this from the back window and the back driver side window.  When I was watching this it just disappeared out of the blue.  It just blinked out the sky, it did not leave any trail, nothing. I did not see it appear, just seen it disappear.  It was too huge to just up and disappear like that. I remember talking to a math professor at my school about my sighting and he said that maybe it could have been a mirage but that mirages were not common in that weather condition during Autumn in November.  That day it was cold, no rain, just a little windy Autumn day.  The sky was a little gloomy, not sunny at all but not dark outside either. I know I saw an object, I was freaked out and at first I didn't want to believe what I had seen.  When it disappeared, I just turned around in my seat and sat there silent for 5 minutes in shock.  When I turned back around to check to see if I could see it again, it was gone.    When I got home, I took notes in my iPod about what I had seen and came to realization about it.",2014-04-04T00:00:00,42.66599931506849,-73.77961926369863

I am a 44 year old female. I have attended several years of college, but received no degree. I receive SSDI and do part-time care for an elderly shut-in woman.  This is my report of something I witnessed from the back door of my home. It was the middle of July, 2011.  I had been quite sad and frustrated and was home alone crying.  It was a nice night so I had the back door of my trailer open for fresh air. The door faces west and I have a wide viewing of the night sky there.  I also live a ways out of town so there isn’t much light interference. It was between 1 and 1:15 a.m. when I got up and stood in the doorway, leaning against the door jam.  My cat came outside and sat on the porch. I cried and started staring at the stars. It struck me that they didn’t look quite right, but was very self-oriented and didn’t think twice of it.  After about 10 minutes, I had stopped crying and was again staring at the stars.  A weird movement to the left of my peripheral vision caught my attention.  I couldn’t see anything, so again I dismissed it and thought that my eyes were just blurry from having cried. I went to get a cigarette about 1:45 then went back to the door jam and watched the stars again.  That’s when I saw a strange sort of wave in the sky almost due west. It was like seeing 2 or 3 quick water ripples.  I thought I was seeing things so I looked closer at that area of the sky.  I know the basic pattern of the stars I can usually see and the ones I did see didn’t look right.  They were in more of a grid pattern, all seemed to be the same brightness, and they didn’t seem to twinkle.  I suddenly had an overpowering, anxious, panicky feeling that I was being watched.  I looked around at the neighbors trailers, but there wasn’t anyone outside or in any window that faced me.  I then felt a strange electric sensation that made the hair on my arms and scalp stand on end and my fingertips tingle.  My cat got up and quickly ran in the house. I looked up again and was watching this grid pattern. It was if I was transfixed.  I couldn’t look away and I felt as if I was in slow motion.  I don’t know how long I stared. Then, I can’t say that there was a definite shape to the area, but the stars I was looking at started to shift like they were all slowly moving in unison.  It wasn’t a big shift, but it definitely was between 15 and 20 degrees.  It took 20 to 30 seconds to complete the rotation.  When they stopped, my field of view of the sky seemed to look closer to the normal constellations I see and the grid pattern was less pronounced. I stepped out onto the porch to see more sky and tried to see if the area had a shape I could see. I couldn’t find any edges or darker, shadowed lines. Again, I felt the electric sensation and the tingling. I remember looking down and blinking several times and shaking off the sensations. When I looked up again, the stars looked normal and I could also see the lights of an east bound ! jetliner high in the sky. I remember having the distinctly clear thought “Go inside. Shut the door. Sit and watch some TV. No one will believe you.” It was like someone had told me this because I heard it in my mind. I blankly did such. It was going on 4 when I realized that I had been sitting on the end of the bed staring at the TV instead of in the middle where I usually sat. It wasn’t until then that I even thought of the strange things I had seen. Initially, I thought the unusual ""stars"" were more along the lines of government “Star Wars” satellites.  That would explain why they were all the same brightness and in a grid.  I recalled that when I had first gone to the door, there was the noise of frogs and crickets, but after feeling like I was watched, I don’t remember hearing anything.  I never heard a sound like an engine or felt any extra air motion aside from the gentle breeze that had been blowing.  I thought that I had just been lucky enough to see the distant satellites change formation in order to do whatever “spying” or weapon exercises they did.  It wasn’t until March of 2014 that I heard of “star-field cloaking” that some UFO’s have been reported as using.  Now, I question if it wasn’t something like that that I witnessed.",2014-04-04T00:00:00,42.68318214285715,-89.04936428571429

All of a sudden we pull onto a dead end (no outlet) road and saw something bizarre. There were about one hundred deer in the last yard on the left.  The man or woman in the house were looking out into their yard.  We all felt that it was odd seeing so many deer at a time.  Most of the time we would only see deer while they crossed over the loose asphalt.   As we pulled a 180 degree turn in the dead end is when we all saw what was in the sky. There was a bright light but not bright enough to hurt your eyes which was stationary in one place.  As we kept driving, the road came up to a fork and we took the left.   We were traveling pretty slowly around 15 – 20 miles per hour.  The light was still as bright and in the same spot. The next amazing event was that the light shot off in the direction we headed to the right of us.  The altitude of the light in the sky was about 35 or 40 degrees.  Then POOF, it was gone.

We have lots of coyotes around here, and when the pack comes through our yard the dogs have a very distinct way of responding to them.  When they bark, they sound stern, gruff, and assertive.  This was nothing like that. They were snarling and shrieking at a fever pitch. Canine hysteria.  Looking up in the northwestern sky, I saw a bright orange “star,” once again out of place in the stellar grid.  Within five seconds it started to move, heading south and then southeast.  The faster it went, the brighter it became.  Then I saw a bright white flash roughly 15 degrees due west.  It was the shape of a massive halo, and there was a tiny white pinprick of light in the center.  It started to pulse like a camera flash as the orange light passed before it.  This caused the orange light to accelerate, freakishly fast.  The halo continued to pulsate, about once every three seconds for around 30 seconds, while remaining stationary.  Each pulse of light remained visible for just a fraction of a second, but it never wavered or decreased in intensity.  It was more luminous than a full moon. At this point, I ran inside and told my Dad:  “Come look at the UFOs!” He came out immediately.  I brought a monocular and we watched the orange light race across the sky, heading southeast. The white halo, however had disappeared.  As I was telling my dad what it had looked like, he pointed out another “star” which started to move.  At first it was white, and then turned orange, following the first light on a southeastern trajectory.  When they disappeared, we were left listening to the dogs howling and snarling hysterically. At about 7:10 my dad went to bed (he gets up early), taking our dogs in with him.  I stayed out, scanning the skies for anything unusual. By 7:15 the skies were being crisscrossed by a total of six aircraft with orange strobe lights.  It was roughly the same color orange as the UFOs. However, there was a distinct difference.  The UFOs were faster, they could remain stationary, they changed colors, and they displayed no strobe flashes.  Two of the aircraft flew in single file from north to south, two side by side from northwest to southeast, and two in single file from east to west. At 7:30 PM while looking southeast, I saw two orange lights pass through the constellation Orion. I cannot say whether or not they were the same ones my dad and I had seen moments before.  Both were firing (or emitting) white beams of light (this may sound silly, but they were just like the laser beams you’d see in Star Wars, only white).  I don’t think they were meteors because they emanated directly from the orange lights.  One was in close pursuit of the other, and it looked like they were firing on each other.  After four of these beams were fired in quick succession, the big white pulsating halo appeared in the center of Orion and flashed twice.  Once again, it was brighter than a full moon.  After the second flash, the two orange lights rapidly diminished to white, then became invisible.  The halo never pulsated again.  The dogs on the neighboring farms were still howling and barking hysterically.  I was left feeling stunned, then overwhelmed.  Then I wept, which is not something I do on a regular basis.  By 8:00 the dogs quit howling.  It was a windy night and I was unable to sleep.",2014-01-10T00:00:00,44.9867,-96.3726

So here is my story:   Sometime between 1984 and 1985 - when my twin brother and I were either 9 or 10 years old – we saw a massive, bright orange object in the sky.  Sorry I am so broad on the years – I am almost 40 now but I know it was in that time frame.  We lived in Stamford, CT on the Darien line (which is East of Stamford).  It was an August night around 9 pm and there was a meteor shower that night, but the odd thing was the meteors were red balls zooming from the North toward the West.  For some reason I remember counting 13 of these red balls. For some strange reason after the red balls stopped my brother and I were drawn to the edge of the driveway toward the street.  At the same time we both looked up to the East and saw this MASSIVE, bright orange object hovering in the sky fairly low – just above the tree line.  The shape from our perspective was disc-like.  We stared at this massive object in disbelief, but then my brother asked me, “Is that the moon”?  As soon as he asked that question this object shot to the South towards NYC and flipped end over end until it disappeared behind a building and into the horizon.  As a note, when the object zoomed toward the south a blue/green electrical charge emitted from the ground.  My brother and I were completely speechless.  In fact, I don’t think we ever talked about that incident until I recently brought it up to him. A few days after this experience I remember my brother saying he had a dream about watching a UFO fly away from our bedroom and into the clouds. Since this incident I have seen many strange “lights” in the sky.  Most of the “lights” I see in the sky are crystal blue in color and travelling way too slow to be a meteor and silent.  I have showed a friend the “lights” and when my twin visited from Australia I was able to show him.  These events occurred from June 2010 to present day at my mother’s home in Stamford, CT.  The lights would usually appear from the North/Northwest and travel southeast, but the insane thing is the light would disappear above her house! I appreciate your time and maybe some other watchers have seen what my brother and I have seen.  Or maybe we have some kind of connection with other worldly beings?

I believe I was about 6 to 8 years old, my sister was about 12 years old and my brothers were a year younger and a year older then me.  The traffic was light and the sky was clear and bright enough that the cars did not need to have there headlights on. When we were probably about 2/3 of the way across the bridge, my entire family other than my parents recall seeing an extremely large light green glowing orb hovering above the bridge and so close to it that we all remember my sister screaming because she thought this orb was going to hit the bridge and knock it down.  This entire sighting lasted probably no longer than 10 seconds and no one remembers observing this orb flying away as it just seemed to disappear. An explanation as to why my parents who were in the front seat did not observe this orb is possibly because my sister and I were seated in the far back of the station wagon which were rear facing seats and that orb did not appear until we were 2/3 of the way across the bridge and it was behind when it 1st appeared.  My parents remember everyone screaming and yelling about what we had seen and they clearly remember the incident. This orb had no distinguishing marks and the entire family agrees that it was not the moon or the sun. As for the size of the orb, I would say at least 300 yds in diameter and I might be underestimating it by quite a bit.  The distance that it was from the bridge I would estimate 300yds or maybe even closer. This incident was never discussed again until about 20 years later at a family reunion when someone brought up ufos and for some reason we all remembered the incident like it happened yesterday. Without a doubt there had to be numerous other witnesses to this sighting because of the clear day, the size of the object and how close it was to the bridge.

IN 1971 I was a DJ at local radio station in Moultrie, Ga.  A week prior we had damage to the control room so we rented a 40' mobile home to broadcast out of until repairs were complete.  It was parked about 10' from the back door of the station were the all the power supply were kept.  Back then, the meters had to be read and written down on the hour and half hour. I remember it was 9 pm.  I announced the call letters, put on a 45 record, grabbed my notebook and proceeded out the back door of the mobile home.  As I opened the door, i looked up, then dropped everything I had.  Above the mobile home was a bright cigar shaped object with different colors going all around the outside perimeter of the object.  I could't tell where one color stopped and another color started.  It was as if they blended perfectly.  No sound was made from the object and if hovered just a few feet from the top of the mobile home.  If I were standing on top, I could have touched it with ease.  It scared me so bad I raced back inside to the mic and made the announcement.  Cars begin to pull down the 100 yard lane off the main highway that lead down to the station which was blocked from the main highway by a tree line.  By this time I had returned outside and had joined the gathering crowd.  At first it moved up slowly about 200 feet and stopped.  Then repeated that same move.  On the third time it went up about 100 more feet and took off at a slant so fast, all we seen was a flash trail from it. Everyone stood still for a moment, then started talking to each other and finally left.  I went back inside and told again what we had seen.  I was told a few days later by three men who came to the  station that it was just a weather balloon.  The local newspaper did a story the next day and that was the end of it.  I know what I saw.

It was a cold, clear, crisp night with very little cloud cover.  The only clouds I remember were high altitude wispy clouds sparsely scattered.  There was light enough from the moon to be able to walk in the field without worry of stumbling or getting hurt tripping over things.  It was late November I remember but cant be sure exactly of the date.  We were far enough away from town so we didn't have any light pollution.  The sky was amazing that night for skywatching.  To the northwest we could see the grand island airport tower light rotating from blue to white as it spun.  From our position I observed a craft that had red and white running lights.  It hovered like a helicopter and must have been between 10 to 20 miles to our north and perhaps at a 45 degree angle from us.  It hovered and moved similar to a helicopter for a minute or so.  It stopped moving and started to change colors.  It turned from blinking red and white to solid blue then purple to red then blue.  It was very bright like strobes.  I knew by the way the colors shifted that it wasn't a helicopter or other aircraft that could be in our area.  It was too far away to make out a shape.  It turned solid bright white and started to make perfect horizontal patterns across the sky at extremely high speeds. It traveled almost three quarters of the horizon in less than a second and did this at least eight times .  When it stopped to travel the opposite direction it did so abruptly without delay .  When it finished its horizontal travel it hovered in the general area of its position .  It changed colors like it had previously for around 30 seconds .   It then started to travel vertically in the same fashion it had during its horizontal movement.   Extremely fast and stopping abruptly.   The g forces had to be extreme.  It moved in perfectly straight lines.  After about 8 movements up and down it hovered in its original position for maybe 10 seconds and shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.  I have been to many airshows and have always been an aircraft buff.  I have never seen anything like that object before that night or since.  My friend who was there is a mechanic for Cessna experimental.   We discussed this sighting and have come to a conclusion that it was something that couldn't have been manned considering the speed and g force involved.  It also made no sound from the time we first saw it to the time it shot into the upper atmosphere out of sight.  No sonic booms, no engine sound.

There were three times I had seen UFOs in the literal sense of the word because I did not know what they were.  To this day, I still do not know what they were.  I had not seen anymore since I had seen the last one.  I would love to know what the three bright dots in the sky were if they were actually alien UFOs or not. On March 9, 1996, my parents went out and I was home alone.  I went out to have a cigarette at 9:05pm.  As usual, I looked up in the sky and saw something very peculiar. I saw a glowing orange dot between Canis Major and Orion Constellations.  At first, I did not know what it was so I thought it was a star.  I saw it move southward so I thought it was a planet, but it was moving fast to be a planet.  So, I had thought it was either a US military plane or a UFO (which it was in the literal sense of the word).  After a few seconds, it just vanished.  I had always wondered what it could have been. I told my parents about it and they laughed at me about it. I told few of my friends about it and one or two believed me. A year and a half later so it was summertime, a friend and I went to my parents’ house to visit my parents.  We decided to go out to have a cigarette.  We came to an opening in the fence that led to the pathway and the train since my parents lived by the train station.   When we got to the opening in the fence, I saw the glowing orange dot in the sky again and told my friend to look.  We both saw it and it was moving east, instead of south. Like the first one, it also vanished.  We were very puzzled and wondered what it could be. I told him that I had seen the same thing a year and a half ago. On December 26, 1999, my parents and I went to my father’s best friend’s house in Minnesota. I went out for a cigarette and as usual, I looked up into the sky.  This time, I saw a very bright white dot in the sky.  I knew that it could not have been Venus or Jupiter because it was too bright to be a planet.  I was wondering what it could have been.

Wat blew my mind tho was the fact that it was a shinning golden pyramid, I could clearly see the lines that outlined each block massive blocks of gold and at the bottom of the pyramid i could see wat was 3 circles positioned as a triangle where fire was coming out of them.

She went outside to see what could be causing these animals to become so disturbed.  She immediately observed a large triangular craft hovering what she thought was east of Emmett, Idaho (at the time she lived approximately five miles west of Emmett).  She observed the craft for about 30 minutes as it simply hovered.  It gave no rotor noise or other prop or jet sound, but she heard (and had the sensation of feeling) what she described as a ""humming sound""--as though considerable energy was coming off the craft. She observed three white lights near each tip of the triangle and a red light in the center.   She also observed small orbs leave the bottom of the craft and fly away.  She had the presence of mind to video the craft with her cell phone, and while the video is not of the highest quality, one can certainly see she captured a strange craft. My daughter is in her mid-thirties, the mother of two children, a housewife and a primary school teacher.  She finally went back to bed; however, she told me of the event the very next day and provided me with a copy of the video.  I am a retired ((rank deleted--senior official)) (Army National Guard). I immediately contacted a particular deputy sheriff that I know and showed him the video.  He indicated that this type of craft comes often to the Emmett Valley, as he has seen it several times while on duty during the ""grave yard"" shift.  On one occasion the deputy said he called the Boise Air Traffic Control Tower to ask if they had a craft hovering over the Black Canyon Dam, east of Emmett, to which the person on the phone replied in the affirmative.  The deputy asked the person if he could tell him what kind of craft it was. The deputy was told that the Tower would get back to him.

It was moving fast, and I thought that maybe it was a plane flying into Mexico; but I haven't been able to find flight records for 01/16/2014 to indicate a flight route that far West. I also couldn't see a metallic gleam that would resemble a plane. My mother and I tried to call the non-emergency line of the police department to inquire about the object, but we couldn't get through.

I was very curious about it, because it seemed be coming in slow and then picked up speed. Whatever it was, I assume it was heading towards Mexico.

I was walking my dog, as I do everyday between 3-4 p.m. in the afternoon, and was approaching the dog trail in my neighborhood.  As my dog stopped and sniffed around, I looked up and saw an emerging vapor trail from a jet up in the sky.  I observed the jet for a moment, only to realize a disk-shaped object appeared to be tailing it.  The disk appeared metallic but shined white at times, I assume, from reflecting the sun.  I watched for about 20 seconds as the jet and the object continued in a westerly direction.  The object had no visible vapor trail behind it.  After watching the disk follow the jet, I observed a second jet with a vapor trail closing rapidly in an almost-perpendicular angle towards the first jet and the disk.  As the second jet closed in, it appeared that the disk changed its course by about 25 degrees and continued for about 10 seconds until it was out of sight.  The second jet appeared to continue its path towards the first jet until they! were no longer visible. The next day, I again was walking my dog around the same time, this time towards North Branch Park.  As I crossed the bridge into the park, a white Chinook helicopter appeared and began hovering in the airspace above the park.  Having been in the military, I realized that it was not a military Chinook, nor was it a rescue Chinook since it was white in color.  It was not being used for any type of commercial lifting operation and I could not figure out why a Chinook would be hovering above this park.

Last night I was sitting in my living room watching tv.  I don't like having the lights on in the house when not necessary; so they were all off.  My fiance and son were in bed.  My couch was facing a large picture window that looks out onto our front yard. We live in the woods. As I was watching my television show, I noticed a dim flash of orange outside that came from over the tree tops and was bright enough to light up the surrounding trees yet not super bright.  I jumped up and looked outside the window but there were no cars.  The flash came from above anyway and I have seen many car headlights come and go from our neighbors and they cannot and do not illuminate our entire yard and up to the top of the 30 ft. trees we have. There was no sound and no sign of any aircraft.  I opened the front door and the only sound I heard was that of the wind moving through the tall thin evergreens and those trees crackling as they swayed in that wind.  If it had been the spotlight from a helicopter, it would have been bright white, like an LED bulb.  I've seen those many times.  And I would have heard that helicopter.  Like I said before, there was no sound at all.  And it was not bright enough to have been a spotlight anyway.  It was a somewhat dim flash. I don't know what it was that I saw and I'm not going to try to overthink it.  I'm just putting it down here for you to consider because we had an experience two nights in a row some days ago that also included bright (at the time even brighter) orange flashes that illuminated our yard.

After scanning the sky it was evident that nothing could be hiding behind clouds, as there were none in the area where the object was.  I would estimate at the time of disappearance, the object was at about 5000 ft.  I am a Mechanical Engineer and consider myself of sound mind.  What I witnessed this morning has left me perplexed.

The first thing I noticed was there was a vertical smoke trail in the sky, the kind of trail which you see when a jet plane leaves behind in the sky.  And the object making the trail looked like a bright white  orb. This vertical trail I could see from the top of the sky.  The object was going vertically down to land , crash or whatever.  I waited long for it to emit a bright flash which I believe would have confirmed to me that it was probably a meteor.  While this was happening I saw something extraordinary.  Another object which appeared diamond shaped,very bright appeared and was moving horizontally near the orb moving downwards.  This diamond shaped object did not have leave any trail of any kind in the sky and appeared to be moving significantly faster than the one moving downwards.  I can not say how close these objects were to each other.  The diamond shaped object was visible for about 5-8 secs and then disappeared.

Nothing side to side or eratic just moving forward at a speed like a plane would heading in the same direction. When I came to a complete stop the light was blocked by the roof of my car along with the stars.  My upper peripheral catches movement again as the light moves from out of the blockage of the roof and I look up.  At this point my eyes are locked onto this light, no more peripheral.  You can see movement out the side of your eye and it could be anything but when I locked eyes on the object I saw it was too high to make out a shape with no blinking lights of a plane but low enough to know it wasn't a star, and it was moving.  Any sound that the object might of had was block out by music. After maybe 3 seconds of looking at the light I seen it cut real hard and fast at an angle away from earth.

Last Sunday night (9/1/13) - I stepped on to the back porch around 8:pm to get a breather, fresh air. Sitting there enjoying my peace, two glaring lights lit up the clouds and I thought - wow - a 747 coming in to land a Logan International Boston.  (Note: I reside in the rural country side of Rowley, MA)  However, the lights got brighter making random motions in the sky and were much too large to be any sort of aircraft (well a thought for the moment) but, within seconds, the entire fields in back of my apartment were lit up as though spotlights had blasted on.  Also, two huge objects appeared in the sky equal distance apart and stationary.  Just kind of stayed there. Being a former military pilot, I know aircraft and I also know how the eyes can play tricks on anyone watching planes at night, helicopters, flares etc.  But, these two objects eventually came to a stand-still , were huge - and stayed in place - not moving - lighting up the entire area – appearing as mother ships.  (My best description for the moment) My first thought - if these are 747's - their on a parallel ""approach course"" to Logan and not good.  Next, if they were landing lights on (2) 747's they do not rotate and flicker - they're constant.  To, rarely do commercial aircraft enter a flight pattern over Rowley as directed by ""air control"" maintaining a certain altitude and omni/IFR heading guiding them to the airport. Last, generally the altitude is such that they’re not too low should an emergency occur for evasive landing or what we call ""go around"".Yet, there sat these huge objects with rotating lights underneath lighting up the entire sky with a bright white. Making matters more interesting - the entire back porch was lit up as though I was under a spotlight - focused on me.  It was the weirdest thing to have happen however, I concluded these are real UFO's Not to sound foolish but, I ran in to the apartment and grabbed my camera and camcorder and tried to get as many photos as I could.  The camcorder played tricks and worse yet, the two huge objects remained stationary – motionless – no noise. The two ships stayed in position - bright lights flickering. One more object appeared (small organge Orb) and scanned the fields behind.  At the same time, one of the larger ships moved across the Plantation complex lighting the area then returning to its original position massively dwarfing the house directly across the street from the senior residences. (The ship – estimated to be about the size of the complex in its entirety).  It remained motionless without sound - lighting the entire area while the other (ship) remained in it’s original position. From the back porch, one of the ships climbed approx. 1000' over the house across the street, which gave me some sort of dimension.  Next, the ship shot to the sky in a split second whereas a bright orange orb dropped from the larger ship’s exit moving over the houses, spot lighting the fields, in such a erratic pattern that I was trying to keep the camcorder on it.  Then, the bright orange orb dispersed about 10-12 smaller orbs which within 2-4 seconds had made a complete sweep of the area.  Then all shot up rejoining the larger orange orb which remained in position..  The sky lit up a bright white, the larger orb remained behind and began to move closer to my direction on the back porch.  There, it remained motionless within perhaps 20 yards of me and emitted kind of a dull, hazy white beam on my position on the porch.  Meanwhile, a car approached on the adjoining road in which the orb backed off and began to chase the passing vehicle – returned and assumed it’s original positi! on in front of me.  The orb itself often changed size but in addition, scanned the lower portion of the apartments below (I living on the second floor) emitting a bright white light which was almost blinding then, backed off slightly raising its position and now it became a “classic face off”.  Thereafter, the orb (rather large now) moved across the street and shot directly upwards in incredible speed.  I’d estimate a split second.  Fortunately - I have it on video.  The camcorder picked up the huge orange orb hovering over the houses, fields etc. - at almost road level.  At the same instant, the 2nd ship which had remained motionless during the duration followed a similar maneuver – shooting straight up into the sky/clouds (being a slight overcast) which allowed me to observe a distinct “hole” formed in the clouds, the clouds “rolling” – as boiling – where the ship had departed.  The large orb followed – exiting the same path of the large ship.  I know this is a bit strange but, seeing these objects was amazing and profound.  We hear of UFO's and there's much debate as to they're existence and being a computer guy and engineer - well – I had my doubts about much however, this is the first time that I saw something up hand which was more than incredible. You might see one I suppose and not knowing what it is - well - it becomes a UFO however - when the whole ""freaking"" family shows up - you have to wonder. There are too many scientists, people of knowledge that have presented evidence but, then again you say - we haven’t caught one yet??  To that they say - yes we have.  Where do you go with it and is there substance?  From what I saw - I'm a believer now.  The video: http://unexplained.co/videos/ufo-videos/bright-unknown-orb-filmed-over-rowley-massachusetts-1st-sep-2013/2299/   I will admit that thereafter, I did suffer some rather disturbing “physical effects” from the encounter of which can be testified for.  As mentioned, the orange orb and myself had somewhat of a standoff – it being within perhaps 20-25 yards of me (as I sat on the back porch) – it scanning me with a faint white light from hip to face and remained motionless as I. (This is prior to it’s departure).  Additionally, there is much more to the story about my physical condition thereafter – most notably, my lips, gums, mouth had been burned inside my mouth.  Feeling extremely nauseous for the next 3 days and faint. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2014-04-04T00:00:00,42.7177,-70.8957

At approximately 10pm on Friday, February 28, 2014 my wife and I saw unexplainable lights in the sky. My wife alerted me to a strange light outside of our South-facing bedroom window that she said she had seen hovering for a few seconds, then slowly move West (to the right) and suddenly turn North East (tracking left).  I turned to the window and saw the object.  It was moving North East over Buxton.  It appeared to have a triangular shape with white and red lights, none of which were blinking.  It was very low in the sky, sometimes obscured by the trees even when looking from a high second story window.  We followed it from window to window and lost it behind the trees heading towards the direction of North Gorham or Windham.  It appeared to be either very close or very large.  It did not follow any route that I’ve seen other air traffic follow here.  A very soft rumble was audible, but I am not sure if it was emanating from the object.  Our observation of this object lasted about a minute.  As we watched the first object, I spotted a second object moving in an irregular manner.  It appeared more distant, or smaller; it was just a spot in the sky.  It too was very low in the sky, peeking out from behind the trees.  We watched it appear to ascend behind the trees to the South East towards Scarborough.  As it very slowly ascended, it meandered back and forth to the left and right before it began to accelerate towards the left – Northward, in the direction that the first object had been going.  It very quickly reached what appeared to be a much higher speed than the prior object while still appearing to be very far away.  No shape or sound was discernible, but it the light appeared again to have white and red colors.  It disappeared behind the trees.  Total observation time of this object was under a minute. After standing there for several minutes looking to see if anything else would appear, we returned to the bedroom from the other side of the house.  Glancing out of the South-facing window, we again saw an object almost identical to the first and following a similar path.  This time, however, it was even nearer and one of the white lights was flashing.  It also moved more quickly than the first, or perhaps it just appeared to move more quickly because it was closer.  We followed it back around to the other side of the house again and watched it disappear in the same direction as had the first two objects.  No sound was audible this time. I’ve never seen anything like it before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2014-03-18T00:00:00,43.7224,-70.4622

This occurred on March 1st, 2014, in Washington State. I’m not sure what I saw but considering the details which I will provide here, I am having a hard time coming up with a “good” explanation. I live in a small town along the Washington coast just west of the city of Aberdeen. On March 1st I was driving to my friends home in the town of Long Beach, Washington, which is south of where I live.  I was driving south on Hwy 101, not too far south of the town of South Bend.  I had Willapa Bay out my right side window and a swampy area that drains into the bay on my left side. I’m not sure of the time but I did back tracking and I think it was about 8pm.  I was at the location described and I noticed there were lights off to my left.  Either they were really small, or some distance away-I can’t be sure because it was dark.  I noticed I think 4 lights that from what I can tell were motionless, but I can’t be sure because my truck was moving-but they appeared that way anyway. What caught my attention a lot was that they were directly at my 9:00 O'Clock position-not up in the sky.  They changed colors constantly.  I remember seeing red, blue, orange and maybe green but I’m not sure about that last one.  When I realized they were not up in the air but either on top of, or just over the swampy area, I slowed my truck down considerably (just creeping along) because I wanted to see if anything was making a sound out there but all I could hear was a lot of frogs.  I got some video on my phone/camera (not really good video-quite short) and as soon as I stopped the truck they began moving very fast, they seemed to move to the north of me quite fast.  And one of them just blinked out. I have no idea what I saw and really don’t plan on telling too many people.  I made that mistake already and people think I’m a goon.  I learned my lesson with that. The weather at that time was overcast (I couldn’t really see any stars or the moon), it was a wet weekend and there had been lots of rain coming and going but was not raining at that time. I have lived in various places along the south Washington State coast all my 64 years.  I know all the towns and all the roads.  The traffic was light at the time this happened. I am not aware if there has been anything like this reported in this area; I know there’s plenty of stories of weird sea creatures washing up on the ocean beaches.

There was a wide band of little round clouds drifting to the east.  My wife says, look at that bright thing up there, it's moving!!  I said, no honey, the clouds are moving, not that, it's a star.   I told her to hold up her finger with the star at her fingertip, and she'd see that it was stationary and the moving clouds made it to appear to be moving.  It was Arcturus.  I was facing due south, and looked just about straight up and saw, in between the clouds, a small cluster of real dim red lights.  They were not round, but like two small, red, dimly lit bars at each point of a triangle!!   I casually said, they must be heading to the Middle East.  My first thought was that they were a formation of military jets.  From the tip of NE Lower Michigan, flying north, it's a long way's to anywhere!!   Then it registered in my head!  The lights were to close together to be a formation of jets!!  There was no sound.  The lights were not blinking.  If you held up a quarter at arms length,that was about the size of the spacing of the lights.  Maybe just a bit bigger than a quarter.   I didn't see any solid outline.  May have been three things!  I saw the lights for about four or five seconds before the clouds drifted over, blocking my view.   I turned around and was now scanning up and to the north for the lights to appear between the little puff ball type clouds.  I assumed that's the way the thing or things were heading.  My wife was to my left, kind of behind me, and exclaimed, ""Look!!""  She pointed to the NE, and I turned to see a solid, white light, below the little clouds, heading to the SE.  At the same time she shouted, ""I heard and saw two jets at about 75 or 80 degrees, heading north, start into hard right banking turn!!!""  The clouds were broken enough for me to see them.   Now, take your hand, raise your arm to about 75 or 80 degrees, point it to the NE and turn your arm! smoothly to the SE.  Now count to 5 as your turning.  That's how long it took for that solid white light to go out of sight to the SE.  Before those jets completed their turn, that thing was gone!!!  They were in hot pursuit!!   I ran in the house and called the local TV station!  I asked if anyone else had called in to report any lights or unusual stuff, and he said no, but would call me back if any other reports came in.   The next morning, May 9th, the call in talk shows were swamped with calls about some lights, fireballs, and things.  I didn't get up and it never dawned on me to listen the next morning to all the excitement going on!!  My brother called me and asked if I had heard the talk shows that morning.  I said no, as I was up real late from the experience my wife and I had.   I called the talk show three weeks ago to ask if they kept the recordings of their shows. I didn't go into much detail, but said I saw some crazy stuff on May 8th, and wondered if they had saved the tapes.  He said sometimes, but only for special or memorable stuff.   I turned on the station and listened as they discussed, and their news guy or someone remembered the calls from that show.  They said they were just helicopters doing training, and then one guy said I saw one of those new, big bombers!  Well guess what?  On Oct 2, 2013, my wife and I, and a friend I called, because I was so excited, watched one of those big, just a wing, bombers, fly by our house three times!!!  In broad daylight!!!  One of the coolest things I ever saw!  It had a blinking light.   I'll take a lie detector test for all I've said here.  Thank You",2014-01-30T00:00:00,45.3785,-84.2573

To whom this concerns,  	I’m submitting this report to your organization to hopefully gain a better explanation of what we possibly saw during that night.  I initially submitted a report to MUFON on July 4th, 2013, and I was shortly contacted by a MUFON investigator to come and visit our home. Sometime after he was suppose to come I had one occurrence late one evening with a helicopter which overflew my home under 500 feet and maybe 40-60 knots of airspeed.  First time was with a searchlight and second time which occurred within 10 minutes roughly; it was blacked out with just one red strobe on the tail. 	I did write this MUFON investigator and informed him about it, and he’d seemed intrigued. Well, long story short he never did come and never contacted me again.  I followed up this previous December about why did he never follow up with me.  Real quickly, the reason I waited so long was because I thought maybe this guy thinks I’m full of s@#$ and I didn’t want to be too persistent to possibly make him think i’m overbearing.  	So I got a response to my concerns about why I was never contacted from the state director of MUFON from NC. It seems that the initial investigator fell very ill, and then my case got pawn off and they explained that it was a very rare meteorological event that we witnessed. Overall I have a gut feeling that there is something strange about this event. Any info would be great.   	Here is the Original report, “My wife and me were outside on the deck watching the thunderstorm approach from the southwest when out of no where a reddish orange fog or cloud appeared. It started out dull in brightness but soon got brighter and brighter and was in my opinion roughly 10 to 15 miles away. As it was becoming brighter it was making its way towards our direction from the southwest and the closes it came was roughly 1/4 of a mile from us. This event lasted roughly 10 minutes and it gave my wife and I a strong feeling of eeriness as it was making progress towards us and becoming bigger and bigger. The weird thing is we never saw a distinct detailed craft, we only saw a glowing fog or cloud that seemed to have intelligent control. This dense fog or cloud just dissipated after getting that close to us and it took roughly 2-3 seconds for it to disappear. If anything has any idea what this was please add on your opinion. Also there was no noise only a creepy feeling.”",2014-01-30T00:00:00,36.31627741935484,-76.27461612903227

I live in the west side of the Salt Lake valley near the mountain.  I only live about a five minute drive to my place of employment, while driving I noticed what I thought was an airplane in the distance out over the mountain. It was a different colored light than what is the normal green and red, it was a dark amber color almost orange.  I didn’t think much of it until I realized it was on my side of the Oquirrh Mountains (less than two miles away) and could not have been an airplane, so I pulled into a church parking lot to watch it.  My second guess was it could have been a helicopter, but I couldn’t hear it make any sound.  The strange light went lower behind a mountain called hogs back losing sight of it so off to work I went. I have a co-worker that lives near where I do and she called me asking if I saw the strange orange light up against the mountain that was leaving a lit up trail in the nig! ht sky, I confirmed that I did.  I left the building I work in to go look for the strange light. It was midnight and all the New Years Eve fireworks lit up the sky.  I could see the amber light again near the mountain now moving in a weird circular pattern, my co-worker confirmed this as we were still on the phone with each other I asked her if it could have been fireworks, she told me she had been watching it for a while and it wasn’t. I decided to call a family member who lived in an apartment building in the same area asking her if she could see a strange amber light up against the mountain.  She was skeptical in asking me “is this another one of you weird UFO things”.  I just ask her to look for it and tell me what it was doing, she got silent for few seconds as she confirmed by saying “yea that’s weird its up by your house against the mountain moving sporadically, yea that’s cool”.  She confirmed that it made no sound.   When I got off the phone, I noticed that it was now sitting still (hovering) in the sky after a minute or so it drop! ped down out of sight behind some trees in the distance, my family member later confirmed when we discussed it the next day.

On today's date Jan 17, 2014.  I left with my son to drop him off at his high school at 6:50AM Arizona time.  We live in a small town about 20 miles south of Phoenix.  As I was heading east on my street I noticed what appeared to be an extremely bright and larger then normal star at about 30 degrees off my horizon.  It appeared to be pulsating. I take my son each morning to school at this time so it was different from what I normally see.  The sun was still about 30 minutes from rising so still dark out.  As I was driving on highway 347 going south to his school I noticed a second really bright large star to the east. It appeared to be about 30 degrees off the horizon as well.  I could see both bright stars.   The one I saw earlier was at a bearing of about 45 degrees and looked like it was towards the superstition mountains which as the crow flies would be about 40 miles from me.  The other bright star light was about at a bearing of 105 degrees.  I dropped my son off at the back of his school by the gym which is the west side of the school and went out to the street that run east.  I know longer saw the second bright star that was at a bearing of 105 degrees but I could still see the first star that was at a bearing of 45 degrees.  It was still pulsating between bright and slightly less bright.  As I am sitting about 5 cars back at the light on W. Honeycutt Ave. and highway 347 by his school facing due east watching this star it suddenly got really bright for about a second then it just completely disappeared.  This was at about 7:11 AM according to my Jeep clock.  I was searching the skies to see if it had moved and when I was looking at the area where the second star had been to see if it might have come back instead I saw what appeared to be three orange orbs at about the same bearing 105 degrees where the bright star light was a! few minutes earlier.  Two were at about the same height of aro! und 20 d egrees off the horizon and one was about 2 degrees lower.  At this point I wanted to try and get a picture of them so I drove to an open farmers field about a mile south of where I was and parked by a school bus whose driver was waiting I suppose to start his middle school run.  I was on the eastside of highway 347 on the southside of Ferrel road looking at the three orange orbs that appeared to be 15-20 miles away at a bearing of 105 degrees.  I took about four pictures with my iphone but the distance was too far away for me to see them on my phone.  The orbs appeared to me slowly going south as I was using a telephone pole i the distance to see it was moving towards it.  This was about 7:13am Arizona time.  I don't know if the school bus driver saw the orange orbs as he was facing due east on the side of the road but he left after a few minutes.  As far as distance from me to the orange orbs I am guessing about 15 miles as it appeared to be somewhere by the city of Casa Grande an! d maybe the I-10 area.  It seems like highway 84 going east to Casa Grande would have taken you right into the orbs from my perspective.  After the last orb went out about 10 seconds later in the same area I saw a dark colored plane.  I couldn't tell what type it was and assume it was a plane.  It flew about as slow as a Cessna in a southern direction and then just disappeared after about 10 seconds. I don't know if that was just due to changing direction and angle thus not being able to see it anymore or if it actually just disappeared.  Was very strange.I know from now on when I take my son to school I am going to make sure I have my hand held video camera with me as then I could have zoomed in on the objects.  I am listing myself as the only witness but my son saw both stars as well as we commented on how bright they were compared to normal.  He did not see the orange orbs.  I am going to send the pictures I took on my iphone to my brother as he might be able to enhance the pictures better to see if you can see anything.  I couldn't see the! orbs on them due to dusk was occurring at the time of the orbs so they were right in the middle of dusk and a great distance away.  I haven't looked at the video I took yet as I have to download it from my phone.  If anything is worth posting I will make an additional report and add it.

The first object had a line of seven bright greenish-white lights.  The object hovered for a moment before descending vertically, it then elevated vertically before moving south-west at extraordinary high speed.   A few seconds later a second object was clearly visible in the same location with a line of seven bright lights, this time reddish-white in colour.  This object hovered maintaining its altitude for a few moments before moving north at extraordinary high speed. My impressions were that the two objects had emerged from a larger airborne vehicle, that was not illuminated and not visible.  As the lights of both objects were equally spaced and of the same intensity of brightness, I concluded that they were on a level surface not round.  If the lights had been on anything other than a level surface the lights would not have appeared equally spaced and not of the same intensity of brightness as they would have been angled in different directions.  The speed at which the two objects moved did not give the impression of acceleration, but that they both moved from stationary to terminal velocity instantaneously.  The extraordinary high speed at which the objects moved from stationary to terminal velocity, was such that it is improbable that a life form could withstand the exceptional gravitational forces exerted.  I therefore concluded that the objects were remotely controlled.  Finally it was a quiet evening and whilst I live in close proximity to Muscat International airport there was no sound emitted from the two objects and no other aircraft or helicopters in the vicinity at that time. The practice of using larger airborne vehicles to transport smaller airborne vehicles has been in use for decades by NASA in moving space shuttles between landing and launch sites.  The technology for an airborne object to descend and elevate vertically has existed since the inception of helicopters, likewise the technology for fixed wing aircraft, such as the Harrier vertical take-off and landing has also existed for decades.  The technology to control an airborne object remotely has existed for decades in the form of remote controlled model aircraft.  More recently pilotless drones operating in Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Yemen, but controlled from a location in the United States of America, illustrates how technology has advanced.  The speed and manoeuvrability of modern fighter jets illustrates that material and airframe design technology exists that will withstand extreme gravitational forces without compromising the structural integrity or functionality of the aircraft.  Individually all of the phenomena witnessed are explainable, except for the extraordinary high speed at which they moved from rest, without appearing to accelerate and without emitting any sound.  I am not aware of any method of propulsion that will propel a stationary airborne object to terminal velocity, instantaneously and more significantly, silently.",2014-01-24T00:00:00,,

On January 29, 2014, approx. 7:00 pm on a clear night- my husband called to me to come outside on our upstairs deck and look at an odd red light.  I at first said it must be a red light from the new cell tower or a small aircraft coming in to the tiny airport up the road approx. 6 miles.  I am a skeptic.  If I can't see, touch, taste, hear or smell it-I'm not convinced. The red ball that I began to observe behaved very smoothly, coming from the northeast directly towards our house, it did not move in a direct path though, it was as if it was hovering to the right, then the left.  I became convinced that this was something odd and unlike anything I had ever seen- pertaining to airplane lights, etc.  I ran downstairs to get my camera and night binoculars for my husband. When I reached my last point of observation again from the upstairs deck, the red ball was now hovering over the southerly sky, heading slowly west- just above the tree line.  I did take some pictures and they are quite clear in depicting the very redness and roundness of this object.  I am an avid photographer- I know what man-made lights look like in a photo- they glare and have light or white centers, no matter the color of the light.  This was red through and through, it did not send rays of light out like a man made light does- this was like an orb and it did hum, while hovering just over our hoop house.  It disappeared from sight as I tried unsuccessfully to take a video too. We are farmers, my husband a retired mill worker.  He is the believer in UFO's, I am not.

Since they were only lights, I could not tell the altitude.  From my perspective they were about half the size of a pencil eraser, and again from my perspective, they were approximately 1 foot apart from each other.  The lights were brighter than the stars and were brilliant white.  It is very quiet at my place , and I often hear airliners flying at 30+ thousand feet as they pass over my house as a low roar.  These lights produced no sound at all that I could hear. I cannot estimate the speed at which the lights were traveling since I don't have an altitude to base it on.  However they traversed the sky from North to South till out of sight in about 15 seconds. I don't believe these were satellites.  I know what objects in orbit look like as they pass overhead.

Then as soon as she said hello this bright light zoomed down and made the sky bright and it seemed like lighting hit the ground but it was white then purple then bluish.  After that I just figured it was a shooting star or comet.  Though I have seen many of those this looked nothing like that.  We'll on down the road I started seening this light thinking it was a star I looked closely at it and realized it was changing colors.  So I watched it till I got home.  Then I sat in my truck and parked it in my driveway where I could still see the light.  As I sat and watched it it didn't move and yet it grew larger and then shrunk while becoming larger it changed colors from white to blue to purple and orange.  So I have no idea what I saw.  I just wanted to know if anyone else saw what I saw that night.,2014-02-07T00:00:00,39.17300546875,-78.218624609375

I was driving south on US Hwy 411 about 8 miles north of the town of Maryville at about 8:30 pm when something caught my eye in the sky.  Two bright red lights were just above the tree tops ahead and a little to the west of me.  As I watched, they moved slowly from west to east pretty much maintaining level.  I was traveling at about 40 mph and the road makes a slow arc to the east there and then a quick reverse S west and back due south.  This put me almost directly behind the lights overhead. The lights had disappeared behind the trees for a couple of seconds as I negotiated the curves going over a rise and into a dip before the road leveled out still heading south.  The lights were moving south, too, but faster than I was moving.  The sky was very dark, but I could just make out what appeared to be a dark boomerang shape with large red lights on each end.  The shadowy shape was much thicker in the middle, where the sweep back of the shape originated, and tapered as it got to the ends.  The lights were large, round, and intensely bright. The closer they got the brighter they appeared.  At the closest point to me, I would estimate the craft was about 100-120 yards long.  If it was that long, it would be 30-50 ft thick at the center.  As it continued south, I would estimate it to be couple of hundred feet off the ground as tree tops would obscure it as I would go into dips in the 2 lane highway. I lost sight of it when I made a right turn and dropped into a dip.  When I came out of the dip, I was able to catch sight of it only for a couple more seconds.  As close as the lights were together then, I would guess it to be about three miles away and still just a few hundred feet off the ground.  Another dip and I didn’t see it again.",2014-02-07T00:00:00,35.702364150943396,-83.98648396226416

I’m a big airplane enthusiast and very interested in astronomy, so I always have my eyes on the sky no matter what time of day.  This was around 6pm, against and completely black sky.  I was walking across campus and saw two extremely bright orange lights.  They were right next to each other and at an angle.   For a small moment, my gut told me it was a plane with bright lights on the tips of its wings that was banking hard.   I took a step back from behind the tree that was now blocking my view to make sure I wasn’t crazy.  I saw the two golden orange orbs moving slowly, in separate directions.  I watched them for about 3 seconds before the lights faded out right before my eyes.  One of them faded slightly before the other, and both were moving in slightly different directions.   I noticed there was no sound at all, and if it was the plane I thought initially, I would have heard so! mething.  The plane would have been a few hundred feet in front of me, and there would have been sound.   Like I said, I’m always looking to the sky.  I know what satellites look like. I know what the space station looks like. I know what Venus looks like.  Two golden orbs, moving slowly, fade away to nothing. Here’s where it gets weird for me.  Yesterday was December 13, 2013.  My friend and I were making our trip from Potsdam, NY to Albany, NY.  An hour south east of Potsdam is a town called Tupper Lake.   When we got to Tupper Lake, the sun had just gone down, and the sky had a pinkish blue tint to it.  I turned to the left to see two golden orange orbs in the east.  They were the exact lights I had seen in Potsdam weeks earlier.  This time, they appeared to be almost directly over us, and about 300 feet apart from each other.  These were the same lights, and in the same place.   The first lights I saw in Potsdam were right over Tupper Lake because it was in the South Eastern sky.  I started yelling to my friend in the passenger seat to look at the lights!  He was looking at the street lights, car lights, lights from the mall…he didn’t see the orbs in the 3 seconds that I saw them.  Just as before, the lights were there for 3 seconds, then faded out while moving slowly in different directi! ons. Later in the drive, we would observe what I KNOW was Venus fading in and out.

From the Bayview District in San Francisco California On Friday December 13th 2013 At approx. 7:45 PM I was observing through binoculars extremely heavy traffic on US Hwy 280 looking northeast from my living room window, lowering the field glasses for a moment I observed one red light.. then two..  moving into my field of view from over the top of my home moving from the South toward the North.  Then looking through my Binoculars I saw they were in formation and each had slowed to a virtual crawl.   I now suddenly realized each had two small but obvious red lights an equal distance horizontally from each other though not apparently supported by any visible structure but in an identical configuration.  I thought it strange the first apparent red light had now become four in the time it took for me to find and view them through my Binoculars - a maximum duration of perhaps three seconds - and all had slowed to a slow crawl seemingly ""floating""  without collapsing toward each other as objects do when receding into the distance. I further saw they were in an obvious formation across from one another. From my perspective as I experienced this first sighting - I judged them to be at least a half mile away in the vicinity of one another though not apparently connected and obviously not conventional aircraft like Jet or Prop driven aircraft or helicopters. Within one minute they slowly crossed the short distance to the left behind the big cedar tree behind my house and were then totally obscured from view. I thought it quite strange. I continued to view the stalled traffic on the freeways through my binoculars for Approx. five minutes when I suddenly noticed a very bright and rapidly pulsating light directly North of my location which I estimated to be perhaps a mile away and about 5 to 600 feet above the Mission District of San Francisco - Approx. the Area of Potrero Blvd. and the Hwy. 101 and 280 interchange.  Shifting my position I saw a second object identical in appearance to the first vibrating light light as well in an identical, abet bizarre fashion somewhat northeast to the first and partially obscured by the same ceder tree which had shortly prior obscured my initial odd sighting of the four red lights, I watched in amazement and fascination  as they seemingly hovered motionless and in unison.  This continued for Approx four minutes before I quickly went to my computer to contact my online community in the SF area to inquire if they too could see what I was witnessing.  One friend a few miles to the west said she could see a bright stationary light hovering over the area of the Mission Dist. She wrote: ""I saw a VERY bright, large light on the southeastern sky.  At first I thought it was a plane, but it was not moving.  Then I thought perhaps it was a planet, but it was pretty low on the horizon"".  After a few minutes exchanging excited online messages I returned to my position on the couch and again saw the bright light nearly exactly where I had first seen it as a vibrating light in a few minutes prior, the second object wasn't immediately visible but quite quickly I grabbed the binoculars and my camera and ran out of my home and around the block to where I would have an unrestricted view of the entire sky.  This took Approx. 90 seconds but there was nothing unusual visible at that time or location. i observed for ten minutes before returning home and calling the police.",2013-12-23T00:00:00,37.76999211048627,-122.42539404565002

I am not a big believer in UFO's but I can not explain this.  The photos I took visually confirm the story. I was driving home from work when I looked up through my windshield and saw the strangest vapour trails I had ever seen.  I work in Aerospace, I have travelled around the world over 12 times...I have seen a lot of vapour trails and they are not uncommon on this part of my drive home.  But these vapour trails were like nothing I have ever seen.  They were so strange it made someone like me get out of the car and shoot them with my phone camera. I thought they looked that strange. There were multiple trails, they were dashed and dotted almost like Morse code and they were moving in multiple different directions as if produced by multiple craft moving in multiple different directions. Unfortunately I was shooting into the sun so I took many shots hoping one of them would show these vapour trails. It was several days later before I even looked at my photos, I could barely make out a few streaks because of the sun glare but my camera caught a floating, glowing blue object in 5 of the 8 photos I took.  I did not see this glowing blue object, I was trying to shoot the vapour trails so I was stunned to find it in the photos. PHOTO 1: Glowing blue sphere hiding behind a tree behind intersection.

Maybe a harrier jump jet because it didn't look like an air force jet.   It was last week.  Around 3/25/14 during the day.   Maybe they can bend light to disappear since the aluminum balls and white saucer then the tan camouflage jet appeared in the same area. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date above are approximate.

I was traveling on my motorcycle so I had an unobstructed view of the sky.   Almost immediately after  accelerating I noticed a single white/yellowish light come into view in my far left peripheral vision.  At first I assumed it was an approaching aircraft because its color and shape appeared like a standard front mounted aircraft approach light.  I also assumed this because I frequently see aircraft in this area.   I quickly realized this was not a typical aircraft because of the speed at  which it was traveling across the sky.  It was moving in a direction of NW to SE, from my left to my right. It did not have navigational strobe lights or any other lights other than the one.  Compared to typical aircraft I would say it was traveling at mach 2.   It did not change altitude and the intensity of the light stayed constant the whole time, including when I would have been looking at the hypothetical back of the craft.  It maintained a constant direction and speed.  I lifted the clear shield of my helmet expecting to hear a sonic boom or a loud jet engine but heard nothing.  Not knowing the actual size of the craft I estimated its altitude to be at 5,000 to 20,000 ft.  It cleared the whole sky, from tree top to tree top within a matter of seconds.

I was just walking my dog that night, and thus not expecting anything unusual.  The sky was partly cloudy and there was no wind to speak of.  As my dog was feverishly sniffing around, I looked toward the southeast and saw a bright, red orb of light.  I estimate that it was about 1/8th of a full moon in size, although I admit that measuring with the naked eye is not my forte.  It was too low to be a satellite, and it neither made sound nor emitted any trail.  It was moving quite rapidly for about 15 seconds before stopping almost above me. I ran back home in a panic, not certain as to the craft's intentions.  Just before I could walk back in, I saw that it was growing fainter.  After about one minute of hovering and whirling erratically, the craft faded out of view.  I decided to continue walking, since my dog was utterly unfazed.  After about 3-5 minutes, I estimate that the time was 22:0. I was walking on a pier down the hill, when I took notice of another orb of much the same appearance as the first. This time, it was moving in a more northwesterly direction and was in view for about a minute or less.  Otherwise, it was too similar to the first encounter to recount without sounding redundant.  I am not even sure if this was a separate object, or the same one from before. I habitually look up at the sky whilst walking outside.  However, I cannot name the stars and planets in the night sky right off my head.  It was very dark, so I could not make out any other shape except for the red light.  Its flight patterns did not seem consistent with weather balloons or Chinese lanterns in calm conditions.  I did not take any pictures unfortunately, as I don’t generally go looking for UFOs.  To my knowledge, there were no other aircraft nearby during the first encounter; at least, nothing that would be consistent with what I saw.  The two aircraft which I saw at the time of the second encounter seemed to pay no heed to the object.

Saturday December 28th, 2013. Sighting location: Hamiltion Train Station, Hamiltion NJ  Time of sighting: approximately 12:20pm EST   Account:  I was waiting for a New Jersey Transit 12:23 PM train to stop at the Hamilton, NJ, train station, heading north en route to New York City. I was gazing across the tracks towards, I believe, the West, as the winter noon day sun was on my left and the trains from Trenton, NJ, headed north towards New York along tracks from my left to my right. The sky was a clear bright blue and I watched a far-off whitish airplane headed North.  As it did so, I noticed beyond and behind the plane at some further distance, approximately 5 white dots in an erratic formation, rather like balloons, or birds flying. Within the time it took me to estimate how many there were, they blinked out and vanished.  At first I thought maybe they were seagulls, further away than the plane, but then, had seagulls travelled beyond my range of vision, I don't think they would have all instantly vanished at exactly the same time, but would rather, have faded from view, and changed their distance relative to one another.",2014-01-10T00:00:00,,

I was out cutting firewood in my in-laws back yard about a 20-30 minutes before dark and I looked up hill and between the house and some tall trees through the opening I saw what appeared to be a very large helicopter off in the distance.  It appeared so large that I thought it might be a chinook (I think that is the one with dual rotors.)  I looked at it for 5 to 10 seconds and then when I didn’t hear it, I asked my wife “what is that contraption flying towards us?”   It did not make a sound which had me interested in it.  It seemed to be traveling at normal helicopter speed what ever that is (80-120mph??)  Like a medevac helicopter when you see them approach and fly over. It appeared to get larger and then went out of view behind the house.  I walked up the hill some to get a better view of it as it came back into my line of site my wife was standing right next to me further up the hill.  When it appeared again,(maybe 10-20 seconds after going out of view) it was actually out beyond the house not precisely over it.  By this time it was clearly black in color with the shape undefined.  The top appeared to be narrower than the bottom and it seemed to me to be oscillating very slightly.  (this very well could be just my brain trying to make sense of what I was seeing based on past experience only small electric drones move in that way with little or no sound)After this seemingly normal speed (for a large helicopter) approach it came to what appeared to be a slow deceleration until it came to a complete stop roughly 500 feet from where I was standing and maybe 300-400 feet in the air. It stayed there for maybe a minute or two with very little mov! ement.  It seemed as if it saw us standing in the yard looking at it and came to a slow stop.  After the one or two minutes it began moving again it moved up in a very different direction than it was going before it came to a stop.  It moved at a very steep angle almost directly away from us.  It took 3-5 minutes to finally go out of view.  I stood and watched it the whole entire time to see if it would eventually dart away or make some other kind of unusual maneuver but it did not.  It seemed to go directly away in a straight line from me up into the sky until passing out of view.  (surpass my ability to see it in the distance) From the time it came over the house to stopping it appeared to be much smaller than when we first saw it. Even though it was a lot closer it appeared to be smaller. So for the time it took to disappear I would guess it was traveling at 10-20 mph as it went away. Based on feeling after it appeared over the house I estimate its size to be about 3ft by 3ft, black in color, with an indiscernible shape.",2014-01-10T00:00:00,36.9518,-79.8592

This sighting was reported to me by my mother (now deceased).  It took place sometime during the mid-1950's most probably, as I remember her stating that my oldest sister was in the vehicle with her and my second oldest sister was a baby (she was born in 1954).  She stated it was during the spring or summer, as her car windows were down at the time.  She said it had just gotten dark outside. My mother had been at the local hospital visiting my grandmother and was leaving to return home.  The hospital was across a 2 lane street from the water (Bogue Sound) and on the other side of the sound is a small strip of beach which directly faces the Atlantic Ocean.  Our beach runs east-west. As she was backing out of her parking space she saw a round, saucer shaped craft approaching from the south (over the water).  She stated it wasn't very high & made no sound (again, her windows were down at the time).  It was low enough that she could easily make out round, what she called ""portholes"" around the periphery of the saucer.  She stated there was yellowish/white light coming from the ""portholes"".   Unsure whether it was actually windows of a sort she was seeing or if it could have been round lights?  She stated it was moving slowly and silently.  It was flying, again, from the southeast to the northwest, over the hospital. Since it was basically following the same direction she would have to go to return home, she decided to try to follow it.  She followed it as it flew over the treetops a couple of blocks and turned left to head west.  She stated it also seemed to head in a more westerly direction, up the highway.  As she reached her turnoff at 20th Street, she stated she lost sight of it heading west-northwest over the trees. When she got home, she told my father about it but he advised her not to mention it to anyone or they would think she was crazy.  She only ever told the family about it.  However, a couple of days later, in our local newspaper, a local businessman who owned & operated a service station around 25th Street (5 blocks from where she last saw it) reported seeing it and described exactly the same thing she had seen, at almost the same time.  He said it flew right over his service station. I am going to tr to locate that newspaper article.  If I can find it I will forward it to you.

It was probably the fall of 1976.  I was 11 years old living in Japan by the Sagami bay in the city of Fujisawa in Kanagawa prefecture, about 10 minutes from the beach by walking.  (I am half Japanese, half American, currently living in America.)   It was in the afternoon, probably around 16:00.  I was at the living room of my house, feeling dull.  I got the inclination to go to the back yard and breathe some fresh air.  So I did and looked up at the clear sky.  The UFO was slowing moving in a straight line in the direction of the ocean.  The direction was south west or south south west.  It was about 90 degrees above the ground (I looked right up at the sky).  There was no sound.   The object was pitch BLACK, no shine; a ""mat finish.""   Its apparent size was that of a FULL MOON, so it was quite big.  The shape was unique and unusual.  It was like a dinner plate with a WAVY EDGE.  Imagine a sine wave with eight to ten cycles and make it into a circle/loop.  And the object was SPINNING fairly quickly.  I observed it until I could no longer see it.  The timing of my sighting was impeccable.  I went to my back yard at the perfect moment.   In hindsight, I wonder if I was telepathically called me to come out of the house.  (Just a speculation.) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

In the mid-evening to late evening hours of July 5th, 2001, I witnessed an unconventional flying object defy the laws of gravity while parked on a private road located in San Jose, CA.  I was accompanied by a young adult female and as we conversed I observed a bright light, (flying in the sky) resembling a star moving from left to right.  I had witnessed this type of movement from these bright lights within the same vicinity before, and I started to turn my high beam lights on the object as I had done previously.   As the object moved to the left I would briefly turn the high beams on in my vehicle once, and when it would move to the right I would I would briefly turn the high beams on and off twice (or vice versa).  During this flight pattern, my companion was not happy about me showing attention to anything besides her, and was discouraging me from shining the lights towards the object.  This went on for a few moments when the bright lit object began to fly up and down as well as left to right.  When the object flew up (moved up or ascended) I would briefly turn my high beams on and off 3 times, when it flew down (moved down or descended) I would briefly turn my high beams on and off 4 times (or vice versa).  Also during this time, I observed a red light in the distance flying to left of my vehicle. I did not pay it too much attention as it could have been a plane.  Either before or after the lit object began to fly up and fly down my companion observed it as well and said “Okay, now that thing is moving”. I decided that we should get out of the vehicle to witness this bizarre flight pattern. As we stood at the front end of the vehicle, the lit object began to fly towards us at a high rate of speed. At this point the objects light must have reached us, (just like a mirror would reflect sunlight on a person’s face in the daytime) because without saying a word to each other, we simultaneously took a few stuttering steps towards the veh! icle doors in a hurried manner. We looked at each other briefl! y and I mentioned to her “Let’s get the F—k out of here”! We entered into the vehicle and I drove us out of there in an extreme hurry at high rate of speed. On our way out I had calmed down realizing that whatever we witnessed was not in pursuit of our vehicle. Being a young adult male, I decided that it was safe for us to pull over and continue what we set out to do when we parked in this area. At that time, my companion reclined her seat so that she could not look out the front passenger window. I was leaning over the middle console conversing with her when I observed another object (possibly the same object I shined my light at) appear just over the hillside approximately 50 yards away. If I had to estimate I would say it was  100 yards above ground. At this moment, numerous yellow, red, white and green lights appeared on the object and were flashing on and off with a row of white lights spinning around the middle of the object. I could hear rapid clicking sounds as well. At this! point the object ascended  approximately 50 yards higher (its highest point was approximately 150 yard above ground) than its original position and then descended approximately 100 yards down to a position of approximately 50 yards above ground. It flew up and down twice before going back to its original position at a 100 yards. It did this in approximately 1 second and proceeded to fly to the right at a slow pace. I could not believe my eyes. I felt as though this was something I should not be witnessing, the equivalence of taking a man before the wheel was invented, and placing him in the middle of a highway with nothing but 18-wheel rigs driving by him with lights all over each rig!  We would experience the same feelings with the same expression on our face! I find it ironic that I was not terrified at what I was witnessing, just shocked and amazed. The object repeated the flight pattern three times, but with the last it ascended once and descended once. Just before the! 3rd pattern my companion said to me “Oh god, not this again”.! I repli ed for her to ”Look”, (I was in such shock I could not speak at first), she answered “Oh god”. I got frustrated and impatient and yelled “F----ing Look”! Just as she began sitting to an upright position and looking to her right, the object flew out of view behind a hillside. I witnessed an object in flight that I will forever question and she missed it! I didn’t even have a witness although I was with another person. Sometimes I wonder why didn’t she hear the initial clicking from the lights, or maybe a reflection of the object anywhere. Now, whenever I am outside at night I will look to the sky’s for anything unusual. I often think about that object, what was it, who flew it, where did it come from, who owns it because something has to, where was it manufactured, does it have a monetary value like a car, and where is it now? Is it in a hangar somewhere, a garage or is it destroyed on some desolate planet?  Or maybe, it’s occupants are awaiting the rapture so that they can re! veal their role in Human history with lie’s spewing from their mouth. Whatever the case, there is definitely a higher intelligence far beyond our own and our government must have some kind of information that could shed some light on this controversial topic. It is even possible government officials were piloting the object and had a great laugh at my expense. This account is real and there is definitely something of another intelligence other than ourselves in this universe. I have never heard of any other accounts similar to mine and the only thing close to it is from a John Lennon song of a UFO he witnessed while in a NY hotel room. If needed I could provide pictures of the vicinity where the second encounter took place. Also I would be willing to make a composite drawing of the object if needed. I am very interested in knowning of any other accounts such as mine and hope I am not disregarded.",2014-04-11T00:00:00,37.3388420218894,-121.88970568836406

Cool but no big deal sort of interesting timing. The next night, same time, I was up meditating on the same mountain but a different location. I want to add there was Chinese military all around this place I could hear what sounded like explosions in the distance.   After the conclusion of my practice I looked up and a huge ship surrounded by golden light just appeared from nowhere.  It materialized.  It was very distinct, not a small dot!  It had many spires or fuel salages pointing forward and glided slowly with no sound.  Hard to tell how high (not very though) or big but there where many tips as I said pointing forward and it appeared quite sophisticated.  It was not round or a saucer and it traveled in a straight line. I was filled with awe and cried out holy _hit!

I had walked up to the top of my street (which is approximately a 32° angle uphill), and turned the corner walking to the right and past the first house on the right.  My dog then stopped to use the bathroom in the grass, while I stood there looking north, staring off into the dark between the large clearing of two houses.

Didn't think much, until I realized these lights were moving usually fast.  So I turned my attention directly on them, and within a few seconds, saw the lights stop and hover, and then all of a sudden they made a complete ""sideways U-turn"" and started headed east.  I literally said out loud, ""What ((deleted)) is that??!!"" (talking to my dog).  Just as quickly, the lights swerved back to the left (west), and flew for just a second until it stopped and hovered again! I proceeded to get my phone camera out to videotape, and as soon as I pulled the video application up, the red light in the sky went out, leaving just this fluorescent blue light, which suddenly dropped straight down, quick as lightning! Like it just fell from the sky.  I focused my camera on where I thought the light had dropped, and caught it on camera shooting straight back up..  it then dropped down once more, which I saw with my eyes, but did NOT catch on camera (even though my camera was focused right on it) and between messing with my phone, I did not see the light come back up.  About a minute later I saw both red and blue lights in the sky again, seeming to fly north until they just disappeared suddenly.  It was the strangest, scariest, yet most exciting experience I've ever seen…  I didn't even think it was real.  I asked my dog, ""Did that really just happen!?""

I had driven my automobile out of  Kirksville, Missouri, going east in the Northeast part of state.  I have driven this stretch of highway hundreds of times so am familiar with the rather flat landscape straight back in to town now coming west back into town about 4 to 5 miles, with clear view ahead with very little traffic so hardly any distraction of oncoming headlight to deal with.  This is a very rural part of State. I’m driving noticing   some red lights coming toward me way off ahead of me in the sky.  I didn’t really think too much about it since on occasion there is a helicopter or small airplane [like Lifeflight or private airplane seen sometimes].  So I kept thinking okay as It gets closer I will know and recognize what these lights are,  It was getting close so I glanced up at it through my windshield and side glass and realized suddenly that I didn’t know what this craft was, so I slowed vehicle to a crawl and then off on the shoulder of highway rolled my window down, now with my head out the window to get a better view, it  Dear Sirs or whom this might concern, was almost  directly over me just a little to the right and moving east, there was a clear view of what appeared to be something that had a honeycomb shaped  intricate like metal  frame structure with about 6 or seven main beams running from the center out to perimeter while it appeared that the honeycomb shaped reinforcement appeared to be somewhat more recessed then the main beams.  On the main beams were red lights spaced out along the main beams but’ bright enough that the bottom of this thing was very visible.   Now what sent me in to a state of temporary shock [almost froze with disbelieve as to what I was watching] it suddenly occurred what was missing was any sound, this was huge and moving silently practically over me and I was peering straight up, looking at the bottom of this thing!  The red light which to the best of my knowledge were like 4 to 5 spaced along each of the main outward beams and it seems some were blinking very slow like fading and then becoming bright again in some sort of sequence.  I sat there for about 5 minutes watching this move off to the east, still moving at a very slow rate of speed [too slow to register as anything that I had ever seen before] I don’t know if this sounds familiar or not but I know what I saw and waited to see if any news of anyone in the area reporting of seeing such a thing in the sky that night, have not heard a word or report of anyone else having seen it,  I guess if anyone else saw it they night know who to tell either!

These 2 sightings took place on Tuesday, January 21 between 6:45 and 7:00 AM. My mother, who lives in an apartment directly below us, glanced out of a window and her attention was immediately drawn to a very bright, white, rectilinear, scintillating light over the Elkhorn Mountains southeast of Helena, Montana.  This was before sunrise and she could clearly see this light about 10 degrees above the silhouette of the mountains.  Atmosphere was crystal clear, no clouds, no fog.  No red or green lights were noted. Estimated altitude of the light would be approximately 8500 feet, approximately 130 degrees from her point of observation, and 10 miles distant from her position (per Google Earth).  She estimated the width of the light to be that of a “pencil eraser”, and the light appeared to be about 3 inches long from her perspective.  She walked to the window and watched this linear, scintillating light move horizontally and slowly to her right (toward the south and toward Casey Peak) for approximately 3 minutes, and then it simply disappeared. She may have lost sight of the light as it moved behind tree trunks near her which could have obstructed her view.  She had no idea what she was seeing, and told me that evening that she ""thought she had seen a UFO"". On Wednesday morning I mentioned to my wife that mom thought she had seen a UFO.  My wife said that she had also seen an unusual light that same Tuesday morning at that same time, although her description was different from my mother’s in several respects. My wife meditates in front of a large window with an excellent view of the Elkhorn Mountains most mornings between 6:40 – 7:00 AM.  She was seated almost directly above my mother but on the second floor of our home.  While meditating on Tuesday morning, January 21, at approximately 6:50 AM she opened her eyes and observed a single, stationary, dime-size, very bright white light also about 10 degrees above the mountains which she said quickly expanded in diameter to the size of a nickel, and then just vanished.  This light was much larger and much brighter than the pinpoint-size house lights and street lights that we see at half of the distance that this light appeared to be.  Her sighting lasted approximately 15 seconds.  She, too, had no idea what she had seen but she knew that this light was very unusual.  She had never seen any light like this before despite having sat in the same place looking out of the same window at the same time most mornings for the past 5 years.  Both my mother and my wife are convinced that whatever it was that they saw was not the planet Venus. I called Salt Lake City ATC which monitors Helena’s airspace above 12,000 feet, and they reported primary radar returns from an Airbus flying at 37,000 feet 40 miles NW of Helena, and a Cessna flying 50 miles NE of Helena on January 21 between 6:45 and 7:00 AM.  Both of these aircraft are wrong direction, wrong distance. SLC ATC reported no other transponder signals from any other aircraft.  I spoke with a man in the Helena Regional Airport tower (Steve) who was on duty that morning and he denied seeing what my mother or my wife described seeing.  However, he stated that at that time he was very likely looking out to the North of the tower and so likely would not have witnessed these events.

On 23 Jan 14 at 0740 my colleague and I witnessed three unidentifiable objects fly near Walnut Creek Ca. The three objects first appeared to be three small helicopters flying in formation up the 680 corridor from Pleasanton toward Walnut Creek.  As they made their way north they made several irregular deviations in their flight path.  As they became closer (15-20 seconds), they broke formation and began rotating around each other in very close proximity.  Every so often they would move back into formation for a few seconds and then begin the rotation again.   We continued to speculate that they were aircraft and witnessed the sun reflecting off flat sides as they spun. We monitored them until they left our field of view, which was no more than 60 seconds of total visibility.  During that time, they must have traveled approximately 6 miles before turning skyward with a heading of north northwest. The best description I can think of is the following:  Three similar sized shapes approximately ten to fifteen feet in length with at least several flat sides, which explains the sun reflection of their sides as they rotated about.  They also did not appear to ever be more than twenty feet apart the entire time. Their flight path was very irregular and they moved between sixty and one hundred knots and maintained an elevation that was fairly consistent at about twelve hundred feet until the end where they shot skyward.",2014-01-30T00:00:00,37.90372453531598,-122.05358215613383

Possible abduction It was about 9:30 PM. I was alone at home, reading a book in my bedroom.  My kids slept in their bedroom in the basement.  The lights were all off, except my reading  light on my headboard. I was focused on my book when I saw something from the corner of the eye. I immediately felt chills.  Looking, I saw that there was nothing.  So I continued my reading  for a few minutes until a flash of white light lighted my whole bedroom.  Then I saw three white spheres the size of a basketball floating in the air at the height of  the ceiling.  I felt terrified.  The spheres move synchronously in spirals around the room.  Spheres of light emitted a hum.  Spheres illuminated the room.  With a yank,  the spheres have stopped moving and vanished. My heart was beating too fast.  I looked at my phone and it was 10:34 PM.  Reassured, I told myself that I had probably dreamed of this observation. I instinctively looked out the window.  What I saw completely hurt me.  There was a total of two beings standing, looking at me through my window. They were about 4  feet tall, big heads, big slanted black eyes, no nose, only nostrils.  They looked at me with a terrible stare.  I could feel anger towards me.  I was sweating cold  water.  I was terrified.   Suddenly, they disappeared in a matter of seconds.  I felt reassured for a second, until something cold grabbed my legs and my arms at the  same time.  I couldn't move, they were holding me tight.  I could feel something cold inside my skull, as if someone was touching parts of my brain.  It was a really scaring experience.  A really uncomfortable feeling.  Everything went black and I passed out. I woke up next morning at 09h52, with a terrible headache.  Something happened last night. I will never be the same again.",2014-01-30T00:00:00,,

Location: Miami, Florida (western suburbs, away from major light sources located eastward)  (Note:  This is the 2nd time in four months I have seen the EXACT same phenomenon in my location. I will include details of this event post-script. This was not a chinese lantern, as well.)   I was sitting outside with a friend of mine.  I glanced at the sky (Which I do out of habit), and my eyes focused on a single red dot of light.  Instantly recognizing this as the same object I saw four months prior, I stood up and pointed it out to my friend. We stood in awe as the following happened:  (Note:  This event lasted over one minute)  The object moved smoothly northward from over the Everglades (west from my location, about 5 miles from my house).  As we watched, we noticed a whiteish-reddish tail emanating from the object, flowing smoothly away from it.  The tail diminished, but given a closer look I noticed a corona of white vapor surrounding the red ball. The dot of light and its tail resembled glowing red plasma.  The object, from my limited perspective, seemed like it was moving as quickly as an airplane would from 30,000 ft up.  I suspect the object was actually located between 50-70,000 ft high, and probably moving much quicker than any airplane.  Despite this, it flowed smoothly from south to north over the Everglades. After about 45 seconds, the ball of light dimmed... then reappeared three seconds later. It dimmed once more, then came back, now with a strong reddish tail flowing from it (at this point it was parallel to me if I faced toward the west). Maybe 10-15 seconds later, my friend and I noticed the ball of light seemed to contain a small explosion, again very flowy and plasma-like. After this final ""explosion"" of light, the object dimmed, then suddenly disappeared, now located to the north of me (i noticed the light when it was WELL south of my location). We continued to watch the sky, but nothing.  Post-script: This has happened to me before.  Same location, but this time the light was travelling from north to south over the EASTERN sky (from my perspective, I can surmise it was flying over the ocean, outside the mainland Miami-Downtown area). Again it lasted over a minute, it had a tail (this tail was much more prominent and strange than the most recent event.  Very deep blood red, flowing well away from the ball of red light, creating what seemed like a Comet's coma/tail.)  The tail would diminish occasionally, the light would dim almost completely, flash bright again, dim, flash, then disappeared. I have studied meteors before in an attempt to explain this to myself.  I believe with 150% certainty, NEITHER of these objects were a meteor or aircraft of any kind.  There also seem to be many other reports of similar objects/events. I write this in an attempt to perhaps get some answers or even a little logical explanation as to what this MIGHT be.  Note: Miami has very heavy air traffic, with various types of commercial, private, military and helicopter aircraft flying at any given time.  During BOTH instances, other aircraft were in full view (I live near Miami International Airport.  Planes do holding patterns or final-descent approaches near my house).  This object did not resemble ANY aircraft or ""chinese lantern""   The first time, I had no witnesses.  This second time, I have a legitimate witness that watched this happen with me.

Dear National UFO Reporting Center,                                    1/26/2014    I do not claim to be abducted but there are a few stories I would like to share with your facility.  I also would like to report a possible UFO sighting. When I was about twelve years of age I was sitting on my grandparents roof experimenting with cigarettes.  At that time back in 1996 my grandparents home was surrounded by hay fields and about 150 yards from a rural residential road on the Wind River Indian Reservation.  I happened to look up out into the hay field and right where a irrigation ditch is I had seen a green and red and white light changing colors.  I could tell it was only about five feet off the ground. I had thought it was another kid out in the field with one of those toy flashlights that change color.  I do not remember climbing down off the roof nor do I remember going to bed. (this was about 10:00 pm)  Through out my teenage and in my early twenties I had never given the sighting another thought. when I was a teenager my grandmother had given me the book ''Intruders'' by respected Budd Hopkins.  The book had sat in my bedroom closet for years collecting dust. I did not read the book until the summer of 2013 and I started remembering the strange lights I had seen out in the hay field.  I am a Native American and as you probably know my heritage is  strongly influenced by the supernatural and paranormal.  After reading Intruders I was thinking ''what would a little kid be doing way out in the hay field at night'' then I theorized that maybe it was a alcoholic walking through the field with one of those toy flashlights'' because there has been a lot of alcoholics in my community who would walk out in the fields to someone's house. I spoke with a Native American shaman and had described what I had seen.  I did not go to him for help we are friends and we was talking about the talk show ''coast to coast'' the medicine mad had told me that he thought that it was not a human nor was it an evil spirit roaming around that it very well could have been something from not of this world. I truly believe that it was something extra terrestrial. Another incident that I would like to share is that when I was twenty six I had a very strange dream that seemed real. I felt like I was awake and conscious but at the same time it was a dream. In this strange state of mind I had seen several green orbs floating around me. something or somebody was speaking to me but I could not hear a voice nor could I speak. The information I had received was in my head. I know there is a word for it but I can not think of it right now. I think the word I am looking for is telepathy. As these green orbs were floating around me I was told that if I do not do this one certain thing that I would be killed. I strongly believe that extra terrestrials were communicating with me. I don't know how exactly but I feel in my heart and with all my soul that they were in fact ET's. I have thought this through a lot and am very confused as to why would they threatened me like that? I sometimes think that mayby they were not being malicious but giving me a warning and trying to help me because at that time I was in a very dangerous situation where my life was actually in danger. In Native American Culture we do have stories of ''star people'' coming to earth and visiting with tribal elders. These ''star people'' are not out to hurt or destroy humans. I strongly believe that aliens are real but I just cannot accept the thought that I was abducted.....here is my UFO sighting.... I was laying in bed with my curtains open and there is a big pine tree outside my window. I had seen a blinking white or silver light through the tree branches and thought it was a star. I got up about twenty minutes later and had noticed that the light was gone. I was looking out the window and had noticed the same light hovering over the Wind River Mountains on the Wind River Indian Reservation. I thought to myself that cant be a star why did it move like that? I thought it was an airplane then I realized if it was in fact an airplane then it would be moving but it was just sitting there blinking it was mostly white/silver and as I peered at it longer and concentrated on it. I could see it change to a faint red color and it was just sitting there blinking. I know now that it was not a star no an airplane and the only conclusion I could think of was that it must have been a UFO. There have been reported sightings on this Reservation of bigfoot but never has anybody reported seeing a UFO. I personally think  that by becoming interested in aliens and reading Intruders and listening to coast to coast that somehow I attracted ET's . I have never seen a ''grey'' only the strange lights as a child and the green orbs in my dream. I am a recovering alcoholic and marijuana addict. I have been clean and sober for three years so I know what I saw the other night was not an hallucination. I was in a very normal state of mind. Anyway the strange blinking lights I had seen was just sitting there not moving. The lights were right above the Wind River Mountains on the Wind River Indian reservation. Thank you for reading my story and please take into consideration my sighting of a possible UFO. God bless! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We live by Mid Continent so i see planes take off and land all the time at night so I'm positive these are not any kind of aircraft I have seen before.  They moved around and stopped regularly.  Looked like bright white stars but it became obvious that these were not stars when they started to move.  There were no planes in the sky at all at the time I witnessed these lights.  I have always been a skeptic but this was easily convincing.,2014-01-24T00:00:00,37.696397848537,-97.32954010327022

Very colorful, chased by military helicopters a few minutes later. Bloomington, UT.  Heading opposite direction from Walmart. Strong sulfur smell at Walmart, enough to cover mouth/nose.  Other people in parking lot didn't seem to notice. Start driving home.  We noticed this craft, some what round, other person thought it was a helicopter for a little while until it moved fast! It was probably 70ft in the air then headed away from our car and over this huge hill that was a good 2 minute drive away in a few seconds.  The actual ufo was brightly colored.  It had orange, red, white and green.  I remember orange the most.  No lights blinked.  I tried to record it on my phone but I couldn't get any resolution to actually see the craft.  So we get home and maybe 1 minute later a helicopter zooms by, I heard the first one and while I was looking up any local ufo sightings.  I then heard a second helicopter and ran out front to see where it was heading.  The second helicopter was solid black with some dull green lights on the bottom.  Turns out!  Both copters were heading the same direction as the colorful craft,  I mean directly where the colorful thing went.  The black helicopter was only 40-50ft above my head when I saw it.  I'm thinking military as far as style goes.  I couldn't tell what the other copter looked like.",2014-01-24T00:00:00,37.13106124401914,-113.58876315789475

Helo on its tale, then craft disappeared. At approximately 19:15, I observed a horizontal bar with two large circular white lights coming out of the North, near Newark Airport heading south. Immediately struck with the irregular lights (non-standard Commercial Aviation lights) which are typical for this heavy commercial airspace.  Just 2 very large white round lights at end of the ‘bar’ which was black and had no other lights or markings.  When first observed, I estimate this craft was over South west of Newark Air/Linden NJ.  This craft was ascending at a fast speed. Faster than normal ascending speed of Commercial air craft.  As the craft come closer to my position, I could see the outline of a black triangle shape, but did not see the same large round white light on the tail of the triangle.  As I tried to view the tail, suddenly a Helicopter appeared directly behind it traveling and escalating in the same direction.  This Helo had red law enforcement lights.  Also noted, the direction of this craft was opposite of what Newark Commercial Flights were using this evening.  Flights were taking off in the South East then banking either west or north.  This craft was coming out of the North at a low altitude.  Such a flight plan is never used at Newark and dangerous to other ascending flights.  As this triangle began to approach my position/home, I could see the vast width, craft was pure black with no apparent cabin, no sound.  This width exceeded any commercial airliner I have ever seen.  Flying low about 100-200 feet above with just the two white lights at each end of the triangle point.  The Helo remained on its tail.  Then the triangle completely disappeared just before the craft flew over my home.  I ran outside and looked in the sky 360 degrees and could not see this Triangle.  However the Helo remained on the original course of the triangle, went over my home and continued South.   I have never seen such large white lights on a aviation craft before.  Hard to estimate or calculate the size of the lights.",2014-01-24T00:00:00,40.5817,-74.2315
