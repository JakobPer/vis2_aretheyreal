We had one car at the time, so she was picking me up, although I was driving. On the way we were enjoying the cool air with the windows down. The interstate we were on was essentially empty, only a few cars going by at that time of night ( this was about 1:30 in the morning). As we were driving she was looking out the window, and said “What the (expletive) is that?” When she said that, I looked out the passenger side window also. Because the road was so empty, I slowed the car down considerably so I could see what she was looking at. Coming directly up from the ground was a ball of green light. It looked somewhat like a roman candle, but this was far too big to be anything like that. It flew straight from a spot we could not see near the ground, straight up in the air before vanishing. It was very large and moving extremely fast. We were maybe 1000 to 1500 yards from it. The only thing in the vicinity is pueblo tribal land with some small livestock. Our first thought was, “shooting star”, except that it was an intensely bright green, and obviously meteors don’t move upwards from the ground. 	We both saw it very clearly, and it never changed colors or faded. It simply went up and disappeared, without ever making a sound. Since then, we recently saw another object just like this. This one was a little over a week ago now (4/23/06), and was moving downwards this time. However this time it went through a color change from dull yellow to bright green, then disappeared before it touched the ground. Between us we have seen a number of objects over the years, but this one was very odd. I have never seen anything this intensely green or bright before. I wanted to submit this report because these “green light” objects don’t seem too common, and it was a bit unnerving. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was sitting down with my aunt and my mother on a nice cool night in the town of Comerio, Puerto Rico in 1998. We had been talking about strange light activity my aunt has been seeing in the sky over the mountains of the region (most of the area is mountainous) when we noticed a strange set of lights moving towards our position from above the tree line approximately east of our position. The craft was shaped like an egg except it was wider than it was tall, it wasnt as round as an egg rather more flattened. At first you couldnt hear any sound but for some reason as it came closer we could hear wind as if the craft itself was causing a disturbance in the air with its motion through it. The craft as it approached was about 40 to 50 feet off the ground, just above the tree tops. It was comprised of what seemed to be gun metal colored panels and had blue and white lights in succesion around its entire circumfrence. Im not exactly sure if the panels were gun metal colored but they appeared that way in the light that the craft itself was emitting (it was dark and the only reason we saw it was because the lights on its sides illuminated its shape enough for it to be seen). Id say the craft was maybe 250 to 300 feet away from us and appeared to be quite large, probably the width of about two and a half black hawk helicopters side to side. The craft was silent except for the sound of wind moving through trees under the craft (I know what helicopters sound like and this thing did not emmit such a loud sound, rather literally the sound of wind moving through trees). It flew in an easterly direction away from us and then over the mountain. Id estimate its speed at about 35 to 40 miles an hour because i was able to get a good look at it as the event happened. My mother, my aunt, and myself looked at each other to make sure we had all seen the same thing because during the event we were all speechless. Thats something my mother doesnt like to talk about (shes quite christian and doesnt want to believe its something unexplainable) and my aunt stays adamant that she sees crafts like that and strange lights in the mountains on an average basis and im inclined to believe her, she claims that the lights have been a common occurance since she was a child. Im inclined to believe her because when i happened to mention me seeing strange lights in northern new hampshire to her once she told me about her personal experience with seeing lights in the mountains.

In any case, a friend and i were waiting to for some other friends, and decided to make the 5 or so mile drive from berkeley heights, to summit. For the first couple minutes, it was a normal uneventful drive. That would soon change.  I was driving the car and noticed an enormous object fly overhead, at first i assumed it was a plane, but without any accompanying noise, i was forced to take a second look. At this point, i pointed up. My friend looked out the window and saw what i was pointing at. It was a craft, flying a few hundred feet up with 3 lights, and a triangular shape. The color of the lights was indiscriminate as it changed often. The object also appeared to be moving north east towards New york city. Just as we came to the realization of what we were looking at, the object seemed to disappear. (as if it knew we were observing)  At which point we noticed a new object (possibly the same object), starlike in appearance , which had appeared near where the other object seemed to disappear. We stayed fixed on it, as it was now moving easterly back towards us, from a position seemingly off the coast, but near the city. All of a sudden the object jumped literally from one end of the horizon to the other instantaneously (east to west). It hovered in this new position for about 2 minutes and then proceeded to jump straight up and disappear..  Needless to say my friend and I had no doubt as to what we had seen. Our only question was as to its origin. I've always been interested in UFO phenomena and spent many a night as a child peering up hoping to catch a glimpse. Ive seen things that are suspect, but could easily be ruled out as being something entirely explainable by the right expert. This was entirely different however, there was no question that this was not any aircraft i had ever seen, or any easily explainable natural phenomena.

She has asked me to try and contact  the UK national press for her, but I have been trawling the internet to find similar sightings and I can’t find any corroborating information before approaching anyone. The closest I have found is on your website:  Occurred : 5/13/2005 21:15 (Entered as : 05/13/1905 21:15) Reported: 5/16/2005 5:54:33 PM 17:54 Posted: 5/24/2005 Location: Emory, TX Shape: Rectangle Duration:about 1 minute  The sketch offered by the above report is very similar to the footage that my friend has captured, in that the lighting configuration is as close to what I have seen on her footage. The collection of lights is very similar being in three rows, but there is one difference in that the red lights in Emory,TX were reported as being fixed. In the footage, there was only one and it was independent of the collection of lights above. If I had to make a supposition, I would say that it was a drone controlled by the larger craft.  Furthermore, it appears that this craft remained in position for some not inconsiderable time. This to me, is totally incredible as we live in a very busy city. On one occasion it was still visible into the early hours of the morning, whereupon it appeared to be able to either generate a cloud, or be sheilding itself from view behind one. All this time in the same position. It is in this footage that the craft appears to pulse light, at a slow strobing pulse that lit the cloud and the edge of the window frame in shot. There was no audible noise in the tapes that I have heard, with the exception of my friends various comments and, well frankly, expletives.  My friend is extremely reluctant to come forward; but I have seen the footage myself and I am frankly baffled. I have had some military and security services experience, and have travelled extensively since a very young age. I have filed numerous arrest reports, worked closely with the Metropolitan Police and acted as witness in many court cases, and consider my judgement and recall to be sound. In all my years of living and flying abroad, I have never seen anything that would come close to describing what I have seen on these tapes.

Thought it was a nightmare. Next afternoon was questioned by parent about bright lights. When I was 17 years old, I awoke in my underwear running from a bright light in my backyard. I was terrified. Next I awoke in my bed and vividly remembered running from the light.  I thought it was just a nightmare and went back to sleep.  The next day I woke up and looked at my watch that I had on been wearing overnight and realized that I was late for school.  I hurried and got dressed and rushed to school only to find that I was ~45 minutes early.  I thought nothing of it.  During my first period class, the girl that sat in the desk behind me asked me what day it was.  I told her the date and someone beside me said I was wrong. My watch was a day ahead.  This would not be strange except that I clearly remembered her asking me what day it was the day before the event and the date on my watch was correct.  Still I did not think about my nightmare, nor did I suspect anything more than a malfunctioning watch.  After school I returned to my home.  When I walked in my mom was in the kitchen.  I talked to her for a few minutes and told her about my day. Then she said something that chills me to the bone to this day.  She asked me if I saw a bright light out my window last night. She said the light woke her up and she wasn't real sure what it was and then it went away.  The window to her bedroom was on the same side of the house that I was on while running from the bright light. Our house is 100 yards from the road and our driveway is on the opposite side of the house.  I am not sure what happened to me, but I have a feeling that I may have been abducted.

I placed my order and walked off to watch the cars go by as my friends placed their orders. I don’t know what made me look up; maybe it was a sense of motion or movement that caught my eye. I looked up and I saw a dark triangle shaped object with three lighter shaded circles at each of the corners. The circles were not really lighter in color but maybe not as black. The object was just within the glow of the street lights being reflected off the street but not quite low enough to be fully illuminated. For some reason it seemed darker than the night sky above it. It moved at a very slow, deliberate pace as if not in any real hurry. It seemed like it was observing maybe. There was no sound either. It seemed to float or glide without any sound of any kind of propulsion. Whatever it was doing, it never increased its speed and slowly made its way down the street and disappeared into the dark.

It was a triangle, point up, with lights in rows inside the triangle, like diamonds.  I don't recall how many.  It could have been 6 (1 at the point, 2 in the next row, then 3 on the bottom row), or there was another row, making 10.  It wasn't moving and didn't make a sound.  I could see lights from helicopters and small planes heading towards it from every direction.  I jumped out of the car to see it better, but my kids freaked.  They ran to the house, begging me to open the door and come in.  They didn't want it to come get us.  My kids were very young at the time, the oldest about 7, the youngest at the time 4.

They showed up in the upper half of my windshield, near the top, and appeared to be moving eastward at a steady clip.  The objects must have been a considerable distance away yet appeared like two quite visible lights separated by three or four 'object' lengths.  Since it was rather cold, my car windows were up and I heard no noise. Suddenly, a tremendous explosion engulfed the front object, and it appeared to be desintegrating in a burst of flames.  The whole surrounding sky had lit up.  I was shaken by the spectacle because, subconsciously, I wanted to believe that the two objects were passenger planes, and here--one was desintegrating right in front of my eyes. I believe I slowed down, checked my driving, and then, the next moment, I saw only one object remaining, still travelling East.  There were no falling aflame parts of the structure.  One moment there was an object in the sky, the next--there was an explosion, and then the object was gone from the sky, as if rubbed out by a pencil eraser. Again, I did not hear the explosion, the objects were too far away anyway. I arrived home around midnight.  I asked my parents if there were any news about an airplane explosion/accident.  There were none.   The next morning, I read the newspapers and watched the TV News and heard nothing about the explosion I had witnessed the previous evening.  I believe I had called one of the local news agencies, but without results.   And yet, if I had witnessed the explosion, someone else must have seen it too.

Location: Observed from side street near major intersection of 43rd Ave. and Peoria Ave. Sighted multiple objects flying in formation, first noticed in SSE position moving south to north. Objects had a slight tan, copper toned color, which I at first thought might be the reflection of city streetlights. As they approached closer, nearly overhead, they appear uniform in color and seemed to be illuminated with a glow similar to Christmastime luminaria (candles placed in brown paper sacks or bags).  I could not tell the altitude of the objects.  They were moving due north in a wide “V” formation.  There were about ten objects in each arm of the “V” all the same rectangular (shaped like a postage stamp, slightly longer in the north-south dimension, the direction of travel).  Meantime, a commercial airliner was climbing out on a NE heading as if it were heading for Denver (very noisy) to my left that would place it over the far northwest area of Glendale, probably over 67th Ave. and Bell Rd. or slightly farther north, possibly over 67th Ave. and Union Hills Rd.  I was riding a bicycle on a dark side street facing east.  As I recall, the evening was clear and moonless.  I figured that the “V” formation would cross the path of the jet airliner and I would be able to get an idea of the altitude and size of the objects as they intersected with the airliner.  As the “V” formation approached overhead, slightly to the east, if low, possibly traveling above 35th Avenue. If higher, they possibly would be above Black Canyon Freeway (I-17), over the Metrocenter regional shopping mall.  The “V” formation was not directly overhead, but slightly to the east of me at an undetermined altitude. As I watched the “V” formation approach the point directly east of me, the objects did a coordinated maneuver: They moved out along the “V” and spun in a coordinated circular pattern and then moved close together in a circular group packed tightly but none of them overlapping.  They moved out of the “V” formation in opposite directions and formed two separated circular clusters.  In doing this complicated maneuver, they never changed speed or their north-south orientation.  The motion out of the “V” formation reminded me of the Paramount logo at the start of Hollywood movies where the star flow up an around the mountain forming a circle of stars. This happened out of the arms of the “V” forming a rotating circle of rectangular objects that then tightened the circle into a paced grouping also having a roughly circular perimeter with all the objects maintaining their north-south direction only now formed into two separate circular tightly packed cluster – still moving toward the jet airliner.  The separation between the two clusters was approximately the length of the ends of the “V” when I first saw it and when it reached the point direct east of me..  These objects continued moving due north and at some point would intersect the path of the jet airliner – either In front of it or behind it – at least one or the other of the now two separate circular tightly packed clusters.  The jet airliner continued NE.  The two clusters were moving toward the rear quarter of the plane and I was sure one of the cluster would intersect and pass over the plane either above it or below it and that would give me some idea of their relative size and altitude.  As the two clusters moved toward the rear quarter of the plane, probably at about a 45 degree angle if a passenger on the plane were looking back over the plane’s horizontal tail assembly.  As both clusters approached the plane and reached a point fairly close, both clusters simultaneously blinked invisible – as if the simultaneously and instantly turned on some kind of “cloaking” effect that rendered them invisible.  Neither cluster passed over or under the plane.  They just suddenly turned invisible.  The jet airliner continued it NE heading, the pilot or crew or passengers, unaware that a large cluster of rectangular objects had nearly intercepted it.  When I arrived home, about a half mile from where this sighting occurred, I looked in the White Pages and found two listings for UFO reporting.  The first one I called rang with no answer.  The second one I called, UFO Watch I think was the name, located in Fountain Hills east of Scottsdale.  The man I talked to said it was extremely unusual to see rectangular objects and even more unusual to see multiple rectangular objects.  He said the complex coordinated maneuvers I described the objects performing would not be possible from any current technology he was aware of.  The U.S. Air Force didn’t have anything capable of such a complicated, coordinated maneuver and they certainly would not perform something as complicated as the circular spin and tight formation clustering over a densely populated city such as Phoenix.  He told me to make a note of what I had seen and leave it at that.  He said no one would believe me.  I told him that I had two thoughts.  One was that this was the first UFO sighting I had ever experienced and couldn’t believe that it occurred over a metropolitan area.  I thought UFO sightings usually were seen over remote, rural areas.  And second, that this occurred in the early evening and surely I wasn’t the only one who had witnessed it.  People would be out playing tennis or shooting baskets or doing other outdoor activities and would have seen the same “V” formation and the maneuvers that I had seen.  I watched the news the next couple of days and never heard any report of such a sighting or similar UFO report.  I find it hard to believe that I was the only one who witnessed this unusual event.  There was a different sighting reported over Phoenix of some kind of unusual “lights” but they were moving in the opposite direction, from what I have heard, moving from north to south.  I told the man in Fountain Hills that I was sure that if I went out and purchased some video or photography equipment that it was unlikely that I would encounter such an unusual display of UFO mass coordinated maneuvers in the rest of my lifetime.  I probably would be wasting my time expecting to see such a sighting again and hoping to record it on videotape or on photographic film.  But what I had witnessed spanned about ten minutes at the most, maybe not that long.  The objects were not moving very fast, no faster than the jet airliner.  If I move my hand to trace the movement of the objects, the time lapse is more like one or two minutes, possibly less than one minute.  When I first saw the “V” formation, it was about halfway between the hor! izon to the SE and zenith looking due East.  This is the first time I have ever given a written report of that sighting.  I have told family and friends what I saw.  Each time a movie started showing the Paramount Pictures-Gulf & Western stars spinning in a circle, I would mention that’s what I saw those UFO objects do as they moved out of the “V” formation.

It moved with a pivoting action as it reached the shores of each part of the lake and It moved in the direction of each corner as if it had no designated front. It traveled slowly and at no time did I see it accelerate beyond that constant speed. Motivated by curiosity I decided to go to higher location on another nearby road that overlooked lake.

These objects were observed with the naked eye. Their initial appearance is a star in the sky; however, I viewed what appeared to be flashing lights which were red, yellow and blue. It appeared in a pattern of blue, yellow, and red. At first, I figured they were helicopters. After viewing these objects evening after evening, I used a low end set of binoculars to view these objects. I viewed serpentine shaped structures moving like a serpent. A program recently played on the history channel ""UFO Hunters"" played an episode of a video recording of a similar structure filmed by a local resident. One must realize I had never viewed the program until after my observations of two to three months. I have used a method using reference points in regards to the objects which proved to be moving, but not in the traditional sense of UFO's. I am not for sure if it is an aircraft or living organism. I have reently purchased a telescope and have viewed these objects. These objects are pie shaped which is evenly segmented into an estimated 10+/+ slices. The color is opaque with which has the appearance of electrical flashes and the three light spectrums are viewed. It appears to be spinning. They do not move rapidly across the sky (appearance of yellow stars on first observation, then one can view the three flashing colors if paying attention)), but sometimes move out of the telescope fixed and locked position. I must adjust the telescope fixed and locked settings to re~obtain the object in the viewing lens. This supports the object is moving. The objects can move vertical or horizontal and are there for up to 4 to 6 hours.  There is always very active chemtrail activity; however, my chembusters have provided me views of the objects while the skies are complete haze around my vicinity. I am positive what I am seeing is not terrestrial. I have never seen anything like it. I am seeing these objects every time the sky is clear.  I am a strong believer of science and have a very technical/technology back round. Something is going on and I would love to understand it all. I am continuing my observations and educating myself on this matter. Also, I am a six year veteran whom maintained air traffic control radar systems for air craft carriers.

((location deleted)),  Shape: Changing Duration:10 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54403.html,"Daytime changing Balloon-like phenomena 	TO THE EDITOR:  DO NOT RELEASE MY CITY OR STATE, the GUYS will be able to find out my identity too easily!   Leave off the particulars after the report, they would divulge my identity..  Report follows:   On September 11th, 1999, a fine Sunday afternoon, I was in the backyard when I saw an odd thing almost directly overhead..  It was about 7 PM. The weather was warm and partly cloudy with some thick clouds overhead but a bright day with the sun shining most of the time. 	Up in the clouds (I'd estimate the cloud base at 7000 or so) was an almond shaped zone of brilliant shimmering silvery cloud, like it had a light source in it.  It was shaped like a football, with pointed ends.  It didn't move and I stared at it for about a minute or two. 	Glancing around I saw what looked like five parachutes, stacked one above the other like a team event where they 'hook-up' and come down as a unit.. Only there were no parachutists or shrouds, and all the canopies were deep red in color.  Not illuminated, but just like dark red fabric.  These were lower in the sky, off to the east less than a half-mile from me. 	About this time, I yelled for my girlfriend who was inside, but she didn't answer, so I looked back and the entire scene had changed. 	Now there were two large, round balloon-like things right in front of me, not a hundred feet up.  I was stunned and just kept my eyes on them, trying not to blink.  They were round, apparently made of orange and white material in a high visibility pattern. The were arranged like this- orange square, white square, orange square, alternating in a regular design.  The two were identical.  Then they start to pulsate rapidly, moving toward each other and away at a fast rate, maybe 5 times per second. (These figures are just estimates of course, but I'm trying to tell what I saw.) 	At this point, dark lines appeared between the two round 'balloons' like it was trying to run cords or ropes to each of the 'balloons'. Here's where I always get a chill because this next part is so entirely impossible in our reality, yet here I was staring at the impossible, right in front of my eyes, broad daylight.  You folks who want to see this sort of thing, had better realize that it can really upset your world view, confidence in scientific theory and law, in just a minute or two of time. 	The top 'balloon' sprouted (from it's top side) another rapidly inflating balloon.  Now there were three, linked together oriented vertically, they weren't in a straight line, but loosely organized vertically, all of them bobbing a bit as they drifted (thankfully) away from me.  One more balloon sprouted in the next few seconds for a total of 4 in front of me, now in the shape of a capital letter 'L'.  After turning and yelling for my girlfriend to get the video tape camera, I looked back and (get this) what looked like a yellow sash or big ribbon  was dangling down the length of the display and fluttering below the now SQUARE objects. Yes, they were now square and the orange and white was a huge checkerboard pattern of dull orange and slightly dingy white square areas.  The material now showed a texture as though it were made of weathered vinyl.  Like an old lawn furniture covering.  I was doubting my own eyes, thinking I must be having some sort of hallucination. 	Girl friend FINALLY appeared and by now the whole thing had moved off to the east-northeast about a thousand yards.  I pointed it out to her, she saw it, (thank goodness!) so I asked her what she saw.  She said someone's flying a box-kite.  I look back out there and it looks like a three tiered box-kite with two lines draping down about twice its length, and the tips of the lines were bent 90 degrees to the left. 	My girlfriend noticed two silver beads high in the sky, some distance apart.  Each looked the same size, like the head of a pin at arms length.  They were motionless, and each was in a sort of blurry field. 	After a bit, I couldn't find these 'beads', and it was over. 	Now I have seen things of a bizarre nature in the sky before, which is why I watch the sky when I'm outside.  But if my own mother told me the above story, I would never believe her.  I'd figure she was 'nuts'.  Like you are thinking I am nuts right now.  Ah, but I have a theory....  			A HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION?  	This occurred within one and a half miles of a very large Air Force base.  A base known for its engineering facilities.  The technology I witnessed was beyond any known to laymen; for instance, the hovering beads and the almond shaped shimmering cloud.  I doubt the Air Force did this, but who knows what technology all those billions have wrought.  One factor deleterious to the secret technology argument is, why?  Why do this to a regular citizen when it could be tested by sworn-to-secrecy personnel?  It is possible they wanted to see if they could create panic in people, and were waiting breathlessly by the phone to see who would call in the freaky report.  No one panicked, because it was a harmless display, and too bizarre for anyone with any sense to even report.. They would sound insane.  Did they want to see if panic ensued, maybe?  I'll never know.  			CRAZY ALIENS FROM SPACE?   	It may have been extra-terrestrials, UFO aliens.. but how pointless, to perform these antics and then disappear.  If it was alien, they acted like children playing around with their shape-shifting antics.  I doubt the UFO alien theory.  The whole display was irritatingly absurd.  			  THE OLD DECEIVER?  	The Bible says Lucifer is the ""Prince of the spirits of the air"". A well read Bible believer knows that Hell is not doing business YET.  The demons of Lucifer flit about the atmosphere doing what they can to deceive men into discrediting God and His Word.  Over the ages men have seen fairies, leprechauns, elves, werewolves, and now bug-eyed aliens.  Maybe they were all the same energy or entities in differing guises.  Play acting in roles to deceive men, causing them to stumble in their faith in the Lord. 	Historical ufo occupant sightings from the 1950's and 60's reported witnesses having conversations with these 'occupants'.  The stories they told these farmers and quaint townspeople were idiotic.  Saying they were from Venus, or Mars and they ask for water and other mundane, easily obtained items.  They took them inside and showed them their blinking lights and knobs and buttons, but the people never brought back any useful info or evidence. The entire episode might have been a demonstration of mind control.  Creating hallucinations in the human mind at will, to baffle and awe the poor schleps.  Like me.  No physical object could do the maneuvers and appearance/disappearance of these things.  The 90 degree turns, instant acceleration to tremendous speeds, all testify to a non-material object. This would explain much.  Out of a thousand ufo reports, maybe ten will describe similar or identical objects.  Like they were all unique and instantly changeable.  This would be easier if the object were a controlled hallucination, nothing would be impossible in this scenario.  None of it was real. 		The question is, why would I type all this, (I'm no typist) and tell this stupid sounding (I could invent a much more intriguing disc story) report, unless it were true, and so strange I still have trouble describing it.  I only ever told the whole story to one person, my late brother.  He believed me.  	I am a 51 year old  USAF veteran of 12 years service, I attained the rank of E-5 with a line number for E-6 as a 32172p, Weapons control system mechanic on McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantoms.  (C and D models) I have the Air Force Achievement medal and many others, Honorably discharged in the middle 80's.  I work as a control panel builder for a small local company specializing in electro-plating and corrosion control. 	 	So believe what you will, I don't 'swear-to-God' about things as this is a sinful practice and is not necessary.  I don't mind you not believing, because I doubt I would believe this strange stuff were you reporting it to me..;) 	It happened September 11, 1999, from 6:55 to 7:05 pm.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,,

First I want to say that the Chicago O'Hare UFO report on CNN yesterday (1/5/07) was inspiring and it helped me discover your organization to share my story. At about 2200 hrs (10:00 pm) June 30th, 2000, I was resting in bed and gazing up at stars through 2 skylites in my home.  My home is situated on almost six acres of woods near  the Ward Pound Ridge reservation.   I suddenly noticed a bright, bluish white, xenon light streak into view and stop. It began to zig and zag, stopping briefly at the end of each zig and zag and going from one skylite to the other. Almost as if it was looking in.  I screamed to my husband to come see and he ran from the bathroom.   We ran to the north facing windows of our room and observed its zigs and zags over the tree tops, in the direction of the reservation, for several minutes.  It moved laterally, diagonally and horizontally  and always stopping briefly at the end of its movement.   Its size, as we observed it streaking over the treetops, was similar to a small plane's from that distance.  It struck us as very similar to a firefly and we wondered if it might have been a firefly but later we saw real fireflies and they had softly green glowing bodies, clustered around each other, and did not move like this bright bluish white light did.  Fireflies also did not suddenly streak off into the sky at the incredible speed that this bright light did when it was done doing whatever it was doing.    The light returned two nights later and we were able to observe it once more, now really amazed and acting like children we were high-fiving each other and yelling ""we saw a UFO! and it came back to visit us!"" The incredible speed that this light/object was moving at was truly unusual.  We've watched planes go by and I've even spotted satellites at night moving slowly  along the sky, meteorites, comets, etc, nothing moved like this thing.

I was coming back from the second shop to get a part.  I glanced up to see something I have never seen in my life that stopped me in my tracks and totally speechless.  It was tear drop shaped but the sides were straight not concave and rounded at the front.  It was an orange, red and yellow distinctive but blend of these colors.  Kind of looked like it was on fire or flaming but was not pulsing or flickering.  It seemed like a cut out picture that was suspended in the sky but I knew this was NOT the case. I stood and watched it for a few minutes as it seemed to be heading straight for the ground maybe 1,000 feet or so up.  I caught myself watching in an almost trance-like state I kind of snapped myself out of and thought, ""I HAVE to get someone else to confirm what I am seeing is just that!"".  I knew I wasn't having dillusions, was well rested, not hung over OR on ANY medication. (legal or otherwise)  I briskly headed for the main shop to get the shop foreman because we were the only ones there at the moment.  I went into the office and asked him with much firmness in my voice he needs to come here to see this.  He asked what it was but I just blurted out, ""Just come here. You have to see this!"".   He followed me with out question as I quick stepped it the spot I was standing earlier.  I stopped at the same spot and pointed backwards to the object and replied, ""WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!"".  He turned in the southern direction I pointed and froze solid...speechless as well.  Blank stare on his face. After a couple minutes I asked him again. ""What the hell is that?"" He said,  ""Charlie, I really don't know"" in an awe stricken fashion. So, we just stood there for a few minutes more then the object seemed to turn due south very gradually but it didn't bend, flex or change its looks when it did.  It was smaller looking after the turn south and seemed to slowly continue until it got too small to see any more.  It left no trail, residue and had no evidence of being a ""made"" or ""built"" thing.  No lights or anything that people typically report with ufos. This all took place maybe 1 mile south of the Louisville, KY, international airport.  About 1/2 mile west of I-65 and about 1/2 mile south of I-265.  So close to the air port and never heard anything about it on the news or from others.  It seemed to be bigger than the good year blimp.  I can't even be sure it was a craft but it seemed to move with a definite purpose. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was driving my daughter and her friends back from the haunted trail on Halloween night, heading away from Jasper on Hwy 78.   We were about to enter the big curve, before the river bridge, when I saw a strange light.  As we came around the curve, I saw the disc shaped object just long enough to make out the shape and see the beautiful lights on it.  It was a perfectly round shape, flat on top and on bottom, with lights going all around the edges.   These lights had the most beautiful color and it was a color I still have a hard time identifying (I have never seen the same exact color in my lifetime and I am now 45 yrs old). The color that comes closest to matching would be a mix of gray and purple with a misty pink hue to it.  It was brilliant and really beautiful.  The lights seemed to be circling the craft, but could have been blinking. I did not hear any noise with this sight at all.  This was only within my sight for a brief but exciting minute!  It flew off at a left angle then made a sharp right, around the bend at the bridge and was gone in the fog, moving very fast.  One of my daughters friends was in the front with me and she and I discussed it again last month.  She barely remembers because they were young teens, but she does remember me saying ""Look, there's a UFO!""  My excitement over UFO's all my life made this VERY exciting for me, I really did not have any fear.  After reaging about the Chicago O'Hare Airport sighting and finding your link, I made the decision to report it here.  Felt it was important to add it to the list of US sightings.

We were laying on our backs looking at a clear night sky, with approximately 160 degrees of sky visible.  I am the son of an aeronautics engineer, and have been raised around all types of commercial and military aircraft.  I grew up near an Air Force base, and have observed hundreds of various aircraft in flight, both at night and in the daytime. This particular night, while viewing the stars, an object moved toward us from the south.  It was very dark and difficult to determine the shape.  It had one distinguishing feature:  a single pulsing red light on the bottom of the craft.  The size of the pulsing light led me to determine that the craft was only a few hundred feet off the ground, yet the craft was moving at a high rate of speed with absolutely no sound.   My experience tells me that only a jet-propelled craft or very high-powered turboprop could move at this speed, typically with lots of noise associated, particularly at this altitude.   This craft was absolutely silent.  It moved south to north, spanning my field of vision in less than 15 seconds.   My wife and I both saw the craft and corroborated what we had seen and agreed completely that we had witnessed a craft that did not exist in any records or memory that we had.  That is all.

I was traveling east on Ga. Hwy 36, approx. 2 miles east of exit 201 on I-75, and my attention was drawn to thunderheads in front of me where frequent cloud-to-cloud lightning was occurring. After observing several lightning flashes, I saw a large rectangular object passing among the clouds. It did not appear to be moving very fast at all; rather, it seemed to be gliding. Based on the apparent altitude and distance, I could not estimate size; it had to have been enormous. At no time was the entire object visible; I could see (from my perspective) the rear and lower-right sides of the object. It was like a large silver ingot in that it was flattened, with an obvious thickness approximately 1/10 of its width. The most unusual aspect was that although it appeared to be dark in color, when lightning flashed near it, the object was opalescent; it had an oily, reflective shine that magnified the brightness of the lightning. It also remained lit for at least one second after each lightning flash. 	I observed the object for at least 45 seconds while traveling on Hwy 36; I turned south on High Falls Rd and traveled approximately 200 yards (the object was in view the entire time), and pulled off the road to continue viewing it. I sat on the hood of my car and watched until it was out of sight among the clouds, approximately 3-4 minutes; even after the object was behind/within the clouds I could see the glow from the reflected lightning for several seconds until I drove away and the object and clouds were hidden behind the treeline.	 	The area I observed this is relatively flat, open pasture with two roads (Hwy 36 and High Falls) intersecting at right angles; little or no artificial lighting; the above mentioned treeline is east of High Falls Rd and south of 36. The object and clouds appeared to be 10-15 miles distant, as the thunderheads were not reflecting any ambient light from Jackson, roughly 7 miles east of the observation site. The object was approximately 30 degrees above the horizon, traveling east (away from me) very slowly. At no time did I hear any sounds from the object (the distance was too great anyway), nor did it appear to have any lights of its own. It was just a huge slab of metal with squared edges floating in the sky. 	I’m sorry I can not be more specific about the date; I do know that my oldest son, born in June of 2000, was almost 1 year old; the sighting would have occurred in late spring of 2001.

Sonic boom? I don't know... I remember two seperate events. The first one happened in June or July of 1986. I was 8 years old. I witnessed what I thought was a Meteor shower. We had a thunderstorm that afternoon, complete with warnings. I believe it was on a Sunday.   Anyway, I liked storms for some reason.  Especially afterwards because I would look for rainbows. Well, as I watched out of the back door through the screen door...I saw a the sky start to turn a brilliant orange/red color.  I mean this was a deep orange-red (almost like dusk, but it was too early in the day for this).  The next thing I know I saw a few fireballs rain down.  I called for my family to come look.  I mean these objects were on fire.  I thought that it was judgement day or something but I wasn't scared. Which is why I thought it was because noone was concerned. We all had this euphoria going on. They were round and it looked like fire was around them. I mean they were showering, however, no one was concerned about them starting a fire.  I don't remember what happened after that.  Also, nobody in my family remembers it.  I have asked several people around town and they really don't remember.  A few people I asked that are around my age say they remember about as much as I do...and nothing after.  The rest of the day is just sort of blank.  I try to remember myself and it's hazy what happened afterward.  However, I do remember not hearing any fire engines or anything.  This has bugged me for years.  I guess it could be dismissed as a meteor shower but I can't find any reports and nobody remembers.  What happened?   The second incident was about four years or so after that(circa 1990).  I can't remember what year but it was the summer time and as I looked outsid in mid-afternoon I heard a awesomely loud clangy like sound.  My first thought was that it was an accident but where was the screeching tire sound? The clanging metal sound lasted too long for a MVA! It sounding more like a symbol as it pulsated outward. The musician in me noticed that it almost changed tone as it moved (like someone running their fingers across piano keys, but imagine keys sounding like metallic chimes with tones sounding almost identical but still different). A good example is the movie War of the Worlds (newer version) the sound the tripods made right before they fire the weapons. I looked down out of the window and saw people running outside. They were hollering what was that?! My dad was hollering too. It was on the news. They said that there were no military planes in the area and the airport didn't even have any planes in the air at that moment. Also, this spread out over the entire county. Wild. I have never heard anything else about it...not even the next day. Also, I haven't heard anything else like this since then. Someone should investigate these two incidents.

My girlfriend and I decided to go to Zuma Beach in California just north of Malibu late one evening. She had a recent model Pontiac ((type deleted)).  She borrowed the car from her step mother for the evening.  She had a curfew and we decided we should start heading back from the beach toward home in the West San Fernando Valley. We left Zuma at a quarter to 1:00AM. She drove and we took PCH (Highway 1) for approx. a few minutes to Malibu Canyon Rd. Turned onto Malibu Cyn towards the 101 freeway and the SFV. There was no one around that intersection prior to turning onto Malibu Canyon. I noticed that there were no other cars on the road behind us or in front of us at that moment, and I had a clear view as we began to crest the first part of Malibu Canyon Rd from the ocean for about a mile ahead as we began to twist and turn on the sinuous canyon road ahead. It was a clear evening. Excellent visibility. We past by the Hughes Research Lab where they test satellites for aerospace. No noticeable activity that evening. Sometimes the huge box that camo colored would be open and they would have something they would be testing. Not this night though. We had a cassette tape playing in the stereo, it was the kind of tape player that would change sides automatically. The event began as we neared the tunnel. I looked out the passenger seat window to my right into the darkness of the canyon and I felt like I saw something out of the corner of my eye only to be staring into darkness. The Canyon is wide to my right and the cliff is a 500-700 foot drop off.  My feeling was that there was something there though which made no sense to me at the time. I shrugged it off quickly and let her concentrate of driving the car. I didn't want to alert her to something that was only a feeling. We went through the tunnel, and emerged from the other side. That is when I began to notice a “brightness” from behind our car develop, as if there was someone behind us who was going to need to pass us soon since they were coming at a good rate of speed. I turned to look at my girlfriend and she was upset that someone would want to race pass her this late at night. It was a weeknight and nobody usually would be on this road on a weeknight anyway. Maybe someone racing someone in the canyon..  The light grew to the point where she squinted her eyes, and flipped the mirror. I remember the bright reflection across her eyes at this point from the rear view mirror was still a very bright reflection across her face and she had to then move her head to avoid being blinded from that point on. The light was from behind the our car, it did not “flood the compartment”, but what the light touched it appeared almost perfectly while, perhaps like a sodium light or probably a flash from a camera except a constant incredible blinding brightness. She began to accelerate. The mood changed quickly from being upset to being worried that some jerk was trying to ! run us o ff the road or chase us through the canyon. That is when I turned around to give this jerk the universal hand signal to back off. As I turned around to look at the person driving, I had to squint  as if I was looking at the sun when I turned around. I thought I saw something that looked a large station wagon, except the lights went all the horizontally across the grill of the car following us. They were square and they were not quite like lights with light bulbs that cars have. They were more like flood lamps for a football stadium. They were slightly larger. I turned around quickly as to not be blinded by the light. I turned to look at my girlfriend and she was becoming panicked. I told her to go as fast as possible. She got the car up to 75-85MPH  and back down on the turns.. I rememebr the tires were screaming on the turns.. Even the slightest straightaway she would bring it back up to around 80.  I turned around again, and the light had not changed distance to our car. It had remained approx less than 10 feet off of her rear bumper. It was impossible to shake them. The second time I turned around, I did not see a station wagon. I saw a grill of lights. There was no glare from a chrome bumper like you would find on a station wagon. The light would burn like if you were sitting in front of a TV set too close for too long, like a very powerful tanning booth on full blast. My girlfriend was starting to under compensate her steering, and I told her take her foot off the gas. She refused and she was screaming at this point. I put hand on her leg and told her to use the whole road, both lanes. Anyone in front of us would see the light and have to pull over. The next thing that happened was very strange. The light was gone. It simply ended. I turned around, saw that it was gone. I looked really hard to see if it had turned off, or if there was a shadow under the street lights.. and there was nothing. It was completely gone. My girlfriend was shaking. I told her to pull the car over to the side of the road. S! he refus ed. She didn't speak a word for the rest of the trip. I tried my best to tell her everything was alright, and that it was gone, whatever it was.  I flipped her rear view mirror visor back down. I kept an eye on her for the rest of the drive back into town. She was different, and I was very worried at this point about something and I didn't know what it was. Something was wrong. For the rest of the drive I just let  her drive the car, and she drove straight back to her parents house in Tarzana, way at the top of Vanalden, south of the Ventura Blvd. The drive felt odd, yet very calm and relaxed. Like waking after a nightmare after you are done being frightened half to death.. She parked, and sat there for a minute before turning the engine off. I noticed two things at this point as she just sat there almost in shock. The tape player had stopped playing the tape. The tape was completely done on one side as I ejected it. It didn't flip or changed sides automatically.. I put the tape back in, and it changed to the other side automatically that it normally would have. I then ejected it and put it in my pocket. I looked at the clock. It took a full ten seconds to wrap my brain around what it said. It said 1:12AM.  My mind went back to Zuma and it was 15 minutes to 1:00AM. We entered the Canyon at at least 12:55, and somehow we traveled all that way to her house in < 13-15 minutes, which is impossible.  I asked her about it the next day, and she vaguely remembered it. After summer she went home, out of state,  where her real family was living. We had lost contact with each other. I wrote her but she never wrote me back.. I came up to visit her a couple of months later, and she wouldn't talk to me the whole time. I only would talk with her brother who was also a good friend of mine. We didn't have a nasty breakup. There was no reason for her acting this way, that I would have been aware of. I tried to think back to whatever it could have been... I asked her brother to ask her about the incident in the canyon, and if that was the reason, because that was the only thing bad that ever happened. She told him she didn't remember anything happening in Malibu Canyon. He said it was like she blocked out the entire summertime we spent together out of her mind. I was horribly heartbroken by this, and I returned home to LA. This incident happened in 88'. Years later when I grew into adulthood I had a few nice cars.. Eventually I got a sport car. I still try to attempt to beat that record time I did in the canyon. The fastest I can make it from PCH and Malibu Canyon to the the valley is 22 minutes. That is hauling and screaming the tires the whole way, not just part of the way.  I even got a ticket for it once by the Malibu Sheriff in all my years of reliving that drive... My only speeding ticket in my life. ha..  She eventually grew up to be a burn patient specialist and married someone from her church. I have heard about stories of people who had lost time. Somehow I gained time or “froze” time going through the canyon in that car that night that I still can not explain why to the best of all my ability. For a while I thought I wanted to attribute what happened to the Hughes Research Lab that is located inside that canyon, the only facility. I don't know why, just my own intuition. I can't say I saw a UFO. I never saw it leave the ground. I never saw anything land from above. I felt like there was something just prior to entering the tunnel and it would have been floating approx 500+ feet above the canyon gully next to the road we were on. 1. 2.Perhaps what followed us could have been the Sheriff or some kid in a V8 muscle car. I didn't hear it make any noise above the sound of the Pontiac's V6 motor. Whatever it was was not car in my opinion. I did not have KC headlights. They were larger and square and not incandescence lights. They were the most perfectly while lights I have ever seen in my whole life, and they wrapped around the entire front of whatever you want to call it.. I just call it the “grill” of the front of whatever it was. A rectangle entirely made up many large rectangular lights. Approx 16 of them. That part bothers me. I haven't found anything that has that kind of light configuration on any type of vehicle ever. It could  have been a practical joke, maybe some teenagers were waiting for someone like us to be coming thought he canyon late on a weeknight. Whatever followed us that night, came up fast, and stayed perfectly on the bumper of the Pontiac and stayed perfectly behind us on ever turn, and matched our speed perfectly for at least 10-15 heartracing minutes.. As soon as we saw the lights of the city ahead then it was gone like someone turning off a switch. It didn't have tires that screamed. I am still very bothered by what happened. I have waited until now to post this hoping somehow after all these years I would have some way of explaining it, after all my research, and I do not. I will admit that I'm a huge fan of Sci-fi books. And I'm a big nerd into systems engineering and that is what I do for a living. I'm a big nerd today. There is some missing time I'm dealing with still. I'm no longer bothered by what happened. It happens so long ago now. I actually enjoy driving that same road at night sometimes, hoping whatever it was would return. Kinda. Sorta. Maybe not.  I have seen some strange lights over the Hughes Labs.. I have told just a few close friends this story. My only witness, my girlfriend can not recall this happening. Her brother remembers my conversation with him about asking her, but that is all. I'm le! ft alone with this memory today.. I wanted to share it here in case someone else has had a similar incident in Malibu Canyon or frozen time.  That's all I have. Thank you. You may edit this to however you wish for brevity but I wanted to put as much detail as I can still remember and feeling for the moment and also with my own conclusion. I'm a UCSC grad, and I own my own company and have a house in Venice Beach, California.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,34.06816860465116,-118.8163988372093

Myself and 5 friends were headed home from a regional Fair in Grey TN. The Fair is about an hours drive from my home. It was just before midnight. The area in which we live is rural, and situated in the Blue Ridge Mountains. There is a stretch of Highway 19-E between Hampton, TN and the TN-NC state line that winds through an area with very few homes, no homes or businesses at all in some places. The road is a narrow, 2 lane in most places with no street lights. I was driving, my Aunt was in the passenger seat, and three of my friends were in the back seat, 6 of us total were in the car. The evening had been one of too much cotton candy, corn dogs, and oversized stuffed animals won at overpriced games of ""skill""! We were driving along,everyone was laughing and talking at the same time, the radio was playing. Each person, trying to outshout the other. There was basically no traffic at all on the road as it was getting late, at least for most people in this area. We were only about 7 minutes from my house when we rounded a curve and saw what appeared to be a highly illuminated area in the road ahead, I was the first to notice, and it took a few seconds to put together what was happening. I slowed and realized that the road was illuminated...from above. I looked up and could not believe my eyes, by this time everyone had fallen silent and I came to a complete stop in the middle of the road. Hovering about 40-50 feet above and in front of us was what I would describe as a ""textbook"" UFO. For anyone who has never seen a UFO, it is almost impossible to describe the feelings/emotions that you experience. Your logical mind says impossible, you're dreaming, hallucinating, whatever, but it can't be real, and yet there it is. It's overwhelming. Above us was a HUGE, black, triangle shaped craft with slightly rounded corners. On each of the three points it had very bright hallogen type lights shining straight down, and the front light seemed to have the ability to aim it's beam somewhat. There may have been a few very small lights of other colors (a couple of my friends said they saw them, I cannot say that I saw anything but the three large white lights). The craft was hovering, and was completely silent. There was no sign of air displacement or means of flight whatsoever. The craft swayed and bobbed slightly like a mylar balloon in a still quiet room, just very slight movement. I put the car in park and looked around to see everyone in the car stretching to the nearest window for a view with their mouths hanging open, and a look of astonishment on their faces. What stands out the most in my mind in how utterly silent everything had become. As if by instinct, I turned to open the door to get out and my Aunt grabbed my arm and said ""NO SIR...you're not getting out of this car!! What is that thing? You could get killed!"" I told her it was fine, and when everyone saw that I was getting out, they too decided to do the same. Carefully, as if we were sneaking up on something, we opened the doors of the car (all but my Aunt),and we stepped out of the car. There was not a single cloud in the sky, nor any sign of traffic, wind or sound....it was eerily silent. Time stood still for us at that point. Whether the craft was truly observing us, or if it just appeared to be, we stood there looking up at this thing drifting ever so slowly towards us, looking back, it must have looked like an Old West standoff! Several minutes passed of staring up at the enormous otherworldy machine, and then glancing at each other. Not a single word was spoken by any of us, except the occasional plea from my Aunt to ""get my A-- back in the car and lock the door!"" After some time, I suddenly had the thought to reach inside and toot the car horn. The very SECOND I did so...the craft rose straight up about 15-20 ft. and shot straight back over us and disappeared over the tree tops. We all jumped back in the car and did a sharp U-turn and drove as fast as I could in the direction of the craft. We were able to follow it probably 7 miles or so before it picked up speed and disappeared over the hilltop. The rest of the drive home was a mix of emotions... from disbelief, to laughter, to ""what should we do?...who should we tell?"" To this day, none of us can explain what we saw, nor have we ever witnessed anything else that compares. I have a couple of times since seen things that made me wonder, and mysterious lights that seemed to have abilities beyond human technology, but NOTHING to hold a candle to what happened to us that night. I have always said how glad I am that I was not alone that night. Having 5 other witnesses makes it so much more solid. I understand the people who disbelieve, or have reservations on this subject. Looking back over what I have written tonight, it sounds so unreal. It WAS unreal, believe me. There are certainly a lot of hoaxes and misinformation out there, sad to say. I can assure you however, if you ever have an experience like we had that August night, your world will change. If there is one thing that I can say with the deepest, most sincere conviction of my heart...my friends and I saw something that is not a part of this world and time as we know it. Spacecraft from another planet? Time travelers? Beings from another dimension? I wouldn't even begin to speculate, but let me assure you of this one thing, without ANY reservations or hesitation, WE ARE NOT ALONE AND ARE BEING VISITED AROUND THIS PLANET EVERY DAY. That, my friend, is an absolute certainty.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,36.2064,-81.9538

I have to report what I witnessed, however it doesn’t match anything that has ever been reported.  It was January 1990 and snow had fallen the night before. The sky was completely cloud free and there was a full moon. I was heading home around 3:30 am traveling along a road that ran next to a river, and the moon light reflected off of the snow almost making it seem like day time. I suddenly felt as though I was being watched, the hairs on  my whole body stood up. I looked into my rear view mirror, only to see myself sitting in the back seat., and for an instance, almost a blink of an eye, I saw myself driving while I was sitting in the back seat. At this point I was starting to feel very confused and everything seemed surreal. I peered out of my window up at the full moon, which was in the ten o’clock position, and that’s when the really bizarre happened. The only way I can describe it was like the movie Predator, I didn’t see lights in the sky, but just the opposite. It was the absence of light, like a blackhole. Some iris shaped crafted passed between me and the moon, obscuring it from sight, similarly to an eclipse. It was like the moon was gone, and then the craft passed and the moon started to appear. I was only a few minutes from my home when this took place, and when I arrived my dog, a German Shepard named Trooper, was agitated and barking furiously. Normally at this time he is sleeping and can’t be bothered to get up. When I opened the door  Trooper ran out the door and across the road and into the woods.  I was still out of sorts from the previous few minutes, but I decided I needed to bring him in for the night. Trooper barked and chased after something  into the woods.  I called to him from the road for about a minute only to hear him attacking something, and then he let out a yelp. All went silent. I had no idea what just happened.  Seconds later Trooper ran by me and straight to the house and cried for me to let him in. Looking back into the woods I started to get that fee! ling aga in that someone or  something was watching me. Once inside Trooper ran and hid behind the couch. I pulled him out and checked him for any signs of a fight. I couldn’t find any cuts or scratches on him.  	Years later I thought about what I could have witnessed. Trying to come up with some kind of explanation for what took place. The only conclusion I can make comes straight out  of sci-fi. Remember this is my hypothesis of the night, not anything based  in science fact. Perhaps some sort of temporal wake was generated by this unknown craft. And this temporal wake gave me the perception that I saw myself in the backseat, and the perception of me in the backseat seeing me drive. I can’t explain this, however I would have thought that someone else would have had a similar experience by now, and maybe even a theory would have been generated. I can’t be alone in this type of UFO phenomenon.  As for what happened to my dog Trooper. This only deepens the mystery, for which I can’t say the two events are connected.  However I’m curious if there has ever been any other such encounters reported or maybe you can offer another theory as to my experience.  I seek honest answers.

Singular object splits in two, lights fly across sky. On one evening around Dec 19-20 1993 (approx the date of Hubble's first repair mission, either the launch evening or the evening of the repair) a friend and I witnessed a Ufo fly over the area of Ottumwa, Iowa.  We had heard on television that NASA were working on the Hubble and we wanted to see if the shuttle was visible at all, my friend and I grabbed our binoculars and stepped out into the driveway of my home. We were looking all over (we really had no idea where the shuttle or telescope would be, we were simply enthusiastic teens looking around)  5 minutes or so go by... my friend was looking Southeast and I looked toward the Northeast for a while and paused, I then saw what appeared to be a shooting star, instantly it splits into two balls of light (i then told my friend to look at it) we both watched as the two lights flew in formation from Northeast to Southeast, their behavior was very bizarre and exciting to watch, they flew as if a ribbon had been placed up in the sky and they were following the shape of it, going up and down irregularly, the lights flew from left to right across the horizon like this. My friend was clever enough to grab his binoculars and watch as it trailed off into the horizon, all he could say was ""no, way! no, way! because we both thought at the time we had just seen a Ufo. He reported the object was disc shaped through his binoculars after he watched it trail off into the distance.. I can't verify that it was, as all I saw were two lights.  These objects were witnessed for approximately 8-10 seconds, they crossed our field of view in that time and emitted no noise that we could hear. From our point of view the object entered from the Northeast, splt in two, travelled south and exited Southeast..  Many years later I heard of the phenomena of ball lighting, I thought perhaps that was what we had seen but the two light sources seemed to fly with each other the entire time. If I were to guess the altitude, over 1,000 feet above ground, probably anywhere from 1,000 - 5,000 would be my best guess, it appeared to be rather close from where we stood. There is a communications tower near here, it flew above and behind that at a distance. Speed, most likely over 1,000mph, It crossed our field of view in 8 seconds or so. I can't remember the color of the lights, all I remember is thinking the object was a shooting star at first..     I can provide an illustration of what we saw or a high quality animation if needed. I am an artist, it is actually easier for me to show what we saw than describe it. It would be an approximation however, I can't remember the exact details as it has been many years, the memory is still fairly vivid though..  Just thought I'd report this incase there was a similar sighting in the area on or around that date. This is 100% for real, no bs.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,41.0387,-92.35789999999999

I was flying along in a B737 at about FL280 going west bound from say Philadelphia to Cleveland, and over western Pennsylvania in an area where there were virtually no lights coming from homes or other obvious public dwellings and over an area with very hilly or rugged looking topography/terrain, I saw these 'Globes' seemingly coming up out of the trees, fairly dense growth, and moving around.  At first it was just one or two, then more and more of them, moving small distances then moving at accelerated rates and large distances. I tried to discern a pattern or patterns and none came to mind however they seemed to move in some grid like patter, very fast and I would estimate a mile or two at a time.  They move a distance then settle down into the trees, then rise up above the trees and race off to the next destination, and go down below the trees.  Watching all of them move over this hilly terrain was most unusual and I haven't seen anything like it since. Occasionally I'll see some mention of these red 'Globes' on some UFO show or report and think about what my First Officer and I witnessed. I don't believe it was man made, but something else.  The patterns or grids they were moving would, or at least to me, seemed almost in retrospect, computer generated and not some natural cause.  The whole thing was clear, clear as can be, which I've never reported or written about, frankly I've told few people with little detail on what we saw.

(link to my case at bottom)  -----------------------  My story;  I lived in a travel camper about 100 feet from my parents house on their property which adjoined my grandparents property at the bottom of a mountain, Virginia, in Roanoke. There was a field 8 acres in size between my parent's and grandparent's homes. One night, it was getting late around 11 p.m., I started hearing some dogs bark (we had no dog, it must have been neighbors in a distance) and went to look out of the tiny window in the back side of the camper and across the field. I saw a light in the woods about 200 feet down from my grandparent's home (on my grandparent's property). It was going around a tree and stayed in the same place the whole time. The family sometimes let a hunter racoon/squirrel hunt? so I wondered if it could be him. After watching several minutes, the light went out. I went back and looked a few minutes later and it was back on, but soon went out again. I left, came back, and each time the light would be on and go off when I looked and kept doing this in sinc with me watching or not like it was playing a game. Then suddenly a red light shot up out of the woods and over the ridge (like a flare?) Then nothing. I left the window again.  This was a little disturbing, so after a few minutes I had to go look again. There was a HUGE triangular craft headed from the direction where the flare was toward the field. It was going VERY slowly and low. It was totally dark, no interior lights, and no normal exterior lights except one long red light that went completely from front to back of the craft. It's flying altitude stayed below that of the mountain peak. It took a long time to go from over the field, to the peak and when it reached the peak, it went beside it and behind it. Then it seemed (later realized a much smaller craft) to circle behind the peak and come back around the other side of it and it started coming back down the mountain in the direction of my house. This scared me so I grabbed a handgun I kept for protection, and went outside to watch it.  There were no exterior lights on this craft coming toward me, and there was a light inside lit up like a cockpit. It was barely skimming the tree tops as it made it's way down the mountainside. When it got about 200 ft. from my home, it stopped and turned it's interior light off. I could see this one was about the size of a helicopter. It then traveled over to my backyard and hovered just a few feet directly over a light pole. It shone a big spotlight down in the yard, which I was standing just on the outside of.  I panicked and ran as fast as I could to my parents house next door. When I looked back, I saw no signs of it still being there. I went inside and woke my parents up, telling them what had just happened.  Suspicious facts; There is no way a human could see me in this tiny window from such a far distance, without having binoculars, telescope and intentionally keeping a lookout for people watching. These crafts made NO noise. I did not have any missing time (in case anyone wondered about possible abduction, no it didn't happen). But, I am left feeling very angry and violated that whoever, whatever, this was did trespass on private property, on the ground in the woods, as well as flying under the allowed altitude according to government regulations. Military, alien? I don't know. I do know this technology is either secret military, or alien in nature. I have searched since then to compare and identify it, and I have not been able to identify it still. The closest thing I've seen is from a UFO story on t.v. of some people in Australia who had an encounter with a huge triangular craft with a long red light.  I called the Roanoke airport the following week and asked them if anything strange showed up on their radar the previous week. They just laughed at me and then told me no.  Here's my Nuforc report;  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16107.html  10/15/96 23:00 Roanoke VA Triangle 1 hour I saw a triangular craft with only red light from front to back on it. Craft stopped over my back yard and shone light down. 2/18/01 ------------------ Note to Nuforc;  There is nothing in those woods. Just plain trees! It doesn't matter if you contact me or not, even though I checked at bottom of form. It's just that if anyone wants to go onto the land and check for radiation, or whatever, or if anyone wants to meet me and go to the area this happened at, I can arrange that. I do not want to say publicly it was at the bottom of Bent Mountain, because I do not want to be identified publicly and some locals might know it's me with that much information put in there. I don't care to investigate for my own purposes, but only if you think you might gain some helpful knowledge or if Nuforc could benefit in some way by doing so. I also hope you don't give our information out to the government, as that worries me the government might hurt or harrass people if they are doing secret operations and people are telling about it. Thank you for your time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2008-03-04T00:00:00,37.275004150943396,-79.97072547169812

At the time, I was entering my senior year at U.C. Davis.  I am now a practicing trial lawyer.  I was returning home from a job training that had lasted all day.  I had consumed no alcohol and I wasn't under the influence of any drug.  I have never suffered from any delusion.  As I was driving on the causeway, in the middle lane, I noticed two red dots hovering over my windshield.  At that point in time, I couldn't tell how high they were.  I could only see them from my peripheral vision.  I assumed I was being speed tracked by a police helicopter.  So, I tapped on my brakes to slow down, as I was speeding.  I could clearly see two red lights, one hovering directly over the other in a vertical position.  At this point, I was sure I was being tracked by a helicopter.  I couldn't see any shape, and my fear grew, because I was sure I was going to get a speeding ticket.  The red lights hovered only about 50 feet over my front windshield.  To my amazement, the red lights came to hover directly in front of my car, and suddenly white lights lit up and illuminated the craft and the entire freeway.  I was so shocked.  I looked around to see if any other cars on the freeway could see what I saw.  To my left, there was a red Jeep Cherokee with about 2-4 college girls.  I could clearly see the woman with light brown, shoulder length hair looking over her steering wheel, eyes fixated on the craft.  At this point, the craft was still only about 50 feet over our cars.  White track lights lit up one after another to create a moving effect along the outer circumference of the craft.  The craft was shaped as if two low sloping cones were put together.  So, from the top or bottom I imagine it looked circular.  From the side view that I witnessed, it was diamond shaped.  The craft was silver in color and had no other edges.  The track lights would take about one second to travel along the edge of the craft; again, these side white lights were extremely bright, like flood lights.  The craft remained lit for about 3 minutes.  All of a sudden the very bright track lights went out, and one could only see the two vertical red lights.  The red lights then shot off westerly in the fastest acceleration I could ever imagine, leaving a solid red line in my vision.  Seconds later, I could see the red lights darting hither and to over the hills around Fairfield and Vallejo.  I could see this darting behavior for about 30 seconds to one minute.  The girls in the red jeep and I pulled off to the Mace Blvd exit in Davis, CA.  We both got our of our cars, screaming and yelling, ""Oh my God! Did you see what I saw?"" We asked each other if we had cameras.  Then, I got in my car and sped off to my apartment.  I screamed for my roommate and a friend to grab a camera.  I told them about the incident.  Then we went out toward Vacaville on Highway 80 West.  I could no longer see the red dot over Fairfield.  So I pulled off to an 7-11 store and asked if anyone else saw a UFO.  I got some really wierd looks, and my friends thought I was a bit loony.  When we were getting back into my car, we could hear loud sounds of jets.  We looked up and there were numerous Air Force jets, fighter jets, cargo jets, etc., flying in two or three separate formations.  They were flying low and we could all see well over 20 jets flying west in the direction of the UFO that I had seen.  It has been 13 years since I saw this event.  I tried to forget about it, but it has to be the single most influential event that has occurred in my life.  I live a pretty eventful life as a trial attorney, but this has never left my mind.  I think of this event often.  My memories of it are very clear.  The event has caused me to question many fundamental things about my existence, my religion, and my government, questions that are yet unanswered.

I do not specifically recall the year, I know within a 3 year range, but could not possibly ever recall the exact date because neither my friend nor I made a record of the observation.  My friend and I were contemplating leave the tent because the air was getting cold as the evening progressed. We unzipped tent entrance which faced to the East. I poked my head out and immediately noticed the apparent lights which couldn't have been anything produced by human beings. Without moving, I told my friend to poke his head out to observe the site and he saw the exact same thing as I did.  We noticed lights in a ""V"" shape with the point being closest to us. Since this at night, it's impossible to judge both the distance above the ground and distance of the lights/craft but they ""appeared"" to be within 2 miles of the surface and over 1/2 of a mile in length. These lights were blue in color. I believe there were either 7 or 9 lights, I do not recall, but they were in a perfect ""V"" shape. The lights were shining down towards the surface, with the closest one almost directly above us, but they didn't light up whatever they were attached to. These could have been separate crafts in a perfect ""V"" shape or just one craft with all the lights on them, but you couldn't see above the lights. The front of the ""V"" was pointing towards the North. The rear of the lights stretched far away from the front. The lights appeared to be perfectly spaced out from one another with thousands of feet in between them. Thousands of feet is more-than-likely an understatement, but again it would be impossible to tell in the dark, especially with it being up in the sky at an undermined altitude.  There was absolutely no sound coming from the light sources and no movement either. They appeared to hover in place throughout the entire duration of the siting. We were both afraid we had been spotted and didn't know if it were possible for us to be harmed so we didn't run, move, or anything except quietly whisper on infrequent occasion. I believe 10 minutes had passed before we felt safe enough to duck inside the tent. We discussed what we had seen to make sure our stories were identical and not fictitious. We both agreed going into my parents' house was the best decision because staying in the tent wouldn't give us the safety we felt we needed. At this time, we were unsure if we were going to be abducted, left alone, or have any other insane experience because seeing the UFO was astonishing, so at this point, we felt anything was now a possibility.  After 5 minutes of discussion, we grabbed our pillows and looked out again prior to making a dash for the house. We slowly poked our heads out and were both amazed to notice the lights were not there, or not on, one of two cases. I didn't think they could have been off, my assumption was they had vanished, but I suppose they could have just been off. The thought never entered my mind until typing this recount of the events. No sound was ever heard and the massive array of lights were not seen again. We ran into the house and told my parents about it. They didn't doubt we believed what we saw, however, they had never seen anything like what we described and didn't know if any possible explanation was possible other than a UFO. At least 9 years have passed before I wrote this recount of the events. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I am confirming a previous report of an object seen over Denver, CO on 4/16/2004. I was working as an armed security guard at a Denver hospital clinic. I stepped outside for my normal check of the perimeter of the building, and I witnessed the same object as previously reported at that time and date. The sky was blue and clear, and I saw a bright silver object moving quickly at a very high altitude from East to West at about 80 degrees from the horizon.  At first I thought it might be a high altitude military craft, or daytime satellite, but it abruptly stopped, and stayed in a stationary position. I retrieved a pair of 10x50mm binoculars from my car, and I was barely able to identify the object as what appeared to be a silver spinning cylinder. It was spinning very fast vertically, end over end, and was completely stationary. I asked a patient outside the clinic if she would confirm what I was seeing, and her response was, quote: “What in the world is that???”. The object was stationary for approximately 20 minutes, and at one point, a high flying (40,000ft?) commercial jetliner flew underneath, yet the altitude of this strange object was still much higher than the jetliner. I would venture to guess its altitude was on the order of 65,000+ft. To be able to distinguish it as a spinning cylinder at that altitude, leads me to think that it must have been huge. After 20min the spinning cylinder gained altitude and sped away at extreme speed to the North, until it quickly disappeared. Being an experienced amateur astronomer, I have seen quite a variety of objects both day and night. I have previously always been able to eventually identify and classify the objects as either spy satellites, the space station, space shuttle, weather balloons, or other man made aircraft, etc. The sighting and behavior of this object has bothered and bewildered me for years, and I am glad I finally found an appropriate place to tell my story, and confirm that it was witnessed by several other people. My conclusion, after all of these years, is that this was a genuine UFO, and that even the most advanced secret! militar y craft in the world could not have flown or behaved the way this one did…",2007-08-07T00:00:00,39.74512637220715,-104.95934593826682

Today, July 24, 2007, I was reading through articles posted on www.fark.com.  One of the links was to a UK Daily Mail article titled “UFO sighting bring town to a standstill”  (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=470579&in_page_id=1770),  about a UFO sighting over Stratford-Upon-Avon.  What immediately struck me in the article was the picture at the top, which made me think ""I've seen this before.""  A friend and I once witnessed a very similar triangular aircraft flying around the area of Charleston, SC, in summer 2004.  This drove me to look into how many others have seen what I saw.  I figured I’d find one or two stories, not the hundreds that can be found that describe the same thing that I remember. I don't believe in encounters with aliens or anything like that; I think it's obvious the distances across space are far too great for such a thing to happen.  Despite that, or perhaps because of that, this event had struck me as being very strange, and has left a strong memory of what I would usually dismiss as someone “seeing things”. I'm not sure the exact month when it happened.  It was during the summer of '04.  A friend and I who were going to school at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command in Goose Creek, SC, decided to go out and get some late night Waffle House.  My friend was doing the driving, as I don't have a license.  Perhaps if I drove more I'd remember the exact locations better, but I don't.  You don’t remember driving directions well when you don’t drive.  Looking at the area's Waffle House locations on Google Earth, I figure it was most likely the one on Goose Creek Blvd, or perhaps the one on Aviation Rd near the Charleston Airport, which is also very close to the Charleston Air Force Base. Well, we ate our Waffle House.  Afterwards, we figured we had time to waste.  It was probably a Friday or Saturday night or something.  We didn’t know the area well as we were only there a short time for the school, and our spare time was usually spent within the city of Charleston.  So, we went exploring. We weren't more than 5 miles away from one of those two Waffle Houses.  We took a turn onto a long, straight, wide, smooth road.  It seemed to be a strange road.  I know I'd never seen it during the day.  There was a little traffic on the road we came off of, but none on this one.  It was wide, 6 lanes if I remember right.  It looked like it was freshly paved.  The street we came off of was in the open, but this one had the forest close in on both sides, I'd estimate within 10ft of the road.  The trees were tall on both sides, probably 20-30ft, or a little higher.  It would give me the impression of a planted forest since they were all about the same height, but you can't really tell at night.  We couldn't see the end of the road in sight, the road in front of us was the only break in the trees, for the whole length of the road.  No other roads turned off that we ever saw.  The street was completely unlit, except for our truck's headlights.  I don’t remember if there were any markings or signs at the intersection that stated the purpose of the road.  There were no signs whatsoever during the length (a couple miles) of the road.  The road turned out to end in a military base, which makes the lack of identification of the road confusing, though it explains it’s otherwise spartan appearance. We were driving down the road no more than a minute, when my friend pointed out some lights above the trees to the left.  I can't remember if there were 3 or 4 lights when we first saw it.  There were definitely 3 white lights (not 'glows' as I've read some people as seeing) at the 3 points of the triangle.  We slowed down the truck to about 5-10mph so we could get a better look at it.  It quickly became clear that what we were looking at was no commonplace aircraft. I remember trying to determine if I could see a shape of the aircraft, and vaguely thinking I saw a darker (black against the midnight blue sky) shape against the sky.  It had reminded me of a nacho chip, with a light at each of it’s points. Next I noticed how slow it seemed to be moving.  It gave me the impression of being low-flying and extremely slow.  (I can’t understand how people are claiming that these flying triangles they see are at 1000ft and going 30 knots, etc.  How can you tell from the ground at what height it is, and how large it is?  You can’t really tell if it’s 170ft wide and 100ft off the ground, or a mile wide and 50 miles off the ground.  At least I couldn’t tell in the dark of that night…)  It made me think of something like a B-2, but if it was only 170ft wide, or however wide they are, then it must have been almost unmoving.  I know few aircraft we have can hover, and a B-2 sure ain’t one of them. Then my friend pointed out something that should have been far more obvious – it was very quiet, perhaps silent.  We couldn’t hear any discernible sound over his little Toyota truck.  This later made us think that it could have been a much larger craft higher up, but that seems less likely.  While an extremely large craft could appear to be moving slowly and be silent if it were orbiting the Earth in our upper atmosphere at high speeds, the idea of some Independence Day-sized aircraft remaining undetected by everyone on the planet seems unlikely, not to mention the absurdity of such a design. The next part is still what strikes me as the strangest.  It reminded me of the old stories and movies of a beam of light coming out of a flying saucer to abduct people.  In the center of the craft there was what appeared to be a searchlight, one of those directional beams of light used to illuminate specific parts of a landscape.  I don’t remember the light first turning on specifically, and I don’t remember it being there when we first saw the craft.  The reason I stated that there were 3 or 4 lights at the start is I figure if it had the searchlight on from the start I would have noticed it a lot quicker, but the clear image planted in my brain is that of the flying triangle with the 3 lights, and the one searchlight in the center.  It was being directed around apparently randomly, like you’d see one being used in a prison escape movie to search for an escapee.  The beam could be seen moving quickly and erratically, but smoothly, over the forest, and it occasionally passed over the road we were on, as well, but it never really got close to the truck.  We were still moving slowly down the road with our truck, and the craft was still passing slowly above us.  I couldn’t help thinking at that time that whatever piece of magnificent technology that had to be, that they must have known we were there.  But if it did know we were there, it didn’t give any indication of it. We kept looking at it in awe as we crept down the road, it eventually being above us and to the left, so that my friend was sticking his head out the driver’s side window, and I was looking straight up at the dashboard.  It slowly passed us, or we passed it; whatever happened, it was behind us.  Not much farther down the road we spotted the trees straight ahead that marked the end of the road.  The road split off to the right side, and I think to the left as well.  I remember the right side more clearly for some reason.  There was an empty guardhouse to the right of a small 2-lane road, which had 2 or 3 large yellow-painted pylons staggered along the lanes to keep anyone from flying through.  I’d swear I remember a sign to the right side of that road, on the side of the guardhouse, which declared it as an Army something-or-another.  It didn’t seem strange to me at the time, but my searching indicates no army bases in the area.  Not even abandoned ones, which would explain the empty guardhouse. Well, we turned the truck around and started heading back, about 30-40 seconds after passing the aircraft.  The aircraft was gone.  Just like that.  We heard no sound that indicated any type of engine speeding up, or any aerodynamic noise, or anything.  It was just gone. We talked about it as we drove back to our Navy base.  We figured it was some sort of experimental military craft.  All the branches of the military were represented in Charleston, except for the Army, as far as we could tell… except for that sign that I still remember seeing.  We joked that we’d probably be assassinated in our sleep by the CIA for seeing something we weren’t supposed to.  It still doesn’t make sense to me why they would fly such a craft over a populated area we were in.  Admitted the exact place was a thick forest, civilization wasn’t very far away. That had remained sitting in the back of my mind – the time I saw that crazy experimental military aircraft – until I read that article today.  It didn’t make sense to me.  The picture I see there looks just like what I saw, through from a lot farther away, but it’s in the UK.  Why would experimental US military aircraft be flown in across the ocean?  They could be participating in it, but that doesn’t make sense.  It’s the American policy to share our old technologies, not our new ones.  Not to mention, the searchlight?  What was that?  With such advanced technology, it seems like a pretty archaic means of trying to find things at night, and not a very stealthy one.  I don’t think we even use beams of light any more for weapons targeting, and we’ve got much better ways of communications than using lights.  Makes no sense to me, but it was there.  Oh, and unlike those stories, it was definitely a clear, white light, like the 3 at the corners, except that it was a directed beam as opposed to a simple light.  It definitely wasn’t red. I place this event as taking less than four minutes, though I can't really tell for sure.  It's not like I was counting the time on my watch.  My best guess was it was 1:30am. Well, that’s all the story I have.  I’m no UFO expert, or even a military aircraft expert, but I know what I saw wasn’t anything the government will admit to having at their disposal.

The light was drawn away the same as it came, ending with just the full moon seeming very far away. It was as if it was trying to trick me.

I had just came home from work, fixed a meal and ate, when I decided to sit outside and enjoy the night air in my backyard. I was out there for about 30-45 minutes after sunset when the clouds started coming in, the weather called for rain, so as I was watching some of the forcasted clouds come in, I peered up and to my amazement I caught what I beleived to be a ship hiding in concealment. So, I was transfixed on it as it passed slowly by there was no sound coming from this ship at all. Then it occured to me that Nostrodamuses claim was wrong it wasn't meteors he saw but alien spacecraft.To my greatest suprise I would get to see two of the worlds greatest theories come to pass. As I watched as it passed overhead, another came by then another, then another, as I was calculating where they were going. I figured it was WPAFB. Then they stopped. The ship overhead was a triangle in shape with three large viewing windows from my observation,ther was also two figures in the windows which seemed to be looking directly towards me, so I just politely waved greeting them to Dayton. Then all of a sudden out of the corner of my eye I saw a bluish type of light, like that on Star Trek's transporter system. Well to my suprise it seemed like there were little children running around my yard playing. I couldn't see them physically because they had on something that made them seem to be invisible. Like that suit the predator wore when he was fighting Arnold S. then as i am looking around I feel a little one lean on my leg and seem to be looking right into my face, and another start playing in my hair, like they have never seen a black guy before. It was just amazing that there kids was just as curious as mine are. So I peer back up and smile & laugh that the two are still there in the window are still looking down on us. It must have been at least 20 or more minutes they stayed in my yard playing. The ships started moving out, I would guess that WPAFB had difficulty greeting our new friends and unloading there belongings. I would guess this ship that stopped over my head was a passenger vehicle, because there was more vehicles to come. The next was box shaped,like a transporter. The one after that had my magneto pulse drive system underneath. I counted at least ten ships, but the last two gave me goose bumps you could tell these were not peace loving ships these were built for fighting. they were larger than the rest with deep grooves and edges, and just looked terrorfying. WPAFB was busy that night,lol. I thank the lord for letting me be a part of this. But I would like to see the proof that I am not Haluccinating. If you could get the weather pictures it might be able to prove it. Nostradamus, and I werent seeing things, please help us prove this.

I worked nights caring for an elderly woman whose house had a spectacular view of the Ocean.All night the T.V. announced the last beautiful full moon. The night was very clear and the ocean was calm with no breeze.  All night I observed what I thought was a star but as i would look at it, it would change shape flatten out and show blue,red and green lights.  Around 3:30A.M. I was awake and I was sitting staring at this so called star when in my mind i said i know you are not a star let me see what you're doing.  Well this craft started to spin. That is when i realized it was pretty close and very big it started to move east ward over the ocean. It moved very slowly out over the ocean then it started to put on a light show. It would shine a beam of light on the water once to the left and then to the right. The be-em of light was very big. then it move on again. It seemed to do this a few times and then i saw a few smaller lights come toward the craft and merge with it.  The last thing i observed was out of this was a very red light i have never seen this color of red be-fore it seemed to be sent back toward the land not so much towards me but over to an out cropping of rock's On these rocks live hundreds of sea Lyons they make noises all the time at this spot. At the time the very red light disappeared i was to say the least very exhausted and freaked out but also excited by what i saw. In closing I am sorry I have not shared this with any UFO people until now but I sure would like to discuss my observation with some-one who can give me some information on what i experienced.

Different because I've never seen anything shaped like this in any of the images put forth on any media. Basically and simplistically, it appeared to look like a drifting, bright, shiney steel garbage can. I'm not trying to be funny. It seemed to be traveling I would say about 30 miles an hour approximately a half mile or so from our point of view. With the sun's reflection it's top appeared either had a series of brilliant lites or these were reflections. Vertical indents going around the side is what made it appear as I've said, a garbage can and what would have been the lid may have been for observation. With the distance, it's size, and sun reflection I could not make out much more. I dubbed it the ""flying garbage can"" because that was exactly what if appeared to be but of course we all know they have no system of propulsion. At the speed this was going it definitely seemed to defy gravity. We watched it head toward the city of Paterson, NJ and at a point where we might have thought it lowered it's altitude large trees then blocked our view altogether. We were quite dissappointed. So that's it in a nutshell - I/we will not forget that one; there was a long time when any of us went outside we always looked for our ""floating garbage can"".......it certainly was unique.......

In the summer of 2000, I was driving with my then girlfriend late one afternoon westbound on Pico Blvd. just west of Sawtelle Blvd..  While stopped at a traffic light, she pointed to something she saw in the sky which was almost directly over us. I had to lean forward to be able to see up through the windshield to observe 3 identical black triangular objects. I observed them for less than 30 seconds.  The objects were motionless and we could not hear any noise from the objects. There were no markings, lights or familiar aircraft features (stabilizers, etc.), just a solid black object. the objects were in a loose triangle formation separated from each other by a distance of approximately 5 times their individual width. What struck me most was their stillness and almost silhouette-like appearance. My impression is that the objects were the size of private jets or fighter planes. They were significantly higher in altitude that the normal Santa Monica airport traffic that occurs regularly in that area, enough so that a closed fist at arms length could have covered two of the objects (were they spaced tip to tip). While observing them, I moved my head to change my viewing angle so as to verify that this was not caused by debris on the widshield or reflections. These were definitely airborne objects. Once the traffic light changed to green, I resumed driving, but was unable to see the objects again since they were nearly directly overhead. Once we had driven a few blocks so that the objects should have been easier to view from a shallower angle, the sky was empty where thay had been.

I was trying to find the big dipper, when I noticed that there were two stars, that didn’t quite fit in. It was only a fraction of a second before the two unidentifiable stars were in motion. When I noticed that there were two stars that were moving, I thought that perhaps hallucinating because I was tired from being up so late. I studied the objects in motion for a brief moment when I realized that there was a third star not too far ahead of the two, also in motion. The two stars were moving at the same speed, in the same direction. The third star (in front of the two) was also moving at the same speed, in the same direction.  I told my 3 friends who were out there with me to take a look and pointed them in the direction, and they were just as amazed as I when we realized that as the “stars” were moving through the sky, that the actual stars in the sky, disappeared, and the reappeared after the moving “stars” had passed.  When placing an imaginary line to get a shape of the moving “stars”, you were looking at a triangle. The triangle was enormous. It was moving at an extremely slow speed, and was obviously a solid object, because as previously stated, the actual stars in the sky, disappeared as the object flew over the night sky.  My friend insisted that there was some army-base near by and that it was an aircraft. I had to disagree because the object was larger than any aircraft we have in the area, and said that its 1 o’clock in the morning, and that there are no army-bases testing aircrafts in the local neighborhoods in the middle of the night! Also, aircrafts give off three different colored flashing lights; one red, one blue and one clear (bright). Aircrafts don’t fly in sync unless doing a performance, which we don’t have in this area. Aircrafts also don’t fly in the same direction for more than a few seconds until they fall out of line because they are going to different places.  The object took about 10 seconds to be out of sight, but that was only because it flew so far into the distance, and we weren’t able to see past the surrounding area. The direction it flew was NNE, towards some of the back roads. (There is an airbase located in the area, however the object was larger than the base itself.)

After the fireworks display on July 4th, my husband and I were headed home a short distance away.  I happened to look toward the mountains in the west and saw what appeared to be a huge star perhaps 3 fingerbreadths above the foothills which are about a mile and a half from where we are located..  I alerted my husband and he saw it too. At first I thought it might be a planet, but I had been observing Jupiter recently which is the brightest “star” in the night sky, and this object was about twice the size and brightness of Jupiter.  We were headed to a party 2 houses down the block where we live but after 10 minutes or so  I went home to watch from my backyard, hoping perhaps to set up my telescope and be able to discern its shape.  I looked toward the west again and watched it for another 10 minutes or so.  It was stationary to my eye but just as I decided to lug out my telescope, the light from this object became dimmer until it disappeared.  The next night it was there again at about the same time  but I was only able to watch for about 5 minutes before is disappeared again.  I surmised that  the object was stationary and had not actually vanished but slowly disappeared behind the mountains due to the rotation of the earth.  On the third night (July 6th)  I saw it again in  what appeared to be the same place.  This time I immediately got out my telescope.   With the naked eye, although it was very bright, I could see that it wasn’t exactly circular in shape, seeming to have a couple of sharp points.  When I focused my telescope I was amazed to see an object which was roughly crescent shaped, with the rounded side facing downwards toward the mountains. One edge had a reddish hue and the other edge was greenish but the colors and the entire object seemed to be shimmering or more accurately, waving.  I thought that perhaps I was visualizing an atmospheric distortion so I focused my scope on Jupiter which was more southerly.  I could see the planet very clearly and distinctly with no distortion.  Through the lens of the telescope this UFO was approximately 3 times the size of Jupiter and the light from it was not the almost pure white light which emanates from the planet Jupiter.  The light from this object was slightly warmer with the red and green edges as I mentioned.  I am sorry that I didn’t think to get my video camera out to film it.

If this was a craft we did not see the actual body but the lights (about 8-10 orbs)were lined in a circular formation and perfectly oval shaped. The lights were perfectly stationary for about a minute and then suddenly, whatever it was, tilted on an angle and just as quickly as it appeared it disappeared.  I broke the silence by asking my mother if she saw what just happened and she said it was probably the airport or some type of light show. She was clearly shaken as she started to go inside. Neither explaination my mother gave me seemed reasonable since Newark Airport is miles and miles from North Bergen and light shows after midnight are not likely either, however, seeing UFO's is probably just as silly so ever since we've never talked about it.  I sometimes wonder what that was. Honestly, it is too disturbing to think that there might be someone/thing out there so I don't really think about it often.

I have never seen anything like this before and I got a very good look at it. It was a shiny silver, like polished aluminum, completely round along the horizontal plane and yet about 1/3 that size in the vertical. To me it seemed about 50 feet in diameter. What really shocked me was it's flight characteristics. I flew manuevers I have never seen any plane accomplish and it was completely silent. It I was not looking directly at it... I would have never noticed it. It came over the mountain tops over the edge of the ridge, so it could be seen clearly from the valley where I was standing. It then abruptly turned a 180 and headed directly back over the ridge. But what was really amazing was during the 180 turn it also completely flipped over on it axis! So it was basically heading back over the ridge on its bottom...or upside down. If there is a top and bottom. Anyway, this short sighting was very profound to me. Since I know planes and this was nothing I have ever seen and the propellants produced no noise....whatever it used. That too was shocking. So there it is...I know what I saw and it was very clear, though very brief. What really shocked me later, because I live in a small community we tend to know all our neighbors. Where I live they are mainly cattle ranchers. They run them on open range up there on the mountain tops. We had two cattle mutilations reported up there over the years... I really was blown away when I learned this...because it seems just like other reports. I found that to be very strange. Let me impress upon you.... I am a very honest person... I strive to be all my life...this was no hoax. You can easily verify my story about the mutilations...the local law went up there and documented the cases. It was later in our local papers.

As I was driving I noticed a very large object in the sky that was very low, and moving very slowly.  It was so low and moving so slow, that the physics of it just did not make any sense to me.  Hwy 20 does not have much traffic (no cars passed the whole time) so I slowed down and rolled down my window in my car.  As it came directly overhead I still could not hear any sound, so I pulled over to the side of the road and shut my engine off.  I first just gazed up still sitting in the car with my head out the window.  I then got out and just stood there next to my car.  I kept my eyes up the whole time.  What I remember seeing was a huge rectangle, it was about the size of a football field.  I do remember lights, but not like you would see on a airplane.  The main thing that I was focused on was the size, and how low it seemed to be.  It was a gray color. It was very close to the ground and why it made no sense to me was I could not hear a sound , and by the huge size and how close it was I should hear something I thought.  It moved so slowly that it seemed as though it should be miles up, but it was so huge that it must have been close.  I vividly remember the large outline of its shape graying out the sky above.  Nothing made sense about the whole thing.   I did get chills and got back into my car and drove home very scared.  I did tell a few close friends about it, never pushing the idea.   I was watching the discovery channel, and saw the episode about the Illinois sighting.  Having not remembered seeing any of that in the news back in 2000 when it happened.  It sent chills down my back seeing the testimony of the police officers.  I have not thought much about what I saw for several years now.  Having started a family since.

To be honest my memory of this event is sketchy but I can tell you what I remember.  It was either 1999 or 2000 within the first few months of the year.  I think it was February.  I was an undergraduate physics & astronomy student with Central Michigan University and I was with a group of two other students and our instructor.  We were taking advantage of some time with the NURO telescope on Anderson Mesa near Flagstaff, AZ.  One night we left our control room to go outside and look at the stars.  I don’t remember what time it was unfortunately.  As we were standing there after a few minutes we noticed a “V” pattern of lights  flying in a counter-clockwise circular path that took it overhead, then to the north(toward Flagstaff),  toward the west at its other extent, south and then back up overhead.   This triangle was being trailed by a red light (not blinking) that was a good distance behind.  Too far behind to be attached to the tail of an airplane.  This red light was noticeable when we first took note of the formation but after 2 to 3 minutes it vanished while the formation was due west of us.  The triangular pattern continued its circle.  I do not recall the color of the V pattern lights.  If memory serves me correctly I counted twenty lights, ten to each leg of the “V”.  I ran in and grabbed a pair of binoculars and upon viewing the lights while it was directly overhead  I  saw the silhouette of an airplane with wings swept back at an approximately 45 degree angle and the lights were on the leading edges of the wings.  The silhouette looked strange to me.  The wings were attached to the fuselage about 1/3 of the way forward from the tail with the “nose” making up the other 2/3 of the length.  While some of the details are foggy in my memory, I remember these proportions as they seemed quite atypical of any plane I’d seen.  The body was slender and the wings were slender and relatively long.  I don’t remember what ultimately became of this plane.  As to whether it flew off or the lights went out I don’t recall.  Now at the time I was unfamiliar with the “Phoenix Lights” but was familiar with UFO sightings of triangular / V shaped light configurations.  My opinion at the time and even now was that this plane and its trailing light were, for whatever reason, deliberately trying to appear as such a configuration.  Hearing of the Phoenix Lights makes it seem even more plausible.  Now it could have been an aircraft in a holding pattern around the Flagstaff airport which is south of town and was to our west.  This is a possibility, however it still seems strange that it would have so many leading lights, would have a red light trailing quite far behind, and in the middle of the night would have to continually circle a small regional airport which according to my professor no longer received any commercial flights and has sparse traffic even in the daytime.

I feel obligated to state that my two friends and I were under the influence of marijuana when the sighting occured.  However, we were lucid enough that I would have felt comfortable going out into public without fear.  We were teenagers at the time (ages 19-20),  and I am now a responsible adult (an Air Force veteran and a college graduate). With that being said, here's my account of what happened.  The three of us (I am female, my two friends were male) were standing around in my friend's driveway talking while I was smoking a cigarette.  The area we lived in was VERY rural.  I will refer the friend who lived on this property as W2 from this point forward.  W2's home was on a dirt road that ran for approximately ten miles.  The road housed approximately twenty homes, most of the land was used for either corn farming or growing pine trees for a local paper mill.  A river runs paralell to most of the road, the river lies approximately 1.5 miles north of W2's home which faced north. While talking, I noticed three bright green beams of light that originated to the north, almost directly in front of us.  I would estimate that their origin was somewhere between W2's house and the river that I discussed previously.  If they were any further north, it couldn't have been by much.  Also, the area past the river is more populated (relatively speaking), and there is a mountain there.  If the lights had originated in this area, they would have appeared more elevated than they did. I noticed the lights, and attempted to ignore them for fear that it was some sort of mild hallucination.  However, a few minutes passed and our conversation fell dead silent.  It was at this point that W2 stopped and asked, ""Okay, what the hell is that?  Do ya'll see it?""  At this point, myself and W3 responded that we did. Once we established that all three of us were seeing it, we discussed it for the rest of the duration we were outside (maybe three more minutes, we watched the lights for abotu ten minutes total).  The lights looked like the spotlights that are used at business openings, except there were three of them and they were very bright green.  The middle  light was pointing straight up, and the other two lights flanked the middle light at perfectly matching approximate 30 degree angles.  The lights never moved.  We were spooked at this point, and went in the house. These lights could have been the powerful lights used by hunters, except I can not imagine one of those lights being that bright from such a distance.  Also, these lights were green and at perfect angles to each other.  Using spotlights to hunt deer is illegal, and I can't imagine any hunter wanting to draw such attention to his illegal deer hunting. Please note that the date and time given is approximate.  I know that it was in the late summer of 1999, and I know that it was after dark but before midnight when it happened (we didn't stay over at my friend's house past midnight).",2007-11-28T00:00:00,34.3685,-85.56419999999999

My father and I were sitting on his porch with my cousin when something caught our eyes. It is so dark out there that anything in the sky could be seen very easily. It was cigar shaped but it was so tiny. Like a star. The color was green. And the light strobed. As it moved, the strobe made it look like it was skipping across the sky. They all looked like this.  At first we saw just the one. We walked out into the driveway to get a better look of the entire sky and saw two more. Each one of them flew erratically. They flew in all different directions and would come back and go again. My step mother and niece came out to see what the commotion was and they too witnessed it all. At one point, one of the lights split into three and each of those lights went off in separate directions, then would come flying back and join together again as one. You would think as fast as they traveled there would be a collision, but there wasn’t one. And the main shape never differed, not even when they broke apart and rejoined.

While locking our westward facing sliding door I noticed a stationary and flashing light that seemed to be bigger and brighter than the surrounding stars.  The size and brightness appeared to be at least twice the size of stars near the position of the light. It appeared similar to a street light from two miles away.  The somewhat large size and the quickly changing colors are what cought my eye.  The light appeared motionless long enough to be video taped for several minutes.  The sky was partly cloudy with a half moon near the eastern horizon.  With the video camera zoomed in on the light it appeared diffused with a very bright center region with multiple flashes of red, green, purple, and white lights around the edge.  When I first saw the light I assumed that it was Venus but it appeared brighter and bigger with multiple flashing colors.  I will attempt to download the digital video in the near future.

I was sitting outside of my house in Midvale (Salt Lake City) Utah having a cigarette.  After casually gazing at the southern sky for a few minutes I started noticing objects appearing from the east.  My first impression was that it was a flock of white birds, illuminated by the city lights, flying to the west.  But then they formed into a perfect triangle, changed course slightly, and traveled west then disappeared into the sky.  Frankly, I thought I was just seeing things or they were in fact a flock of birds.  Another wave of these white objects then appeared, formed into 3 triangles, then headed to the west.  At this point, I was convinced I was seeing UFOs.  I am 30 years old and have never dreamed that I would witness something so strange in the night sky.  Then I started seeing other types of objects.  They were very big objects that looked liked grey clouds, but they all had sharp edges and were with the same exact shape, these flew side by side and headed of towards the western sky.  They started coming wave after wave, mostly the white objects that were sometimes accompanied by the much larger grey objects.  At this point I was getting quite scared and simply could not believe what I was seeing.  Then I saw a group of red orbs that formed into a cluster ball, this was surrounded by some kind of light that resembled a corona or aura.  This headed in a slightly different direction but still slowly to the west.  When it traveled, it passed behind my neighbors house, then reappeared on the other side then faded after it traveled for a bit.  I was already stunned by witnessing the previous objects, but this one just blew me away.  After that happened there was nothing in the sky for a few minutes, then the waves of the white and grey objects passed close overhead.  This went stop and go and the entire experience lasted around 40 minutes.  During the time I was on the phone with my girlfriend and brother describing what I was seeing and was astounded to say the least.  I have always been a skeptic.  I don't believe in ghosts, voodoo, psychics and such things.  I have always had doubts about UFOs, but I always believed they could be possible.  I never thought that in my life I would see something like this and hopefully I will always remember.  This could not have been anything man made.  The way the objects were moving in the sky almost looked like they were alive.  They were completely silent as they grouped up in formation and flew towards the west.  It is hard to say how far the objects were considering that I have no idea what they were.  All of the objects were kind of faint, but you could still make them out because of their movement.  One of the white object clusters blinked several times then disappeared.  I sincerely hope somebody confirms this event, it was awesome and I would like to compare sightings.  I called FOX news to see if anyone else reported, but they said no.  I made this call at 23:15 MST.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,40.6092,-111.8819

It was moving left in the sky, passing the stars, and abruptly it got smaller and smaller until I couldn’t see it anymore. As it got smaller, it also got redder, until it just disappeared.

It was taller than most reports of these things.. approx. 5 ft tall.. and it seemed incredibly thin and had a very pointed chin.. more so than what I would class as a typical 'grey'. It appeared to be studying plants and from this point on I have no certain recollection of events.  It didn't appear interested in me and carried on studying the plants.

The other is one of alerting the dogs and making them check outside... which they do not as they don't want to go (too sleepy). My wife was working till 7am and I was in bed asleep when she arrived.

I reported this incident back in 2002, at which time it was posted on your website and also on the Wisconsin website (taken from yours).  It remained there for some time.  When I had not checked on it for a couple of years, I found that it had been erased.  I'm not sure why it was erased unless it was deemed increditable.  However, the recent sighting at O'Hare reinforces the accuracy of my family's UFO sighting that took place in February 2002.    I am a former teacher and substitute teacher, and my husband is an Air Force veteran and a retired IRS Special Agent, who is now currently employed as an inspector for the Illinois State Police.  As to the incident, my husband, along with our 13 year old  daughter, and myself,  witnessed a UFO for approximately one hour while driving east on Highway 43 between Beloit, WI. and Milwaukee, WI. at approximately 5:30 A.M. in February 2002.  The object first came into view as an unusual very bright light in the clear sky south of our position.  At this time in the morning, the sky was completely dark and we continually observed this object as it appeared to move closer to our position.  As we traveled eastbound on Highway 43, the object began to take shape.  We had no idea how far away the UFO was, but it eventually began traveling in parallel to our vehicle.  When it first became identifiable, it appeared to be cigar shaped, with a lighted opaque dome.   From time to time, the object emitted various light patterns consisting of various colored lights in a strobe-light format. As the object came closer to us, it seemed very large.  The object would occasionally stop moving and fall behind our vehicle, then suddenly dart very far ahead.   At one point, the object was directly parallel with our vehicle and began to turn about its axis.   The object's appearance ressembled the classic description of a ""Flying Saucer"".  Across the middle of the object were stobe lights running in a pattern of red, green, and blue lights.  At various times, white, red, green, blue, and lavender colored lights were emitted, in strobe form, from various positions on the craft.   As we came into downtown Milwaukee, the object appeared to be over the southern part of the city near the Milwaukee airport.  Daybreak was taking place and the object was quite clear.   At that point, as an aircraft took off from the airport in a southwestern direction, the object rapidly climbed at a steep angle (approximatley 70 degrees)in the clear sky and dissappeared into a high cloud bank.  This occurred at a speed far in excess of any known aircraft and similar to the O'Hare sighting.

Green glowing UFOs and some that look like stars in the shape of circles with many encounters.,Honolulu,HI,2002-06-30T22:00:00,circle,Years,"Occurred : 6/30/2002 22:00  (Entered as : many times 0:00) Reported: 12/30/2006 11:49:13 PM 23:49 Posted: 2/1/2007 Location: Honolulu, HI Shape: Circle Duration:Years",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54230.html,"Green glowing UFOs and some that look like stars in the shape of circles with many encounters. The first encounter was with two friends I no longer have contact with.  It was probably about 5-6 years ago around 10:00p.m.  We we're skateboarding behind the gym of an elementary school and decided to take a rest.  We lodged our skateboards into these vents against the gym wall and layed back on them.  We had a clear view of the sky that night and I noticed a green star in the sky.  It was bright and very distinguishable amongst all the other stars in the sky.  I pointed it out to my two friends and they noticed it right away.  We layed back and watched it for about 10 seconds when all of a sudden it came down right in front of our faces, all the way from high up in the sky right down in front of us in a split second.  The object was emitting a green glow that was very bright, but I didn't notice anything else light up around us.  It was completely silent making no sound at all, and this object was big.  My friends and I made no sound and just stared at it.  I just couldn't believe what I was seeing.  It probably hovered in front of us for around 10 seconds, as if it were staring back at us.  Afterwards it shot off back into space as fast as it had come down in front of us and we lost sight of it a second after it shot directly back up into the atmosphere.  Afterwards my friends stood up screaming their heads off and running.  I didn't know what to do or think so I just followed them.  Years and years later my friends and I were just discussing UFO encounters.  This wasn't my first either, but it is the most significant as it leads to a chain of sightings.  So anyways, I told them about this one and they realized that we could try and head to the school gym to try and see if we could spot them again.  I thought it was a great idea and got excited, so we left.  At the gym we waited for a while, and sure enough my friend spotted one out of the corner of his eye.  It looked like a star, but it was movinhg, and then a few more started popping up and moving around in the sky.  They looked ! like sta rs, however some would fly low and close to the mountain next to us and these were green leaving green trails behind them.  These would move fast and then slowly, and then all of a sudden they would jet accross the sky leaving trails behind them.  We could spot up to even 6 at a time easily.  Some were straight above us, some were off in the distance.  We watched these from around 12:00 midnight until 5:00-6:00a.m.  after the sun comes up we could no longer see them.  I gathered more friends over time and we would make routine visits to the gym to spot more UFOs.  Sometimes we would see a lot, sometimes none at all.  One time one flew close to us, we could just tell it was close, especially by lining it up with the mountain next to us.  This one flew slow and was about the size of a quarter if you were to hold one at an arm's length in front of your face.  It flew from above our heads, all the way to the other side of the field and eventually passed the mountains and dissapeared behind some clouds.  There is no way these objects could be aircraft, it's impossible.  Nothing can move that slowly and then speed up that fast and maneuver they way they did.  Sometimes they would fly directly at each other as if they were going to collide and move away right before they would touch, and move at extreme speeds.  These were still flying around, the last time I checked about a year ago.  Sometimes I could see them from my apartment balcony, like one would just jet down really fast and dissapear.  I mainly only saw them at the school gym though.  I would love to have people investigate this.  I want this to go places and I was watching the National Geographic channel and heard about this place on a UFO show that they had on.  Please, check this out!  Oh yeah I forgot to mention that we brought video cameras afterwards to try and videotape some of these UFOs.  We were unable to capture any of them with our camera because the sky was just black and the video camera was horrible at picking anything up in that type of! setting Another thing is that the video cameras shut off at the same time while we were trying to record.  The batteries weren't drained or anything, but for some reason the cameras just shut off completely. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

WE WERE ALL INSIDE A TOYOTA CAMRY parked outside of boxwood townhome, FACING OPPISITE DIRECTION OF CRAFT, WHEN I got out of vehicle I saw a light in sky that was like a magnetic feeling almost as if i knew it was there before I got out of vehicle. I kept on starring at light that apeared to be over randhurst mall or maybe further it was hard to tell distance due to how to compare and contrast,well anyway my friends also exited vehicle shortly and asked what I was starring at? I showed them they said it's just a light pole from mall.I told them to look closer and use the mall light poles as a way to tell if unidentified light would move, shortly it did. When we first saw it it was on right of mall light pole then on left. At this point this had our complete attention,would not see it move but port,it appeared to be over home depot but probably further but from our view it appeared over it. All four of us were talking asking what is it?who is it? out loud then when we realized it was directly over us,we never saw it move only when it stopped motion or hoverd over something, What we saw changed our lives, it was shaped like frisbee  metallic black and the light's we saw earlier where light all around ship except they all light up at differnt times but it was not lights it seemed to be synergy produced be craft, also craft was differnt then any material we had ever seen cause it kind  of had a liquid material surface or some sort of feild maybe that made it apear this way. The craft hovered and it did have a outer circuler part of craft that move counter clockwise but slowly almost seemed so slow it might have been really fast, the underneath looked still except the kind electric feild it had going, It made no noise at all. We were unable to move we were looking straight up in complete silence no one talked if was almost like they took control of our senses left us motionless, for what felt like five minutes. When we were! able ma ke motion we all reacted at same time,we all turned around and ran in mark house to his room when we lookoutside window ufo was gone.At this point we all new what we saw we started talking about it and we looked at the time a 1 hour had passed. We could not make sense of time span. One thing we all agreed on was that when we where looking up standing motionless many seens played very fast through our minds. Like when you fast forward something on video similar but faster and many differnt taste smells sounds colors. We were going to report this insident at time but people usually don't believe it until they see it and we knew it was going to be hard to convince people of what we had encounterd. The irony is we felt settled with what we had experienced that we felt that why bother trying to make people believe us we all knew what we saw and told each other we would always remember and cherish this. Ever since we all have developed ESP and we can do extrodinery thing's with our brains it almost as if they unlocked a part of our brain we did't know how to use before this,we all write and produce music.We also read prophecies of edgar casey and got our own <prophecies> and <visions> very frequent and stated we all play music together on occasion so we still keep contact.

So we walked in got the flash light and walked out with me in front then our friend then my sister as i stepped out I saw two bright lights directly over us we could have reached up and touched it the shed is not that tall and it was probably at the same height as the top of the shed or a little below the top.  I thought I was the only one who saw it but I found out different.  We were astounded at it.  It could not have been a plane or anything of that sort it made no sound it was completely silent and no plane is that small and no plane makes no sound and no plane could get that close. more mysterious is the lights were there for so short yet there was no sight of anything coming or leaving. just the lights.  We wondered if my dad had seen this or anything he might have been able to tell us so we knew what it was.  He had seen nothing.  We all saw it. my dad didn't, yet he was only 10 feet or so away from us.  It bugged me what it could have been I have no answer but I know it probably was nothing known to our society.

About 30 minutes north of Ocean City on a beach, my girlfriend and I were sitting on a lifeguard stand looking at the stars.  Far up on our right I saw a star that was moving.  Then it stopped and held its position.   Then it moved again but in a different direction.  Then it stopped.   Then it repeated this pattern several more times.   With an understanding of geometry, I figured the the object must have been more than 10 miles above the earth.   At the rate it was moving, it must have been traveling at many thousand miles per hour to move from one point to the other....How it was able to pause its movement and just hover and then suddenly burst to another position is beyond me.   I am a man of science but when I saw this object, it was a surreal experience.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing and it truly frightened me.  It definitely was not a plane.

My ex-boyfriend was the first to see ""something"" moving in the distance in the sky. So I took the binoculars and started looking for myself and sure enough there were 3 round objects in the sky.  At this point they were in a triangular formation and their multi-colored craft soon began to change formation. Repeatedly for a long period of time.  Their color was multi-colored, but it alternated between the colors.  I would say the most prominent colors were gold/yellow, purple/blue and red.  They almost seemed to pulse when they changed colors.  Their formation seemed as though it was a code or an S.O.S or something. They executed it so perfectly; making moves in all directions.  I think I was out there an hour or better before they just completely disappeared as though they were never there. However, within 30 minutes of the crafts disappearing we witnessed many aircrafts ( the human kind) searching the area. You could with out a doubt tell they searching for something. The sky had been clear of crafts all night and then the UFO's came out of nowhere to do this beautiful light and pattern display.  Also, at some points it looked as though the ships became one and split into three again before assuming the next pattern and rotation. I have NO photos of the incedents, however I do have drawings of the formations and colors on the crafts. The thing about three of the drawings is that I drew them maybe 8 years before I had these sightings and they are dead on as to what I saw. They are the exact color shape and texture.

IT was a dark night with a semi full moon in the south east sky.  WE passed the Aroginite Exit on I-80 and we saw lights in the distance coming towards us. Same side of the freeway as the moon. As we got closer we all started making comments, like ""What the heck is that"".  It was huge and dark, but had 3 very big bright white lights on the front that went on and off. The lights where in a row, spaced apart pretty far. The 2 at each end would go on for a few secs then the middle one would come on. It was so weird.  My boyfriend wanted to pull over and take a look at it.  Me and my friend said do not stop the car. We were very freaked out.  Other people on the freeway, I know, saw what we saw. There were truck drivers and everything. My friend was in the back seat and had the window down as we passed.  He said it was the shape of a triangle.  Whatever it was it was huge and kinda flat. I will never forgot the lights and how they turned on and off in a strange sequence. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My family and I had been out at night looking at the stars. A thunderstorm was moving in around the time we headed back to town. Our kids had gone into the motel and as my wife and I were heading in, I looked up toward my left and then pointed it our to her.  She saw it, too. There was no sound. It moved fairly slowly. The sky, as I recall, was overcast somewhat. This could have made the lights look somewhat hazy, sort of like seeing a colored light through a mist or fog. There was a row of lights appearing this way. As I recall they were red and green and not flashing. Each light, based on what may have been the distance in view of the objects speed and height as best as I would guess the depth of field, would be around one to three feet in diameter.  Again, the haze of the evening may have made the lights look larger than they were. But again, no sound was heard. In view of its unusual ""drifting"" movement, it is hard to think of a plane. And it was low and not close to the airport. The hazy lights were pretty much in a straight line, but from what I recall in a slightly elongated ""V"" form. Within seconds it moved out of sight. It would be natural to write this off, but it has been close to ten years and you are the first ""official"" place to receive my report. I do not know what it was. It did not fit the usual context of normal flying vehicles. So all I can say is it was unidentified. Thank you for reading.

When it got close enough for us to get a good look at it, it was right over the tree line. It had 3 colors swinging under it.  Blue, white and red.  We had one car window rolled down and I noticed there was no sound coming from the ""so called plane"". I turned the radio off, rolled down my window and so did my friends.

The two observers had been sitting for about 45 minutes watching the sky as they talked.  Suddenly one observer saw what she believed was a plane until she noticed that it was not.  The object was flying south toward the ocean gulf and was going slow enough and low for her to briefly glimpse a triangular flying object with no lights on it.  The only source of light was coming from the back end:  a tail of orange/red emissions that decreased in size as it left the back of the vehicle; Think golf tee.  Its emissions gave enough light to show the contours of the bottom side of the vehicle.  The bottom revealed a scalloped like design, much like the old corrugated roofs.  By the time the observer had registered this information and realized it could not be a plane (it was too close and did not look like one), it and its plume shot quickly away with no sound, then disappeared.

The object was flat black, rectangular in shape (a very slightly elongated square), and flying very high (approx. 30,000 ft = with cruising altitude.). To give an idea of its size, in order to block it out, you would need to hold a dime in front of your eye at arm's length. It was too difficult to judge the object's speed as there were few other reference points at that altitude.  There was a pair of binoculars in the car, and when I focused in on the object I could only faintly make out two silver-ish objects that appeared to be the profiles of fighter jets flying a short distance ahead of the object at its upper and lower left corners. However, because of the height and angle at which they appeared it was difficult to make them out clearly.  Upon reaching the store, we all stood on the parking lot for awhile looking up at it; several other people had also taken notice, before moving on. I remember hearing one mother explain to her son that the object was a stealth bomber. My dad was in the Air Force, I have my MS in Space Studies, and I am very familiar with most aircrafts including the stealth bomber. This most definitely was nothing of the sort, and I have never come across any other craft similar to what I saw that day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of sighting is approximate.

There was a person walking by my truck as this happened and saw it fly away and he looked at me with a puzzled look on his face and I said I did not know what it was, the man kept walking. A few days later I tried telling my room mates and a few other friends, and they all looked at me like I was crazy, so I kept it to my self and let it stew for a while. The reason I waited to talk to anyone else for while is because I have no physical proof that this happened. I’ve never heard of this kind phenomenon anywhere! And even crazier than that is the fact that it felt like it passed rite through my head! Who the hell is going to believe that? Believe it or not, The feeling was kind of  pleasurable. To describe the feeling would be to imagine having a tube that started from your left temple behind your eyes out your right temple, now imagine pulling a piece of mink fur through that tunnel. That's what it felt like. I would like to know if anyone else has ever experienced this kind of phenomenon.

It looked to me like a huge metallic blimp that was catching the setting sun or something.  The road, being heavy with traffic at that time was not to be ignored, so I looked back at the road as to not rear end someone.  I looked back over at the sky, and the object was no longer there.

I reside in Louisville, and frequently visit said friend as we have a 20 plus year friendship.  The day was fairly mundane and customary of the visits- on this particular day we were having a cookout to celebrate the holiday.   My friends brother of which Im also closely acquainted,  had also arrived and was assisting us with preparing the food. We were standing in a group in the patio area of my friends apartment, when for no particular reason I happened to glance upward facing East.  Immediately I viewed an object which was instantly unusual and atypical to me.  I called it to the attention of my friends.  For the next several minutes we observed this object in silence, then I suggested my friend go retrieve his binoculars.  Roughly 2 minutes later my friend appeared outside again with the binoculars and each of us in turn observed the object more closely through the binoculars.  This had the effect of enhancing the unusual nature of what we were witnessing. The weather that day was partly cloudy with a storm approaching from the west.  We were each facing east where visibility was clear.  It was approximately 5:30 in the afternoon and the sky was a crisp blue where visible to the east.  A bank of thin clouds were immediately overhead. The object we were viewing was a very stark black of perfectly square configuration.  The object had no surface features, no protrusions, no reflectivity and no oscillation.  The was no sound accompanying the object.  Upon first viewing the object it was roughly 25 degrees from the horizon and stationary.  As soon as I first viewed the object, it began ascending along a single vector straight upward at a very slow leisurely pace.  The object maintained it's relative configuration, size, speed of ascension, and color value the entire duration of the sighting and ascended until it dissapeared behind the above cloud bank.  With my arm outstretched the object would have been approximately the size of my forefinger nail.   As the object was against the backdrop of the sky there was no frame of reference to accurately determine distance or relative size of the object.   If I were to make a presumption based on my own depth perception of the objects spatial orientation it appeared to be closer rather than further, less than 2 miles away, making it roughly the size of an automobile. The object was in clear view long enough for a discussion during the sighting on what it clearly was not.  An entire gambit of possible explanations was dismissed as we were all viewing the object.  The object was clearly not an aircraft of conventional configuration, balloon, parasail, garbage bag, insect, bird, toy, kite,  or illusory figment.   This was a tangible, solid object that possessed mass and weight. I immediately contacted 911 and was instructed to contact New Albany or Jeffersonville police department, of which I did neither as the event was over and the object was no longer visible.   Additionally I contacted Louisville international airport and spoke with the radar operator.  The operator indicated there was nothing unusual in the sky over southern Indiana. The event left me disturbed and confounded.   I have a background in Psychology and I am fully aware of the many mechanisms within the human mind that can create potential misinterpretations of visual stimuli. The irony is while observing this object I distinctly recall all of these formal concepts raced through my mind it seemed,  and none of these were satisfactory to me.  Remotely. It is one thing to read about unexplained aerial phenomenon over the years, but to actually witness something that defies frame of reference or educational background  is quite startling.  I consider myself a fairly learned and educated individual with a working knowledge of meteorology, astronomy, physics, military aircraft, and human perception, yet the object I witnessed defied all of these schools of thought and rationale.  I am the type of person that doesn't enjoy mysteries and despite researching, careful contemplation, review, and even soul-searching, I never discovered an explanation that satisfies what I and my friends witnessed. A square object is not even aerodynamic, to say nothing of the stark black appearance of the object. I am not prepared to say what I viewed was of extraterrestrial origin, yet at the same time I am prepared to say what I viewed does not belong in the sky  over a major metropolitan area in broad daylight for all the world to see.  There was a strange eerie stillness to the whole event. To my knowledge no one else viewed this object with the exception of the  three of us, despite our close proximity to Interstate 65 which runs through southern Indiana and Louisville Ky. I would be quite curious if there was anyone else that happened to view this object that day.  To be perfectly honest, I would be relieved if it were infact mundane and simply mis-identified.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,38.32784732142857,-85.69607053571428

This had to be several miles away and up and the burst would have to be fairly large.  After the burst of light went out in the almost perfect symmetrical pattern, the two lights separated and moved away from each other until they were out of site. We both wondered what in the world it could be and I surmised that it must have been a jet doing a mid-air refuel and maybe the fuel upon separation caused the light.

This event occurred when I was approximately 5 years old; as such it is an old memory that may be partially ""contaminated"" by the intervening years, but it remains, nevertheless, a very vivid memory for me.  My parents were driving home after visiting relatives. It was late (after midnight) and I was trying to sleep in the back seat of the car. The weather was getting cold that time of year, so all the car windows were rolled-up. We were traveling through an area that was only partially developed at the time--a heavily forested road, or forest preserve land, near Riverside IL--when my father abruptly stopped the car.  I sat up, thinking that we had almost crashed, and looked out the front window. Indistinct shapes moved around a bright light at what seemed like some sort of accident, but I could not see any other crashed cars. My mother kept saying something like, ""What is that? What are they doing there?"" The light extended completely across the narrow road and was a brilliant amber-yellow color with other spectral shades in it . . . like the rainbow hues glimpsed along the edge of a beveled mirror. My mother was talking very fast and nervously and I could tell she was becomming upset. She kept insisting that my father back-up the car and get ""hell out of here."" My dad shouted back, ""I'm trying!"" but the car wouldn't move. My mom became hysterical when some of the figures turned toward us and started approaching the car.  As I watched I became aware of a presence alongside the car near me on the passenger side. The glare from the light, which now seemed all around us like an enveloping  fog, partially obscured him. This figure seemed to indicate to me that he wanted me to open the car door. When I reached up and raised the door ""button"", my mother began to scream uncontrollably: ""Don't let them in, DON'T LET THEM IN!"" I was unable to see any distinct features of the figures because of the glare around the car but, nevertheless, I could not understand her fear. One figure in particular seemed to want to play with me. He seemed older than me, but behaved just like a funny, playful older sibling. He projected this tremendous sense of warmth and affection toward me that I grasped immediately on a gut emotional level. No fear at all.  The last thing I remember was a monotonous buzzing sound as if the entire rear car window had been covered with insects. (I actually have what may be a screen memory of a thick blanket of buzzing flies entirely obscuring the view from the car's back window.) The car door opened and someone lifted me out. At first I thought this was my father, but it was not; the figure who lifted me was featureless, like a living shadow, without any discernable face. My body went limp, like someone who was asleep, only I was still conscious . . .  but it was as if I were outside of my own body, watching all this happening from a safe distance. I woke up the next morning at home in my bed surprised and confused about how I got there. When I asked my mother about the incident she simply said nothing had happened. To this day she either flatly refuses to discuss the incident or claims she has absolutely no recollection of it. I am a university lecturer. My father is deceased. My elderly mother lives with a 24-hour caregiver. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",,41.8373,-87.8291

I was nine years of age in the summer of 1958 and the sighting occurred at our family home about ten miles east of Castle Rock, Washington as my mother was tucking my two younger brothers and me into bed. We shared a single bedroom and my bed sat against the rear wall of the house off to one side of the bunk beds where my brothers slept. The windows were wide and narrow and high up near the ceiling. As my mother knelt down to kiss me good night, her attention was suddenly diverted by something that caught her eye as she glanced up through the window. Her face grew very serious then paled and her expression faded from curiosity to astonishment and then fear. Her expression frightened me and she failed to respond when I asked her what was wrong several times. I was afraid to look out the window myself because of the fear I saw in my mother’s face.  The following morning she told me she had looked out the window into the darkness just as a very large cigar-shaped silhouette glided silently into her view from her right (east), barely clearing the tops of the eighty-foot fir trees in the forest that began fifty yards behind our house. She said that she first thought she was witnessing a passenger airliner about to crash but then realized it was moving so slowly that it was nearly hovering and that there was absolutely no engine noise. She thought this was odd, because it was so close she thought she should be hearing something. She said as the object passed her field of view, she could see windows glowing with yellow light spaced evenly along the sides and even thought she may have caught a quick glimpse of dark humanoid shadows in one or two of the windows. She said it reminded her of watching a nearby passenger train passing in the night. She continued staring out the window for several seconds after the object drifted out of view, expecting to hear a crash somewhere nearby, but there was no such sound and that confused her even more.  My mother called the radio station the following morning and reported what she’d seen. The man she talked to said they had received dozens of similar reports from all around the area and that her sighting appeared to be where the sightings first began coming in. He told her the UFO had been tracked on radar across Oregon and into California where it turned west and then disappeared off the screen over the ocean at a very high rate of speed.  End of report.

Will make the report here. Here goes. Date: May or June 1964 or '65. Time: Just past dark. Sky: Moonless, no clouds, excellent star gazing evening. My father had recently bought a boat and a pair of binoculars to use on the boat. It was a clear evening. I decided to take the binoculars and stargaze. Happened to meet a neighbor of mine out in front of my house. Every star was out, viewing was great! I happened to see large meteor. I quickly pointed it out to my neighbor. I first saw it appear in the SW sky heading NW and going down at about a 10 to 15 degree angle. Its heading would be about 315 degrees. It was huge and visible for much longer than any meteor I had ever seen. It disappeared on the dead west horizon. At the tender age of 14 or 15 I got the idea that it must have been a fairly good size hunk of rock  hit earth dead west of where we were. We lived 25 miles north of Detroit at the time. I also figured that it hit well beyond Lake Michigan. I believe the next day in the local papers was the story of a meteorite that hit somewhere in Iowa. Had a map in the article and I was right! Do some research, you might find it and then know when it happened. It hit dead west of us hundreds of miles away in Iowa I believe. Less than a minute later I saw something out of the corner of my eys in the SE skymaybe 30 degrees off the horizon. I quickly locked with both eyes and at first thought I was looking at a flock of ducks or geese. The flock  was making an arcing turn to the north and west. As they got directly east they flattened out in a smooth motion and started to pass overhead and go directly west. Didn't seem like birds flapping wings to me, this was smooth and no wing flap sound. I quickly locked on with the binoculars. They were well focused. About 60 degrees off the horizon, east I saw 4 disk shaped objects flying in fighter plane formation. There was structure to them, not just disks with a dome. I could see wind screens. They, the craft, were luminiscent.Didn't really have time to see who the pilots were. And traveling fast . I h! ollered Look to my riend. Adrenalin was pumping I was excited to say the least. I quickly gave the binocs to my friend. He got a quick look before they disapeared from sight, going dead west. Stll no sound what so ever. I kind of thought they may head to where the meteor hit. I believe the ufos were 500 to 1,000 agl ( above ground leve). From the time they were directly overhead to the time they were gone from sight was only a few secnds. Fighter jets would take longer and make a hell of a noise. Single engine private planes probably would be visible for a couple minutes Seemed like maybe going about 20 or 22 times faster than say, a Piper or a Cescna. This would put the speed about 2,100 mph. This also seems to be a good guess on my part. Next day I told my sisters husband about it. He was in the army in a radar control room at a Nike missle base tat was on a nearby air force base.I told him the time, speed direction. He says they saw them, didn't know what they were and weren't supposed to talk about it. Next day while on my paper route I stopped at a local ice cream stand and told a friend of mine the worked there what we  saw. He told me not to tell him, but tell the guy behind me. Turns out to be a guy from another Nike base. He happened to be at in the radar control room at that base at the time and reconfimed what my sisters husband said, including they weren't suppose to talk about it. In the mean time I read everything I can on the subject of ufos. Lot of garbage out thereWhat is real, what is't? I learned to talk to very few people on the subject of ufos. Now the whole reason for this report. In a sighting report you wrote,""We do not understand why if the same witness reported to NUFORCin 1993, he has waited until 2005to report his sighting in 1968. Doesn't make sense to us. PD"" I can tell from experience I don't report all ufos I see. Might want to tell the story annonymusly, or tell the story before time runs out as Maj. Marcel did.

The location was East of Marysville above or slightly east of the  Quilceda Golf Course. It was a very clear sky that night and one could see in the background Mt. Pilchuck and then the old Ski Slope lights in the background.  This disk shaped craft displaying bright yellowish / white portals (rectangular shape) windows. These windows were quite visable of the 180 degree  facia of the upper portion of the craft. What made this craft unusual was extending from each side of the  diameter of the craft were circurlar tubes. At the end of these tubes or conduits were as it appeared  round balls.  Much like a vertical lolly pop stick infused into the candy ball. This craft appeared to my brother and I as if it were a transport or research craft. from these round balls extended from the craft one could quite clearly see colored red,green,white colored objects flowing to the ground. These objects were round in dimension. From the bottom of the craft flowing to the ground were streams of gaseoues like colors, green.red,blue.  This activity lasted for about one hour. During this time of activity this craft made vertical and horizontal movements from slow to very raid speeds.  After the  decending colored objects from the balls stopped, the lighting from the portals became much brighter for about 15 minutes from what I belive was the cabin lights of this craft. Shortly after the powering up of the light intensity This craft went from a very staionary position a rapid speed I have nver seen in my life out over Mt.

I was delivering newspapers at approximately 3:30 AM, October 1, 1961, (plus of minus a week), on North Braden Avenue at the corner of East Marshal Street.  It was cold (30-35F) and the sky was clear of clouds. Two circular, saucer-shaped objects flew over me in a North-East direction, generally headed toward the Tulsa airport approximately two and a half miles away.  My estimate at the time was that they were flying at about 250 feet altitude, and were about 80 feet across.  It was relatively easy to judge the distance, as the edges of the saucers were crisply in focus.  There was very faint scoring or scratching on the bottom surface of the saucers, giving a slight textured appearance, which also allowed me to judge altitude better.  They flew at approximately 15-20 MPH (very slowly), and in line (one behind the other, same altitude).  The bottom of the saucers glowed with a golden light that pulsed slowly, in about a 2-3 second cycle from dimmer to lighter and back to dimmer.  The pulsing was very distinct, but not the cycle was not ""wide,"" in that it was never particularly bright, and always a bit dim.  The saucers were completely silent.  There were no ""point"" lights, or particular light emitting locations except for the whole of the under surface. The location was very slightly hilly, and the saucers proceeded in a direction directly in line with the street.  I would watch clearly them until they had flown about a mile and a half away.  As they receded, it became apparent that the main bodies of the saucers had the appearance of two thin spherical surfaces, one above and one below, meeting at the edges.  Given the estimate that the saucers were 80 feet in diameter, I estimate that the main body of the saucers were 8 feet thick. The main body of each saucer was surmounted by a translucent (opaque) white dome, rising approximately 4 feet above the main body.  The dome was only a little brighter than the golden bottoms.  There were no ""point"" sources of light on the dome.  I do not recall that the top surface of the saucers, apart from the domes, glowed; however, it is likely that they did glow only a little dimmer than the bottoms or I would have noticed either that they were dark or that the saucer bodies were uniformly bright, top and bottom.  I do not recall that the dome lighting pulsed. It is possible that my size estimates are too small.  It is possible that the saucers were instead, 125 feet across and 12 feet thick in the main body with a 6-7 foot dome, flying up to but not exceeding 400 feet in altitude.  These sizes are an upper limit and unlikely. At the time I was skilled in aircraft recognition, having been growing up with a parent who was employed at the Tulsa Airport and who kept me well informed about airplanes and air flight mechanics.  I was also a relatively skilled hunter, with a good sense of distance for estimating bullet trajectories for high powered rifles. Naturally, I thought this to be an extraordinary incident, and so I kept my eyes on the sky for many mornings thereafter.  Subsequently, within two or three weeks I saw another saucer, which I will report here as part of the same incident. I was standing at the corner of East Pine and North Yale, approximately half a mile North of the previous sighting, and saw a saucer fly overhead in a South-West direction toward downtown Tulsa, 4 miles away.  The location was elevated sufficiently so that I could see the downtown skyline.  The saucer was the same size and shape, but this time flying silently at 750-1000 feet altitude at perhaps 200-250 MPH.  It glowed with a golden pulsing light, as had the two saucers in the previous sighting. Within perhaps 1 to 1-1/2 minutes, the saucer passed just even with or to the other side of the downtown region and turned Northward at probably the same speed.  From this distance it was a little easier to estimate the altitude, as the profile of the saucer was relatively clear, although distant and therefore a small visual object.  The saucer flew Northward for about a mile, until more or less directly East of me, then abruptly changed both direction and speed.  The saucer abruptly veered upward at about 25 degrees -- a ""point-turn"" with no curvature to it that I could detect from where I was.  It abruptly increased in speed to what I would estimate to be about 1500 MPH.  I judge this to be the speed from the prior assessment that it was going 250 MPH, and was not going 6-8 times that speed, upward at the 25 degree angle.  It seemed that the saucer accelerated from 250 to 1500 in not more than a few hundred feet, if it took even that distance.  For all I knew, it was instantaneous, since one or two saucer-body lengths in acceleration to that speed would have been indistinguishable from instantaneous.  The saucer continued upward rapidly until I could no longer see it. Within one week more, I saw something that I presumed to be a saucer, also.  From the same location at Pine and Yale, I looked into the sky Southward and a little East, and saw high into the sky (about 55-60 degrees elevation) what appeared to be a meteor entering the atmosphere -- a not uncommon sight.  However, this meteor began to glow, then streaked down at about 150-160 degrees downward Upper Left to Lower Right in my vision, then abruptly slowed and stopped in place, still glowing brightly from what I thought to be heated entry into the atmosphere.  After remaining completely still for approximately 10 seconds, it flew off horizontally to the horizon, Eastward (probably South-East from its stopped position) and disappeared into the distance.  I could not see features on this object, nor its shape.  The event was probably 8-10 miles distant, perhaps in an area 1-3 miles West of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. These three events were the only ones I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",,36.109455879967555,-95.93524541768045

This is an incident that happened to my mother and sister around August 1965. I'm guessing at the date, but my mom was teaching my sister to drive so I believe it was the autumn before my sister turned 16.  I would be able to ask my sister to verify the year and month if the researchers here would like me to.  Neither my sister nor my mother ever officially reported this sighting to anyone, (outside of family and friends) at any time, but, even after all these years, I've decided it should be on the record.  Roseville, Michigan, near Detroit. It was late evening, maybe 10 or 11pm. Because there was very little traffic my mother thought it would be a good time to have my sister practice her driving. My sister drove around on some side streets near our home then drove toward a near-by school, Eastland Jr. High, to practice parking in their lot. As they approached, my mother suddenly noticed a large, metallic ""saucer"", with rectangular windows hovering very low over the school and parking lot. It was lit up inside. My mother yelled to my sister to stop the car. My sister hadn't yet seen the UFO and assumed she was about to hit an animal or something so she slammed on the brakes. My mother jumped out of the car and walked toward the craft. When my sister got out of the car she spied it and grabbed my mother's arm trying to stop her from getting closer. My sister kept saying, ""what is it?"", my mom kept saying, ""You can see it, you tell me."" My mom then told my sister to go knock on the door of a near-by house to try to get another witness but my sister refused to leave her side. My mother said it made no noise, my sister says she heard a low hum. My sister says she saw a ""shadowy"" figure in one of the windows as it slowly rotated, my mother insists there was no figure. After hovering there for several minutes, it started to slowly move away.  My mother told my sister to get back in the car, and with my mother now at the wheel they tried to follow the UFO. It finally disappeared behind some trees. My mother said that was the last time they saw it, my sister said she actually saw it zoom up into the sky and disappear into space.  I think they also reported an antenna with a light on it attached between a couple of the windows.  They both repeated this story to me and others many times over the years. They always completely agreed about all the main parts of the story. They always disagreed about only these three things; the figure, the hum and the zooming away. Their stories never wavered dispite a falling out that had them not speaking for years. My mother passed away in 1995 but my sister still tells the story.  One other thing to note about this. One day in 1979 I brought my mother her mail. It included the April edition of OMNI magazine which my mother subscribed to. There was a drawing of UFO's on the cover. As my mother flipped through the magazine she suddenly said ""Oh my God, that's it!"". She showed me a picture then called my sister's husband (they weren't speaking during this time) and told him to go buy the magazine and give it to my sister. An hour or so later my sister called and actually talked to my mother about the photo. They both agree this was what they saw. I have my mom's copy of the magazine still but it's packed away somewhere. I can find it and pinpoint the exact page and picture if asked or scan and email it. If I remember correctly, that photo was said to have been taken around the same year and maybe in the same area that they saw the craft.

As Iam driving on the 684 and get past exit 3, half way to exit 4 which is about at least 2 miles between exit 3 and exit 4, the last mile to exit 4 was like day time bright, and I even shut off my highbeams.

Well I dropped off my customers at Mt.Kisco and rushed back in about 10  minutes to see exactly where those lights were coming from.  When I got back on the 684 southbound it was like pitch black again.  Could not understand what happen to those bright lights that just disappeared.  Well I turned my highbeams on again and I was looking around everywhere to see what just happened.  Could not find anything to explain where those extremely brights were coming from.

At 6:00pm the news came on and the Anchor Reporter had news coming in from Arizona that over 200 people called the Arizona police to report sightings of about 7-8 bright disc flying in formation in Arizona through the evening sky.  Those bright lights that I saw at 4-4:30am in the morning that same day in Mt.Kisco were probably the same lights those 200 people saw who called the Arizona police that evening in Arizona.  In Mt.Kisco between Northbound and Southbound between exit 3 and 4 there are mountains of trees about maybe 20 to 30 yards wide.  These UFO's were hiding above those trees in Mt.Kisco while I was traveling that night. I was only yards away from a tribe of aliens from another world for just a short minute or so, interesting experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I noticed a light moving across the horizon from east to west. The night was cloudy and the light was below the clouds moving in a straight line. This was a solid bright white light traveling about the speed of a jet. I've seen jets before up in these mountains and they had blinking lights. Passaconaway is located in a mountain valley so the object could not have been more than mile from our location. I yelled to my brother inlaw and he also observed it. We did not here any sound and I backed away from the river listening for any noise as the object went out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was a small bright orange light that seemed to be dancing around.  My husband and I couldn't make out what could have been causing it.  We know two things for sure based on the abnormalities of the object's movement and the level it was at - it was not an airplane, and was not a light from the ground.

Frankly, I don't know what i really saw, except that it was unlike any aircraft I ever saw, and let me tell you I have seen my fair share of them. Please let me explain.  I am an army veteran with nine years and nine months of service.  My job numerclature was (16-sierra-20) what that means is; I was in charge of a shoulder fired stinger missle anti aircraft team.  I was littraly trained to identify hundreds of aircraft, both Nato and non Nato aircraft; within five to seven secounds, my gunner within ten secounds.  To this day i'm still pretty good at it.  I live next to the bigest army base in the United States so I still get plenty of practice.  The inccident happened as I was leaving Los Vagas on my way back to Texas. I was driving through the dessert heading East, off to my right front on my passenger side, I noticed a silver oval object very bright and relecting the sun.  At first I thought it was a jet plain, but as it got closser it did not fit any profile I ever seen.   It actually seamed to me as if it was bird dogging me.  It made several mennuvers up and down as it decreased and icreased in spead. If it was a human pilot in that aircraft I would think the goverment may have come up with some sort of new G-suit, becouse it would have definetly turned him or her into putty.  Anyway it really started to give me the willies so I got on my C-B Radio and tried to reach somebody, anybody, I just wanted to see if any one else was seeing what I was seeing.  Well I never did get a responce back, the whole thing lasted for about 15-min.  The dammed thing seamed to littraly just blink out of exitstance.   I never told any one about it, never really felt compailed to do so.  But reacently I have thought about that day qwiet a bit.  I even dreamed about it several times. it started to bug me more and more the more I think obout it the more it bugs me.  Well any way I really felt like I had tell somebody.  I still havent told anyone I know I don't think I can; becouse receantly I started to get treatment for depression and I don't want any one to think i'm going nuts.  So I decided to do some reasearch and cme accros this site.   I know I got to sound like some nut job but it really feels good to tell my story, just to get it off my chest. I don;t know maybe there is something to this U-F-O- stuff after all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  We have assigned an artifical date in 2001.

A dimm, yellow round light hovering in the sky about a mile and a half away. It was hovering about 100 feet in the air. When I noticed it I told my friend to look at it, I pointed at it. We both had no clue what it could be because the light was too big to be a helicopter, and we knew it wasnt an airplane. About 2 minutes after we spotted the object, we saw something very strange! The erea where the object was hovering over is a resivior (Sweetwater Resivior) which is our water supply. The object began dropping things into the resivior. The objects it was dropping fell very slowly and illuminated with many different colors. Rainbow colored objects. It was unbelievable. I couldnt determine the size of the illuminating objects, but they seemed to sparkle as they fell. On and off. After about 3 munutes of dropping things into the water, it vanished.

We will seek permission from CUFOS to either link to, or post to the NUFORC site, the follow-up written report by Mr. Jamrus.  PD)) Train Collision At exactly 2:47 a.m. on Jan. 14 02, while working a coal train enroute from Russell Kentucky to Shelbiana Kentucky, our trailing unit and first two cars were severely damaged as we struck an unknown floating or hovering object.  I know it was 2:47 because my watch froze, and to this day shows that time.   Along with my watch the entire electrical systems on both locomotives went haywire.  Approaching a bend near milepost cmg 42 in an area referred to as the wild kingdom, for the many different types of animals spotted there, my conductor and I saw lights coming from around the way. This ordinarily means another train is coming and will pass on the other track.  The outlay of the area is this, the river, #1 track, #2 track and a straight up mountainside, carved out for the laying of these tracks.  I killed our lights as not to blind the oncoming crew.  As we rounded the corner our onboard computer began to flash in and out, speed recorder went nuts, and both locomotives died.  Alarm bells began to ring and thats when we saw the objects.  Apparently scanning the river for something, the objects, (at least 3) had several ""search"" lights trained there, the first object hovered about 10 to 12 feet above the track.  Metallic silver in color with multiple colored lights near the bottom and in the middle, no windows or openings of any kind that we could see.  Approximately 18 to 20 feet in length and probably ten feet high.   With both engines dead as we rounded the corner we made little noise and the first object did not respond in time, I estimate that we hit the object at 30 mph with 16,000 trailing tons behind us.  It clipped the top of our lead unit then skipped back slicing a chunk out of our trailing unit and first two coal cars.  The other objects vanished into thin air.  Our emergency brakes had initiated due to the loss of power and we stopped approximately a mile and a half to two miles after impact.  Our power restored after we were stopped and we notified our dispatcher, located in Jacksonville Fla. of what had happened.  We were told to inspect the cars to see if they'd hold the rail and try to limp into milepost cmg 60 which used to be the Paintsville yard which is no longer in full operation.  We checked everything out and the cab of the rear locomotive was demolished and smoking, the second two cars looked as if they had been hit with a giant hammer but looked like they'd hold the rail.  We pulled into Paintsville yard at approximately 5:15 am. The huge overhead lights lining the yard were noticeably dark and the only lights came from what we assumed were railroad officials vehicles parked near the end of the track.  We pulled to a stop and began unloading our grips off the wounded train.  We could hear what sounded like an army of workers immediately tending to our train.  Vehicle doors slamming, guys running by in weird outfits and lights glaring from all directions, the one thing missing was railroad officials.   A guy named Ferguson shook my hand and asked me to follow him into the old yard office.  We did, once inside they, and by they I mean I have no idea who these people were, began to ask us hundreds of questions, they then told us for our own protection we'd be medically tested before we could leave.   I asked repeatedly to talk to my road foreman or trainmaster and not only were these requests denied but they confiscated my conductors cellular phone.  Hours later we were led outside the old yard office and the strange things continued to happen, the 2 locomotives and two cars were removed from the rest of the train we had brought in and my only guess was parked 4 tracks over under a huge tent like structure buzzing with activity.  We were lead off property and told due to national security our silence on this matter would be appreciated.   We were then put in a Railroad vehicle and taken to Martin Kentucky were we went throgh questioning again with railroad officials and were then drug tested.   After all of this we were sent on to Shelbiana, where we took rest for 8 hours and worked another train back to Russell.  Working back we passed by Paintsville, no sign of the engines, cars, tent, people,  nothing. ((COMMENT/ADDENDUM FROM VISITOR TO NUFORC SITE, MAY 16, 2006)) For what it's worth, as a railfan I can say the terminology/slang the witness is using is accurate and how he describes the train's reaction seems likely.  Since he says his dispatcher is in Jacksonville, FL, I can tell it happened on CSX.  You might want to ask him about that and if he remembers the unit numbers or model.  Locomotives last between 15-20 years unless they are totally demolished in a wreck.  That means the units involved are most likely still in service and can, perhaps, be examined.   Another FWIW would be the Portland, OR, railcams that operate 24/7 with some sky in the views.  I doubt that they archive their feed but you never know.

There were three of them, motionless in the sky, just visible over the buildings. They appeared to be very far away and gave the impression of being VERY large though I can't be certain of this. Each one appeared to be of the cigar shaped variety and glowed a dull white which stood out well against the darkening sky.  They were in a perfect triangular formation and never moved at all.  The sighting ended when we arrived at our destination and the building obscured our view, when we left later it was gone.

Red, blue, and green lights, and it looked like the blue lights strobed around the middle circumfrence of the ball, flashing twice per second.  Didn't think much of it until it started getting closer.  We turned up the music and began flashing the truck headlights and it grew twice as large and even closer.  At this time we were freaking out and shut off the headlights and turned off the music.  Whatever is was hovered erratically for thirty seconds and dissappeared instantaneously.  We couldn't believe what had just happened and sat back down by the fire and were talking about it when the strangest thing that has ever happened in my life hit all three of us at once.  We were in a half circle, sitting on the ground, and from the tips of my fingers spreading through my whole body I recieved a powerful jolt of electricity, a quick ZAP!  It wouldn't have been a huge deal, but ALL THREE OF US GOT HIT EXACTLY AT THE SAME TIME!  The millisecond it happened we all looked directly into each other's eyes and said, ""Holy $%#@, DID YOU FEEL THAT!  All three of us had recieved a shock the strength of an electric fence, at the exact same time, but instead of my whole body being shocked at once, i first felt the jolt in the tips of my fingers because I was pointing at something and it was the closest body part to the dark forest in front of us.  The crazy thing was, I thought I heard a faint zap type of a sound when it happened, and it seemed to have come from the forest, directly below where we had seen the spherical object with flashing lights.  The night had just begun.  The music and truck lights were turned back on, when two of us noticed something and called over the third person.  We saw a creamy-white light, larger than a star, but we couldn't tell if it was in our atmosphere, or out in the solor system.  It seemed far away and close at the same time.  It was moving in a swooping direction, like how you would draw a puffy cloud, or in elementary school when you move the decimal point you make the swoosh under the numbers to count how many spaces to move the decimal.  That is the movement this object was making, yet totally different location in the sky, different color, and complete different erratic movement than the first object we saw.  Immediatley following, there was one more oject that appeared way, way out, as far as the stars and about the size of a star, but it was going up, down, left, right, diagonal, every direction possible.  It was so erratic it was completely unpredictable where it would move next.  All three sightings lasted nearly five minutes each, spread out over the course of almost three hours.  That night was the clearest I have ever seen the sky, even more clear than it is in the middle of Alaska.  There were aircraft going by, easily distinguished by there red and green lights, direction, altitude and speed.  I am a pilot so I know what is an airplane and what is not,and what we saw that night, had no scientific, logical, or spiritual explanation.  We all told each other we are surely not alone in this universe.  And we proved it to ourselves that night.  Even though all three of us saw those objects, the craziest, most insane thing that has every happened to any of us was being shocked, jolted, in the middle of the dark forest, with no person, place, or thing around.  It was absolutely insane, and will remember that night for the rest of my life.  Look up, you never know what you are going to see, (or not see) that is mystifying  the universe.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,32.7857,-116.4874

But I was just taking pictures of the scenery with my digital camera, and didn't even realize that there was a strange object in the middle of one of the photos I had taken (I put the photos on my computer a couple days ago).  I would have just shrugged it off except for the fact that I had taken an identical picture less than 30 seconds later and the object was no where to be see.  I don't recall there being anything in the photo at the time I had taken it, but then again, I wasn't expecting anything to be in it.  In the picture the weird object is just a small black blur that is right in the middle of the clear sky.  I'm not really sure what it is, or what it could be, so I wanted to contact someone to see if they could tell me what it is exactly.

The sky was pitch black and many stars could be seen, including many high flying airplanes heading for Europe in the same path continuously.  However, towards the Northeast I saw a bright light, about as bright as a light from a lighthouse if it were a mile away, about 10 degrees above the horizon.  Now, there is a small airport with a light in that direction as well, but it was clearly distinguishable that this was not the airport light.  The light, which glimmered, traveled further to the East in a direction away from us.  I mentioned it to my father, who saw it for himself and admitted that he did not think it was an airplane.  The craft would move up and down about 5 degrees while moving towards the East.  The craft did this about five times while we watched it.

It appeared to be about 50 feet above a street lamp. I was approaching a stop sign which merged onto the highway I needed to drive on. As I came close to the stop sign, the street light suddenly dimmed and went out, as did my car headlights and dash lights. I felt the car was going to stall, but it didn’t. As I turned right, I noticed something to my left, and stopped to investigate. Much to my shock, I saw this object hovering stationary above the street light. I stopped the car, and the craft also stopped, which had begun to move. I began to accelerate and it did the same!  I again stopped my car, and it also stopped….and then began to turn towards me! As I took off in my car, all the street lights and the local motel’s outdoor lights all went out at the same time. I again pulled over, and much to my amazement, all the lights began flickering, and came on again! The craft then took off, heading in a southerly direction. I have just learned that it had been spotted in this area twice since June 2007. Living in the country, and driving alone and encountering this object that late at night really terrified me.

I could see no outline of an aircraft, only the lights.  The sound was lower than any other aircraft I've seen flying overhead. It also seemed to be flying both slower and lower than other any other aircraft I've seen at night, although it was hard to tell against the night sky and since I couldn't see any outline of the craft.  It traveled in approximately a nw - se direction.  I can't say the exact time it was since it was several weeks ago but can approximate somewhere between 2200 and 0000 at night.

All  I saw through the view finder was the clouds and the moon. I never saw what turned up in the photo.

I am currently a plant insulator, but was a plant operator for a time. On the morning that this observation occured we , myself and 3 fellow insulator/coating spealists, were to clean and recoat insulators on a transformer located at the north end of the plant. While waiting for a qualified electriction ( for safety purposes) an airplane was observed coming from the horizion toward us. As it came closer to our position I, we, all noticed that it was not a normal airplane.  It had no sound coming from it's engine and no wings, as it came closer(2000 feet away) we noticed that it also had no lights. This being just after daylight was easy to see.  The speed of the craft was approx. 300 mph.  It then disapeared behind a knole approx. 1/4 mile north of the plant. We continued to watch, for a crash and flames, but in 30 seconds it reappeared heading out to sea, West, again at approx. 300 mph, but picked up speed and disapeared over the horizon at a very fast speed. Our eye level was at 90 feet above sea level, so we were able to see quite far out to sea.  Visability was exceptional. The craft was not large, probably 100 feet long and 20 feet in diameter, my best guess. It was shaped exactly like a cigar, color of silver or bright white.

I saw this UFO a long time ago, but did not think to report it until now.  I don't recall exactly when I saw the UFO, but it was some time in the winter months of either 1992 or 1993. I was with my husband, Michael (who was my boyfriend at the time of the sighting), late one evening.  I was a student of Pennsylvania State University at the time.  Michael was a graduate of Penn State and was visiting me for the weekend at the time.  Penn State had an area in its vast grounds commonly called the ""Deer Pens"" which is part of its Deer Research Facility. Late that evening, perhaps roughly around 11:00 pm, though I don't recall the exact time, we decided to go up to the deer pens and see what we can see at night, even though it was pitch black out at the time.  Call us crazy college students.  Anyway, we went up there driving in Michael's car, and the place is deserted.  The deer pens themselves are surrounded by a tall chain-link fence to contain the deer, and the inside the fenced area is off-limits to the public and accessible only to the deer researchers and the deer themselves. The access road (dirt and gravel road) we were on was just outside the fence.  As we drove up to the central part of the deer pens viewing area, we noticed a glowing object on the ground inside the deer pen.  The object was roughly the size of a small barn or very large storage shed.  However, the object's shape was like a rounded cone shape.  The whole thing was glowing a bright orangey-red color, and appeared to have a ""doorway"" in the center of the object.  The doorway was shaped in a vertical rectangular shape that was arched at the top.  The doorway, or opening perhaps, was colored black or was simply darkened.  The object appeared to be sitting on the ground inside the deer pen, and was located perhaps 100 ft away from us in a clearing of the woods.  We sat there in the car peering at this object in disbelief for a long minute or so, wondering what in the world it was.  We both quickly came to the realization that we might be looking at a landed UFO or some sort, and became freaked out.  We then fleed the area as quickly as we could by backing out down the access road in our car.  After we left the scene, we did not see anything else that night out of the ordinary.  The following morning, we went back to the site to check and make sure there wasn't some strange building on-site in the pens that would explain it all and make sense to us in the morning daylight.  When we arrived at the site, there was no buildings or structures of any kind in the deer pen, only deer and trees.  The was a clearing in the trees in the area where we saw the ULO (Unidentified Landed Object) large enough to contain the ULO, but no sign that anything had been there the night prior.

I just happened to look up & noticed an object passing directly overhead, not much higher than the tree tops. It was moving incredibly fast & did not make a sound. When I first noticed it, it was directly overhead & it had a round, black underside, which appeared as a black circular disk. As it passed heading west I got a good look at the object. It had a smooth oval shape & was silvery metallic in color. The sun was glinting off the object. It went just over the tree tops & was quickly out of view. The best thing I can think of to compare it to is an Airstream Trailer, only more round, with no visible windows & with a dark, frying pan like bottom.

Part of my military occupational specialty entailed reporting to the National Security Agency (NSA) on Soviet & East German Air Force activity, including aircraft speeds & descriptions. I held a top secret security clearance. This object was heading in the direction of a hydro-electric plant about five miles away in Baltic, CT. I had a friend who had told me that he & others had seen such an object hovering over the hydro-electric plant. I heard that some other people in Southeastern Connecticut had witnessed an unidentified object in the sky that day, but I have not been able to find any accounts of this on-line that coincide with the date of my sighting. I took a photograph of the area where the object had passed. I drew a picture of the object into the photo using computer graphics & notated the date.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,,

Very easy to discribe, but you wont believe. I bought a house in detroit, and i lived there about one year and started having dreams about, well everything. Then one day i was sleeping in my bed on my side facing north and I was awoken by a three dimensional triangle. It was like GOD, and totally scared me. it started between my eyes, close to my face and moved to the left in a perfect golden(actually like a silvery) line. I will explain in cartesien coords. positive X-dir points into your face, positive Y-dir points to the right, and positive Z-dir points up. I will use the unit vector space of i+j+k. start to finish it took this path in straight lines. (1,.5,0) (1,0,0) (.5,.5,sqrt 3/4)) (0,1,0) (0,.5,0) a pyrimid!!!!!   saw it with both eyes, and they were both closed. I could not open my eyes until the design was over. It was not a dream. all the lines stayed there and did not fade until the design was completed and then they all vanished at once. I have noticed stange phenominon on the abdomins of bugs. such as little spirts of light shooting directly out of one type of bug butt. all of one kind of that bug on a certain day do it exactly the same, but not at the exact same time. this is wierd because i came back thoughout the day and the light about the length of my fingure nail and as thin as a microscopic wire being lit was the same every time and from every angle, inside the house, and outside in the garden. when i look for them i can see the glittery light in my eyes any time i want now that i know what it is. I assume that it either has to do with getting someones attn. that this is the only way to comunicate from the future. such as the use of a creating a new life force with the message ebeded in the DNA, and the key is to be the first to find the new bug of the year and decode the message. I am the only one i know who also does not remember this bug from the previous year. OK, am i really that off topic? There have been more bugs that I have seen that have come in mass amounts that have not been there the year before. That bug that looks like the ladybug but was a beatle, NEW!!!. the one i saw was black, had a red v on the back and was about 2 cm long. I currently am around the cylotron at MSU alot. I saw one other design that was a flash of about 1/20 th of a second and looked like a non moving design: _ <X>, with a lines on the sides, top and bottom. Like: <|X|> with all the gaps touching                                                -  I have a book on the oldest GOD dating back to 3000 years before the pyrimids were built, THOTH. the design on the cover is,  /\ /  \ /----\ / \  / \ /___\/___\ , with a dot in the middle. it is black and the design is white.

This sighting took place in 2003 (the exact day is unknown but I believe it was on August 23rd).   The sighting was later verified as having been seen by two Mexican laborers I had working on my property. As you can see by the attached photos (jpegs) of which there are two (2) the sighting was photographed with an old digital camera close by the edge of a street in VOC and shows the same landscape with about a 10-feet difference.  I am sending you four jpegs of the sighting of which two are enlargements of the object in question. For your information, although I would prefer anonymity regarding what I am sending you, my wife and I are known artists, although 30 some years in the past I was, for 14-years, a trained US Army Special Forces NCO and worked in intelligence and communications under the command and control of the CIA.  The reason for my telling you this is that if there is an investigation it will not leave you hanging for a response.  Also, there is the fact that since 2000 I have video-taped a number of unidentified flying objects in and nearby VOC; but enough of the past as this sighting was accidental as at the time my wife was photographing monsoon clouds to use in her paintings and we did not see the object until the photographs were downloaded onto our computer. Even then the object was thought to have been a speck of dirt or other material on the lens.  It wasn’t until I began enlarging the photographs that I sighted; on the bottom left of the photo a red spot lighted area upon the ground and above, on the top left, a white spot lighted area on a cloud.  Reflected sunlight?  However, photo nr. two shows, on the bottom left, only a white spotlighted area on the ground.  Further enlargements of the black spot (see corresponding formation of sky surrounding the unknown object) piqued my curiosity when it showed an oval object that looks to be a person in side the object, standing before a vertical rectangular object (control board?).  I will leave it up to you as to what the object is and, if you find it intriguing, enlarge the object yourself. As for the Mexican laborers, they told me they had sighted the same object while changing a flat tire on their vehicle.  They also stated that the object had then approached and landed upon one of the Mesas in the background shown in my photos.  When they returned home and told their families they had been ridiculed so they hadn’t told anyone else other than their employer.  Later, while working upon a studio for me I showed the photos to their employer and he then showed it to the two men and they told me that the object was the same one they had sighted.  Unfortunately, I didn’t have the two men write down what they had seen and like the unknown day we took the photos I or my wife cannot provide any further information.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,34.904693548387094,-111.89417096774194

They appear to be from Beal AFB and/or somewhere south.  They hover like stars in the sky and can bleep in and out as needed.  They emit many colors and seem to be a bit unstable. I now know that the light is a scanner system for the surface of the earth. I borrowed a telescop from a friend and took it to another friends home to try.  As I did,,, I noticed that they seem to be aware of me watching them.  As I drove home about 10 miles. I could see and feel one at my back all the times.  I had to go see my mother.  Even though I had to talk to her, I was afraid to tell my mother as she wouldn't have believed me,,, nor would my wife.  THEY DO NOW!!!!!!!!  When I set up the scope at my Mothers home,,, a large craft dropped out of the sky and hovered just behind the tree line.  That was all the evidence my mother needed.  She was at once astonished and then she scolded me and said ""believe me son,,, you don't want to keep doing this.  As usual I didn't listen,,, perhaps someday I will. I went home and got my son,,, we dove 2 miles to a clear spot in the canyon.  It was there that my son and I watched a craft hover over head at 800 to one thousand feet, and just drop to the ground.  No sound????????  no movement not even any heat..  My son and I had a real bad feeling and chose to leave then. This is no joke. I would advise any skeptic not to look if you don't want to know.  These are war games they are working on or,,,they are really in combat.  See for yourself. My son is a believer now,,,, and my wife and mother are too. THIS IS REALL,,,, I was in the military many years ago.  I can tell you that I believe they are about to make this public. I have never seen a ship that can defy gravity, has somekind of radar or defense beam, and appears to be able to fly at 50 to 80 thousand miles an hour.  I can blink out to invisible!!!!!!   The place is in the greater Sacramento area in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas.  It happens every night but Sunday (Even Aliens need to go to church).  If you want to see the show,,,come and get it.  It brought around a skeptic like me.  Please,,, don't aim a telescope at any of the craft.  When they scan,,, they see the return beam from the reflection. I am certain thats why they took a close look at my son and I. I must look like a shoulder fired missle.  I would be nervous too. I think they are X22-A's and several other manufacturers.  I love the home team.  I just which I knew who the home team in this case. These are US owned and operated though.

I began to turn around in a vacant golf course.  When I turned North into the lot, there was a bright series of lights directly in front of us and just over our heads.  The sky was light blue with thin whisps of clouds.  Our windows were down and I was talking on the phone to a friend.  My daughter and I were amazed at what was in front of us and I expressed this to my caller and daughter by saying , oh my god, what is in front of us.  I said are those planes, they can't be planes, what is in front of us.  I leaned my head towards the open window for any sound.  My daughter was already amazed by what she saw.  We both were excited and stunned by what we thought was a UFO.  My daughter actually yelled it's a UFO.  I think it's going to land.  My other daughter in the back seat said she couldn't see anything and was frightened telling us she wanted to get out of here quick.  I told my caller that she needed to step outside and look north, there are some kind of lights in the sky, but it was already fading away while I was speaking to her.  What my daughter and I viewed was a multiple light formation containing six individual lights that were very bright in the center and grayish on the outside.  My daughter (age 15) said that she could see a thin gray outline like it was a craft.  I did not view that myself, but I was also looking over at her and glancing back to my other daughter while talking on the phone.  It happened very quickly.  Five of these lights were in the formation of a rooftop with one light at the peak and two lights on each side.  The sixth light was centered a short distance below the peak.  They all stayed in this formation and seemed to float moving only slightly up and down as if they were suspended in air.  We had the impression that whatever we were seeing was attempting to land in the field or empty parking lot.  We thought it was a formation of jets but they were way too close to each other.  With the windows down, there was no sound of planes either.  And there was a plane flying below them iin a slanted east to west direction which my daughter pointed out when I asked if they were planes.  No, she said, that's a plane below them, this is a UFO!  It was obvious these sets of lights were significantly different than a plane light. Then all of the lights seemed to close at once as if they each had a sliding door that closed from our right to our left.  Each light left a very small sliver of light like a piece of moon.  The formation then seemed to move slightly up and west.  It had no shape of an object, like the side of a plane would have or anything of that nature as it turned.  It was just those slivers of light that moved as one.  They didn't move out of our sight, they disappeared out of our sight.  It was as if they were the same backgound of the sky but with slivers of light.  I guess you would say whatever it was now seemed to be transparent.  My daughter was asking me if I could see the thin gray outline of it too because she could and she knew it was an UFO!  I had glanced away and found it difficult to see it again, but she watched for a second or two more but she said it was gone...and just disappeared.  VERY VERY WEIRD and VERY VERY COOL. Now, let me tell you.  There is an air show scheduled this weekend in Chicago. My family did view a jet flying over.  My husband could hear the jet when it went over. I was in the car alone earlier and saw a jet overhead too.  I recognized it as a jet because jets are obvious with there beak style nose and slim body.  I thought that maybe there was an air show somewhere this weekend and that was why a jet was in our area.  And that is also why my first thoughts at seeing this formation was that it has to be jets in formation.  However, when we were viewing this ten seconds of lights there were no sounds of planes/jets, no visuals of a plane/jet either while it was facing us or when it turned/moved or whatever it did to leave.  And I don't think jets just disappear.  This was truly the coolest thing we have ever seen and I was glad that I saw it with someone else. Excitedly I called a family member and my other daughter called a friend.  I thought about calling someone somewhere and reporting it, but who?  You don't want people to think you are some kind of kook or something.  I also hoped that maybe someone else had seen it and it would be on the news or in the paper.  I don't know if this is an official site to report UFO's or if it does any good to report it at all.  But it was definitely awesome to see something that unknown and interesting!",2006-10-30T00:00:00,41.3648,-87.4411

The object was large; it was probably almost about a half an inch long from my perspective, which would seemingly be a huge ""craft"" or object considering it appeared very high up in our atmosphere. The object radiated as a blue-white light, and although it appeared as somewhat of a haze (I couldn't make out any specific edges or details of the object), it took the shape of a cylinder, with its height being about one-third its length. When I first saw the object it was moving slowly; however, at the altitude it appeared to be flying at its rate would be quite fast. The object then sped up as it made its way across the sky, at a rate that was much faster than any airplane I've seen at a comparable altitude. After about five seconds or so, the object made one last acceleration that had to have at least tripled its speed, and disappeared as it moved upward and seemed to leave the atmosphere. The last acceleration of speed before its disappearance is what has stuck with me—it seemed straight out of a science fiction movie. Nothing that I’m aware of could move that fast. I’m a sane person, with no prior UFO sightings or unexplainable phenomena in my past. I spent most of my time in the 24 hours after the incident trying to convince myself of some rational explanation, and I’ve realized that no known human craft or atmospheric event could have accounted for what I saw. I want to know what it was, and if anyone else saw it! Some other details concerning the event: 1) It was a clear night; more stars than are generally visible in my area were visible on this night. I took this into consideration while trying to determine the object’s altitude. The fact that it was an illuminated object with no real shape other than a hazy cylinder caused me to believe that it was very high up in our atmosphere. 2) The object made no sound. 3) Regretfully, I was alone at the time. I was outside for no more than two minutes when I saw the object; my girlfriend and three of my friends were inside the house at the time. My only regret in this experience is that no one was there with me to experience and validate what I saw.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,42.48885774647887,-71.15891690140845

I opened the sliding glass door in our bedroom because of the nice breeze & temperature outside and noticed what looked like a flickering star but it was flickering purple & green & white.  So I went and got the binoculars and went out on the balcony and sat down in a chair and steadied the binoculars on the railing and saw what I would best describe as an object that was stationary but pulsating different very brightly colored lights, blue, green, purple, white & red - the object looked very much like the body part of a jelly fish without the tentacles.  I watched as it at first looked like a circle with lights all the way around, and then it seemed to tilt on its side and looked like a see-through dome on top.  I watched this for 10 minutes and had my husband look through the binoculars and verify that I wasn't making this up!  I then called a girlfriend of mine at 12:05 a.m. who lives 2 minutes away and she hopped in her car and came right over.  She also saw the same thing I was seeing, although we did notice that, although appearing to be probably 25,000 to 35,000 ft. in the sky, it looked to be above a mountain in the Sylmar area that has some kind of buildings with lights at the top of it.  But there was no beam of light coming from any of those lights on the mountain to what we were seeing in the sky.  It is now 12:55 a.m. and it is still in the same spot.  It is now almost 1:00 a.m. and it is still there!!!  I will look again tomorrow evening and see if it is up there again, then maybe I will believe it is somehow tied to the lights on the mountain.  If anyone could shed any light on what those buildings are at the top of those mountains perhaps that could narrow this down to a logical explanation.  But I have never in my life seen anything remotely like this up in the sky!!",2008-06-12T00:00:00,,

I live on the 10th floor of a 17 floor building here in Cleveland Ohio.  I have a Easterly view and a partial view of Lake Erie. The next building to mine is far enough away that I can get a pretty good view of the sky.  Today was a pretty windy and cold day here in Cleveland, so the waves off the lake are pretty rough.  Since I can hear the waves, I tend to notice the lake more and often look out my window to see how big the white caps are.  At about 10:00 tonight I did just that.  I couldn't see the waves so well, so I glanced up and saw what I thought were two airplanes. Airplanes often approach the city from the lake side, so I didn't think much of it.  The ""Planes"" had three lights each, which again didn't surprise me because I thought i was seeing the two wing tip lights and then a central light under the fuselage.  The lights were blinking rapidly and were more of a strobe fashion.  The lights on the objects were white and red, and I can't remember what order they were in.  I immedately noticed how close the sets of light were, and thought they might be helicopters, but I didn't hear any sound.  Just when I thought that, the lights, which were moving in a northwest to south east direction started to rotate around each other in a circular fashion.  The set of three lights in the lead, kind of looped back and circled around the three trailing lights.  Then the three trailing lights took a sharp turn and went north, while the first set of three lights proceeded on it's southeastern course.  Its fairly overcast here, so when the lights were obscured by clouds, I never saw them again.  At first, i was really scared, because I was still under the impression that these were airplanes.

He did say, however, that the tape showed an aircraft doing touch-and-go landings at the airport from about 9:20-10:35 p.m.  The family that reported the incident were all of Chetek. They first saw the object when they were driving northbound on Hwy. 53, taking one of the daughters to her job at Wal-Mart.  “The oldest daughter said ‘What is that?’”  “I thought it might be some new-fangled helicopter, then it turned on all those lights,” the mother said.  She said the UFO, which was larger than a semi, seemed to come directly to their pickup truck from the area of the airport. She said it hovered above the truck, only about 15-20 feet away. She said there was also a semi and another car on the road, and that the semi was swerving, possibly trying to get a look at what was going on.  “It was just the scariest thing” she said.  She said the object looked like a “sideways teardrop,” and had blue, green and white lights, and had a purple flashing light at the pointed end.  Stites said airport runway lights will cause strange sightings, particularly in cloudy or hazy weather, but the mother said the UFO was definitely not a result of airport lights.  “There were lights on it that were lit. They were on the thing. I don’t know anything that has purple lights on it,” she said. She said the object quickly darted off.  “It turned and switched directions so fast,” she said.  The daughter said she always has a cell phone, with a camera, with her, but that night she was in a hurry and left her phone at home, which she never does.  The mother said they dropped the oldest duaghter off at Wal-Mart, and that they had another encounter on the way back home. She said the object again launched from the airport and came toward their truck.  The son said for a bit it looked like the craft landed, and that it had a red laser-like light when it went near the airport.  “It just sat there in midair, about 5 feet off the ground,” he said.  The mom said it followed the truck for about 4 miles, then suddenly disappeared.  She said although brightly lit, the object made no noise at all.  “It was nothing from this planet,” she said.  “This is a real sighting. This is the real thing,” she said.  Spooner’s Highway Patrol district had no log entries about UFOs, nor were there any entries in the Polk County sheriff’s log.  But the Barron County Sheriff’s Department log had an entry at 10:19 that stated “Three officers saw it too. Cameron, Chetek and Vince Graf.” Graf is a county deputy.  A Cameron police officer was on duty Monday evening. He said he saw something in the air near the intersection of Hwy. 8 and 53. He said it wasn’t unusual.  “What I saw appeared to be a helicopter,” he said.  Medical transport helicopters are based at the Rice Lake airport, but Stites said there was no record of helicopter flights during that time period.  Chetek’s police log notes that at 10:28 p.m. all units were asked to look for a UFO between Cameron and Rice Lake. Reported was an object with four evenly spaced lights changing color from purple to orange to blue. The object was there for about 30 minutes and then disappeared.  Sheriff Tom Richie said an officer saw “some strange type of lighting, unusual lighting that he hadn’t seen before, but it certainly could have been some type of aircraft, some type of military training, who knows what it could be.” -04/16/08",2008-06-12T00:00:00,45.3905,-91.6764

(Derived from the exif data of the first picture.) Approximate location was the City of McHenry, Illinois, the intersection of Routes 31 and Bull Valley road, and traveling South from there, approximately one quarter mile.  As I was walking down my driveway to check my mailbox, I saw what seemed to be a kite or windblown scarf, brilliant orange and darker orange in color, it was slowly moving toward me traveling from North to South very slowly, its size at the time appeared to be no more than maybe four feet in any direction.  I did not observe it intensely because it had a motion as though moving up and down as if tethered by a string from the ground, the speed of the oscillations were approximately three or four cycles per second, the range of motion restrained to about twice it’s physical size.   The odd motion had me ready to grab for my pocket Sony camera that I keep with me,  but still not enough to trigger a reaction to take an image, ""no need to waste memory card space,"" I thought.  I continued on to check the mail, it had not come yet, when I looked to see where ""the Kite"" was located, all my internal alarms went off.  The object was now abreast of me, it’s path seemed to be about 200 feet West of me, but I had no reference to gauge it's actual size, and it was never directly over me, it was clear to me that something strange was happening, the “thing” was rising up while still traveling due South, now directly West of my position, and abreast of me, any sense of its size was now lost, it may have been much larger than my initial estimate. It is worth noting that the bizarre appearance and motion of the Orange object matched nothing in my mental catalog of known objects, it is almost impossible to even describe it accurately because it looked so strange, it had sharp angles and curves and as it was rising in front of me, it's motions were so fast as to cause it to be a blur as it was close to my position. The motion at this angle were now a horizontal back ! and fort h, as it was rising, same frequency of cycles per second as noted before, about three of four times per second, and still rapidly rising. I did grab my camera, got it turned on, as I lifted it up, the LCD screen was almost completely washed out by the brilliant sunlit sky, I had to approximate the correct direction, the camera is set in bracket mode, it will take a series of three frames, each with a different exposure, one overexposed, one optimized, and one underexposed, usually at least one will be usable, and you can make an HDR image by combining all three together. As I depressed the shutter button, the multi hued Orange “thing”, abruptly faded out within one second, an extremely brilliant strangely hued point source of light popped into view slightly to the south of the orange colored object at the same instant, as the first orange colored one dissolved, the bright light appeared. The distance between the two objects locations was about the size of my fist held at arm’s length. Upon examining the camera images I saw that I did capture the light points but they are quite underwhelming compared to the impact of the actual event. The Sony cameras lens was set to minimum zoom which is 38mm, the average 35mm cameras lens would be 50mm, this means my camera (a Sony DSC T9), was set to a fish eye setting as opposed to a zoomed in setting, this makes the light I saw too small and far away looking to provide images with high detail. The light had an odd purplish blue cast to it a little bit like a welders arc, but strangely different,  to my amazement, this small yet powerfully bright light began immediately moving up and away now traveling Southwest an unknown distance, in just a second, it paused in its apparent movement and ascension, but then engaged in a series of severe and rapid saw tooth type oscillations, occurring within a second, while staying within an imaginary box, the size of which I could not guess due to a lack of references pertaining to size and distance. The small bright light seemed to! have an abundance of energy to burn judging by its erratic and speedy movements. I was taking pictures all the time, the three images are taken in quick succession probably almost occurring within a second, there is a delay of several seconds as the three shots are written to the memory card and then it will take another series of three. The point source light then either dimmed or moved away at an incredibly fast rate, leaving again in a steep vertical climb, with a slight Southwest direction of travel. My initial reaction as it disappeared from sight was that the thing I had just witnessed was very unusual and most likely not caused by any natural phenomenon I am familiar with, the rapid oscillations were so fast that I saw a streaking or elongating effect that happens with fast moving very luminous objects viewed with my naked eye. I would say the after image (The streaking effect.), behind the light source was very noticeable, like rapidly waving a glowing stick of incense in the dark. My impression of what it was is mixed, the first manifestation looked like something solid, but it moved erratically, it seemed to have a physical presence. When the point source of light appeared, it is hard to imagine anything moving so erratically could be moving under intelligent control, the motions were just so extreme. Why would such radical motions be part of its operation or function, it does not make sense. I took pictures, but they are only of use to someone with some computer graphics background, I think someone with some Photoshop skills could overlay some of the pictures and show the trajectory that the object took as it moved away. There are foreground objects (Trees and power lines), in enough of the frames that they could be overlaid to show the differing locations of the light as time elapsed. The digital images do not show any streaking caused by the rapid motion, perhaps because of the bright conditions, the automatic settings most likely would have selected a very fast shutter speed on the camera, or it c! ould be that the object happened to be moving at a slower speed at the moment the frames were taken. The pictures have no value to the casual observer, as far as the wow factor goes. But the testimony I give is honest and true. As for myself, I have a limited educational background, but have always been a scientifically minded person and was an Ultra light aircraft pilot, with a good understanding of weather and other natural phenomena. I enjoy watching YouTube videos and am very skeptical of 99% of the UFO videos and images seen there and elsewhere. I enjoy reading and contributing to the Above Top secret forums, especially those topics concerning alleged UFO activities.  The Chad Drone incident was covered there extensively with hundreds of contributors joining together to analyze the data, eventually a consensus was reached that it was a hoax. In short, this object flew over the wrong person, if it was attempting to be stealthy!  I feel that I am very qualified to make an impartial, detailed report detailing the behavior and visual characteristics of this event. My Flickr account has the images here. http://flickr.com/photos/ring0/sets/72157604542071914/ there are 21 images in all. I hereby release them to the public domain, free to use for nonprofit purposes.  They are of very low usefulness for the casual viewer, no craft are seen, only a hard to see point of light in most of them, the last few images show none, but I included all the frames that I took that day. The few people I have shown them to have said that they do not show anything of an interesting nature, and I cannot blame them, but there is enough there to satisfy myself that I was not imagining the incident.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,42.34763636363637,-88.2704

I kept watching the lights and noticed that they were slowly moving away from each other.  One stayed in the original spot where I saw the lights and the other two were drifting oppositely away from the original location.  The two lights that were moving separated a lot.

The civilian airport is up on a hill which gave me reference height and we believe it flew over towards there and disappeared in front of the hill.  How we don't know.  It had landing lights on it just like the military and civilian planes all do.  No other lights were displayed.  Distance from exit 59 to the last exit is approximately 7 miles.

It seemed to be like the next airplane to come in but too far to be in the flight plan to land.  My father in-law said ""Hey, that's not a plane."" I said ""That looks like it's over the lake or maybe past the lake."" (Lake Mead)  We watched it for about a minute and then saw it start to travel straight up.

At the 45 degree angle, the light gradually faded as if it was ascending and traveling away from us. This lasted about 30 seconds before completely fading away.  Unfortunately, I did not have a camera and besides my camera would not have the resolution to pick up the light clearly.

I was lying in my bed, which was next to a window on the second story of my house. The window was facing southwest and across the street was another two-story house with trees to either side. I remember waking up in the middle of the night and seeing a bright red-orange fire ball in the sky above the house across the street. It was about the size of the full moon in the sky, but appeared to be much closer. It was bright, but it was lighting anything up on the ground, at least from where I was positioned. The fireball was shooting out small bits of fire, which would orbit the ball for a time leaving a trail behind them before plunging back into the main body of the ball. There were clearly flames on the surface of the ball, as well. It looked a lot like what you might imagine an atom with its orbiting electrons to look like. Small specks of fire swinging around the fire ball in all directions. Furthermore, to the right of the object I have just described was an array of white dots, larger than stars, but quite small. In the sky, this would be probably six times the diameter of the fireball in distance. These white dots would line up in two rows (there were probably 8 of them) and then one on the end would scoot through the sky, at first slowly and then with increasing speed, toward the fireball, then stop and turn down and head back to the main group ending up in the lower row, when it originally been in the upper. I watched for probably an hour and a half taking in the beauty of what I was seeing. I contemplated waking up my parents and nearly did so, but I was reluctant to take my eyes off the phenomenon in case I were to miss something. I never woke them up and eventually went back to sleep. The date I have proposed is approximate. I have only recently begun to share this story with people because in the past when I tried I was met only with skepticism, which is, I suppose, the right response. In any case, it seems to have stuck with me a! nd now I would like some answers. The only possibility I can think of, which does not rule one way or the other in terms of extraterrestrial activity or otherwise, is that it had something to do with the nearby Hanscom air force base. This air force base is in a pretty densely populated area, so it doesn't seem like it would be a good location for top-secret technology testing, although I have heard that some of the research on stealth fighter planes was carried out there.

The light was small, steady, a deep cardinal red, moving slowly in a horizontal fashion over the big lake.   The light quickly rose in altitude and began a ""ballet"" of arcing turns and curved trajectories, appearing to approach closer then retreat farther away.  The speed varied from almost static to a blur.  I noticed the light being reflected on the lakes surface at one point.  The only sounds were those of frogs, toads, loons and birds.  The light might have been a large object some distance away, or a smaller object relatively close to me...it was difficult to tell because it never flew below the tree line to provide a scale of size or proximity.  The show lasted about three minutes.   I related my observation to a party of other campers a few days later who were exiting from the north.

I am unsure of the exact time but it happened just a few hours before the funeral which was scheduled for 2pm so I estimate that it was around 10am but it could have been 10:30am. My mother may remember what time it happened. My husband and I had a room on third floor on the north side of the building and my mother, grandmother and a friend had a room on third floor on the south side of the building. We were over in my mother's and grandmother's room visiting when my mother said she needed to get something out of her rental car and wanted me to go out with her because she wanted to tell me something. The car she rented was parked in the parking lot on the north side of the building right near the entrance. In the late morning this side is in the shadow of the hotel. The lobby had entrances on both sides of the building. So we took the elevator down and then my mother told me what she wanted to tell me. Then she proceeded to look in the car for something. She didn’t find it in the trunk so she opened the front passenger side door and was leaning into the car looking through a bag of stuff. I stood next to the car with my back to the building looking north. As I stood there, motion to my right caught my attention and I turned to look and saw what looked like a bubble, like the bubbles kids blow from a soap solution. It was traveling from the direction of the freeway towards the back of the building. It came down the aisle the way a car would have except that it was floating about 6 ft above the ground. As it got closer I realized it wasn’t a kids bubble but then I remembered that rubbery kind that the kids blow through a tube but as it got closer yet then I knew it wasn’t that either. It just glided along and then just as it passed the back of my mother’s rental car and up to the sidewalk leading into the hotel, it suddenly turned to the left like it was go! ing towa rds the entrance to the hotel but then it turned again and headed right for me but just as it got near me it also increased in altitude a few inches. So I was just standing there trying to figure out what it was and I finally said to my mother, “Look at this” and she backed away from the car and stood up and looked and she didn’t see it approach us and so her perception was off and she thought it was larger but further away and said, “Oh, a kids balloon” and I said, “No, it’s closer” and she said, “Yeah, you’re right” and then she started talking up a storm about what it might be. We both sensed an intelligence about it and felt as though it were looking at us. As we stood there staring at it I sort of heard in my head the name of my brother. It was like the orb communicated telepathically. The hair stood up on the back of my neck at that point because it scared me but I then discounted it and thought, ‘how could this be my brother and what would would an orb have to do with my brother.’ Then I remembered something my husband had watched just a couple weeks or so before about spirit orbs near battle grounds. The orb was about the size of a softball or slightly larger and it was pearly white with a little discoloration on the bottom just to the left (from my viewing perspective). After hovering there for a while then it reversed the original flight path until it got to the back of the car and then it floated along the drivers side of the car back towards the hotel and then went up and over the top of the hotel. We lost sight of it after that and so my mother hurried up and shut the car door and we raced through the lobby of the hotel to go out the other door on the south side to see if we could see it again. We did see it again. It seemed to light up or catch the sunlight differently sometimes because sometimes we could see it very well as though it were a light and other times we couldn’t. Then finally we couldn’t see it anymore. It was heading sort of southwest towards some mountains off in the distance! while g aining quite a bit of altitude. When we couldn’t see it anymore we headed back upstairs and as we stepped off the elevator on third floor, my husband was standing there. He didn’t know what was taking me and my mother so long and was about to come down and look for us to find out. So we told him what we had seen and right away he said that it was my brother. I don’t know what I saw except that it showed intelligence and watched us and knew the name of my brother. I want to know what that was and why it happened just before my brother's funeral and how it knew we would be there and how it knew my brother's name. It is creepy when anyone knows stuff about you when they shouldn't.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

I went into my pick-up and started it to warm my cold bones. There were only two other campsites in use since it was the 'early' season. One site had a few young folks and was noisy till 11pm. When I woke the sky was cloud covered, dark, and the storms had died down but the staedy rain had not. I left my tent and went into my pick-up, started the engine to warm-up, and lit a cig. Now after my 1974 UFO incident; and all the ""Talk"" after that one this was unique. All of a sudden a stream of Universal Pictures Stars decended from the low clouds. They shot straight down out of the clouds, fromed a circle, just like in the movie intro, and then spread out. There were about 15 little stars flying down, they seemed to hit the water and spread out to the west. These small lights flew at about 200mph when they came close to the water, never touched it, and spread out on the west side of the Sawmill Lake. I have been camping here at that time 30yrs. and never saw anything like this! These little lites streamed through the trees like firflies. But at 200mph! 4 of them stopped at what I knew to be an abandoned trail, the others were still flying through the campsites. One of the lites left the area on the far but close side of the lake and flew through the woods towards me. I lost track of the rest, this one was coming right for me. It landed on my windshield! I have drawn a picture, and it is not a UFO, but a small creature. The one that left the fold of 4 flew through the woods towards me; and landed on my windshield. It almost looked like a grasshopper. It had the same oval dark eyes; suchtion-cup finger tips, and was about 5""tall. I spoke to it mentally... I Thought i Had died and they were there for me...NO! It flew away, wings and all, rejoined the other lights at the center of the lake and flew straight, with his/her friends; straight UP from where they came. This was not a UFO, but some kind of close encounter...s! o has an yone reported something like this? Aliens not in a ship? Aliens just here in some sort of glowing gold bubble? with wings, feet, hands, etc.etc. WOW Someone help me here.... my 2nd; and VERY different CE3rdK. Theses small creatures were most certianly Alien but not what you might expect. Free flying, free falling, and it seemed, free-thinking!

Knowing this distance from my position I could determaine the size and alltitude of the object. I estimate this sphere being approxamittly ten feet in diam. and two hundred feet in alt. This object flew on a flat trajectory and speed about two to three hundred miles per hour with the speed being determined by the distance traveled in the time span of the sighting.  A hissing sound was heard as it flew past. What made this object look so strange was the surface of it appeared to be made of mercury because as it passed by I could see wind resistance created by the speed of travel made it appear to wave.  Like if one was to blow air on liquid causing a rippling affect. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD)),2008-03-04T00:00:00,42.4085,-88.06340000000002

But after reviewing the MiniDV Tape, I did capture a few frames of what I saw after all! I just did not know how I could slow down the frame rate of the video for better viewing of what I was tryng to tape.

I was at the top of the Empire State Building at around 11 pm with 3 other people standing on the side that faces Central Park but looking to go back to the side where the memorial lights were shining in the place of the World Trade Center when one of the people I was with said “Oh, Look up! It’s a shooting star!”  Realizing that when someone spots a shooting star it is usually too late if you don’t happen to be looking in that direction, I was surprised when I followed where she was pointing and actually saw the “star”. It was still traveling much faster than a plane, high in the sky, coming in from my left (from N-W) in a downward arc leaving a bit of a trail.  But what happened next really freaked us out.   The object then slowed down.  It stopped for a fraction of a second (as in hovering) and changed directions going back to the left for another fraction of a second then shot off to the right, made a very brief hesitation, then continued to the right (south-east)  and was gone…no further sign of it.  In all, the Z like movement lasted about 3 seconds. I have never been a believer in UFO’s but I’ve changed my mind.  There I was with 3 other people and we all saw the same thing.  Then I checked out the internet and found that Channel 5 in Seattle had a news report on a similar sighting around sunset their time and that it was explained away by the FAA as a reflection on a plane.  No way …it wasn’t sunset for me!  Taking into consideration the 3 hour time difference, I’d say if it were the same object, it took this “shooting star” about 1 hour to cross the USA from Seattle to NYC.   I want to be in contact with more people who saw this “shooting star”.  I know I’m late in reporting this but I just finally had to say something.  It happened almost a year ago but I can’t get it out of my mind.

I was looking across the ocean, roughly facing the northwest.  This happened several months ago, so times are only approximate, but at one point between 9:00 and 10:00 PM I noticed a strange orange light in the sky.  I estimate that the object must have been somewhere to the north, based on my position.  It was apparently hovering, making slow movements at different angles.  It rose in the air and apparently moved along the coast.  I observed it for several minutes.  I am certain it was not an airplane. It did not move like an airplane or jet of any kind.  The only earthly vehicle I can think of that would have been there at that time would be a Coast Guard helicopter.  I concede that this object may indeed have been that, but the reason I have doubt is that while many Coast Guard helicopters are orange in color, this was a lighter shade of orange, and it was distinctly an orange light or glow, not a painted craft.  In any case, I was at least one-third to one-half of a mile away.  I am only going by a map of the location over which I thought the object might have hovered – due to perspective, it could have been much further away, over open water.  Given my distance, and due to the fact that this was at night in an area with very little light, I could not have discerned orange paint on a vehicle.  It was hard to tell from my distance, but I think it looked a bit like a funnel or cone pointed down.  The light was not blinking.  I did not see any searchlight either, which might be expected from a Coast Guard helicopter.  I also did not hear any sound coming from that direction, but I concede that I may have been too far away to hear a sound if there was one.  After a few minutes, the object seemed to be slowly approaching my direction, which means it was traveling south or southwest.  Not being able to identify it, I began to feel nervous and left the scene immediately.  That is all I know.  It may well have an earthly explanation, but I could not identify it, so I am calling it a UFO.

I was standing in The University of Wyoming football stadium parking lot at about 9:00PM.  As a passionate sky watcher, I was looking for Iridium satellite flares and one had been predicted to pass right over the stadium.  I was disappointed to see the parking lot lights on, as it would add to the light pollution… nevertheless, I stayed to watch it.  After the satellite flew over, a rectangular shaped object (it was more like a trapezoid with the front narrower than the rear) passed over the parking lot at an altitude of about 100 ft traveling southeast at about 60 mph.  Total distance from me to it was no more than 150 ft (practically flew right over me).  The object was completely black with no markings or lights whatsoever.  It was also completely silent.  The object was slightly larger than a car but very flat (about 2 feet tall).  The only reason I saw it was because some light from the parking lot lights was bounced skyward.  After about 4 seconds, the object was out of reach of the lights and had disappeared from view.  There would have been no way to see such a black and silent object without light pollution.  As a student of mechanical engineering and a flying enthusiast, I can say without doubt that this object was not a conventional aircraft.  I don’t know whether it was top-secret military or otherwise, but it was traveling towards the I-80 pass which leads to Cheyenne and Warren Air Force Base about 50 miles away.

My and my brothers were camping at Table Rock Lake, Branson, Missouri. We were lying on the docks, watching the stars and having a smoke *about 1 AM* (his girlfriend was back at the camp site) we started noticing some strange activity when we saw a shooting star, not unusual right? Well we didn’t think so wither except we saw over 30 in a brief time period, about an hour. We went back to our camp site after things died down. We had separate tents, he and his girlfriend were in one and I was in the other. I couldn’t sleep and was lying awake watching the shadows on the tent. There was a bright white light, moving across the top of the tent, casting heavy shadows of the tree branches like a search light. I didn’t think much of it, dismissing it as a plane or helicopter even though there was no noise. I got up to go to the bathroom *about 2, 2:30* I was walking back when I noticed a white light flying across the sky. Being an aviation nerd I noticed the object (a plane to me at the time) was flying very fast, but then I focused on it and there were no strobes, as by FAA regulated law, you must have strobes on any flying aircraft. You’ve seen then on the tips of the wings and also a red one on the belly of the craft. I thought that it was strange but again dismissed it as a possible government plane with permission. When I got back to the camp site my brother was standing out of the tent looking at the sky, he said he saw a bright light, like I had, except he saw the one I encountered and then another one a couple min. after I left. We were just messing around looking at the sky, and saw another bright white light; however it was coming from the side, and was growing brighter, as if heading straight for us. As we looked on, the light suddenly shot off the right, and up. The light was the same color and brightness as the one I saw earlier. We watched it till it disappeared behind the trees, though it was still flying as we could just make it out behind the branches. We saw more lights (howeve!  not near as bright) flying the same direction. They appeared to change altitude slightly every few seconds, though I cannot be sure. All I know is that they were NOT planes, helicopters or any sort of FAA regulated craft, they were too fast, and did not have enough lights to be planes. Unless there were 5 planes without required lights, and one plane that could change directions extremely rapidly, then there is something weird going on. The sightings lasted between about 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM, the sun came up and we were unable to see more, or they had all left. I have though about this for a while and am unable to come to any conclusions as to what they may have been. *If investigators would like to contact me, please do so via e-mail as I currently have no phone.  I will update with new phone number if possible. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2007-08-07T00:00:00,36.66493333333334,-93.25375225225224

It was strange.  I  lay  listening to George Noory talk to a lady who said she saw a rough looking man come out of Book Depository building with a serious looking long gun and head toward a silver car, he glaring at her.  I was awake enough to take this in and hear George ask her if she would talk to him after show,....and Voile!!!!!  A light lit up my bedroom.  Since we are atop a hill and far from the road, a mile or more from any house it was not a car.  I was shocked.  Got up to better see out the window, although out my second story window, I am rather with the tree tops. There are hills and hollows here.  I was on one hill looking toward another hill.  And above that hill was what at first I thought was a streaking falling star, the tail of it.  This was not the case. It was too wide.  It was angled straight up and down. And no streaks or movement at all.   It hung, a rectangle, above the far hill.  It sparkled like a rhinestone rectangle.  Just hung there sparkling with a perfect perimeter of a rectangle.  Neat as if you had drawn in with a ruler. Bright.  Sparkling. White.  Rectangle.  Fatter than the width of a falling star. It was higher than a house above the far hill.  Wanted to bring my husband from another room but afraid it would be gone.  It did not diminish in brightness, size.  It did not waver, wiggle.  After about 20 or 30 seconds it vanished.  Instantly.  Was there, one split second it was gone.  I called the Ohio State Patrol, the Lisbon Police Offrice, the Columbiana Sherriff's department.  They all had no reports. Where I saw it was just about where I see the plume of exhaust in the daytime from Shipping Port Nuclear Plant.  A few days later, in morning, maybe about 7am or so there was a strange light trail (up from the ground I thought) near that area.   Right then, there were a lot of calls in to radio station by respectable people who had seemed to see it from the sky downward, I think.

My family was on its way home from Lake City when we decided to stop at my wife’s brother’s house in Bellchester to say ""hi,"" since he didn’t show for the family Thanksgiving.   His house was dark and my wife decided to go herself to see if he was home while I waited in our minivan with our two young kids who are still in car seats.  My oldest was sleeping and we didn’t want to wake her up.   I had shut off the headlights and was trying to figure out how to dim the radio lights when out of my peripheral vision, I saw what I thought was an airplane streak from my front left to front right, almost above my vehicle.  This craft was flying very quickly at cloud level and could be seen in between two puffs of clouds on a partly cloudy night.   I had only briefly locked into the object when it entered into another big cloud and that was all I saw. This happened very quickly, a second or two. At first it didn’t register as anything unusual since my immediate focus was elsewhere.  Since my wife was talking with her brother, I was able to think about what I had seen. I’d spent my first three years in the Army at Fort Bragg, next to Pope AFB, where a lot of F-16s,  A-10s, and cargo planes such as the C-5 and then the new C-17 flew.  I had spent some time at Seymour Johnson AFB guarding cargo next to its runway and had intimate understanding how loud F-15s were.  When I was a kid growing up in Southern Wisconsin, C-130s flew over our house nap of the earth and so I knew how loud they were, what sound they made, and how much slower they were than fighter jets.  I spent a lot of time in C-130s and C-141s at Bragg as well. What I realized was that at that low of an altitude and at that speed, the only thing it could have been was a fighter jet hauling butt.  However, I know that fighter jets are not allowed to fly so low at those speeds over populated areas.  It was much too fast to be a C-130 or similar type of aircraft.   But the most distinctive fact that struck me, was that when this object flew over, it made no sound. Even in a minivan with engine running, the sound of a fighter jet going that fast that low would have been deafening.  I would have just heard it approach before seeing it, and heard it even longer after it passed over.  Instead, nothing at all.  No sound. I then realized that I might have seen a UFO.  I couldn’t have been sure in the moment, but after analyzing all the facts, it couldn’t have been any known aircraft.  It wasn’t a satellite because they don’t fly under the clouds.  I thought it might have been a meteor, but this flew at a straight horizontal path.  I’m no meteor expert, but the ones I’d seen always came at some angle to the horizon, are usually higher up in the sky, and appear whitish, not the orange light I’d seen.  If it were that close, wouldn’t I have heard something?   FYI, I spent 13 total years in the Army, about half on active and half in the Guard.  I started as ranger qualified paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne (11B) and finished as a Signal Corps officer within V Corps with one tour in Iraq.  I was with the 32nd Infantry BDE WIARNG between those two Active Duty stints.  I am currently a small business owner in a small MN town and only talk about my UFO sightings with people I trust or if someone else admits they saw one, too. I saw my first UFO sighting as a young teen and posted that experience in the WI area.  I grew up in a fundamental Christian home, so this is not something I'm suppose to believe in.  However, I can't deny and can't explain what I've seen.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,,

My sister was 10, my older cousin about 25. We were traveling by car from Barre, Vermont to a summer house on Nelson Pond in Calais, Vermont. I believe the time to have been about 8 pm, possibly a little later. It was dark outside already but there was enough light in the sky to see the silhouette of the tree line. We were driving up a small hill, with a field on either side bordered by woods. We were in a green Chevrolet Impala sedan with four doors. My older cousin was driving, I was in the right passenger seat, my younger sister sat in the middle.  As we mounted the hill, we noticed a large bright ring of yellow and red lights in the sky to the left. It was relatively nearby, about 800 to 1200 feet in altitude is my guess, and it maintained its location for about 3-4 minutes. My cousin stopped the car and we just stared at it. I began to notice that the lights I had seen were on the bottom of a larger short cylinder shaped object. The cylinder was darkish brown, a little bit like anodized aluminum. The object was probably 5-6 times larger than the ring of light in the bottom. Rods or pipes, or maybe antennae extended from the sides of the cylinder. I remember thinking that there might be a window or a rectangle of light on the side of the cylinder, but that rectangle shape was not as intense as the ring of lights on the bottom. At first I was calm, and fascinated. Then my cousin locked her door, reached past me and locked my door, and might have locked the back doors. I noticed my cousin was edgy, and had tears in her eyes. My sister began to cry.  The object began to move from left to right, which I believe was west to east. It did this quickly but also sort of jerkily, in a series of short quick moves. It maintained the same height for about I guess 3 minutes. It seemed like we were stopped for a long while. I remember the sound of the car, the headlights on the road, and the dashboard lights. The movement was from about 10:30 in the sky to about 1:00. Then it moved rapidly upward, a similar quality of motion: fast but a little jerkiness to it. The object stayed in that position another minute to two minutes and then rose upward again very fast until it was no longer visible.  Almost immediately we began moving again. My cousin only said we'll have to tell our dad, and her husband, who we were meeting at the summer house with my mom. When we got to the summer house (we say camp even if it's quite finished) my dad and her husband were very dismissive. My dad suggested we had seen lights on a radio transmission tower. I knew we had not. Her husband joked about it.  Many years later my sister and I from time to time draw what we saw. We will do it in separate rooms. And the pictures are very similar. On several occasions we have drawn the scene from a perspective outdoors, looking down on the green Impala. Once a friend who saw those pictures observed that it was curious we drew it that way given we were in the car.  As a boy I was fascinated by space, the manned space program, and the possibility of space travel. I think that is why the initial response was just fascination, not fear, until my cousin began locking the doors. Later in life I wondered if what we had seen might have been a product of our defense intelligence, or a spy vehicle from the Soviet Union.  Reports of similar experiences from mature friends, one in Wisconsin, and one in Maine makes me wonder about this. The edge of this thing were so sharp I can not imagine them to have been fog or vapor. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2007-04-27T00:00:00,,

However, we post it, nevertheless.  Date is approximate.  PD)) Bright light shining with 4 lizard-like beings approaching. Late at night in the mid-summer month of July I was awakened by a very intense bright light shining from the back side of the house that I grew up in.  I was accustumed to seeing bright head lights from the railroad trains as they approached my dads property from the town of Grand Blanc.  But, this time there was no deisel engines roaring and the light never faded as would when the trains passed by the property.   I could see this really bright light coming from the other side of the house and in order to really see it I had to go down stairs and look out the back porch door.  When I did this I was so blinded by this light that I had to cover my eyes and that is when I saw them.   A small group of four short, very stout, Dark-skinned, weird looking....almost a dark purple or navy blue color Lizard-like beings. It felt like a circus or carnival coming right at me,no! Coming for me! I freaked and went inside in a sort of strange dream-like panic and desperately needed to hide somewhere. I could not think and quickly just layed down on one of our families picnic benches that we used for feeding the large number of siblings that I grew up with. I tried to imagine that I was invisible and turned myself into a bench, for I was only 9 years old at the time. They came inside and as a group picked me up and carried me away. I was paralyzed by some kind of hand held instrument and it all just seemed like some sort of carnival-like dream. When I regained what I thought was my consciousness there I was laying on that bench still. It was just starting to turn a tad bit light outside and I went back upstairs and went back to sleep. Later that summer I started having night scares and an intense fear of sleeping in my own bedroom. I did everything I could to spend the rest of the summer at my nephews home; we were close in age and I simply had no recollection of this experience, until I was a teenager and started having this exact re-occuring dream. For the longest time that is what I considered it to be, just! a reall y strange dream. Until I saw the movie,""communion""! The creatures were just like the ones they described visually in that flick! And then many years later my sister told me she saw them carry me out the door. We both have had to deal with this peculiar sense of being abducted and violated through some vague sense that we suffered through some ordeal. I believe that they zap you with this instrument to prevent  terror shock from killing us! Realizing this has in no way made my life any easier. It has been a burden on my psyche and self will. There are/were peculiar psycological and behavioral problems that I feel have stemmed from this occurence/disturbance in my childhood. I would sleep under my bed, seizures from out of no-where. Doctors probed my brain to see if I had epilepsy. An asthmatic condition would strike if I was suddenly spooked or surprised. To this day I still struggle with what happened.

As we got within about 5 miles the object lit up a part of the hill side with a light that did not look like any light I had ever seen.  The light was not instantaneous but moved toward the ground and then would go back up again.  It was also a differant color than one might imagine from a search light.  I woke up one of my sisters and pointed the object out.  We were within a mile of the hill now and the object(possibly round?) was moving around and occasionally shining the light downward.  As we got within a half a mile it rose approx. 500ft from the 100ft it was at and then accelerated at incredible speed SSW and disappeared.

My mother, my three oldest brothers, and I walked out of our house in the evening to drive to church to attend a Coffeehouse function (that’s what they were called).  It was evening and dark but not too late – I would venture to guess it was bet. 6:30 and 7:30pm.  We saw something that astonished us in the night sky.  Looking NW we saw a huge vessel that was not very high in the sky, over the field in the back of our house.  We lived on a court and there was a 3 or 4 acre field behind our house.  The UFO was about 500 feet up, moving very slowly toward the SE, noiselessly.  I have a very good picture in my mind of it – it largely resembled the typical UFO spacecraft, just like the “Jupiter Two” from the “Lost in Space” series.  On the bottom of the craft were large, lit panels.  We all remarked upon this – how amazing it was to see.  We knew instantly that what we were seeing was otherworldly.  It was so close, so large, and moving without sound.  After it departed, at a constant but slow speed, I don’t know why we didn’t just all go back inside and call the police.  I do remember that we went inside to tell my father what we had seen (he was home babysitting my little brother), but we then just proceeded to go on to church.  We all compared notes in the car ride to church, “Yep, it looked just like the Jupiter Two” we agreed.  At church we asked folks if they had seen it – only one or two people said they had heard there was some kind of large weather balloon in the area that was being tested.  This was no weather balloon.  It was directly over the field in our backyard.  I know what I saw.  I’d love to see it again sometime.  Hopefully I’ll have the presence of mind to videotape next time!  (I do not know the exact date of this event.  I thought the year had to be ’73 or ’74.

I was actually raised in a small rural town East of Ashland. While growing up, two siblings and myself shared a bedroom. I'm not exactly sure of the year, but I know my older sister was married and my other sister was married in 1973. I finally had my own bedroom. My brother was still @ home and sleeping. Mom and Dad of course were sleeping in their room. I would have been 20 years old @ the time. A bedroom window was over my bed. To the north of the house was a Maple tree which was outside my bedroom window. Early morning. Still dark outside. Clear sky.  I was awoken by a very loud sound, that sounded like a low airplane. I wanted to see what the sound was so I got up on my knees and looked outside the window. What I saw has stayed with me for 33 years. Just above the tree-top was a disc shaped object that had colored lights at it's base. The lights seemed to have a pattern of rhythm changing in and out or maybe rotating.  It slowly moved just above the tree top heading north. I cannot remember a deafening loud noise at my window then, but a humm sound. It was summer. There was no motion of the leaves or tree limbs (like strong wind) when it passed over. I lost sight of it after it passed over the tree. I ran into the bathroom (which was the next room over)to look out that window (which faced the same direction) and it was gone. It's like it totally disappeared quickly.  What's amazing to me is nobody else in the house was awoken by the LOUD noise. It's like I was the only one meant to see it.  My brother, maybe 10 minutes later was up. I said to him, ""I just saw a UFO"". His response was naturally...yea right!  This is not a young girl's imagination. This was not a dream. I KNOW WHAT I SAW and I will never forget it!

UFO activity must be getting really busy.    Well, lets see ............. This was about 4 years ago and I was never good with dates anyway, but I will do my best.  The astronomy club met on Wednesday evenings.  So in regards to the large craft, I can say for certain it was on a Wednesday night.  It was during the summer months and there was no moon.  You don't get good star watching when there is a full moon as it gives off too much light for star viewing.  So if you go back to the summer months of 2002 and look for dates on Wednesdays when the moon was not up between about 8:30 or 9 PM, that would give you a couple of dates to go from. I don't have the tools to research that.  No one logged this that I know of but there was at least 12 or 13 people there that night.  These were all scientists.  (They usually don't believe in anything).  In fact, the president of the astronomy club, (Sirius Lookers), was only annoyed that this thing blocked out the stars and interrupted his lecture and he had to wait for it to pass.  Strange but true!  In fact, that was even stranger than the UFO.   Regarding the small triangular crafts, well, that was also in the summer months of the same year.  It was just around sundown.  These small crafts were pretty strange in the way they maneuvered around the red rocks of Sedona, AZ.  It reminded me of Luke Skywalker on the craft he drove through the woods in 'Star Wars'. The crafts were black, made no sound and I saw no lights on them, but then it wasn't quite dark yet, if that makes any difference.  I don't have any idea as to how aliens think when it comes to putting their lights on.  They drove these crafts only a few feet off the ground.  I was alone when I saw the small ones.  I did not log them.   I'm sorry I can't be more precise.  However, I did get another photograph of a UFO over Hoover Dam in 1991.  I dated that one, wrote down the time and even the type of film I used, shutter speed and the whole banana.   If you're interested in seeing it we can make arrangements for that.   Through out my life, I have seen quite a number of UFO's.  I guess they just like hanging out with me. ????   Close encounters of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or whatever.  Name your number and I can probably come up with one.  I don't mean to sound flippant but that's just the way it is.

After it had enlarged about 5-8 other spheres of light (looking similar to large stars) seemed to explode outwards from the origional light.

At the time of this observance I was working in a factory in very close proximity to Pearson International Airport (Toronto), in fact the factory was pretty well right under the flight path for landings, so I had seen a lot of planes approaching the airport.  When I noticed the light in the sky I brushed it off as being a plane landing. then I realized where I was and that There was no airport close by. My curiosity peaking, I began to pay more attention to this light.  The object that I observed looked kind of looked like a triangle with three lights. As I observed, the lights grew really bright and then started to fade. The light faded untill it was as bright, and as large as a star in the sky. At this point it began to move in SE direction and it was picking up speed. I reached for my binoculars so that I could follow it, but as soon as I grabbed the binoculars the object was gone.

I am British and live in Hong Kong. One day I received a call from my close friend in Hong Kong. He informed me that the night before he and several members  of our community were having night cruise. They saw balls of light in formation but he stammered over his description and it seemed to not make sense. It was a Hong Kong harbour cruise. My friend asked me to come the following night at around 8.00pm to talk  whilst they were unloading a chartered ship full of oranges. I arrived and spoke to my friend when he was interupted by the Polish captain of the ship and they were talking. His back was towards me when I saw up in the sky and saw balls, glowing in delta positions. Pls note my choice of words. I called to my friend and he said that was exactly what they saw and he became very flustered. 10 chinese were on the quay side and  when we asked them to look they became very cynical and made jokes and we could not assess whether they could see these things or not, in the sense that they could see but could not really make descriptions. One of them took pictures, however the night before, the pictures that were taken did not show anything.  Now, I must explain to you something. Firstly the objects were balls estimated at 8ft diameter, glowing between white and gold. My friends descriptions was ""glowing red"". The chinese could not say what they were seeing and as I said their answers were not cohesive. There would be circa 9 balls in delta formation that did not change. As wide as 500-1000ft wide. Secondly there were about 5 delta formations and they were circling the IFC 1 building in Central Hong Kong, slowly.. It is I guess a 50  or more story building and the building has a light beaming skywards.The objects circled the beam within the height of the beam. Thirdly my friend is the Governor of the School, religeous and honest. I am a Director of a Corporation in HK. My friend does not want to talk about this incident due to it effecting his credibility as a school governor. I can honestly tell you under oath that these objects were intelligently controlled. I can vouch that no reports were made in Hong Kong at all and that is understandable as far as local culture is concerned. It happened a month after we were shown the UFO flap on TV which happened in Beijing and Shanghai. the objects were not the same. Not wanting to go too deep into it but for weeks afterward strange related issues took place as far as I was concerned, however they have not been happening since. Please also note this was not lights on a wing. Each ball was its own object in fixed formation with the others.They appear to resemble the film clips on the internet ""phoenix lights, which might be balls on a wing. these were not.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,,

I couldnt move, finally he yelled at me again and I turned around and looked and yes it was there in the road behind us.We raced away 90 miles an hour.

I don't remember the exact date, but I was driving along route 65/69 on a sunny afternoon.  I checked my driver side mirror to change lanes when I saw a silver colored object in the sky.  The object was easily noticed since the sun was reflecting off of the object.   At first, I thought it was a blimp, but I found it peculiar that it did not move.  Even more surprising, the object moved away at incredibly high speed and accelerated faster than anything I have seen before.   The object was ""cigar"" shaped and looked very similar to a silver blimp.  The most unusual thing about this object is that as it flew away in the opposite direction, I noticed that the object became ""transparent"" and eventually it dissapeared completely.  I could see clouds through the object like it was a semi-transparent mirror.  The effect was similar to the stuff you see in ""Star Trek"".   I only saw it a few seconds in my driver side mirror, but it was definitely ""not of this world"".  If it is technology invented by man, then I am most impressed.

A silent anomalous array of 3 white lights some 15-20 feet across flew south along US 5 at no more than 50 feet elevation,Sacramento,CA,2007-07-28T02:30:00,unknown,30 seconds,"Occurred : 7/28/2007 02:30  (Entered as : 07/28/07 2:30) Reported: 8/25/2007 12:44:46 AM 00:44 Posted: 10/8/2007 Location: Sacramento (180 mi. S of; on Interstate 5), CA Shape: Unknown Duration:30 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58370.html,"A silent anomalous array of 3 white lights some 15-20 feet across flew south along US 5 at no more than 50 feet elevation The second sighting was full of apparent ambiguity. An hour after the first sighting I was on Highway 5 driving north at 70 miles per hour through the San Joaquin Valley. This enormous expanse of agribusiness territory has few settlements along the freeway. It is a desolate area with dry unpopulated low lying hills la short distance to the west To the east as far as the eye can see stretches desert transformed by irrigation into large industrialized farms.  Moving perpendicular to the highway I saw a faint red light crossing from right to left over the Interstate. It was perhaps half a mile away and from its speed and elevation, about fifty feet above the road, I immediately assumed that the red light was the tail light of a car on a freeway overpass. This impression was reinforced when after crossing the freeway the red light became a faint white one, as if I were now viewing a vehicle that had turned left from the overpass and was heading down towards me on an onramp in order to merge with the southbound traffic.  I immediately noticed that there was something wrong with this ""car.""  Instead of the usual headlight configuration of two, there were three discrete white lights. They initially appeared quite faint in the distance. They were moving down towards me on what I assumed was an onramp. Traveling at about 100 feet per second I was rapidly closing with the lights that were arrayed equidistant from one another in a straight line parallel to the ground. The distance between them was fixed. I quickly realized that they were attached to something much larger than an ordinary car or truck. The light array covered a distance of at least 15 to 20 feet. My mind raced for possible explanations. Perhaps the three white lights were attached to some kind of large construction or agricultural vehicle that was lumbering down the onramp to get on the freeway. Or maybe it was on a side road adjacent to the Interstate. Why such an oversized vehicle would be cruising about at nearly 3 AM when driver fatigue and poor visibility would make such driving particularly dangerous was beyond me.  As I moved steadily closer, the light array suddenly became much brighter. They did not look like headlights at all, but rather like  landing lights of a small plane. As if to confirm this notion, the three lights titled sideways, lifted off the road and then headed up into the sky at a sharp angle. This was crazy! What would a small aircraft be doing flying so close to the ground along a busy Interstate in the middle of the night? It didn’t make any sense at all.  As the object that I assumed was attached to the array headed into the sky, I suddenly could no longer see the three white lights. Instead where they had been last seen was now just a solitary motionless red light. It seemed to be hovering some 50 feet off the ground and was just sort of stuck there in the sky a few dozen yards to the west of the highway. I was able to see this strange unblinking red light for only a few seconds as I speed by headed north.  The thought occurred to me that perhaps I had just seen a crop duster. On rare occasion during the day crop dusters can be seen flying along US 5. They are quite noisy and I believe they move a speed of no less than 80 miles per hour. The object that I had just seen was totally silent. In addition I estimate its speed to have been no more than 30 miles per hour. Its slow approach was one of the reasons why I had assumed it was on some kind of highway onramp. The unknown objects sharp upward turn with its nose pointing practically straight up  is not consistent with the flight characteristics of a small plane.  The entire sighting lasted no more twenty or thirty seconds. As I drove off I carefully noted that there was no overpass above the highway. There was no ramp on which the triad of lights might have possibly descended. Whatever I had seen crossing over the freeway at the beginning of the sighting must have been airborne.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,38.57580181028241,-121.45009956553221

The sky was cloudless and unusually clear for my urban location. I had just watched several satellites pass overhead, when I noticed a light low in the southern sky. At first I thought it was another satellite however it seemed a lot brighter and faster than the ones I had just been watching. The object was going from South to North and appeared to be at great altitude. Numerous general aviation and commercial aircraft were visible at the same time. The object appeared to be self luminous instead of reflecting sunlight, as it had an unusual blue/purple tinge similar to an electric welding torch. The object passed almost directly overhead of my location, continuing North until I lost sight of it behind the roofline of my house. The light maintained a straight course the entire time I could see it, traversing the sky from where I first saw it to where I lost sight of it in approximately one minute or so. Shortly before I lost sight of the object it blinked out and lit up again in a regular pattern about three times, going dark for several seconds.

The first time we saw the light, it was a bright light moving at a high rate of speed high in the sky over Canyon Lake.  It was moving north to southwest.  There was a large grey cloud in front of it, so at first we thought it was a shooting star. After the cloud moved, we saw the light would move from North to Southwest, back to North and then it would move from North to Northeast stopping at certain points, then go back to the Southwest.  It was a cycle that never stopped. We then thought that it might have been a strobe of light from the ground like the large lights they put in a parking lot to attract attention, but we never saw any strobe of light from the ground up.  This light pattern was high up in the sky and it would change it’s interval’s of speed, but never changing the pattern that it took.

It was a clear sky; sun was coming up when I looked straight up and noticed a lot of contrails.  There were 360 degree turns, 180s, 90s just all over, but pretty much confined to being over central Florida, Orlando area. As I followed the trails I pretty much guessed it was probably fighter aircraft out of MacDill AFB, Tampa.  I thought maybe an early morning skirmish. I drove my car out of the garage and continued on to work. I stopped at a large intersection approximately 3mi. to the north of my house and happened to glance up at the contrails.  Two bright white stars were right in the middle of all the trails.  I thought those are awfully bright stars till I looked at the rest of the sky – NO STARS.  The sun was rising (0630) and washed out the rest of the stars but these two. They were absolutely still, no movement at all. Light changed and I continued on to work.  (I didn’t even notice the head-on collision that just took place before the light changed). I was stopped by another traffic light approximately 3 miles farther north.  I looked up again.  One of the lights had moved a little farther away, but remaining relatively motionless. The light changed and I kept watching as I drove. The light that had moved slightly off began to go straight up, faded and disappeared. The second light remained for approximately 5 minutes more and then did the same, began to go straight up, faded and disappeared. Within two minutes after the last one disappeared; a jet airliner went directly underneath where the two lights were.  The jet was leaving a contrail, but was only 1 to 2 miles behind and it was disappearing. The contrails these objects left lasted for the best part of an hour and a half.  These objects were at a much higher altitude than the jet liner as well.  I also found out later that morning the Mars probe was launched from Cape Canaveral around 0530.  Some guy tried to tell me it was the trail from the rocket as it went up.  I have lived in Central Florida for over 50 years and watched way too many rocket launches to know it was not the rocket trail that drifted over.  The launch pad is a good 60 miles away.

Seen by 8 people. This sighting occurred on Saturday, the evening of the 4th of August in Canaan Maine.  My friends and I have a regular camping spot that we meet at just about every weekend during the summer to camp and cook out and enjoy the spectacular view.  The spot is on a ridge, and known locally as ""The Pinnacle.""  This night, it lived up to its name. From the Pinnacle, an observer has an expansive view of a large lake valley oriented more or less due west, with the north and south views open before the tree line by about 75%.  The valley is bordered on all sides by long low ridgelines, like the one we were camping on. My friends and I were cooking dinner on an open fire when my girlfriend mentioned that she could see a light moving in the distance.  I stood up and looked where she was pointing and could see an obvious orange orb, having approximately the size color and brightness of Mars on one of its closest approaches.  The orange orb was moving parallel to our ridge, in a more or less south to north direction.  The were no features on the orb other than its clear spherical shape.  No protrusions of wings or tail, and no lights to speak of, blinking or otherwise.  It was the lack of running lights that first made me really question what we were seeing. At that point, I called it to the attention of my friends and we all started watching it.  It was obviously very far away, but for that, it was moving very fast to our perspective.  Much much faster than a plane would have.  For nearly five minutes we watched it cross about half of the full sky from our point of view, and then it suddenly flared bright arc welder white and at the same time made a 90 degree turn to the east and started coming more or less toward our position.  When that happened we all gasped as one and all conversation that been going on as to its nature ceased.  From this point until it vanished later, we were silent.  It traveled for another three or four minutes, seeming to approach almost right over us. and then just as suddenly flared again and made another turn, of over 90 degrees this time, so that it was heading about northwest.  We watched it for another couple of minutes until it vanished beyond the treeline. After that we started talking about what we had seen and tried out different explanations to try to explain it away, but nothing fit.  A satellite wouldn't have changed directions and flared the way it did.  Neither would the space station.  A meteorite would have burned up after only a few seconds, not ten minutes, and certainly not changed direction multiple times.  A helicopter would have had running lights, and considering how high up we were, would have been clearly visible as such.  Also, it would not have been self-illuminated over its whole body. One of the main things that interested me was the fact that it didn't slow in the least when it made its turns, as if inertia didn't exist.  At the speed it was going, inertia would have required it to slow down, and that's assuming a plane could even make the angle of turns this thing was making, which to my knowledge, they cant. Just as confirmation of everything we were thinking, about twenty minutes after the sighting we saw a pair of what were obviously planes flying fast and at high altitude.  Whether by coincidence or not, they were streaking in the direction of where we last saw the orb.  Chasers perhaps?  At any rate, the difference between the planes and the orb we saw were obvious, and just cemented the unusual qualities of what we had seen that night.  Some of my friends are a bit more skeptical of these sorts of things than I am, but even they were left speechless and agreeing that what we had seen was definitely beyond conventional explanation...",2007-10-08T00:00:00,44.782,-69.5421

When I served in the Peace Corps in Uzbekistan I lived in a small town by the name Shavat, in the Khorezm region, not far from the Turkmenistan border.  I was a teacher in a small school and rented a house there. One morning I woke up for school.  I can’t remember exactly which time it was , but I know it was between 6:30 and 7:10 AM there.  It was still dark.  I stepped outside to walk to the outhouse in my backyard and as I did so I happened to look up in the sky and  noticed something that seemed out of place there. It was a green ball of light, moving slowly in all directions (up and down, right and left).  It wasn’t just an insignificant spec in the sky but big and bright enough to have a true presence there.  I knew immediately that it wasn’t a shooting star, an airplane, a satellite, or a meteor because I had seen those things before and knew how they moved.  This object moved deliberately, covering wide distances in the sky in only seconds, as if somebody were moving a laser pointer dot all around on a blackboard.  Then it sped away and disappeared. That day I went to school and told colleagues about it.  These were Uzbek nationals.  One friend, a young woman my age who was my counterpart, was skeptical and treated me like I was crazy while my director told me had seen something similar years before.  I also told another friend whom I didn’t work with-- a young female teacher at a nursery school. The next morning I woke up again around the same time and just like the morning before I stepped into my backyard on my way to outhouse and saw it again.  This time for only a split second before it sped away. Later that week the nursery school teacher I had told my story to told me that she had seen the same thing while outside at her house, only late in PM hours. Months passed.  Later, in the Spring, my counterpart at school who had treated me like I was crazy when I told her my story apologized to me one day, and told me that she and her family had all witnessed the same object in the sky over the weekend, late at night.  Her sighting took place for an extended period of time and witnessed by more than at least three people  I have no opinion as to what this object was, only that it wasn’t normal and that it was definitely worth reporting.

PD)) Nine spherical UFO's in the night sky; one came close to scan me! My Sightings  I have had a number of sightings at home and on my property.  I live in a rural area where, for some reason, just about anything can happen.  The sighting I am writing to you about is a fantastic one, although there have been some other pretty incredible sightings. It started one evening on the 2nd of March, 2005. I was walking my cat down to our garage to put her in out of the cold, when all of a sudden, to the left of my view, I saw 7 spherical UFO’s flying through the sky. They zoomed into view. They were pale white, filmy sort of objects with a little dark dot in the center. As I watched I was treated to a dancing display of lights, which left me dumbfounded. During the dance, the two smaller white spheres dropped out of the two larger UFO’s, and began to zip around in the sky, darting every which way. The two smaller discs then joined back up with the larger UFO’s almost as if they were being absorbed into these larger objects. These smaller discs were white and filmy too but with no dot in the center of them. It was as if they were smaller ships, or something, that seemed to scout around even more quickly than the bigger objects. They looked like orbs of light or similar to that. The group continued on, but hovered in the middle of the sky. I was so excited! I had just made a decision about a year before to start looking up at the sky for UFO’s. I had only looked up, maybe, twice, that year, for a minute or two; it wasn’t anything serious, so when I saw these objects I knew exactly what they were. I had read about UFO’s, and how some of them looked, and behaved; there was no mistaking it, this was what I had read about. I quickly ran over to my drive at the gate to get a better look, then to my husband’s shop to get my cameras. I had two cameras - unfortunately, only one was fully loaded (as I found out later), but I managed to get a couple of shots. I told myself (inside my head) that I wanted these UFO’s to come closer, so that I could get a good photograph. No one would believe the picture that I would get, at this distance. While the second I said that, one of the UFO’s started over! It heard me! It had heard what I had said in my own mind; that means they are telepathic! As the object came closer, I panicked and started to run. I had heard and read about what could happen to you if you got too close to a UFO – you know, burns and radiation – so I didn’t need that. So, I ran. As I ran this object stopped in mid-stream and started back toward the group. …I stopped and went back to the gate with my cameras in-hand, actually one was strapped around my neck and started to snap pictures of these UFO’s, when I realized I couldn’t get the flash to work (on my digital camera). Over and over, again, I snapped the picture with no luck. I quickly went to camera B. It worked fine, it was my 35 mm camera.  I got pictures of these objects, or at least, I hoped  I had; it was dark and they were up in the sky and you know how that looks on film. So, I said it again, “Please come over so I can take your picture.” And, again just as I said that, the UFO started to travel over….I was so excited, but I started to run again to my house. I just couldn’t stop myself. The UFO kept coming and I kept running, looking up as often as I could. Just as I was approaching the house a white flash went off…with the sound of a click. I thought, “Oh, my camera is working now or they have somehow activated my camera.” I kept running. As I came to my house, I took another look…this object looked like a star traveling pretty fast; it was white with a fiery motion to it, all ablaze in white with a pale yellow front to it. The pale yellow was at the beginn! ing of t he object. Then as I looked - before I was near to the house - I saw the object stand stationary in the sky – about 15 feet from me and 30 feet in the air. It was in semi-darkness, with light and shadow playing upon it, I could barely make out the shape. It wasn’t circular anymore but looked to be sort of crescent-shaped. …I don’t know, I couldn’t really tell. Something was rotating… it kept rotating. Then all of a sudden, a slender milky white arm slinked down from it, about 15 feet down from the object. You know what I mean, like a spider drops down from its web (that sort of motion and look). And it was translucent, gossamer-like, with a curly-cue tail on the end of it. The very last look I got before I dashed into the house, was when I looked up and saw a milky white sphere on the end of the thing. As I was running, it must of appeared somehow on the bottom of the arm. It was attached to this arm. The sphere was see-through, too, similar to the arm. This UFO star-like thing seemed to be in the material world and the arm and sphere seemed to be in another dimension. This was like a science fiction movie.  I couldn’t believe it!  I felt like I was being scanned. I was being scanned by this sphere, and my only thought was ... “I feel so primitive.” I ran into the house and didn’t come back out or look out the windows the rest of the evening. I can tell you that I had had a real earth shattering experience; things will never be the same for me. I still look up at the sky, every night, wishing and hoping to see these UFO’s. A month or so later my husband and I had another visit but this time from a red/orange (circular) UFO. We actually got a photograph of it!

I told him to shut up and look, and we sat in silence, absolutely amazed. The fireball was just hovering over the ocean about a few miles from shore.  After a few seconds, little pieces of fire began to fall from the original fireball.  Then, as quickly as it appeared, it disappeared in the most peculiar way. The fireball expanded, contracted, and then just disappeared into thin air. There was no smoke, no other aircrafts in sight, there was not anything except for eerie silence.  We were so freaked out that we left the beach and went home.  We discussed the possibilities of an airplane crash, military experiments, falling stars, but nothing seemed to make sense.

We watched the news for days, waiting to hear some kind of mention of this bizarre incident.  We heard nothing.

It looked like to me, (at that time) that they had huge black sideways teardrop shoulders. I was only five at the time and my perspective was from a prone position in bed. When many years later I saw drawings of other people's descriptions of Aliens, I recognized what I saw. Anyway they said I must go with them. Everything else is a blank. When I was next conscious of being back in bed I told my mother what had happend, she told me it was only a dream. It was as real an experience as writing this letter. It was vivid, and clear. Believe me I would not tell of this experience if it were not real. For years after that, whenever any science fiction shows came on TV that had Aliens in it, I would break down and cry uncontrollably. My parents and their friends thought I was emotionally sensitive, or a big baby. (Take your pick.) I have suffered depression, and alcoholism since, and have always felt different.

I arrived home from work early this morning, and as is my habit looked up at the sky after exiting my vehicle. I love to look at the night sky, and this morning the sky was unusually clear and crisp.  The *dark* side of the moon reflecting the ""bounce light"" of the earth was plainly evident - an astronomical phenomenon that until recent years was fairly rare, even here in the relatively unsullied skies of North Dakota - but now for some reason it is a very common sight. (Something very odd going on in that department!)  Anyway, almost as soon as I looked up and almost directly overhead, I saw what I at first thought was a very bright planet - until, that is, I realized it was moving quite slowly on a roughly north to south trajectory. And very quickly after that realization the object swiftly flared brighter and brighter until I became rather alarmed - I would estimate its lumens quadrupled - and then suddenly its intensity dropped off as though somebody had thrown a switch, but it was actually still faintly visible via peripheral vision.  In other words to still see it after it flared out, I had to look slightly to the side of its trajectory.  I'm thinking it was a satellite of some sort reflecting the predawn sun as it rolled in orbit - it seemed to be at satellite height - but at the same time it seemed to move too slowly to fall into that category.  The brightness of the object when it flared was astonishing.  This is the second time I've seen this object (or something similar) flaring overhead. About two weeks ago, I witnessed pretty much the same event, only I believe it was a couple hours earlier in the am, and both times the event occured almost as soon as I'd looked up into the sky!

I've never before seen or experienced anything that I felt was convincingly supernatural, extraterrestrial, etc.  I am open-minded but skeptical; I am willing to accept the possibility of just about anything being true, but I need to see some hard, scientific evidence.  I majored in biology in college, I work in a medical laboratory, and I am certainly not a flighty person.  Two days ago I would have laughed at the thought of posting a UFO report on the web, and yet here I am.  This all took place last night, Saturday, 8/19/06, at about 9:30 pm in Tacoma, WA.  It had been sunny and clear all day, and the night sky was clear too.  It was warm in the house, so I went out onto my deck in the backyard for some cool air. I reclined in the lounge chair on my deck, facing southeast.  I looked up at the stars, as I like to do, and noted that I could see more stars than usual.  Suddenly, I noticed out of the corner of my eye some movement in the sky directly above my head.  I focused my eyes on the object(s) and at first interpreted what I saw to be a shooting star (by the way, my vision is 20/20).  But then I noticed that there were 3 of them, traveling together (2 were close together, side by side, and the third was slightly ahead (i.e., south) and east of them).  I thought, ""Wow, 3 shooting stars?""  They were at this point so far away that they appeared exactly as tiny stars lightyears away, and they were moving as fast as shooting stars.  Not slowly like satellites - they were moving at great speed.  I watched these ""shooting stars"" for a second or two, waiting for them to burn out.  But they didn't.  They did not burn out.  In fact, they grew larger in appearance as they traveled and presumably grew closer to the Earth.  What started out looking like tiny white stars shooting across the heavens quickly increased in size until they were maybe 100 times larger than they first appeared.  As they loomed larger their appearance also was transformed, from tiny white specks to, eventually, much larger ""ovals"" that were light orange in color.  What's interesting is that as they enlarged they became more out of focus.  It was difficult to distinguish the exact shape or form of these objects, because they appeared as light only (not terribly bright, and not glowing or radiant light -- it was more self-contained), and were so out of focus.  Not blurry or hazy or furry, but out of focus, as though they were traveling so fast that their light was reaching my eyes at a slower rate than at which they were moving.  That's the only way I can describe it.  I know that nothing travels faster than light, but I imagine that, if something were able to move faster than light, this might be what it would look like.  My brain struggled to assign a shape to their form:  ""oval"" is what came to mind but this is not entirely accurate.  They were somewhere in between oval, disc-shaped, and boomerang-shaped.  There was no flashing light, no trail behind them, no beams, and absolutely no sound.  I watched these 3 objects travel across the sky heading south, weaving back and forth slightly (side to side) as they moved.  Then they seemed to swoop down and then continue on in a southwest direction.  Even though they wove from side to side slightly, they maintained their basic formation (basically lined up along an east-west axis, but with 2 close together and one slightly ahead).  At one point, as they flew off into the southwest direction, the 2 that had been closer together moved apart and then returned back together.  They moved extremely quickly and effortlessly across the sky, with great ease and fluidity; they appeared to be extremely agile, smooth, powerful, and with a definite sense of direction or destination (they were not traveling along a rigid trajectory, or meandering or switching directions or moving randomly).  Their flight path was fluid; they appeared to swoop down across the sky, from outer space towards our atmosphere, and then they continued on heading south west.  I watched them until my view was obscured by the roofline of my house.  I jumped up and ran to the edge of my deck to see if I could catch another glimpse of them, but they were gone.  All of this took place in the span of about 5 to 7 seconds.  As I watched this all unfold, I felt scared, sick to my stomach, awe-struck.  I was overcome with an awareness that I was witnessing something not of this world.  I've been racking my brains for some earthly explanation for these objects, that can travel and change altitudes and weave back and forth at tremendous speed, with such agility, all in complete silence.  I've never seen a quality of light like that emitted from those objects as they drew closer.  My heart was pounding.  I called people excitedly on my phone, to tell them what I had seen.  I sat out on my deck for some time afterward, searching the sky.  I was scared but felt almost ecstatic to have witnessed something so incredible.  I imagine that others must have seen it too, and I hope that they'll report it.  And if there is some reasonable, earthly explanation for what I saw, I'd like to know what it is.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,47.21257223776224,-122.4597204895105

On 04/15/2008 I was leaving work at approximately 11:15 P.M. from a restaurant I work at in Chandler Arizona.  As I was waiting outside for my wife to pick me up I noticed a spherical orange glowing ball in the south sky at roughly a 40-degree angle from my position. The sphere appeared to be at an altitude of about 5,000 feet. The object was hovering and appeared to be wavy like the surface was hot. The look was similar to magma and distorted like the surface of hot asphalt.  The object did not have what looked like conventional lights on it, but rather the whole object seemed to give off an orange fluorescence. After the object hovered for about 4-5 seconds approximately 2 miles to the south, it bolted off directly north, passing overhead and stopping about a half mile north of my location.  Again the sphere halted to an immediate stop and hovered.  When directly overhead the object appeared to be about the size of a house (1,500 square feet) the object at this point was at about a 120-degree angle.  The object traveled that distance in about 2 seconds.  The object then sped off at a 90-degree angle and immediately stopped again.  The object would not slow down and come to a stop, but rather come to an instant stop.  While accelerating the object would maintain a constant velocity and achieve its maximum speed at the instant of its movement from a stop.  After hovering in its location, the object bolted off to the N-NW in an upward 45-degree angle, disappearing from sight in less than a second. The object while in motion about 5,000 feet high was traveling a speed of approximately 4,000 to 5,000 MPH.  When the object sped off into the sky the final time, its speed was at least 4 times faster then its previous speeds.

It looked like it had light bars on each of the sides and each of the three corners had very bright lights on it. It seemed to pulsate a bit and was completely silent. I stared at it for 15-20 seconds.  When I finally realized what I was seeing, I ran back inside to grab my phone to take a picture because my camera was on the second floor. I was gone for approximately 20 seconds, when I came back I noticed it was gone. I scanned the sky for it I looked farther into the distance and could see it had moved very far away and much higher. I tried to take a picture buy my phone camera could not pick the object up. I tried to move into the moonlight but it still did not help. The pictures on my phone just seem to be black skies.

I had stepped out to get some fresh air by the ""smoke pit"" and looked towards the airfield (Approximately 1 mile) to see an amber sphere stationary between the airfield and myself.  As I work on aircraft it caught my attention. I initially thought it was the moon but with a haze. However, the moon hadn't been rising till much later and was not in that area of the sky. I then considered a blimp, but it made little sense due to the proximity to the airfield and the types of aircraft that fly over that portion of the base. I had about a minute to speculate when it appeared to fold in on itself (like 3 evenly spaced dark petals. It was night after all) and silently disapeared. At no point did I hear any sound. Unfortunately, I didn't have another witness with me. It was a hand span above the horizon. It was as large as a full moon when on the horizon (when its size appears largest). The object was bright (but not glaring) and featureless.  If it hadn't been for the way it disappeared I'd have passed it off for my being unobservant of my surroundings. The following morning I looked to that region to see if I had missed some sot of tower or structure in that area but there was nothing to break the horizon. As for the way it folded; the ""petals"" were evenly spaced at 10,2, and 6 o'clock. Also note the petals were unseen until it actually occured. It seemed very odd for me to see it as a perfect sphere and the fold to be so even for it to be a local military related event that I just happened to witness. These observations made me want to share this.  Also, (since I marked aircraft were nearby) there are/ were aircraft taking off or landing on a 24 hour basis. I did not observe anything making inspection passes. This would prove difficult considering its proximity to the field and the period of time that I saw it. (pilots don't sit in the plane waiting for UFO intercepts, and the passing of a launch alerts takes 5 -10 min)  I am late reporting this as I hadn't heard (or thought to try due to obvious distractions) of this site until a few days ago.

I was preparing my home and property for the storm. As I walked around my pool, I noticed off to the west what I thought was just a bright star and only looked at it for a second as I was quite busy. A few minutes later I thought to look at it again just because it was so bright. This time it appeared much closer so I watched it for a moment. It was a clear evening with just a few puffy white clouds moving to the west and I knew this was an object other than a star because it was moving to the east, towards my location. I called into the house for my wife and friend to step outside and watch the light. It got to within I would say a mile off where I was and it height was below the level of the clouds as I noticed one pass behind what ever it was I was looking at. It slowed to a stop and began to hover and then it went dark. We could tell there was something there but even with binoculars we could not make out the shape of the object. There was no sound that we could connect with the object but it was right in the middle of a large residential/commercial area and within a mile of the executive airport. What really got us a little freaked out about it was when the object began to expell some sort of mist or fumes that took the form of wings or some type of venting and both of the flumes, for lack of a better word, were huge. I estimate they were more than 100 yards one off to each side of the object. After 15 minutes or so, the craft moved off to the north and appeared to be going higher. As it disappeared out of site a cone shaped, I want to say vortex, appeared way up in the sky about where we last saw the craft. THe point of the cone was pointing towards space but angled off to the north a bit. I have no clue what this could have been but it was truly a life changing experience for me as it has truly opened my mind far beyond what I would have previosly considered within the realm of possibilities.

We saw it in the darkness of the town. It was saucer shape with the center of it like a dome on top of the aircraft. The disk area did not appear to be very thick yet much, much bigger than the dome area. It was big, about 2/3  the length of a 747 but round. It was pretty low, about the height of a five story building. I would not necessarily use the word 'metallic' to describe the material of its exterior, neither was it plastic: it was something else, like maybe a combination of materials. It did not make any noise nor was it showing any lights. Neither was it blowing any air out very strongly as it was near some very tall trees and the branches were not moving.  It seemed powerful, it hovered there with precision. We could all see it from the balcony; we were a block away from it. Then, as if they/it realized that we could see it, the grayish black color of its exterior which made it visible in the darkness in a matter of seconds began to turn black and well it was as if it was emitting black light around itself to camouflage itself at the same time it started to move up slowly. Then it completely disappeared. We went outside where it had been and we tried to see if we could still see it in spite of its camouflage by perhaps seeing that it was covering a part of the sky. But, no, it had completely disappeared from sight. That was some impressive technology.  Why Moca? There is absolutely nothing of interest happening there. Perhaps worth mentioning, however, is that the previous year for the first time in the history of the region an international airport was inaugurated at the town's border with Santiago. The craft sited however does not appear to need an airport to take off and land. It could just go up and down. The other possible thing that could be of interest is that a 6.7 earthquake had just occurred - a couple of weeks prior to the sighting.  I saw what I saw. I did see an unidentified flying object.  I hope this information helps someone, someday. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2007-02-01T00:00:00,,

I happened to look up and see a bright orange light in the sky moving north parallel to the coastline and bay. At first I thought it was a plane with its landing lights on except the color was a bright orange and the light was moving slowly. Eureka is often covered by a cloud deck as it was that day and I estimate it to have been about 800- 1000 (Thousand) feet above the ground. There were also patchier clouds approximately 400-600 feet above the ground though far fewer. The light was below the 800-1000 foot cloud deck, but above the 400-600 foot cloud deck. As the light moved behind the lower clouds it would become obscured momentarily. I spent probably at least five minutes just watching it from the street. By now my curiosity was raised so I went to the back yard to get a better look. It continued this path for another couple minutes. It then made a logical arcing turn westward where it began to increase velocity away from my position. The intensity of the light dissipated and it eventually disappeared.  The most similar thing you could compare it to is a helicopter with a spotlight, however their was no noise, and I tried very hard to hear anything. The light remained constant and could be compared to a flare, but it did not descend in elevation. It could have been a mylar balloon caught in different air currents, except it was emanating light (And was under the cloud deck) and was accelerating slowly. All that was visible was a orange light.  I have not seen anything like it before or after. And its been a couple years since this sighting but I remember it well and it was witnessed by one other person that I know of, and others must have seen it as well.

One Orb exhibiting extraordinarily odd behaviour.

I went to the window as I always do late at night and looked out.  I was stunned to suddenly see  7 - 9 Pale (Dull) White Glowing Orbs gliding along in the sky soundlessly. They all had the same colour. They were there long enough for me to ascertain that they were NOT birds. Or Aircraft.  The first 4 orbs held a solid formation, as did the last 3 or 4 Orbs.  The most fascinating (yet profoundly disturbing) thing about the whole ""flight"" of Orbs was that there was another Orb not behaving like the others. This particular object took to flying not a straight line like the other orbs, but was cutting in and out of the formation continuously, repeatedly, quickly, with the  precise rhythym of a metronome - while flying in the general same direction.  It seemed to jump from one width of the formation to the other, as if it's job was checking each side of the formation as they flew along. It maintained a particular ""perpendicular track"" in the formation - and did not deviate from this.  These were NOT BIRDS. They were NOT insects. They did not oscillate or flap like bird do. They flew from the east to the west, towards where the sun had set some hours before.  They flew from the east to the west, towards where the sun had set scant hours before. They were quite high, but BELOW THE CLOUD COVER. Speed as fast as a civil helicopter. They flew out of my range of vision quickly (blocked by the building), and the very sight of them, particularly the one orb ""bending the laws of physics"" truly scared the living daylights out of me.  These were not the result of projector lights. I am very conversant with these. I am an accomplished aircraft spotter - able to ID an aircraft by shape and some by engine sound!

It just appeared above us and was hoverring.  As my boyfriend kept driving he turned to me and said, ""Tell me what that is!!??""  I could not speak so he repeated ""Tell me what that is!!??

According to both of us it was extremely similar to the ""bigger spaceships"" in the movie ""INDEPENDENCE DAY"".  There were many lights on its bottom surface and had many exterior fixtures on it...it wasn't a smooth looking craft, it was very detailed and intricate in its design.  The vision of this craft is so embedded in each of our minds due to the fact that it was so close to us in broad daylight that if we were sketch artists we'd be able to draw exactly what we saw.   As we continued around the tree lined bend it vanished without a sound, without a trace.  It was as if this UFO's cloaking device or camoflauge system was temporarily disabled allowing us to see it ever so clearly. There is no doubt in either of our minds of what we saw.  There is no mistaking what it was.  It was no small light moving above us in a dark sky. This part of our experience is very clear to us and totally the same.

Many people around us were looking at the sky pointing at it, as well.  The object was as bright yellow as the moon (the moon was also visible).  It looked like a giant glowing doughnut in the sky. It stayed in one place completely motionless for a few minutes, then it suddenly disappeared and then we noticed it in a totally different parts of the sky (we thought it was the same object, but who knows), then it disappeared again and then we noticed it in another part of the sky, then it disappeared completely.  We (and all the people around us) were stunned.  We've never seen anything like that before.  Would love to find out some day what in the world that was. Strangely enough, and to my great surprise, my son mentioned the following day that his classmate said that her relatives in Mexico called that same night to tell them that they saw the glowing disc-like object behaving ""strangely"" in the sky (the same night we saw it).

This was May of 2003. My passenger, who has some knowledge of aviation matters, told me to look up at some strange lights to my left. (south/east over the Navajo Reservation)   I looked up and saw three bright lights smoothly moving across the landscape over a mountain range.  I stopped the car immediately on the side of the road and got out.  It was a very clear cold night and myself and my friend looked closer at these lights.  The other friend was trying to find a camera inside the car and missed most of it. The lights where flashing like a camera flash bulb going off, almost a blueish tinge to it, but the light was not regimental like a regular plane tail light and where much brighter.  They where moving very quickly and silently and it perfect formation, one slightly ahead of the other two.  Judging from other planes in the sky that night (I had time to compare) these lights where moving extremely fast but there was no sound.  Then they stopped in mid air and then the 'last two' changed from this flash to a beautiful round orange glow.  This slowly died away in brilliance and the sky returned to it's inky blackness.  There was never any sound at any time.   The other light kept on going, and then a few moments later a number of these orange circles appeared where the path of the flashing ceased to be.  They appeared one after the other and like the others, faded as the next one appeared a little further along the sky.  I counted 7 in all.  Then all was quite and silent.  We drove back to Flagstaff in silence. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2008-03-04T00:00:00,,

Me and two of my friends were on our way to my sisters house in my car on route seven going past Lums pond state park going north words Wilmington.  As we were passing the main entrance five lights in a row came up from behind my car. We had the sunroof open. It came directly above my car (about thirty feet) it looked like a string of five lights in a perfect row. When I saw it I thought it was a helicopter I had heard no noise but that may have been because we had the music going. It seemed to follow us directly above us for about thirty seconds. My friends said it could have been a r\c airplane because there is a r\c flying field near us. I thought it was way too big it was about thirty feet long. I remember thinking that it was one object but after the first thirty seconds the lights began to move in a almost slithering motion like a sidewinder .Then it had moved (still slithering) to the left of my car. And kept going left of my car slowly until it had gone out of view into the park the whole time keeping the same speed we were going. The five lights were white and almost reminded me of the lights on a helicopter. I apologize for my lack of writing skills. I just wanted to add my sighting to the sight.

It left such and impression on me, that I feel the need to get the sighting to as many folks as possible who are interested and believe there are UFOs here.  I was just watching a show on the PHOENIX SIGHTINGS, and thought I SHOULD report my sighting here (as suggested on the show and that some folks do wait months to send in sightings).  On a warm evening about 3-4 years ago, I had just put the kids to bed, and had gone to let the dog out in the yard. The sky was partly cloudy, but not completely overcast. One could see the shapes of clouds against the suburban lit night and in some directions, stars were showing through.  I looked above our house, and I could not believe my eyes, yet, it was all there as plain as day, as if it were milk, in the glass cases at the local mart. I had always expected that if I was going to see strange lights in the sky, it would be out in the wilderness, as we spend lots of time in the Adirondacks, and, I had formerly lived in the Catskills (and we have seen our share of shooting stars, etc.)  however, seeing this set of lights in suburban North Jersey, was just amazing, and clearly, very different from anything that I had ever seen before.  The formations were of 4 SETS of four lights stretching from the east (Parsipanny area) to the west (Mendham/Randolph/Shongum Mt. area). They could have been covering 7-10 miles in total. They were about plane’s altitude above the house. One set was right above my neighborhood (The Fairchild neighborhood), one set was further east perhaps Cedar Knolls/Parsipanny),  two other sets were further west, towards Randolph/Washington Valley area.  Within in each IDENTICAL set of lights were four smaller, white,  round, globes which moved in a rapid clover leaf like/”infinity” pattern - never touching each other, and always staying in the same circumference. There was not a sound coming from these formations.  All four sets had these four lights moving in the same “infinity” pattern, but not in complete timed unison with each other.  I ran in the house to get my husband and the phone. I got a flashlight to “try and signal back”.  We did not have a digital camera, or a video camera at the time, nor a phone camera, or, I would have grabbed one of those items.  My son who was about 3-3 1/2 at the time was peering at them from his window.  My neighbor, a fireman,  came out via my husband’s beckoning, and they were standing on his stoop in awe.   We live near to Newark and Morris County airports, but these were most definitely not planes, as we are in the flight patterns of many large and small planes, and helicopters we are frequented by the sights and sounds of planes constantly. These sets of lights did not move. These were also not the “attention floods” used for celebrations or grand openings of businesses. There WAS NO BEAM of light coming up from the ground, nor coming down, or forward as search lights in helicopters, or a plane’s path lights.  Each set stayed in the same spot for about 20-40 minutes.  I can not remember exactly, however it was long enough for me to call the police, call my Mom, and call one of my good friends.  When I called the police, they did say that other people had reported seeing the strange lights in the sky. I had inquired about any noted celebrations where folks might have had “attention floods” beaming up, but none could be noted. I have also seen the “flash lights” that the local Morris County Airport shooting up on cloudy nights near Rt. 24, but these would never have been visible in my neighborhood, and not in four distinct sets over such a large area of geography.  I went out to walk around the neighborhood to see if I could get a better view, but at this point, the clouds were clearing, and then lights were gone but, I did not get to see how they dispersed.

It was a little brighter than the surrounding stars, and was moving at about the same speed as a satellite at first. We then noticed another, and another. Total there were at least three and possibly as many as six. For about 15-30 minutes we watched as these lights came together in a group, lined up beside each other, branched from one another and then came together again. (I’ve forgotten the exact sequence in which this happened.) At one point three of the lights aligned in triangle formation, and moved around as a group. They took turns branching off from the triangle and then coming back. They all moved in straight lines, there didn’t seem to be much, if any, curve to their movement. When the disappeared, it was fast, and almost like they were being sucked back into the black of the sky. It reminded us of “warp speed” from Star Trek. The three of us all saw the same thing, and being the open minded people we are, didn’t take long to come to the conclusion that whatever we saw were some sort of space crafts, possessing technology way beyond human capability.

I did and it was a report of an event that was going on right then. I am not sure but I think the aircraft was a C-141 or some kind of military cargo plane. It was off the cost of Florida and reported that they had seen a craft come up out of the water and fly off. In a few minutes they were tracking it and it was flying at (I think they said 60,000 ft). and was traveling at a speed of around 4,000 MPH. It was heading northwest. We scrambled F-16’s. At the speed it was flying they scrambled planes from Chicago to be in front of it. Somewhere need the South Bend, IN area it just went off the radar. That was the end of that and I didn’t think anything more about it that day. But the next day we had some people come into out area and cleaned the information about what had happened of all the computers that had been used in our area.

As we walked, we were amazed at how clear the sky was. The stars were brilliant on this cold crisp night.  My son and I always hunt with quality binoculars. My son was using Leica’s and I had a pair of Swarovski’s. We used them walking back to gaze at the stars. In this remote large field, it was dark. Light was absent from any streetlights, homes, or traffic.  As we were getting closer the vehicle, I noticed what at first appeared to be a comet arching towards us from the horizon. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed, but had no trail behind it. We watched this brilliant shape travel from the horizon to directly over us. The speed that it traversed the sky was “comet-like”. The speed that it stopped directly over us was immediate. It stopped on a dime.  All of us took turns with the binoculars looking at this stationary glimmering energy shape. It glimmered evenly and remained perfectly still in the exact position where it stopped. We watched it for about a minute, trying to understand what we were seeing.  As we watched with binoculars, the object accelerated from zero to comet like speed at 90 degrees from the original flight direction. It was so fast; I had to lower the binoculars to keep up with the object with my eyes as it traversed the horizon and disappeared.  Two teenage boys and I witnessed something.

Then, they stopped moving altogether, with two of the ""lights"" spiraling out and then rejoining the formation. Then all 4 objects sped out in opposite directions, disappearing almost immediately.

It was a Friday night in February 2007 when I received a call from my father about something very bizarre going on above their garden.  He had walked up to the fenced garden area to check on a recently acquired mare, which had attained a bad leg injury and was rumored to be pregnant.  He was very frightened to see translucent orbs approximately four feet in diameter circling 10-30 feet above the mare.  He described the appearance as :lighted fog.""  According to him there were a large number of these orbs ""dancing around,"" which gave him the appearance of intelligence rather than simply moving in a random fashion.  After he started his truck one of the orbs moved onto the hood area, which immediately cut the lights off, as well as the engine.  At this point the traveled a hundred yards or so on foot to their dwelling. My mother stepped out on their front porch and was so frightened by what she saw through the bare trees that she refused to go any closer.    At this point I received the call from my father.  I called a neighbor to witness the scene to ensure nothing was medically wrong with them.  He brought a camcorder and attempted to record the orbs, which had risen to a couple hundred feet at this time.  He tried to use his cell phone and the battery suddenly went dead and every time he would raise the camcorder to record the orbs then they would all clump together and shoot off at lightening speed out of sight.  Within a short period of time they would return, expand and do the same thing as before.  The movement reported was remarkable and comparable to a kaleidoscope. There were several other witnesses who observed this phenomenon from 3-20 miles away.  However these witnesses observed the lights at high altitude and my father was the only one that I am aware of who noticed the occurrence at such a close distance.  He is an extremely reliable source although I will not disclose further information so he can remain anonymous.  They observed the phenomenon from approximately 8:30 to 10:30 pm on a Friday evening.  Weather conditions were cold and clear. Nothing like this has been observed since. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I have seen weather balloons, space shots and most everything else that you see in the air but these two objects remain a mystery to me. 	The objects were cigar shaped, pure white and made no sound, size is relative to how far away they were.  If the objects were about the size of a general aviation aircraft then they were approximately 1 mile from me and at an altitude of 1000 to 1500 feet and moving at a speed of about 150 mph..  Both objects were moving south at the same speed and direction with one behind, slightly further away and slightly higher than the other, what I would describe as a Navy formation rather lose.  The color of both was the same, pure white with no markings or variation in color that would be caused by shadows.  There were no wings to be seen and no protrusions above or below them.  The shape was the same for the top as the bottom and the edges were well defined.  I observed them for about 30 seconds until they went behind a near by tree.  Once I walked past the tree they were no longer to be seen.  The three things that I can’t explain are the lack of any sound, the lack of protrusions above or below and the uniformity of the color.

I must have driven another 20 minutes  asking myself what on earth this object could be and re-affering with my family I was actually seeing what I was seeing. They  where  just  as in wonder as I was. When we got to the same place that the bright circular object was we could see it to the left of our truck. It wasn’t one but 2 disks hovering in the sky about ¼ mile from our truck. They were slanted at a 45 degree angle facing eachother. Then out of knowhere a third one appeared. At this moment one of the 2 had moved in a blink of the eye to the lower position while the third object was considerably further away compared to the other two. We couldent believe what we were seeing . After 2 minutes they just dissapeared. I should of stopped my truck and took pictures but I was pulling a trailer and didn’t want to stop on the highway with my kids in the truck. I went through every single option of what it could have been in my mind. I tried to make sense of it with logical reasoning but all I can say is what we saw was definatly not of this world. I spent 5 years in the Marines as a harrier mechanic and have seen every kind of military aircraft you can see come through our base. The base I worked at is the largest air base on the east coast. You name it I have seen it.  Up close and personal. I kno! w how th ey look when they fly . I worked on the only hovering aircraft in the world. I can say with 100% confidence this was not a military or commercial aircraft(s). I hadnt said too much about this but I feel  maybe this can help if even a little.,2007-08-07T00:00:00,35.503425,-108.8373625

This happened about the same time of year on 2 consecutive years, one night each year. I was maybe 15 and 16 years old. A different friend saw it each year as well.  Myself and a friend were hired to guard/watch the art festival tents for approx. 1 week, nights. We laid on the ground as this was the best position to look for possible intruders feet. Though there was some ambiant light, in the shadow of the tents we could still see the black night sky and stars well.  An object that looked exactly the same, same size and glow of an Earth based satellite came into view at a slow rate of speed. There was no sound. It stopped, sped up, zig zagg'd, loop de loop'd, went strait, at varying  rates of speed, stopped short. Sometimes it covered from one side of the whole sky and beyond to the other in a split second. Most of the time it moved at an unearthly speed, I'm guessingat least 20 times what a modern fighter jet would do.  When it left for good, it accelerated in a strait line with building speed, compounding, at a rate that is indescribable and definitely not of our capibilities, strait out into space(as opposed to over the trees) It got noticeably smaller and was gone in parts of a second.  I can't remember for sure if it left a trail or not as I have seen many Meteorites leave glowing Green etc. trails. My feeling is it did leave a trail but just on its final exit...it was long ago.

It was mid September early in the evening, just before the streetlights came on. 2 of my brothers, 2 friends and myself were hanging around out side in front of my parent's home. I noticed a distinct flickering light coming just east of our subdivision, in the sky. I lived right near the Detroit city airport and was used to seeing all kinds of different aircraft. Yet here was this strange flickering light coming out of the eastern sky, catching my attention!  Intrigued, the 5 of us decided to watch the path of this strange moving “craft” as it continued across the sky due west. I say “craft” now because at this point, about 5 minutes after we first noticed it one could plainly see what I can only describe as a flying saucer! There it was plane as day just moving across the sky for all to see, a classic type flying saucer. On the out side diameter were these different colored lights, red, yellow and blue. Just moving around clockwise.  Now here's where it gets really interesting, in our subdivision there was a side street that ran north and south, this is where we stood most of the time watching. The“craft” slowed to a full stop and hovered just above a cemetery that was 3 streets north of ours. It hovered  lower until it was about 60 feet above the ground. If you hold a silver dollar at arms length and held it up at about a 30 degree angle that's  the size it looked in the air. So it was abuot 40 feet in diameter.  The 5 of us thought it was just too cool! I was shaking like a leaf. We watched this thing as it hovered there,just “showing off” I thought, for about 4 minutes when suddenly it decides to hover on an angle exposing the bottom side of the “craft”.  It was the weirdest thing, the bottom was just solid black void! If the flickering lights were shut off and the “craft”  hovered above you ,you wouldn't even know it was there unless it made some kind of noise. I didn't here any distinct sound coming from it from where we stood watching. The “show-off” decided it was time to move on so the “craft” straightened  horizontally (like most flying saucers I guess). It began moving straight up in the air until it was about as high as a small Sezna plane would fly. It continued it's westerly path rather slowly, again like a small plane, then suddenly the “craft” just shot it's self like at warp speed westward and was gone out of sight. “Wow!!” I said to myself, “I always wanted to see a UFO!”  A few moments later there were 3 police choppers hovering above the cemetery were the “craft” was. I never herd or read anything about the incident from the news, “Hush-Hush” I guess. If anyone else has seen this sighting, I shure would like to know!

I recently started looking through NUFORC.com in hopes of finding a similar sighting, which my father and I saw together. I was startled to find that someone had posted a sighting of the very object we saw and even stranger that the UFO was in the same town, on the same date, at the same time, and moving in the same direction - West to East.  We were just oustide my new home in Arlington, TX, when the object caught our attention. We both looked up and saw a rather large black trianglular object moving very slowy and seemingly very low, directly above us. The object was pitch black, against the night sky, with several large circular, but very dim, lights underneath. No other deatails could be made out and it seemed to glide accross the sky, in complete silence, and then it just dissappeared, soon after it passed overhead. The whole incident lasting only a minute.  The report I found of this sighting in NUFORC.com was seen from a different angle than myself, and the other viewer was able to see some more detail than I remember, however, I was able to see the lights underneath in more detail than what the other report describes. There were at least 5 perfectly round lights that were evenly dim, I was able to see them, but they did not give off any rays of light.  There is no stranger feeling in this world than experiencing a UFO, especially when it comes so close. It is gratifying to know someone else saw the same object.

The popular TV show MASH was on in our living room which faced Colorado Blvd, the street where we lived. My mother and two brothers were in the living room watching MASH, and I was in the family room watching another TV show. I could see and hear through our kitchen into our living room, where the rest of my family was watching television. I began to hear some excitement coming from the living room and went in to see what was going on. My whole family was staring out the window when suddenly my brother (17) darted to his room to get a camera and out the front door he went. I took his place at the window and was amazed at what I saw. Above the houses across the street and hovering, was a cigar-shaped disc, about 100-200 feet long, bright, with what I can remember as alternating white and red lights. Things began to happen very fast and the excitement was none like I’ve experienced before. We all were outside within seconds of me entering the living room to see what was going on. Once outside, my brother (17) easily scaled onto our roof via our front porch. My other brother (12) ran out into the front yard. I can remember my mother being very concerned, she kept me by her side as we continued to watch from our front porch. My brother’s camera was a cheap Kodak with a flash, but in the dark, he was unlucky at getting any kind of exposure. Anyway, we watched the craft through the tall trees, hover back and forth, over the houses, for about two minutes. The trees were not in bloom as of yet (my estimated date of 4/1 very easily could have been late February or March) and I could see the object through the trees. Another aspect that I am certain of is that I could see through the craft, I mean, it was a clear starry night, facing Mt. Rose and Slide Mountain, part of the Sierra Nevada Mountains which are easily visible on a clear ! day. At night, however, all one could see were the stars, and I can remember seeing the stars through the outline of the craft, which was bright orange-yellow. The lights I mentioned earlier went from one end to the other, through the center of the cigar shape. The strangest thing about our sighting is that is seemed very dark and quiet on our street for that time of night. Not one of our neighbors, who we all knew very well, were outside at that time, and not a single vehicle drove by. The episode, as I said, lasted about two minutes. The last thing I remember is that it all of the sudden disappeared, either from speeding away, or vanishing into thin air, I can’t say which. I am confident the year was 1975 for a number of reasons which I won’t get into here for this could get very long. I will say that this sighting has never left my consciousness. I rarely tell anyone and very rarely discuss it with my family. I can also say that the experience immediately (within one year) turned me and my mother into UFO buffs, of a sort. I can remember reading my first UFO book (Project Blue Book) I checked out at my school library (Vaughn Middle School). Ever since we’ve shared information and still do to this day, but we rarely venture into a conversation about that night. The experience has changed my life, and at the ripe age of almost forty-three, my interest has peaked so much that I have finally taken the time to write it down. That night we called the radio station and they thought we were joking. I told my friends at school and they didn’t believe my either. I do remember my mother telling us one of here friends from the hospital where she worked, spotted the craft. This person, according to my mom lived across Plumb Lane, so it made sense that she could have seen the same thing we did.

This was broad daylight. Soon, a crowd formed and the police were called. They responded and just stood and watched  like everyone else. The ship would hover, fly quickly  towards us and then  turn and fly off in another direction just to stop and hover once more in a different position than when it started. At one point, an officer grew alarmed and ducked down behind his squad car door with his weapon drawn because the craft had turned in our direction and came closer than before. I had lived at the opposite end of the complex from where the crowd was gathered and walked back to our apartment to get a drink of water.  As I was returning , the ship flew over the area where I was walking and I got a close look at it.  It stunned me when it came down lower because it was so big that it looked as though it might crash into the nearest building.  It hovered a minute and then went back to the general area that we saw it in originally. After about 40 minutes or so it turned and flew off as quickly as it appeared. We were told by the local police that it was a new advertising machine for the bank.  Can you imagine that?  It flew, there were no wings and it had no words on it.  That was a totally impossible scenario. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2007-04-27T00:00:00,41.1916,-87.8555

(A normal air-craft would have taken more than 3 minutes to cover that distance). There was no sound or noise of any sort associated with this flying thing and neither had it any regular shape.  Just a random cloud shape. It could have easily passed for a cloud but for it unusual dark orange color and its super-high speed.  In my opinion, there was a solid object really flying but with the cover of a randomly shaped orange cloud around it that not only masked it’s appearance but also perhaps suppressed any associated mechanical sound.

I want to emphasize that I did not witness a UFO during the time period described. Back in 1978, when I was in high school, I vividly recall a major UFO Flap that occurred in February and March of that year. My friends and I were very excited by it because almost every day there were reports on the local news and radio about another UFO sighting. Some of them were quite spectacular.  However, this major UFO flap seems to have been forgotten in the UFO literature, so I did some research at a local university library of The Detroit News from that time period.  I was disappointed that only one article was written during that time. The article has been sent electronically via email. It discusses some of the UFO sightings, but not all of them.  The one I remember most distinctly occurred during afternoon rush hour.  The local television news reported that many witnesses reported a low flying UFO buzzed down the I-96 expressway in Brighton, over hundreds of cars. Apparently, many people got out of their cars to get a better look.  This occurred a week or two before the report about the UFO following the park rangers, which is in the article.  I asked a coworker if they remembered the flap.  He said that he did. Surprisingly, he went on to explain that his father was a narcotics detective for the Detroit Police Force and that one of his father’s friends flew the police helicopter. During the time period in question, the Detroit Police helicopter pilot stated that a UFO followed his helicopter. He tried to lose it but could not. I wonder how many other incidents like this may have occurred that were never reported.  I will continue to inquire regarding this interesting time period.  Perhaps other readers of your website remember this flap also and can add further details or historic sources. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This echo was showing up at 900 feet altitude which is the exact height that the surface search radar ends & the air search radar begins. As the echo faded from the surface search radar it began appearing brilliantly on the air-search radar, then vise versa. Around 10 minutes later, upon exiting the radar room to go outside for a possible visual, it was immediately noticed that it had become quite foggy outside! Visibility was less than 50 feet! Yet, the last weather observation was low humidity, 74 degrees and calm wind!  It was at that point that previous books read pertaining to U.F.O.'s, sightings, abductions, etc. became the thinking while going to the port-side of the ship.( In one abduction case written about, the author had written about how aliens went about preparing the abductees for viewing what was to be a sort of weather show that the aliens were about to conduct). Upon arriving to the port side of the ship & looking upward about 45 degrees towards the baring the echo showed on the radars, it was witnessed that within the fog was a diamond shaped object that was showing various colors like that of a gem was seen. There was no sound whatsoever coming from the object, nor was it moving. Once atop the bridge (called flying bridge), a 'bolted-to-the-deck' double lens telescope was swung towards the objects direction. Once focused onto the object, one could see what was the outline of what appeared to be the window area of a saucer or ship. The various lights emitted from this craft seemed to come from all areas except for the windows area. The windows area appeared as a dark tinted set of windows, and that there seemed to be motions coing from inside the glass though one couldn't get a very clear view through the tinted glass along with the fog that was drifting past the windows in waves. The windows area appeared to be angling downward towards the ship, the bottom pointed end of the craft appeared to be slanted back while the pointed top appeared to be pointing forward as was the tinted windows just below the top point of this craft. It was decided to go back to the radar room to attempt to get further data established without alerting any officer or crewmate. Once back inside the radarroom, the echo was still appearing on either the surface search or the air search radars. It was then that it was decided that this craft is aware of the radars antenna's 'beamwidths'!  The width between the two antennas is mere feet but enough that if a craft has the ability to trace the ships electrical output from those antennas that craft could in fact hide between the two radar antennas without being detected. The good thing was that this craft was not completely successful in hiding itself completely either with the heavy fog nor between the beam-widths of the two antennas. As minutes passed, it was noticed that this echo began to move!  This echo was plotted during 3 complete sweeps from the air-search radar (set at 350 miles). After the 3rd sweep  the echo disappeared completely off the radar screen! The results of the 3 plotted marks were; 1. Altitude 1000 feet, speed 400 knots, 2. altitude over 15,000 feet, speed est. near 800 knots, 3. Altitude surpassing 50,000 feet, speed est. over 5000 knots!   It was then decided to go back outside for any further visual possible. Once outside, there was no fog whatsoever present, the sky was completely clear with the sun shining which was the precise weather just before the contact had first appeared on either radar screen!   As for the name of the military vessle, any other witnesses, etc., it has been kept annonymous. Though noone on board the ship was alerted to this sighting, others did notice and it was talked about by fellow radar operators, crewmates, etc. for days to come afterwards. The above information is of fact to the best of ones knowledge, and is in no way a hoax or the like. Also, this report is not the 1st sighting ever seen by oneself. Another sighting can be traced back to either 1966 or 1967 during the summer which was located 60 miles north of Albany NY & was printed in a small column in the local newspaper there (Post Star). Footnote; there are other details of the ocean sighting that were omitted due to protecting witnesses as well as oneself. As for the possibility of being sworn to secrecy, one could say that it was a good possibilty. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

A group of us from the same Department were on a recreational basketball team that played in the evenings.  As we stood in the parking lot on a very cold night, talking, all 9 of us saw:  Approaching from the South, an area of sky that was dark, meaning the stars were covered by an object.  It was low in the sky, moving very slowly.  As it came closer we could all see it was a huge triangular shaped object, wider than it was long, similar to a B-2 bomber, but much larger.  I estimate it was at least 100 yards from ""wing"" tip to ""wing"" tip, and about 25 yards long.  There was no light of any type, just the obvious blotting out of the night sky, which was full of stars in our small town.  As it came directly overhead, and slightly East of our location, the most blatant thing that stood out was the lack of any sound from the object.  I estimate its altitude at 500-1000 ft.  Even as it slowly passed, and continued north, there was no sound at all, and no lights.  While we had barely said a word while it was in sight, we all started talking about it, comparing details.  We all agreed that, due to the very slow speed, and lack of sound at its low height, that it was not an aircraft.   (Our small town was on Victor 32, an airliner ""freeway"" from California to Seattle, and we had all seen and heard a lot of aircraft before.)  As we were all cops, we more or less agreed to not talk about, for fear of being ridiculed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Being an avid offshore fisherman I have seen many large fireballs when out in the gulf at night.  The things that struck me as odd besides seeing this in relative daylight, was the trajectory of the object and the fact that there was no contrail remnant.  Instead of an arching trajectory from horizon to horizon, this object was coming down at a very high 'angle of attack' and did not fade as it approached my observable horizon which was approx. 1/2 mile away.

Principally, that on the night of November 8, 2003 at about 8:40 pm- as we finished observing the lunar eclipse that had been transpiring- we were walking from the front lawn toward the front door of our house.  At that moment, my husband took one last look up at the moon and suddenly blurted out ""what's that?!""  We all gazed up to see what appeared like three distant, yet large, luminescent objects flying across the night sky.  Each was somewhat arrowhead shaped, and all three were together in a chevron formation... one at the head and one on each side.  These were not geese.  These objects were large and ethereal in nature- almost as if translucent. We're certain that they were not commercial jets- nor did these objects follow a flight pattern that we've ever witnessed in these parts.  Moreover, they were totally silent which really amazed us. My husband ran quickly to the front gate of our property as he tried to follow their flight path which seemed to be heading west by northwest towards Manhattan.  However, a large tree on our lawn was obscuring his sight; nevetheless, within moments he reached a clearing... yet, they had already completely vanished.  My daughter and I could not tell, either, how they had disappered so quickly... all within, I believe, 10 second or less.

I believe my comments, along with some of the others, were: ""What's that?"" ""..that triangular shaped thing? ""Do you see that?"" We were all mystified.  This V-shaped object was extremely high up in altitude, higher than any plane I've ever seen flying, and moved just under the moon, towards it, then disappeared. It had about 8 round Shapes (probably lights, though it was too high up for me to see the illumination of these lights).  There were about four round shapes on each limb of the 'V' shape, and the whole shape seemed somewhat translucent.  Many planes had passed through the crisp crystal-clear sky as I was viewing the moon for a duration of about 15 minutes. All of the other planes had very bright lights, took routine pathways and were easily identified as planes. This V-shaped, triangular object was quite different from the planes. It had more lights on it than a plane and the lights appeared transparent or translucent. And, it was so high up that it appeared as if it was the same distance as the moon!  Then, it disappeared  as it seemed to fly towards the moon. This triangular, V-shaped object was something else!

I went out onto her back patio to smoke a cigarette, and as I was lighting it, I looked up to my left to see a jetliner cruise by and its contrail forming. Only, at the end of the contrail, and seemingly following the jetliner, was a bright green, glowing sphere of light. As soon as I noticed it though and called for my griend to qiickly grab her camera, it seemed to take notice in me. It bounced arounded and darted from point to point in the sky, almost as if it were putting on a show for me, just to make a point of saying ""Hi you can see me, I also see you."" It kept this up until my friend returned with her camera, at which point this object shot right to my zenith. She quickly snapped a picture, and with that the object simply zipped off out of view. Although we knew whatever came out on that film would be low and questionable quality, nontheless we were still excited to see what we did have on it.

The first involved 2 silver craft that were so high up one had to strain their eyes to see them but when the two other s present did track them we witnessed incredible aerial manouveres that involved acceleration and coordination beyond known aircraft capabilities. I rang the news stations with precise coordinates but it was a joke to them. This spurred me to buy a cam corder and we [my partner and approximately 15-20 neighbours] witnessed a display by approximately 6 orange balls of light. They created formations and this was taped [poorly] I freaked and am embarrased by my prattling as i ran out of film...my focusing was poor and the footage does not do the experience justice. Third time was a ball of light witnessed by my partner and myself in the early morning hours [daylight] on a weird drissly morning...it weaved in and out of the rain cloud and rapidly ascended into the cloud cover. The fourth was by myself when i was in the backyard of relatives house in london[holidays with fam] sucking back a ciggarette and firewirks were going off all around from fourth of july... it was awesome and i was taking it all in and watching the endless circles the planes were making overhead... some cloud but was irregular and not raining...sky still visible and dark... i think 9 pm. I saw something  orange and lots of them... it was approximately 30 balls of light in a v formation flying perfectely without changing position and banking away from me. It all happened so quickly as they passed into the cloud cover. Im tired of telling people about my experiences and being labelled as a freak. I dont care if anybody believes this...i have really researched all this and i think half of it is military and the rest is a mix of really bad and just downright quantamly confusing...with emphasis on quantum. coming from south australia my only outlet is colin norris whom i visited and have talked to when it all becomes overwhelming and i think...why am i seeing this although i choose to and that ithink is part of the answer. here it is in a nut shell... are we going to visit another planet in the flesh soon???... i dont think so. WHY?..because we are just not mature enough, not while all this crap is happening in the world and you all know what im talking about.... Take a good look at roswell and colonel corso....heavy quantum stuff to challenge your perceptions, throw in the philadelphia experiment and a couple of nukes and whalla youve got altered time lines with dimensional disturbances....lets put the spotlight on earth scenario in a negative light we arent going anywhere.

I had sunglasses on; these screened out UV and so I could see quite well. Clouds were at high altitude (cirrus), mostly blue sky and the clouds were scattered. I had been thinking that it would be a good time to spot and observe a UFO, which I am interested in generally. Previously at the dock, I had seen some somewhat unusual things including one craft which looked like a more angular Space Shuttle with no contrail at high altitude going southwest to northeast (that was in a previous month perhaps about May 2007, and it occurred just after the Space Shuttle was launched that day, so I assumed I may have seen the Space Shuttle although it seemed impossible to me at the time). Anyway on this day I was relaxed after swimming and saw a tubular shaped object. This looked like a translucent plastic tube, slightly tapered at both ends. It was proceeding from north to south at high altitude but below the cirrus clouds. I could see that because of its altitude, and because I could see it clearly, it must have been quite large, I would estimate about 30 feet wide or less. It looked like the general shape of straight across airplane wings, but was translucent looking similar to what a bubble or translucent plastic balloon, no color, and could see blue sky through it. Also, there was no fuselage or anything attached. The object moved much like airplane wings, not along its long axis but along the short axis for its direction of travel. It appeared quite stable in its motion and direction. I observed it for a minute or more; and although it did not seem to go behind any clouds, the object disappeared from view while it should have stayed in view. It did not look like any sort of ""floater"" or eye defect like that; it looked like a real object similar to a very high altitude balloon, and it did seem to slightly block out the upper cloud layer above it as it flew between me and the high cloud layer. It was defin! itely be low the cloud layer. Toward the end of the time when I was carefully watching this object, it seemed to waver slightly as if it was slightly shifted by wind, but this variation was very slight, and may have been a result of my own motion or even my imagination comparing the object's motion to the nearby cloud layer. This is really only the second time I felt I saw something unusual. In the early 1960s I saw a green fireball at night, silent, with green particles flying off it, but I had assumed at that time it was some sort of near Earth meteor and nothing very unusual-- (although that was the most phenomenal sighting of anything in my life-- with one friend (we were camping out, and my friend also saw that object). But that was huge; this translucent balloon looking thing was relatively tiny compared to that. There was no sound associated with the elongated balloon thing. One thing I would like to mention about it was that it did not seem random in its motion; rather, it stayed transverse to its flight path at all times as if it was controlled; a balloon would have moved end over end somewhat; this did not do that at all. As I said also it had no fuselage whatsoever, and seemed to have nothing at all other than the elongated translucent plastic looking material, slightly tapered at the ends but not pointed. I was wide awake at the time of the sighting, having just swum in very cold water, and I looked away several times and back at the object to test that it was really there.

It was the prospect of seeing Perseids meteors that had us sitting outside in the tourist camp near the Flaming Cliffs in the central Gobi. The character of the pulsing light seemed to be more of something tumbling out of balance, but there was no apparent movement of the object and somewhat reminiscent of a light house. The event lasted long enough that after my initial sighting was I first drew the attention of our driver who was sitting next to me to it. I was then able to call to my nephew who was inside a ger (yert) laying down to get up and come out and spot the light overhead for a short period before the light faded. I’m capable of believing this to be a satellite of some sort given the angle the suns rays would have been traveling at the time of the event, but it was just a very unusual sighting I thought worth the mention and still leaves me wondering what it was we saw. The Perseids meteorite shower was outstanding being seen from such a place with virtually no light pollution, and a relatively high elevation. Quite a few shooting stars to make a person say, “ähhhhhhhhhhh”",2007-10-08T00:00:00,,

Something I am having a hard time explaining flew right over my head what seemed like no more than 500 feet up at Washington Elementary School at about 1:45am... as big as a large house with 2 car garage attached and kinda shaped like that..  At about 1am I went up to the darkened school yard alone to see if maybe I could catch a few early annual Perseid meteors shooting across from the North sky. I was disappointed to notice the installation of new security lights in my favorite urban astronomy field, which actually do nothing but cause light pollution and burn energy... so I decided to lay in the middle of some playground equipment where the shadows would cover me and give me a much darker if slightly more limited view of the sky. I was laying with my head to the west and feet to the east so the meteors would appear to my left and fly to the right. It was a slow show, but a pretty clear night. I could barely make out the faint glow of the Milky Way. I saw about 5 bright Perseids over the course of approximately 45 minutes, when something enormous and low appeared directly in front and above me to the East-southeast.  When I say enormous I mean it seemed like a large house with 2 car attached garage was flying over my head. As soon as my eyes flicked to it, It was directly over me. Although it was dark with no Moon, the craft was darker, like it absorbed light. Its hard to explain the shape. Like 5 or 6 or 7 black square boxes connected oddly, sort of like a 3 box rectangle with 2 other box protrusions on either side 1 front and 1 back, with a large orange circle in the center of each square 2/3rds the square size. The orange glow did not seem to be lights, but more like very hot orange glowing metal. There were no running lights what so ever. I got the impression it was much larger than I could actually see, and was not supposed to be able to see it, but the orange heat glow lit up just a small portion of the bottom of the craft which is all I really saw.  Although the square and circles were symmetrical, the boxes seemed to be put together in an odd shape. I came home and drew it and painted it but I cant get it to look exactly like what I saw but you can at least get an idea. This craft did not seem aerodynamic in any way, yet it was flying super fast, Lear jet fast, although flying is the wrong word. More like it moved like a waterbug across the surface of water, or dragonfly like... kinda skiddering diagonally sideways..  It passed directly over me and shot off West Northwest. As it passed I flipped over on my stomach and elbows to get a better view and t disappeared over some trees that fast. The whole event lasted less than 30 seconds. Not a single sound came from it. The crickets kept on chirping. There was no wind. It was very calm. An odd thing seemed that maybe it was moving slowly or standing still until my eyes flicked to it, and it shot off straight over me. I do not know if it was watching me or was it just moving over when it saw me an decided to take off? I was kinda hidden by some steel playground equipment..  I have seen strange things in the sky before, but nothing even remotely close to this. I know what satellites look like. I know what the ISS space station looks like. I know what comets and asteroids and meteors look like. I own a 6"" Newtonian reflector telescope. I have been to military air shows before. I know what planes and helicopters and blimps are capable of. Although I have never seen swamp gas ignite I am pretty sure this was not that either!  I saw what I saw. As to who was driving that remains to be seen!  I have another sighting posted on here where I saw 3 black V triangles in the same schoolyard, which happened 11 years ago. I would like to add that looking back I think the sightings are connected, and from pictures I have seen I think they are the same type of craft that was over Phoenix Arizona in 1996 the same year, but in my case they were much much higher and therefore smaller. And there were 3 of them.  Just my speculation but it seems to me as if these lights/boxes can move together like an F-16 wings retract and expand for higher speeds, but not for the same reasons. They move from V to more wide mouthed U and boomerang shapes, and now I think they can form any shape, maybe even come apart and move freely and then rejoin at different angles.

So, I pointed in the direction straight above us and we watched as the satellite moved from north to south and was soon out of sight. He was impressed that he had finally seen a satellite.  I told him there are a lot of them in this area and that another one should be visible within a few minutes.  Sure enough, there came another satellite heading from north to south.  It was not as bright as the first satellite, but we had no trouble seeing it. I handed my automatic adjusting binoculars to my brother in law, while I observed with my regular eyesight.  As we watched it approach slightly south of overhead, it stopped!  Both of us lost track of it within the background of stars.  However, we stayed focused on the general area.  Within about a minute, it moved again, very slowly. We watched as it gained speed to about the normal speed of a satellite.  Then, it stopped abruptly and went into a zigzag direction, east and west.  It repeated this several times, and then went into an expanding circular pattern and repeated that several times. It returned to the zigzag pattern several more times before it resumed a straight line southern direction, picked up speed to something extremely fast, (much faster than the speed of a normal satellite), and disappeared out of view to the south.

It was nearly in the middle of the road, facing the road, almost as if left on display.  We stopped, and I approached the carcass with the intention of doing an amateur forensics discussion for the benefit of my friend, essentially to show that the power of deduction and observation could be handily used to determine the likely cause and time of death. As I rattled off my observations to him like some amateur Quincy Jones, I realized with horror that this was NOT a poached animal, nor the victim of any predator I had ever seen or heard of.  Close examination of the manner in which the vertebrae were severed indicated that neither metal laceration nor laser could explain the nature of the cuts. I had only seen these types of seperations of tissue with one device- and a very expensive one- a sonic scalpel. We then discovered the second deer carcass, at the edge of the forest line, and then the third, further into the forest, each two meters from the last, all in a strait line pointing to the middle of the south end of the Carter Moutain ridge.  All were turned inside out, all had their upper abdomenal organs removed, all the rib cages were so denuded of cartilage and flesh it appeared that they had been vacuumed clean, and the tiny spot of blood the size of a quarter or a dime underneath the carcass left on the road indicated a state of congealment indicative of the kill being no more than a half hour previous to discovery.   Nevertheless, the stiffness of the first deer half propped upright on the road was almost as if it's flesh had been highly stiffened by some kind of freeze-dried process, though, of course, there was no freezer burns. I cut the flesh with a pocket knife to ascertain if blood would emerge and investigate the stiffness of the flesh itself. There was no blood, the flesh cut easily. In the weeks that followed, I began to lose an enormous amount of weight and began to suffer from a rapid deterioration of *every* system of my body. I barely survived, but by the next February, my weight and health returned. This was a highly lethal, highly advanced technology used to mutilate those deer in Charlottesville Virginia.  This needs to be examined and reviewed. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I used to go to school at the alternative school in Moscow, though i live in another town. At the time the school got out at around 5-6:00 pm. I don't know the name of the road we were on, but it was down the road only a little ways from the alternitive school, and we were going to head west. We were sitting in traffic for a long time. It was sort of a windy cloudy day which is rather typical in Moscow. My friend was driving the car and i was in the passengers seat.  We sat there for quite some time and i began looking up into the white sky and suddenly i saw something that was pretty strange. I didn't say anything for a moment and i did not take my eyes off of what is saw that day.  In the sky was a dark colored triangular aircraft of some kind. It was perfectly triangular and was obviously not something natural. I wouldn't say it was black; more of a metallic dark grey. I was comepletely amazed at what i saw, and for the most part i wanted to be practical and believe it had an obvious explaination. It seemed to have been standing in place but suddenly it started moving. It was moving steadily fast. I moved fast enough that it was leaving sight rather quickly, but it wasn't leaving at lightning speed. It was a super cloudy day that day, and it was probably strange that we even saw it at all considering how overcast it was. I watched it go into the clouds and i kept looking out for it, but i simply didn't see it at all.  My friend then spoke up and told me that she had just seen something really weird. She hadn't known that i had seen it too. And my i told her that i had seen it and we talked about it for the ride home. I kept looking for it all the way home, but i didn't see anything strange. I decided to believe it was nothing, and when i told adults, they sort of looked at me as though i didn't know what i was talking about, since i was only sixteen at the time. I gave up trying to get anyone to believe me and soon i quit thinking about it, though i never forgot it.  A couple nights ago something sparked my memory and so i decided to look it up on the internet and i did some research. I didn't even know that triangular shaped UFO's are reported but i found out that they are. And i looked at the description and sure enough, the descriptions had an uncanny resemblance to what i saw. So, i looked into it further. I typed in something about triangular ufo's seen in Moscow Idaho. I didn't think i would get anything. I found a reporting on this website that took place on the same date someone else had reported a sighting. I also noticed that that it is not particularily common for Moscow to have reported UFO sightings on this website. But mainly, i was take away that it was on the same day. So my friend and i were not the only ones to see it, and not only that, but they saw a triangle as well. It is all rather eerie and too ironic to be an accident.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,46.71884324324324,-116.9267972972973

As I looked straight up, I noticed what appeared to me to be a flight of military fighter jets flying in a triangular formation very high up.  As I noticed this, I told my girlfriend who had spotted the same thing.   Upon further observation, I thought the objects looked more like stars, as they were small and appeared to be white lights.  My girlfriend maintains that it was a single, solid object with lights on the leading edges.  Regardless of their shape they continued to fly straight at a constant speed in a westerly direction.  Soon the formation (or possibly one single craft) broke apart.  The objects on either side took off at extraordinary speed to the north and south respectively until they were completely invisible.  Soon the leading object did the same, flying straight ahead to the west.  These objects were moving extremely fast, and apparently at an extremely high altitude.  They literally took less than a second to disappear completely from sight.  Pleas note that the date and time of this sighting is NOT exact.

My friend and I were on our way back from the Cross-gates Mall.  As I came over the highway we were at the highest point of the road and started going downhill, the sky was completely visible.  We both noticed at the same moment a bright orb moving slowly across the sky.  He said it was probably a plane, but I was sure it was a UFO.  We both watched for a couple seconds as it moved across the sky.  Then out of nowhere the light shot downward, and then to the right, and streaked across the sky then disappeared. It appeared to make a right angle turn at very rapid speeds it was gone in a split second, and the streak lasted only about a second or two.  We were both stunned!  We knew that it had to be a UFO because no aircraft that the U.S.A. is capable to go that fast, let alone make a right angle turn in a split second.  There’s no doubt in my mind that what we saw that night was in fact a UFO and the answer to the question are we alone in this world is no.  Pretty soon everyone is going to know about it because it’s only a matter of time until we find out if their hostile or if their friendly.  What do you think their doing up there?  Studying us?

We went down and around 9 pm, approximately 8 glowing orange orbs passed overhead in a loose v formation.  They were soft orange in color, appeared spherical, and made no sound.  Their diameters were somewhat smaller than the full moon.  As they passed over us, the formation shifted slightly and one of them stopped overhead and hovered while the others went on.  We pointed a flashlight up toward it and flashed it on and off a few times.  It dimmed and brightened somewhat in what appeared to be a response. At this point we all freaked and got into the house.

It was a Wednesday night approximately 22:15 and I was working as a waiter at the Quonsett Poin Naval Air Station Officers Club.  We had just closed an outdoor steak cookout and were cleaning up.  The area was about 1/3rd the size of a football field with high strong ""ball field"" type lights on poles and other lighting on the building facing the yard.  The yard was bordered on two sides by high underbrush like reeds or canes and the area behind that was marshy the building on the third side and the pool on the last. Additionally the wooded area bordered the actual airfield, hangers and buildings.  I was returning to the area from inside to bring more things into the kitchen. The doorway was on a slight rise (one level) above the picnic area so visibity was not blocked.  I saw this ""being"" walking away from the eating area at a moderate speed (no rush), pause a little before entering the reeds look ove the shoulder at the area and in my direction the immediately enter the reeds.  I do not know if I was seen as I was standing still and above the level plain with lights at my back.  I had been away from the picnic area 5 or 10 minutes before going back outside. I had made several trips in and out.  As someone else had been working with me off and on I looked to see if they had come out and seen the same thing.  I was alone.  The ""being"" was about 5 to 5 1/2 ft tall thin, but not skinny and did not have an oversized head. Because of the lighting and location I did not notice any coloring. Everything was pale grey or dull silver. It appeared to have a one pc suit of clothing with no cuffs, pockets or closures. No helmet or head covering. The face was very human and I did not notice any head hair.  It was not carring anything or holding anything. It showed no surprise when it looked in my direction.  Just one look back over the shoulder, and he went into the brush.  I did not mention this to anyone at the time as I didn't want anyone to think I was looney.  I checked local newspapers and other media over the next few days to see if anyone else reported anything or there were any reports.  I had recently been sworn into the Air Force as a Second LT. and was waiting assignment (in November 1971).  I did not want to jeprodise my future as a pilot with some big investigation.  Some years later I found out the area behind the marsh also contained ammo bunkers and the Nuclear weapon bunker.  I have never seen any reports of something happening at this time in this area and have told very few about it.  The whole thing is still very vivid in my mind.

About 200 miles from Las Vegas I guess,  We seen a Very Large Craft Hover up from Behind a small mountain range to the east of us, the best I can describe it was that it was like 2 tops off a football stadium flipped to make a ship, big, silver metallic with a lot of tarnish or a rust discoloration, a weathered look to it. with structure protruding from it on the side facing us, very much like the UFO's seen in ID4 only silver with tarnish all over it. It came straight up above the Mountains then back down a little back up then all the way down disappearing behind the mountains, I suppose it was somewhere around Area 51, yet I don’t know if it existed then, It looked very heavy no exhaust seem to be coming from it, I cant remember if it had any lights, but I want to elaborate it was real big, actually bigger then the top of a foot ball stadium big. I’m sure even with the best of our technology at that time we had nothing of that scale, and why would we? I am sure it was not a balloon or anything like that. I wanted to share this with you for I have been seeking a similar story to no avail. And was hoping someone might have a story that mimics mine. Well Good hunting, also was wondering why there never seems to be any real good UFO pictures? What gives, someone with modern Cameras needs to be out there photographing them.

This light was not accompanied by any sound and seemed within decent range of where we were camped. The light was very bright and then quickly formed into four (4) distinct circular shaped lights: two on one side and two on the other. The new lights were shaped in a very strange, hard to explain way: they were very well formed light sources and the light from them stayed in a round shape as it came shone out from the craft (in fact we never really saw a ""craft"" per se).  This object flew at a much quicker pace than any of the airplanes we'd see that night and moved towards the west. About 6 seconds into al this the lights went off and became a ""pinpoint"" kind of light...looking a bit like a satellite does. It then moved VERY fast westerly and then completely disappeared.  All of this really intrigued me so I stayed up for another two hours and saw a total of six (6) of them all moving in the same direction. Some just quick, small points of light and others looking like fluttering wings made of light...very blinky and fluttery and fast in their light. Two of them changed colors from white to red to blue and back, but most were just white.

It happened at my cottage on tamarack lake in haliburton. I was outside at my fire on the shoreline after the whole family went to bed after midnight. There were 2 parties going on in the bay where my cottage is and a few camp fires spotted on the shore. I was gazing at the lake when I thought I saw someone in the lake standing on a shallow rock ledge about 250 yards from shore. There was no moon out and the sky was partially cloudy. The silouette appeared to be glowing a white-green colur at the surface of the water. I watched it thinking must be a reflection, then after about 5 minutes there appeared to be a single white spot light directly above it about 20 feet off the water, again I thought must be someones cottage light reflecting to the water. After about 5 minues there was some blinking between the 2 lights as if going from the waters surface to the light 20 feet above. I again thought maybe kids with flashlights in the woods along shore on the other side of the bay about 400 yards away. After watching awhile longer I looked to the left end of the bay and saw 2 more objects again one larger light orange colour on the water surface with a spot light again 20 feet overhead, I watched all three objects appear to blink in blue and red colours horizontally outwards and back to the centre. The objects appeared to look like a cigar shape almost translucent like you could see an outline however it was see thru. There was all types of different lights flashing in no apparent sequence just mainly blue and green yellow and red lights. I was starting to get a shiver up my spine because numerous times I heard noises around my brother in laws trailer next to the cottage. He was sleeping in the trailer so I thought he was making the noise that night. I was watching the water and noticed the first object I spotted was gone however the other 2 to my left were still there but no more blinking only 2 orange lights again. Straight thru the bay I could see another similar object which appeared to throw a green glowing haze along the water surface and change positions left and right. The flashing lights seemed to get more active when the object approached the cottage having a party. After about another half hour of watching all the strange lights all of a sudden there crept in what seemed like a large fog type mist over the whole bay and I lost sight of all 4 objects. My brother in law told me next morning that he thought something was scratching the trailer walls and he kept his golf club by his side all night he said did not sound like racoon and he thought he could hear movement around the trailer.

While on commercial flights I typically follow the flight progress by looking for airports below and trying to figure out our position.  My wife and I were flying out of San Diego on a commercial flight on 16 April that departed about 3 pm local time. We were seated a few rows in front of the wing of the MD-80.  About fifteen minutes out of San Diego we passed over three very remote airports at an altitude I would estimate as between 12,000 and 15,000 AGL. The area is desert mountains and is very rugged. The last airport I saw was marked ""US NAVY"" on the approach end of the northwest-facing runway (about 320 degrees). From referring back to aviation sectional maps I believe we were just south of El Centro, AZ, which is located in an area of highly restricted MOAs (Military Operational areas). I have noted that the sectional maps warn that there is a tethered surveillance aerostat (blimp) north of El Centro at between 5,000 and 15,000 ft MSL. What we observed was clearly not a blimp.  About a minute after we passed over the US Navy landing strip, which was situated between two small mountain ranges we both observed a large, extremely bright and shiny metallic cylindrical object below us, on the opposite side of the eastern range about 20 miles from the airfield. The cylinder was oriented north/south. Based on its relative size, I initially I assumed it was another commercial jet traveling about 2 miles to the north of our track and a few thousand feet below us, but I could see no wings or tail or markings.  As our jet flew eastward we observed the ground gradually disappear beneath our wing and as the Navy landing strip disappeared we noted that the metallic cylinder was not moving away from us but was nearly keeping pace with our aircraft, although we were moving slightly faster. What was most interesting was that the cylinder was oriented perpendicular to us but traveling parallel to us. The craft did not move northward; it was flying perpendicular to how a normal aircraft would move.  Realizing that this was highly unusual, I now spent some time trying to calculate the size and distance of the craft, based on my experience with visual cues at altitude. Based on the ground detail and runway appearance, I would guess that we were at 15,000 ft AGL. By comparing the observable detail on the cylinder, which consisted of two parallel lines running almost the full length of the craft as well as some slight variations of surface texture on the highly polished surface, I would guess that the craft was three to four hundred feet in length and traveling eastward at about 7,000 AGL. The craft continued to travel in an eastward direction, running parallel with our jet, until it disappeared from view beneath our wing.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,,

Also, I am in South Carolina, and people around here aren't exactly open-minded or welcoming about things like this. I can't remember the exact date, but I do know it was one afternoon, around 4:00 pm, in early June. The weather was not too sunny, but it was not overcast either. It was mild, pleasant weather that day.  I was home with my now husband, our infant daughter, and our then-roommate.  My husband stepped outside onto our front porch to have a cigarette, and I started to follow him out. We were standing on the porch talking when I happened to look up at some birds that were flying over some trees approximately 200 feet away from us.  Right at that moment, a shiny metal object came into my view.  It wasn't close to the trees; from what I could tell it looked like it was at least as high up as a small airplane.  Like I said earlier, an airport is not far from my house, so I'm very accustomed to seeing (and hearing) planes, big and small, fly over the house all the time.  But this shiny object made no sound whatsoever.  My husband saw it as well, and we called our roommate out to look at it. It looked at first liek it was shiny, metallic, and saucer-shaped. It wasn't moving at all. It was just hoovering where it was.  Then after a few seconds of just hoovering there, it started rotating and spinning, in alternating speeds. It looked like it was spinning in all directions, upside down, sideways, and diagonally. It looked as if the entire shape of the object was changing with every spin. It did this for a few minutes, then it would move over to the right and hoover a few minutes, and then it would move higher up, hoover for a minute. All the while there were birds flying around in these tress by our house, and that's when I could tell that it must have been pretty high up in the air. (Because in proportion to the birds, it looked very small.) After about ten minutes, it just slowly moved away, towards the west. I have no idea what it was, but I have never in my life witnessed an airplane or balloon of any kind, behave in a manner like that. To my knowledge, no aircraft or balloon, can hoover in one spot, and completely spin! , rotate , and change shape. And if there were such an aircraft, I highly doubt that the general public would be made aware of it, nor, would it be made visible in plain daylight, in suburban areas.  All three of us saw it. There's no doubt in my mind that it was not something that the airport knew about. I don't know if we are the only ones who saw it, but I still keep my eyes peeled every single day, in case it ever comes back. If it ever does, I'll be ready with a video camera next time. I'd love to know if anybody else saw this in this area. Thanks for your time, and again, I'm sorry it took so long for me to report this.

I saw a red light attached to something that was just sitting in the air not moving and then all of a sudden this thing just rises incredibly fast into the cloud cover above it and disappears.  A few weeks later I was again out at night doing the same thing and this time I was looking at the stars themselves when one of them began to move very fast, it was just a point of light very high up and I thought it was a star at first till it cut across the sky and then turned and disappeared into space.  My first expierence with weird stuff in the sky was in the early 90's, I had been out late at night and when I got home that's when everything got strange.  First off I was completely sober and when I went into my home I felt very unusual.  I also behaved strangely, I am afraid of the dark and don't like being in dark rooms alone unless a light is on. This night I walked into my dark house never turned on any lights and went and stood in the livingroom, I just stood there doing and thinking nothing and suddenly had an urge to go out the front door which we never used. We always used the back door to go in and out of the house. When I opened my door there was a huge ball of white light in the sky across from my home, this thing was massive and as I watched it I went out onto the porch.It glided or floated, it moved slowly and it passed behind a large maple tree, I remember wondering why it didn't come out the other side right away, it should've because of the size, so I went down the street to look around the tree but it was gone. I turned around and started to walk back to my house, I have no memory of getting to my house and it wasn't till a year later that I remembered this night.I got up the next day after this event and acted like nothing happened. Very weird.  My husband also had a sighting involving a large craft with 5 blue lights,I think it was stop sign shape or something like that. He works nights at a factory outside the city and he said that some guys were at a door and called him over they told him there was a ufo but by the time he got there it had passed over so he ran to the back of the plant by himself and saw the craft pass over and a short time later he saw a military jet coming flying through the sky, stop on a dime and turn in the direction of the craft. This was only an hour away from the Toronto airport but fairly high up in the sky he said.This also happened shortly after my first sighting in the early 90's.

I am clarifying some information a little. I was thinking about it again today (this weird event pops into my mind every once in a while still.. it really impacted me) and wanted to just clarify info a little bit.)---   There were three of us in the car on the road going out for the night.  It was early August on a Thurs or Friday night, somewhere between 10-11 pm. We were in the city on a street driving Northeast, and there were buildings on either side of us on the road, restaurants, mini mall, parking lots etc, all lit up with typical lights.  Suddenly in a split second, all lights went OUT and the sky lit up in a bright flast of light.  There was not an apparent point that this light radiated from, rather the entire half of the Southeastern sky was lit up like daylight. ie, the sky was sky blue.  For that split second it was like daylight (although the extreme opposite direction, the horizon was still dark). before you could blink, everything was back to normal lights back on and everything.  Literally, it occured in a split second. It was VERY WEIRD and paranormal..  All three of us in the vehicle screamed and the driver STOPPED the car in the middle of the street. Before we were through jumping/hollering/car stopped it was over, though, leaving us to wonder if it really even happened.  There was absolutely NO NOISE associated with the event at all.  We all looked at each other in disbelief... in fact we all asked each other "" did that just happen"" at the same time.  If we were not all there to assure each other, I think if would have been passed off as imagination, etc.  I called electric company the next day because we were so freaked out.. no reports of any kind of problem whatsoever.  We had called another friend we were going to meet up with several miles away north of us, who was in her car as well with her fiance, and although she saw no flash of light in the sky, she said the lights in the city did flash off for a second where she was at too.  The night was fairly clear...nice weather. There was NO lighting, and no storms in the area.  This event may seem trivial just reading about it, but if you were there you would understand why I have reported it here.  The three of us talked often about this event for WEEKS after it occured.   We were shaken up for all that night.. something UNREAL occured that defied our senses and rational explanation.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,30.594153829787235,-96.30467468085106

Me and my family were having a fire outside and were injoying the night sky when we heard a loud sound in the distance . It shook the ground it was a not a loud sound but a low roar like thunder.  We stood there a looking up to the sky for any sighn of lightning but it wasnt even cloudy . A few moments later the sound came again this time louder and with bright grey lights . The sound shook the ground so hard that you could feel it in your head .  We realized that the sound could not be thunder of any kind . We could not see through the trees where the gray light was coming from.  On the oppisite side of the tree line was a large cattle field.  We all figured thats where the light were coming from .  We have one old woman that lives down the road and she does not make any noise  so it couldnt have been a neighbor it was to loud and to powerful for a machine or anything of that nature . We all kind of started to worry so we went in the house after the second time we saw it .  As soon as we got in we felt the low roar and felt the floors in the house shake . I was standing by the window and it shook the house so hard a picture fell off the wall .  Again the lights were very bright and could be seen over the tree line and throught the windows of my home . The tree line was a ways off from my house so it was unbeleavible that something that far away could make enough energy to shake the walls and be as bright as it was . You could hear the cattle running behind the house to apparently get away from whatever was out there .  We considered calling the local police but did not because we thought it would be made fun of . This contiuned for another 30 mins or so then stopped . It would light the woods up like the middle of the day and shake the house and suddenly stop then do it again . This went on for about an hour .  I went out to see if i could find anything the next day but i found nothing . For nothing to be there was suprising because something was in the field that nigh! t . After that night i have contiued to see strange lights in the woods but no sounds . It always happens in the colder months for some reason . I havent asked my close neighbor about that night or if she ever see's lights or sounds coming from the woods but she never asked me so i suppose she was asleep that night Plus i dont want to worry her she lives alone and im sure it would scare her . I will post what i see from now on to let you when i see more lights or hear anything . ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD)),2007-02-01T00:00:00,,

In the spring of 04, as I was driving off Elmendorf AFB, I saw a silver sphere in the sky. I was stopped at the stop light just before the bridge at Mountain View and Boniface Parkway. There were other cars at the light also. I noticed a small aircraft flying from east to west. What caught my eye was it looked to be towing something. This is not unheard of for the Anchorage area, but not all that common either.  I thought it was towing a large balloon at first. By comparing it to the plane, I’d say it looked to be about  eight feet tall. As I was looking at it, it stopped moving and the plane kept going. At first I thought it broke away from the tow rope or whatever, but as the plane flew further away, I could tell the sphere was actually much further away than I first thought. I think it had just happened to be moving at the same rate as the airplane, making it look like it was being towed.  It was very near the Chugach  mountain range, which is east of Anchorage. I could tell it was spinning on it’s own axis. It was totally featureless. Just a silver orb now hovering in the sky spinning. Then it just disappeared. It is hard to explain, but it looked as though  it disappeared on itself as it turned. It never made a sound, but it was far enough away that I don’t think I could have heard it if it did.  When I first noticed it, I was looking through my windshield. I thought it might be some kind of reflection off the windshield, so I rolled down my window and stuck my head out, so I’m sure it was actually there. After it had disappeared, I looked around me to see if anybody else in the other cars had seen it. No one seemed to have noticed it. It was only visible for about 15 or 20 seconds.  I reported this incident shortly after it happened to your web site. It said it had accepted it, but the report never showed on the site. I just chalked it up to a computer error and forgot about it. I’ve only told two people about this incident. My wife and my youngest son. They both laughed at me and thought I was seeing things so I dropped it and never talked about it again. But today, 02/29/08, My oldest adult daughter was visiting with me, and somehow the subject of UFOs came up. Well, it turns out she saw the exact same thing in the same general location about two months ago. So I thought maybe it was important enough to resubmit it. I will leave it to her to decide weather to report her sighting or not.  This incident really occurred. It was a real object, and it really disappeared before my eyes. I am not an attention seeker. I am a military retiree, an ex cop and currently work in the federal security field, so this kind of publicity I don’t need. Do with this report what you will.

I was sleeping in the passenger seat when all of a sudden my friend who was the driver, woke me up and pointed to the sky above and said what is that?  I sat up and cleared my eyes and looked above. There it was, a UFO no more than 150ft above our car on the freeway.  At that time, the sky was still dark. But as close as that UFO was to our car. There's no mistaken that it was a UFO. The UFO was coming down as we were looking at it. Surpisingly, the UFO made no kind of noise at all. It was moving very very slow. It was 360 degree with three circle lights under the flying object. As the UFO came down and hover to the side of the freeway it got so close to the ground, the UFO was literaly touching the grass. Then it started to move into the dark and out of our sight and that's when we lost total sight of the UFO. To this day, I still remember what I have seen that night. It was unbelieveble.

Please once again, closely examine for example pictures 4 & 5.  By the way my brother was looking through his binoculars while I was taking pictures, and my brother counted 7-9 object that we saw that were continuously changing orientation that evening. First notice there 5 lights in picture #5 (note you clearly state that the Aerostat aircraft has 3 strobes. Also notice throughout all the pictures that the objects vary dramatically in orientation from each other . . . not what your Aerostat aircraft is even capable of creating those formations of objects with the just 3 strobes onboard. Next closely examine #7 picture and the objects in that picture  below (zoomed in) …does that look like Aerostat strobes???   The lights formations (that constantly changed formation that evening) throughout the 15 minutes my brother watched them, were at a 12 o’clock position straight up over the top of your Marfa concrete circular landing area that was lit up with your landing area lights that evening. Your Aerostat aircraft is simply not capable of creating the formations of objects in these photos (attached) documenting what my brother and I witnessed.  Please respond with what you now think based on this eye witness account and please do not tell me (as you did before in your previous email) “The Aerostat is equipped with three (3) high intensity Aircraft Strobes to warn General Aviation Aircraft in the vicinity, so that is what you most likely saw that morning.”  (Ken) The numbers (of objects) and logic simply “does not compute”. Next you stated in your email that did not see any other objects or unusual lights around the Aerostat . . . . 1st  were you outside looking straight up at midnight that night?   2nd there was a strong breeze that evening and even if the Aerostat was launched, you and I know that the Aerostat aircraft would have been down wind hundreds of yards not straight up over head in that strong breeze . . .right?  And how do you explain #2 Photo below???##!??? This is one of the objects taken that night with my Olympus C-750 Camedia camera with 6.3 mm 10X lens  where I zoomed in and enlarged it 400%.

While watching a flurry of leaves fall from a tree I noticed a bright object in the northeast sky through the tree's branches. At first I thought it was the sun reflecting off an airplane but it became apparent to me that the object was not moving in relation to the tree's branches. I checked my watch and it was about three minutes past 6:00 p.m. (Mountain Daylight Time). The object appeared to be in a position not quite half way between north and east and all the activity I describe took place at an elevation of between 30 and 45 degrees above the horizon. Having no reference point, I can not guess as to the distance or altitude of the objects I saw. I moved to get the tree out of the way and began thinking perhaps I was seeing a star becoming visible as the sun was setting but it was just too early for a star to come out. I then began to think it was a weather balloon reflecting the sun. I have not seen a weather balloon since I was a kid and am now 60 years old. By the time I changed position and got the tree out of the way, I could see that the object was now moving in relation to some overhead electrical wires. About 30 seconds had elapsed at this point. Now I began to think I was seeing a satellite of some kind, as it was moving to the southwest at about the speed I have seen satellites move. I called to my daughter (age 24), ""Come see the satellite,"" and when I looked back the bright object was moving to the straight west. While I was waiting for her to arrive I saw several smaller bright lights (of two sizes) appear and disappear randomly at varying distances around the first object. Some were visible for several seconds, others just flashed on and then off. She arrived just in time to see several smaller objects, about six of them, form a semi-circle around the first object for a few seconds and then, in a split second, a number of the secondary objects formed a straight line with the first object for a few seconds. The line was angled in such a manner that, if extended upward, it would have crossed the northern sky in direction of the north compass point. My daughter looked at the bright objects through binoculars and said that they appeared to have orange and green lights on opposite sides. After this, both the primary and secondary objects appeared and disappeared randomly in the same vicinity for several minutes. Some were large and others were small. At some point one of the secondary objects separated from the group and began moving in a southwesterly direction. Every so often it appeared to produce flames, like rocket propulsion, and would accelerate rapidly in random directions. At some point another object separated from it and acted in a similar manner, flaming and changing direction at odd angles but keeping in the vicinity of the object from which it came. Both objects headed west, sometimes bright and sometimes dark, as silhouettes, but I could not discern any particular shape. The offshoot object disappeared but I continued to watch the other object for a while. It became dark continuously and looked and acted much like a radio controlled model airplane. It flew west and I swear that at times it looked like the silhouette of a large bird flapping its wings, then it too suddenly disappeared. While this took place, several of the other secondary bright objects moved off slowly in a northeasterly direction. The first object then disappeared and by 6:15 p.m. all objects had completely disappeared. My daughter continued to watch the sky and about 10 minutes later she said she saw a bright object again in the vicinity of where the dark objects had disappeared.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,39.7047,-105.0814

Subject: White pyramid shaped object seen Date: December 16th, 2004 - 8:15 PM Witness:1   I called MUFON to report a triangular UFO in my backyard. This is the report that MUFON processed.  Summary:  Witness called me to relate her UFO sighting of December 16th at around 8:15 PM. She says she was looking out her window which faced a field behind her house. There is around an acre of land between her and the tree line where the object was seen. She states that she saw an object just above the tree line. It was like a triangle standing with the point facing up. She first thought it looked like a pyramid but it was only three sided. In the center of the object was a white light. The object looked all white. She does not know if this was due the center light or if the object was really white. On the three corners were red and green flashing lights. She says this object moved very slowly and began to rise up higher as it went out of view heading from the East going to the Northwest. It made no noise. The object was in sight for about five minutes. She said that the object was about the size of your thumb at arms length which would have made this object very large. The County sheriff's Dept. was called and the local police. Nothing had been reported to them.

PD)) Nine spherical objects in the night sky, one  flew overhead, changing into some sort of flying machine!   My Sightings  I have had a number of sightings at home and on my property. I live in a rural area in Ohio where, for some reason, just about anything can happen. The sighting I am writing to you about is a fantastic one, although there have been some other pretty incredible sightings.  It started one evening on the 2ndof March, 2005. I was walking my cat down to our garage to put her in out of the cold, when all of a sudden, to the left of my view, I saw 7 spherical UFO’s flying through the sky. They zoomed into view. They were pale white, filmy sort of objects with a little dark dot in the center. As I watched I was treated to a dancing display of lights, which left me dumbfounded. During the dance, the two smaller white spheres dropped out of the two larger UFO’s, and began to zip around in the sky, darting every which way. The two smaller discs then joined back up with the larger UFO’s almost as if they were being absorbed into these larger objects. These smaller discs were white and filmy too but with no dot in the center of them. It was as if they were smaller ships, or something, that seemed to scout around even more quickly than the bigger objects. They looked like orbs of light or similar to that. The group continued on, but hovered in the middle of the sky. I was so excited! I had just made a decision about a year before to start looking up at the sky for UFO’s. I had only looked up, maybe, twice, that year, for a minute or two; it wasn’t anything serious, so when I saw these objects I knew exactly what they were. I had read about UFO’s, and how some of them looked, and behaved; there was no mistaking it, this was what I had read about.  I quickly ran over to my drive at the gate to get a better look, then to my husband’s shop to get my cameras. I had two cameras - unfortunately, only one was fully loaded (as I found out later), but I managed to get a couple of shots. I told myself (inside my head) that I wanted these UFO’s to come closer, so that I could get a good photograph. No one would believe the picture that I would get, at this distance. While the second I said that, one of the UFO’s started over! It heard me! It had heard what I had said in my own mind; that means they are telepathic! As the object came closer, I panicked and started to run. I had heard and read about what could happen to you if you got too close to a UFO – you know, burns and radiation – so I didn’t need that. So, I ran. As I ran this object stopped in mid-stream and started back toward the group. …I stopped and went back to the gate with my cameras in-hand, actually one was strapped around my neck and started to snap pictures of these UFO’s, when I realized I couldn’t get the flash to work (on my digital camera). Over and over, again, I snapped the picture with no luck. I quickly went to camera B. It worked fine, it was my 35 mm camera.  I got pictures of these objects, or at least I hoped  I had; it was dark and they were up in the sky and you know how that looks on film. So, I said it again, “Please come over so I can take your picture.” And, again just as I said that, the UFO started to travel over….I was so excited, but I started to run again to my house. I just couldn’t stop myself. The UFO kept coming and I kept running, looking up as often as I could. Just as I was approaching the house a white flash went off…with the sound of a click. I thought, “Oh, my camera is working now or they have somehow activated my camera.” I kept running. As I came to my house, I took another look…this object looked like a star traveling pretty fast; it was white with a fiery motion to it, all ablaze in white with a pale yellow front to it. The pale yellow was at the beginni! ng of th e object. Then as I looked - before I was near to the house - I saw the object stand stationary in the sky – about 15 feet from me and 30 feet in the air. It was in semi-darkness, with light and shadow playing upon it, I could barely make out the shape. It wasn’t circular anymore but looked to be sort of crescent-shaped. …I don’t know, I couldn’t really tell. Something was rotating… it kept rotating. Then all of a sudden, a slender milky white arm slinked down from it, about 15 feet down from the object. You know what I mean, like a spider drops down from its web (that sort of motion and look). And it was translucent, gossamer-like, with a curly-cue tail on the end of it. The very last look I got before I dashed into the house, was when I looked up and saw a milky white sphere on the end of the thing. As I was running, it must of appeared somehow on the bottom of the arm. It was attached to this arm. The sphere was see-thru, too, similar to the arm. This UFO star-like thing seemed to be in the material world and the arm and sphere seemed to be in another dimension. This was like a science fiction movie.  I couldn’t believe it!  I felt like I was being scanned. I was being scanned by this sphere, and my only thought was ... “I feel so primitive.” I ran into the house and didn’t come back out or look out the windows the rest of the evening. I can tell you that I had had a real earth shattering experience; things will never be the same for me. I still look up at the sky, every night, wishing and hoping to see these UFO’s again.  The next day something very unusual and strange happened at the License Bureau – no less,  of all the places. I had to renew my license and had to take the vision test. I don’t need eye-glasses to drive, so I was looking into this vision-testing machine (it was a new one) and the weirdest thing happened. In the beginning of the test, I saw a series of patterns that I was to relate back to the clerk. I did that, and as the test progressed the clerk seemed to tell me that I wasn’t seeing the board properly. Or I wasn’t getting it right, somehow. I told her that what she was asking me to look at just wasn’t there; that that part of the board pattern was there, but the part in the middle was not. I said to her that I think the machine is broken. She said that it had worked all morning and that there wasn’t anything wrong with it.  I gave her the machine (for her to look into) and she began to draw what she saw. She said that this is what is in the machine, at the moment, and this is what she needed me to describe. I looked at her drawing and recognized the pattern, immediately; I had seen this pattern and column at the very beginning of the test. I quickly looked into the machine so that I could see this pattern, too, and I was flabbergasted. It wasn’t there! The column in the middle, the one she was talking about, was gone; it was blank, now - when I  looked into the machine -  with a white background. Her drawing with the column in the middle and the symbols on it, was not there. I started to realize then that there was something going on, and it was inside of me. It had to do with my unusual experience the night before …. I just somehow knew this.  She didn’t laugh at me or anything, just directed me to another building where I cold take another vision test with a different machine – the older type machines they had had the last time I visited the license bureau. This time a police officer was at the helm and I passed the test quickly and got my license. I know that this had something to do with my UFO sighting the night before. It’s almost as if the individuals who controlled the UFO were telling me that they could come into my mind and change what I see… change what I see through my own eyes.  Intriguing. They made me NOT see what was there at the license bureau clearly that day on the machine….and, possibly, just maybe, they made me SEE something that might not have been there, the night before, with the UFO’s. Who knows what it was I really came upon that night? The UFO experience seemed like magic to me. I don’t know…maybe it was all hallucination…or maybe I did see something the night before, a real UFO, and then the individual controlling the object (probably from afar as I didn’t sense a being in it) showed me that he could get inside my head and change my vision. The individual or controller of this experience, my experience, is God-like.  ….Maybe all this is just me doing all these miraculous things, mentally bringing these things about. But what about the UFO my husband and I photographed a month later? My husband and I witnessed another UFO and actually photographed it! It was a different type UFO, in that it was a red/orange sphere…but that’s another story to tell.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,38.9312,-84.1063

My friend said ""Ey what is that?""  Thinking he was playing with me I didn't look at first but when I eventually did what follows is what I saw...In total at least 5 of us saw all of this and were calling our wives/girlfriends/friends to see if anyone else had witnessed it:  It was still sunny out and there appeared to be something extremely bright in the sky.. It could've been silver but it was just BRIGHT (and mind you the sun was still out)… At first I thought it was just a star or something but it was moving sorta side-to-side, up and down..just hovering around that general area..Then when we looked to the right we saw 2 more bright lights making the same movements and to the right of them, there was a pack of maybe 5 smaller (but still pretty bright) lights doing the same movements.  From my job, there is an Air Force base (strategically put there I begin to wonder??) about 15-20 mins car ride away...After observing the lights for several minutes, an air force fighter jet flew across the sky from west to east and then disappeared...  Within a minute or two of the fighter jet leaving, the pack of 5 smaller lights broke up and moved side-to-side up VERY quickly until they all disappeared.  (From the moment they started ascending til they were no longer visible must've been about 20 seconds)  Then the two lights that were next to the brightest one also broke away and ascended very quickly..  The last and brightest one ascended quickly but did not fully disappear...Most of my co-workers had stopped watching at this point, however I followed this bright one as it moved in the SE direction for close to 45 mins and eventually disappeared...I checked the next day the see if anyone had reported anything and I tried googling but nothing ever came up...After reading descriptions of sightings on here, I had to post because some stories are EERILY similar to mine.  Had I been the only person to witness this, I might've thought I was crazy but to have the backing of my co-workers makes me believe something was happening and my eyes weren't just playing tricks on me.

I went with my friend from New York to a beach called Playa Paraiso, outside of Haciendo de Cabanas, Guerrero.  In order to get to the beach you have to cross a lagoon by boat. Since we arrived at around 11:00 PM there were obviously no more boats so we knew we'd have to wait until the morning to go across.  The lagoon is not that big.  I parked my car in front of the lagoon and sat with my friend watching the sky.  We'd been driving for several hours, so we were kind of tired.  Suddenly a huge, bright pink/orange colored round object departed from the ocean, and went into the sky.  If I had been alone, I would have thought I was hallucinating but my friend saw the same thing.  We were both speechless as we saw this object take off into the sky.  Instead of disappearing into the sky, it hovered about the ocean for several minutes.  The radiating colors of this craft were unforgettable.  When it was still, the light that it emitted would shine brighter.  But when it moved it would become more dim.  Finally it disappeared.  My friend and I had shared a strange moment that to this day, few people believe.  We slept in the car that night.  The next morning when we went across, we asked several people who lived and worked on the beach if they had ever seen something similar.  Apparently it is something very common to that area.  Everyone we talked to had seen these things, and it seems to be something very common.  If someone ever wants to see one of these, I recommend going to this same beach and watching the sky.  It has been happening regularly for years and I imagine it will probably continue to happen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The sky was clear with very few clouds. We were driving the speed limit which was 40 MPH through this short canyon.  We were just about to reach the end of this small canyon, when all of a sudden I saw out the corner of my eye a very bright spotlight, similar to a spotlight that police helicopters use. It was showing at the top of the canyon, at that moment I told my friend to look, the spotlight seemed to be moving parallel to the car. The spotlight flashed on for about 20-30 seconds, then it would disappear, we turned off the music in the car, rolled down the windows to listen for any sound, we heard nothing, it was really shocking to me, I am a very logical person, who was very skeptical about UFO’s. But on that night I became a believer. My friend and I could not see the source of this very bright spotlight, we could not hear any sound of any kind.  This is what had my friend and I shocked. The spotlight was following parallel to our vehicle for another 3-4 minutes. It would flash on for about 20-30 seconds, it was moving, it must have flashed on and off five or six times, reflecting of the tops of the short canyons. I turned to my friend and said, No one is going to believe what we just saw, he looks at me in amazement, and said, I know. We both still have this encounter very fresh in our minds; we will never forget what we saw that night. I am a believer! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

This event caused me to call the 3 local tv stations and ask if any one had reported seeing a triangle in the sky.  The respone I got from all 3 stations was no.  They did not seem to even want to know what I had seen.  At this point I started to doubt what I had seen bec there was a lot of traffic on the road and someone else had to have seen it.  The only thing that makes me think I did not just imagine it is that I watched it for about 5 min.  before I actually was underneighth it and saw the shape of it.  My impression is that it may be some kind of exp aircraft because we live right near redstone arsenal.  The object was not making any really unsual movement except that it did not appear to move at all but hover or move very slowly and I heard absolutely no sound coming from it.

WITNESS: Commercial pilot for over 30 years. After repeated communications I deem this witness highly credible. The description of the event and the responses to follow-up questions were consistent and articulate. The witness is cautious in drawing conclusions. The witness also has been employed in the past by agencies where expertise and integrity would be required. The witness expressed reasonable concern about reporting this event due to professional standing, but believed what was observed was so far out of the ordinary it needed to be compared to other reports. TIME/DATE:  April 16, 2007 at 2130 hours (Pacific Daylight Saving Time). (Sunset occurred at 1903 hours according to the Naval Observatory Table.)   LOCATION: My house is about 70 ft above sea level and I overlook the Fidalgo Bay Marina. I live in Anacortes, Washington and my house is on top of a hill looking south towards Whidbey NAS. Whidbey NAS is approximately 6 miles straight line from my house and is SSE. My view towards the south is mostly unobstructed but there area few trees that block 20% of the view. METHOD OF OBSERVATION: Miyauchi 77x30 astronomical binoculars. The optics have excellent color correction and are high quality. They were mounted on a tripod during this event. DIRECTION OF OBSERVATION:  I saw some aircraft lights departing the Whidbey NAS so I pointed my binoculars south to watch the aircraft. The NAS is approximately 6 miles from my house and is SSE from my point of observation. OBJECT: It had a very large and very bright red light that pulsated on and off slowly which is very different from an aircraft red rotating beacon or red strobe anti-collision light. The red light was on top of a dimmer but large white light that was separated by some structure. The object was stationary and hovering and was absolutely still. I thought it might be a military helicopter but there where no red or green navigation lights. SIZE / DISTANCE: Witness could not estimate distance as I don't know the size of the object. (Rationale: Exact shape could not be discerned and thus, could not be estimated in comparison to known aircraft.) This also relates to one of my follow-up questions about whether or not the object was in restricted air space. The witness reports, ""I am not sure if the object was in fact in restricted airspace as I am was not able to determine the distance of the object.”""  DURATION: Witness observed the object for a few minutes. OBJECT FLIGHT MANEUEVERS: ""When I first spotted the object it appeared to be south and west from the NAS but. It slowly started moving in an east direction towards the NAS. But it was moving in a weird wave oscillation motion. It moved a few degrees to the left or east and then stopped. Then it sat motionless for maybe 30 seconds and then shot straight up. I can only guess that the altitude was very low when I first spotted it and was below 1000 feet. When it shot up it moved extremely fast and stopped. It could have covered a thousand feet in a second. But then it accelerated at an unbelievable rate to the east and covered several miles in 2 or 3 seconds and then stopped dead. It sat motionless again for a few seconds and then slowly moved off to the east and disappeared from sight."" POSSIBLY RELATED RESPONSE: As the object slowly moved off, a fast moving aircraft depart the NAS moving west and then turned sharply left to the south, climbed to 1500 to 2000 feet and appeared to accelerate to the south towards where the object had disappeared from my view. I lost sight of that aircraft as well.  The aircraft may not have had anything to do with the object but thought it was strange.

One evening I was scanning around on my short-wave radio station on the AM band at around 1340 KHz, I heard a small radio station which is talk-show radio program where people were calling in to this station and saying that they’ve seen this large disc shaped object with multi colored lights on it, as it was passing through Millhurst IL as it was heading towards Silver Springs State Park in Kendall County IL.  One person who called into this small town radio station said that this object appears to have multi color lights and it was changing all different colors. Another person had called into the radio station and said the he was camping out at Silver Springs State Park, and saw this saucer disk shaped like object hovered towards the southwest for about 20 minutes, and then this saucer shape object had shot down a white laser beam as if it was looking for something, then it just took off way up into the sky.  Other phone calls had came pouring into this little radio station, in fact one person had said that she had seen from a distant had saw a young woman walking alone into the woods area, as this saucer shape object had a white laser beam had shot at this woman, as she vanish right into mid air without a trace.  I do not know if this radio station was telling the truth or making this as a phony story, by making a mountain out of a molehill?

We looked up to see a UH-1 on a low flight path. As we watched it the helicopter changed its flight course from due south directly toward us, southwest. It flew over the power lines and osprey nesting poles to right over us, about 300ft above us, and hovered.  The noise was disturbing, to us, and to the wildlife there abouts.  I was angry at first, then a bit intimidated, as, upon viewing the craft through my binoculars, getting a very close look, I noticed there were absolutely no markings on this very dark green UH-1, only 3 white strobe lights, one on the top, one on the bottom, and one on the tail rotor.  No other lights or markings were on it. The cockpit windows were closed and blacked out so no one could see the pilots inside.  The doors were all closed.  Since we were alone on this trail with no one else in sight it was a bit intimidating to say the least.  After a couple of minutes where we felt we were being observed, the ""huey"" flew away in a northwest direction. I felt puzzled as well as angry about this incident, so I contacted my Sen. Jack Reed, D-RI.  I sent him an email on that same day asking him to find out who was piloting this chopper and why there were no markings on it.  On July 19th, 2007, I received a written letter from Sen. Reed informing me that he had contacted Maj.Gen. Bray of the RI National Guard and that the general's letter to him was enclosed.  Also, that if I had any more questions regarding this incident to contact David Foehr at his RI office.  I read the response letter from Gen. Bray to Sen. Reed.  It was vague, saying that on that weekend three UH-60 (no UH-1s) helicopters were dispatched to Indiantown Gap Military Reservation in PA for training.  He also stated that the Army Aviation Support Facility at Quonset Point in N.Kingstown, the home of the Air wing of the Guard, ""did not recieve any inquiries concerning operations conducted during the period of May 4-6, 2007.""  What that meant I have no idea...again, vague.  He went on to state that the RI National Guard conducts flight operations on a routine basis within RI and that the UH-1 and UH-60 helicopters that they use are ""affixed with U.S. Army markings.""  Therefore, this rouge unmarked UH-1  was not from the RI Army National Guard.  Then, the question is, where did it come from and why did it fly where and in the manner seen by me and my girlfriend? I called back to Sen. Reed's office in RI and spoke with one his male office people.  I explained the reason for my call.  He became nervous, and said, please hold on, I am transfering your call to Washinton, D.C.  After several minutes an official sounding man answered the phone without giving his name and wanted to know what I wanted.  I had already given my name and address to the RI office.  I asked who he was and he would only say his name was ""Kevin"" and did not want to give me his last name.  He said he worked for Sen. Reed.  I explained the reason for my call again to him.  He told, rather non-sensically, to call Maj.Gen. Bray directly and ask him about this UH-1.  I said Sen Reed has already gotten a written response from the General, of which I have a copy, so why am I asked to call the General myself.  Again, he was vague, but said it would be quicker if I called the General myself, assuming the General would even talk to me.  He implied that maybe this time I would get a direct answer since Sen. Reed's new inquiry would take time.  I laughed to myself, said, ""ok"" and hung up.  I did not have Gen. Bray's phone number but the number for a contact person, LTC Habersham of the RI Air National Guard, would be the one to talk to.  Apparently, Gen. Bray and Sen. Reed want to distance themselves from any prying questions.  Why all this secrecy, I ask myself.  I call LTC Habersham yesterday, July 19, 2007.  A message on his machine said he was away on TDY training in PA and would not be back for a week.  He left his cell phone to call him. I did, left a message as to who I was and why I was calling.  A while later, when I did not have my phone near me, he did indeed call me back, saying that he would call me when he got back from TDY as he was very busy at this time.  Fair enough.  That's where this incident lies at this time.  Whether there is any connection  to the secrecy, as I perceive it, to the silent, gliding UFO I witnessed fly over the Jamestown Bridge and hover over the Nat'l Guard HQ at Quo! nset Poi nt last month (reported to NUFORC) I don't know.  Thought you might be interested. By the way, I am a Vietnam Army combat vet who has flown on the ""hueys"" and have never seen one without military or some kind of markings/insignia.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,,

The light was as bright as Venus and did not have any other flashing lights around it. From my point of view the light was moving from South to North at a steady pace. After it passed by Venus the light split into two lights, now flashing. They each went away from one another at about 45 degrees. They then disappeared. This lasted about one minute. Approximately 10 minutes later my husband came outside to join me and I told him what I saw.  After waiting a few minutes three orange lights appeared in the Western sky in about the same area, to the left of Venus and just above the treetops. These lights were bright round lights, orange in color and the same size as Venus. They appeared one at a time from right to left. As one would come on to the left the right one would go out. The lights would fade in intensity as if a blowing tree was blocking your view. Then the lights just turned off. This lasted about one minute.  We both noticed after the lights went out there were about 20 to 30 airplanes in the sky circling the area where the lights had been. These airplanes appeared very far away. We waited about 10 to 15 more minutes and saw more orange lights appear in the Western sky just to the left of the previous ones. This time the lights appeared one at a time from right to left, about 3 or 4 in a row. They faded and brightened again and then just before going out a line of 3 smaller lights appeared at a 45-degree angle up from the original lights in this formation. Then they turned off too. This lasted just 30 to 40 seconds. These lights were about the size of a pea from arms length and about an inch apart in the sky. They did not move when illuminated. They did not appear in the exact spot as the times before. These lights were not flares being shot up from neither the ground nor flares shot from an airplane.

The craft came down and landed in my friend's backyard. a door opened and two tall, slender gray colored, about 6'2"" and about 6'4"" beings, came out and floated across the yard. The crowd panicked and backed away. My friend's mother ran out of the house screaming for everyone to get back. My friend's younger sister was frozen like a statue. These two beings floated across the yard,toward the frozen blonde haired young lady. Her mother ran right at the two beings screaming no you can't take my daughter. One of the beings raised their hand knocking the running mother over backwards, rendering her unconscious. The two beings came and took the daughter by the arms, floated back to the hovering craft, doors opened, in they went and the craft left slowly at first, then disappeared very quickly. The daughter was never returned. Since the summer of 1978, my friend's sister has never been seen again. The mother had a complete nervous breakdown, as she told of her own abductions. Officially the daughter's disappearance, has been categorized by the local police and FBI as an unsolved kidnapping. Everyone I have told this story to has never believed me. The mother told me of her own abductions as well as her daughter's abductions as a small child. The daughter had just become 18 years old about 6 weeks before she was taken.

My friend and I were sitting at a campfire late on a summer long weekend.  Our group of camping friends consisted of about 5 families or about 20 people.  We often went to a site that was about 2 hours from where we lived, at Wood Lake, above Harrison Lake 25 miles north of Chilliwack, B.C.   We were about 15 years old and had been enjoying staying up late with the parents.  Between gazing at the campfire and listening to our parent’s stories, we would recline in our camp chairs and gaze at the stars, counting the satellites and looking at the stars, in amazement of the beauty of the night sky and what might be ""out there.""  At approximately 1 AM, we noticed a fairly bright satellite traveling westwards across the sky.  When this satellite was getting close to the half way point across the sky we noticed another bright light traveling at about 5 times the speed of the satellite (it seemed as though it was almost streaking across the sky).  To describe the approach angle of the light heading towards the satellite: if the satellite was traveling from the 6 o’clock to the 12 o’clock position, the streaking light came from the 4 o’clock position.  When the streaking light came within a close distance to the satellite and as though it was about to cross the satellite’s path just behind it, it slowed suddenly to match the speed of the satellite and was now on the same path, following it and just slightly to one side.  This portion of the experience happened within the space of about 5 seconds.  The bright light then sped up to get closer to the satellite and kept that closer distance for a few seconds, then accelerated in a zig-zag pattern making sharp angled turns that seemed unrealistic because of the speed and the seemingly impossible sharp angles of the turns, not bends but sharp bends.  When it did this I had the impression it was ""checking out"" the satellite.  Then after the last ""zag,"" it sped off faster then it entered the picture, at almost the speed of a falling star, but without the streak of a falling star.  My friend and I watched for a few moments more to watch the satellite and be sure we wouldn’t miss something else, then looked at each other and I said: ""Did you see that?""  He looked at me with a bit of blank stare for a moment, then said slowly: ""yah, I did.""  I asked him what he thought it might have been, and he said I don’t know and neither did I.  I’ve only told a few people over the years about this because I didn’t think I would be believed, and sometimes I would begin to doubt the experience myself.  I have tried to reason with this experience and all I could come up with is that it must have been intelligent to do what it did.  I couldn’t say that I believe in ""aliens,"" because I’m the type of person that has to see it to believe it.  What I do know from that night is that my friend and I saw my first and only unidentified flying object.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,,

I looked at it for sometime off and on as I ate with my family. I pointed it out to my mother and grandparents and they also could see it - but they where more interested in me finishing my meal so I could go play. It was not alarming to us as we did not think about UFOs or such things – just figured it was suppose to be there. I remember seeing sun light reflect off (flashing like) a more silver-ish side as it rotated above us. The other ""half"" was a blue hue. Again, as I got older and re-thinking about how odd it was this satellite was so low that I could see it and it was not moving, just spinning above us.  I learned that a satellite would not be stationary at the altitude I was seeing this object at. It was hovering and rotating on its axis at about once every two or three seconds.

It slowly and silently passed and I looked a him and he looked at me and we both were like ""Did you see what I saw?"" We confirmed it.

Description:  A formation of 3 lights, appearing in the sky above a ridgeline, with mechanical and precise motion. I was in my backyard after carrying several buckets of coal to the basement for our fireplace.  I was looking westward along a mostly flat ridgeline approximately 7 miles away.  From the north end of the ridgeline, noticeably well above the ridgeline itself (i.e. in the sky), a single light emerged, moving at a relatively slow speed.  Once it had moved along for a few seconds, a 2nd light appeared in trail behind it, emerging from the same location the first one had. The lights continued to move southward, in lock-sync, above the ridge until approximately halfway across.  At that point the lights stopped, in a very odd, mechanical fashion (i.e. there was no deceleration, just instantaneous cessation of movement) and immediately a 3rd light appeared from ""behind"" the southern-most light and stopped at a symmetrical point with the other 2, forming 3 lights in a straight line and spaced equidistant from each other. The lights sat there motionless for approximately 10 seconds.  At that point, the new light continued southward, and the original 2 lights retraced their original path northward, and all disappeared behind neighboring hills.  The motion again was completely mechanical; instant acceleration and completely synchronized. The lights themselves were single-point white lights, with no other observable characteristics.

The next day I asked my little brother if he had seen anything and he told me that he thought our parents had been in the room. I then asked both my mother and father if they had been in our room at any time of the night and they both had said that they haven't been in our room the entire night.

I have two different events to share with you.  First off, some background on myself.  I own my CNC machining business.  Have been a race engine builder for years.  Worked with GM for years.  Studied astronomy, physics and engineering.  Very down to earth person.  I don't look for phenomena, but have always had a major interest in the natural world.  I quest for knowledge in all my endeavors.  I not easily swayed, I seek facts and details.  I could go further, but that being said, here's my events.  September 04;  I was driving home from my shop ~ 11:00 pm.  I turned right on Jefferson from Date Street heading north.  It was a warm night and I enjoy the solitude of the night sky.  I had the drivers window down and was glancing up to view the night sky and stars as I normally do.  A dim luminous object in the sky caught my eye at about 11:00 above and to my slightly forward left.  I had to look out the window and look almost straight up to see this object.  I drove almost two miles to Murrieta Hot Springs road while slowing and viewing this object.  While driving the object never moved from it's position in the sky.  The object was the size of my thumbnail at arms length.  To not alter it's position in the sky over two miles horizontal on the ground says something of the height and size of this object.  The object was exactly triangle in shape.  It's luminosity was about a 10 watt bulb viewed from across a large room with an old lampshade covering the light.  It was a dull brown/gold in color.  It had a distinuished dark band that outlined the perimeter and appeared to be darker than the moonless night sky.  However the most strange element of this sighting was what appeared to be the underside, the side I could see.  The surface seemed to be in turmoil.  I would describe it as what you would see on a TV set with a screen full of snow on a channel without programming.  I pulled over just before I got to Murrieta Hot Springs Road to grab my camera in my glove box.  I just got back from Lake Mead with my boys and had not yet turned in the disposable camera for developing.  I stopped my truck while still watching the object.  In the time it took me to reach over to my glove box for the camera and look back out to take a picture, the object was gone.  I was standing outside the truck with a complete view of the sky and saw no hint of the object anywhere.......  I had not noticed any sound.  The object appeared to be very close to me, but with the distance I traveled and the object maintaining it's position in the sky, it had to be very large and very high.  February 2006;  I was again driving home late at night, ~12:00 a.m. from my shop.  My girlfriend was with me at this time.  We were heading north on I-15.  Just pass California Oaks off ramp, we both noticed a very bright light hovering just above the horizon about NW, 10:30 from our position.  It was very strange in that there was no traffic in our direction.  No lights ahead and one set of lights very far behind us.  Very unusual for the busy I-15.  We commented on the brightness of the lights.  Like they were pointed right at us.  They were brighter than any aircraft lights I've ever seen.  But there were 3 together but distinctly separate.  We thought it may be a helicopter.  It moved ever so slightly towards us, maintaining it's altitude.  We continued to comment on the strangeness.  As we approached Bundy Canyon, the object seemed to start to draw a bead on us.  Again there was oddly no other traffic in our direction, but a sporadic car passing on the opposite side heading south.  As we passed Bundy the object was now even with us and within a 1/4 mile to the direct West of us and falling slightly behind us, say to the 8:00 position.  It's altitude was maybe 200'.  It then turned and maintained running parallel to our direction exactly off at 9:00.  It maintained that distance for ~ 1/4 mile, then moved in to us.  It continued to fly directly over the truck.  I become very uneasy and speed up to around 100 mph, because I felt like it may hit us.  It flew directly above us for maybe a 1/2 mile and then started to veer off to the East and disengaged slowly.  I could not see it off the passenger side except for just a couple of glimpses.  My girlfriend continued to eye it.  She said it then shot off to the East at an extremely high rate of speed.  Faster than a jet she said.  Strange facts:  NO noise.  This object made absolutely NO noise, even flying about 100' above us.  Three aircraft type landing lights up front and two of the same type lights in the assumed ""Rear"" of the object.  NO traditional navigation lights or strobes.  And the most amazing aspect of all is that there was no visible body.  We could not make out any physical type of structure to the object.  NO wings, NO fuselage, NO body.  Just lights and void between the lights.  Even as the object came over head, we could not see any type of body.  The object did appear to be circular only becuase of the way the lights were positioned.  I would estimate the size to be maybe 20' to 30'.  I figured you may like to add these sightings to what ever compilation you may have.  Thank you ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

At on point it was directley ubove us and through the sun roof I could see it clerley. one whiteish blue light was in the center with 4 lights surrounding it those lights would change color and rotate positions. it made a slight humming sound. (it was probobley a bad idea but the sunroof was compleatley open). A short while later it took off behind us and later was followed by a low flying hellocoptor. wich surprised us. I think the hellocoptor was following it because it was flying DANGEROSLEY LOW and in the same directon as the craft whin it left.

At that early hour of the morning there was just enough light so that i could see a perfect triangle outline in the dark blue morning sky. My bedroom window was open at the time and the thing that got my attention was that the street was completely silent and this craft was not gliding, not at the slow pace it was moving at and it was completely dead silent no noise whatsoever. I kept watching as it moved north east for about 30 seconds or so and the triangle shaped craft eventually disappeared over the horizon. Theres one more thing i would like to mention that i feel is very important, im not at all a morning person, i never get up early, not since my school days and the thing about that morning is that i woke up and it's almost as if someone or something told me to get up open the blind and look out the window and when i did 5 secends later this triangle shows up.

It was nothing I had seen in 20 years in the military! Ahead of me the coast took a jag to the west toward Mugu Rock this craft followed the coast line and as it did it turned it side exposing it top side. I could see no tail fin and no cock pit. This craft made no sound and I was very close! It scared the heck out of me because I thought it would crash but it did not. It came to Mugu Rock and very easily negotiated around it keeping the same distance away.Scared and curious at the same time I accerlated and got past the rock as fast as I could. Once past the road was straight for a distance of a mile and so and I could see the air station clearly. no planes were seen in the air. I hurried down the road to where the road turned east and I could see down the road and too the city of Camarillo. no planes in sight.I kept searching the skies but saw no planes.It was a very unusal event.

Each end of the diamond closed in, making a purple line in the sky, with a white center. Then the line closed in forming a tiny dot, which became nothing.

The power went out in the entire town.  A few car alarms sounded and were going off.  One of the street lights exploded and the light ambers floated to the ground.

I had a cut-out cardboard box around my head to block out the street & residential security lights in the neighborhood, making my view of the clear but hazey sky quite clear.  I had laid there admiring shooting stars when at about 12:25 AM a small airplane flew North over me in Oak Cliff, a suburb of Dallas, Texas.  Its North-South trajectory was about a few blocks to the West of my position.  I imagine it to have been following the path of Westmoreland Boulevard.  Before I could see it, I remembered the noisey little airplane by its distinctive sound, since it flies North and/or South over our house frequently at night, always disturbing my sleep.  It triggered the usual question: why aren't such airplanes required to muffle their noise, especially at night?  As it passed over my line of sight, I noticed something following it.  I first thought the plane was towing something behind it, because the object behind the airplane was traveling the same speed and at approximately the same altitude.  It was so dimly illuminated it was hard to see.  It's image area was about six to eight times larger than the small airplane's image area.  All I could see of it was three elongated octagons (rectangles with the corners cut off).  Their lengths ran the direction the craft traveled.  The octagons were in a common plane, two in the back and one in center front, evenly spaced apart in a triangular formation.  It was about one to two hundred yards behind the small airplane and slightly to the West of the airplane's trajectory.  It flew in a straight, level line without deviations.  Either the small airplane was making so much noise that I couldn't discerne the object's sound.  Or, the object was making no noise at all.  The object's three elongated octagonal panels were either very dimly: but evenly illuminated, or they were finished with a non-reflective or ultra-flat coating that evenly diffused their reflection of the city's ground lights over their surfaces.  No sharp ground lights were reflected off of them as it passed over.  And, I don't know if it was a single craft or three individual aircrafts flying in continuous and perfect formation.  I stood and turned around to continue watching it and the airplane as they flew away from me, to the North toward Love Field.  As they dissappeared in the misty distance I couldn't descerne anything about the object's shape.  As the three panels became flat in the distance, the whole thing seemed to dissappear.  But, I could still see the airplane's blinking lights and barely still hear the airplane's noisey exhaust.  I immediately went downstairs to write down and sketch what I'd seen.  Just after one o'clock I called Love Field Tower.  A recording gave me a night phone number.  I called that number at 1:10 AM.  Someone named Gary answered the phone.  I briefly described what I'd seen.  He said he was on the field and to call him back in twenty minutes when he'd be back in his office.  I called him again at 1:30 AM and again told him what I'd seen.  He said he'd talked to the tower and they'd heard nothing from anyone else about it.  I reminded him that the tower's nightn phone number isn't even listed, so the public couldn't have called the tower unless it was a relative or other airport official who already knew the tower's night number, deducing that HE would be the only one to have recieved any calls about it.  He completely ignored that.  It seemed as though he was partonizing or attempting to placate me.  He didn't seem genuinely interested, failing to ask for my name, phone number or any information about the sighting that I hadn't volunteered.  I asked him if there is an official phone number where such sightings are supposed to be reported.  He said, ""No,"" that I'd ""called the right number.""  So, I appologized for bothering him with such ridiculous nonsense and hung up.  I was left feeling disgruntled, unsatisfied and embarrassed.  Now, that I know the National UFO Reporting Center is listed in the FAA Manual as the correct place to report unusual sky sightings, I'll call ole ""doubting Gary"" back tonight to provide him with the NUFOREC's phone number, remind him to read his manual and give him a free piece of my mind.  I saw a similarly unusual flying object many years ago (I'm bad with past chronology) several miles East of Tyler, Texas.  It was deep in the dark piney East Texas forrest.  The night was clear and the stars were amazingly bright.  The thing appeared to be a sharp triangle, only distinguished by it's blocking out the star's light behind it as it passed over me heading East.  It was moving too slowly, in my opinion, to be an airplane.  It didn't exhibit the three elongated octagonal shapes on the bottom.  If it was the same type craft, I suppose this was because there was no ground light to illuminate them.  It was exactly the same color and intensity of the background night sky.  It, too, made absolutely no sound.  And, I was alone then, too.   I seriously doubt these craft were man-made.  And, I no longer have any doubts that we are NOT alone on our God-forsaken, bloodthursty, demockery-cursed, predatory little planet.  So, perhaps there is hope for Us good Earthlings, afterall!",2007-10-08T00:00:00,32.83516807743405,-96.80811785917632

Sometimes they just sit or hover directly north or directly south.  Number of UFOs:	7  Height:	variable  Size:	half thumb  Number of Witnesses:	1  Details:	The weird thing was the lamp / lights. I have never seen them this bright. Instead of looking like street lights they looked like mini stars, flaring sort of. And I missed at least 3 other flyby. As soon as I put the camera down they flew past again. The orbs were huge at least 3 of them. The triangles were amazing really low. I got two filmed but typically the lowest & best I didn't get to in time as the battery was on charge. Also as I said before there was some kind on membrane either side of the street I can see it but I'm not sure if it will be on the video. The only analogy I can think of is the look of the liquid you blow bubbles with combined with T.V.Static. This membrane sort of vibrates and runs the length of the street both sides behind the neighbors house. I'm thinking this could be some sort of shield so that other people in the town can't see the vehicles or it could be an opening into another dimension or even a shield from the prying eyes of military satellites. Now I think it was all of the above.  As you will hear from the tape there is little sound.Only a few slowed jets noises.The birds are silent and here seagulls are never silent. The neighbors behind were in the garden drinking and chatting. They were oblivious.  The noise of the coast road which normally has taxis on sounded literally like out of a sci-fi movie. The sound of a space ship. These sounds precede the filming. In fact that is how I know they are coming. I always here these very very slowed down jet noises. But they are not jets more just like a slowed down video tape or sci-fi effect.  I'm not used to the camera so I zoomed in and out a bit to start with. But there is over 13 minutes so far. I could have got at least a couple of hours but my camera is 7 years old and the battery needs charging often.  Anyway here is the link for the full 13 minutes of video footage. The best part is after 6 minutes, however I would suggest watching the whole thing first time.You can watch or download the footage here.  http://www.archive.org/details/E.T.V.U.F.O.August13th2007   As an intelligent person I can assure you these are not commercial or private Aircraft or Helicopters. The U.K. has very strict rules regarding flights over urban & suburban areas. The speed of these vehicles is very slow only as long as I am observing them. The seem to continue to the horizon where they vanish. They vehicles always appear in an instant. The triangular ships also have morphing or cloaking capabilities. I have not been able to confirm whether they are the same as the Orbs or whether they are the same. Perhaps there is another larger mother ship nearby disguised as blue sky I would never know.  The police helicopter is possible at the end although I didn't hear it. Often when these sightings occur the police helicopter or the Coast Guard Helicopter turn up. Living on the coast I hear & see these all the time. I didn't hear them or see them. The footage is of the UFOs . The first piece of footage could have been two hours long. I observed it for more than two hours. I didn't film it because I just didn't have the battery's charged. There's no way a helicopter is going to sit above my neighbours house hovering for two hours or more in silence !!! However sometimes these E.T.V.s turn on their sides flip over charge shape completely & even morph. So I'm not sure. All I know is that since I reported this incident the sky has been sprayed very heavily with chemtrails up to 8 aircraft just last night. Now we have gone from warm 80 degree heat to winter weather in less than 24 hours. Its raining / flooding again and very windy. Of course this also means no one is going to look at the sky and watch UFOs.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,,

It was about the size of a bright star, and had a large glow to it.  It did not have a blinking light like an airplane, and again, it was moving incredibly fast!  There was no sound as if from a plane, and it was not accompanied by a tail as if it were a meteorite (shooting star).

I watched it as it moved around across the sky until it began to fade at about my 2 o’clock.

When I went on deck I looked up to where the sound came from to look at the plane and I saw a craft which was not at all an airplane.  It stopped making any sound and stopped in mid-air.

It had a window area which looked like a cartoon version of human teeth; 1 row upper 1 row lower.  It emited a color of red then changed colors to yellow to green to yellow then red. It blanked out all color and moved east (50 mtrs as I saw it) and stopped again and repeated the color sequence.  It moved once more, stopped, and repeated the color change.   It then moved off slow but steady toward Puerto Rico then gathered speed as it left.  It disappeared from my view into clouds.  It made no sound once I had it in my sight.

I saw something moving very fast in the sky behind two buildings.   I watched the other side of the building to see the object emerge because I wasn't sure I'd seen anything.

I am an airplane buff and can ID most things that fly but I had trouble even seeing anything and yet, there was something there.   My impression at the time was that I was seeing through the object and it was distorting the background of clouds behind it.  I could not see any distinguishing features.  I thought it might be a floaty in my eye, but it kept flying in a ruler straight line at preposterous speed.   I could not hear any roar of engines or a sonic boom, though I could hear helicopters that I could see so I know I was hearing the sounds from outside.   The object just flew out of sight at an altitude of about 3000 feet.  I base this on the angle at which I saw it and that it passed in front of the contrails of higher jets and the clouds.   I called my  girlfriend about an hour later and told her about the experience.

It was about 2100 hrs and the night was dark. She had just arrived from visiting our son who lives closer to town. Minutes prior, as she was driving home toward our house, she had observed a craft that had her mentally shaken, even today.  She was 1 ½ miles from our home when 3, evenly spaced, bright lights, descended toward the road in front of her. Her first thought, when she saw the horizontal lights, was an airplane about to crash or land on the roadway ahead. The lights didn’t seem to illuminate the ground, but were more like round window lights.  As she drove forward, the lights continued to float downward toward the road surface. She became concerned the craft might actually hit her car. At the brim of the hill before the little valley ahead, she stopped the car, thinking the aircraft would likely land in front of her. A pick up truck, had been following my wife, also stopped. Then both she and the pick up truck edged over to the side of the road., attempting to give as much room as possible to the craft. As the lights dropped down to the level of telephone wires, they continued their approach directly toward the front of my wife’s car. “At that point“, my wife explained; “I gunned the car downhill figuring I would be able to get under the plane. I didn’t want to “stay put” because, the lights were heading directly for me. I felt I would certainly get hit if I didn’t drive under the lights. My wife drives a convertible, the top was up, but she had the windows down. She was listening for the plane’s motor but heard nothing. The lights then turned 90 degrees to the east and immediately disappeared. A giant shadow passed between her car and the trees beyond.  Since the shadow and the lights then completely disappeared, without noise, my wife realized she had seen something she had heard about, but never wanted to see and was terrified. I drove my wife back to the site immediately. She answered questions and showed me right where everything occurred, in sequence. I could find no evidence of a place where an airplane would have crashed or flown and nothing appeared out of the normal.

I was grabbing boxes out of my moms vehicle since we just moved. We moved into the deep country, so I know I didn't see an illusion or anything. What I saw was a large, glowing orange ball of dim light. There was(what I thought to be) a rectangular shaped craft floating some ways above the orange ball. It was to the right of the orange ball, hovering vertical to it. Then the rectangular craft slowly floated vertically towards the orange ball. Then the orange ball floated slowly away, then took off faster than anything that I have ever seen. That is when the rectangular ship stopped, and began floating over my house.   As it turns out, the ship was a huge triangle like ship, with three lights at each point. The light in front was blinking blue, and the two in back were blinking red. The craft was completly silent, except for a small buzzing noise. It flew over my house at about tree level, so it was very close. Then it turned right, and began flying away from my house. That is when I noticed that the craft had three massive rocket looking things on the back, which were glowing a dim, bright, neon color. Of course, I ran inside of my house, telling my family what I just told you. My family is of the skeptical type, and me and my brother are the only ones in our family who believe in this stuff. So then I ran back outside, to see that it had turned back, and was flying over my house again. I ran back in the house, searching for a camera, to find out that it hadn't been packed yet. When I returned outside, the craft had disappeared. I don't know what it was, all I can say was that it was very strange.

This sighting occurred while traveling in a car southbound on I-57 some ten or fifteen miles north of Mattoon.  My speed was maintained at or near 75 mph throughout the incident.  Skies were clear.  Over the span of about five minutes, I gradually became aware of an unusually-bright whitish light visible intermittently through the trees at about my 9 o’clock position.  It must have been blinking in and out, since the roadside woods do not obscure the eastern horizon continuously along this stretch of road.  Eventually, this phenomenon began to strike me as something extraordinary, and I focused my full attention on it.  Soon I came into a long stretch of road where the horizon was clearly visible.  The light had nearly the hue of a sodium lamp, but was much brighter—more so than Venus, and comparable in magnitude to that of the incandescent landing light of a large aircraft viewed from a mile away, but having a much different quality.  It blinked intermittently, sometimes flashing with a period from 1-5 seconds, sometimes remaining visible for 20 or more seconds at a time.  The appearances and reappearances did not occur instantaneously; rather, the brightness grew continuously over a short period of time, say one third of a second.  Shortly after coming into the clear area, this light was joined by two more showing identical behavior with regard to blinking in and out of view, etc.  Each light was associated definitely with a certain area of space—that is to say, after disappearing, a new light would appear very near to the original location, so that the impression given was of three separate objects translating through space and periodically flashing in and out of visibility.  During this entire incident, the lights (when there were three) showed what would be interpreted, had they been connected, as a slow counter-clockwise rotation, the motion of each light relative to the stars not exceeding about 3-5 degrees per second.  This seems to indicate that they were either near and transla! ting wit h my vehicle at about the same speed (which seems unlikely, as they were extremely bright, but did not at all illuminate the fields and tree lines past which I was driving) or that they were far away and moving at some unknown speed.  The formation of lights occupied about a thirty degree sweep of sky, extending from 20 to 50 degrees above the horizon.  After about two to three minutes with three lights visible, all abruptly blinked out of existence and did not reappear.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,39.4885,-88.35959999999999

Macadam Road maybe a couple hundred feet west of Ridge Road, Chazy, NY. Exact date may be a week sooner or later, not too sure of that but it was early samll game hunting season then.  3 of us were bird hunting in the area and it was getting dark fast. Done, and heading home, we stopped just to watch flocks of ducks landing in the (sanctuary) ponds to the south/south west of our position on the road. Overcast, maybe 2,500 feet with a steady wind from west as I remember.  During some of the joking and talking, I saw bright magenta (red) light descend straight down, unaffected by wind and with no smoking trail or sound, to the ground by the pond in front of the tree line slightly to the west of where we were looking and maybe 1/4 mile away, a good guess. It was a brilliant light with kind of a haze surrounding it. Size is hard to say...maybe from basketball to large beach ball in size. As it got closer to the ground it actually slowed down and the light turned off. I assume it was on the ground in tall grasses etc. That is when I mentioned it to the others because they were looking back in my direction as I recall.  Maybe 5 minutes went by, after swapping a few more stories, I saw the light turn on again and pointed at it...this time all 3 of us saw it ascend straight up, very fast, no sound, no smoke, no wings, no rotor blades, nothing but brilliant pure silent magenta light accelerating into the clouds, seemingly immune to the effects of the wind. Now that is what got my curiosity going, you know, something coming down and soft landing then, later, taking off at an incredible speed all with no sound and in a wooded/marshy area. We were close enough to hear ducks making noise but that thing was silent.  The other 2 weren't all that interested after seeing it, and I never thought about it again until a few years ago. As a former pilot I can say that it did not look like aerodynamic flight and so I do not know what it was. Thinking about it now, that was not a good 'alternate landing site' for any aircraft for any reason.  I wasn't sure whether to report this old sighting or not, I am sure of what we observed then, just don't know what it was.

I'm fairly certain this was in 1976. It is similar to the sighting in Thousand Oaks posted for 1/15/76. Simi is just a few miles from Thousand Oaks. It was a warm evening, and I was out in the front yard with my parents. I was about 14. We were just sitting there talking and enjoying the evening. I was looking up at the sky and the stars and saw something in the sky to the west.  I'll describe it as a light, because that is what it would most closely resemble. It was more like a grayer area of the sky, but translucent enough to see the stars through it. The frightening thing is that it was shaped like the typical ""devil face"" outline complete with horns and a grimacing mouth. At first we thought it was being projected by one of those big searchlights they used to use for grand openings, etc., but there was no beam of light visible coming up from the ground.  My dad was working for Rockwell at the time, but not up at Rocketdyne. He was trying to figure out what was causing this quite obvious shape in the sky, and was getting pretty upset. My mom was just quiet and looked scared. We watched it for about 20 minutes, and it never changed or moved in any way. I don't know what size it was, but it was bigger than my hand as I held it up .  We watched it for awhile and then went inside. I was assuming there was some logical explanation, and we would read about it in the paper the next day, but as far as I know, nobody else saw or reported it.  Even stranger, about a month or so later, I was outside with some friends at about the same time, and was telling them about what I had seen, and described the shape. One of my friends pointed up and said ""do you mean like that?""....and there it was again, in the same place. We all watched it for a few minutes, and it gradually faded and was no longer visible.  The only indication I have ever had that anyone else saw this was a drawing on the cover of a ""Weekly Reader"" type newspaper they used to hand out at school. The paper came out a year or so later, but had an article about UFO sightings, etc. inside. The cover drawing depicted a night sky with the exact same shape in it, and I believe whoever drew it must have seen the same thing as I did. It was accompanied by the caption ""Are We Alone?"" or something similar. I kept that copy for many years, but can no longer find it.  I believe the poster from Thousand Oaks saw the same thing or something similar. I asked my parents about it a few years ago, but they don't remember it at all. Strange.

It had just become dark (around 9 pm, the time we had to be back in our parent's sight)and my friends and I had begun settling down for the night on the front porch and were repairing our bicycles after a long hard day of BMXing and Evel Keneveling. We had our bicycles under extreme maintenance and one of us lost a small part in the shrubbery around the porch. One friend went down two doors to his home and returned with a 12 volt sealed beam lantern. We were looking for the part for several minutes and then found it.  As I got up and walked out on the sidewalk in front of the house, I looked to the east and noticed this bright light hanging in the sky just behind the very top of a tree. I said nothing and went back to my mechanic duties when my friend noticed it a few seconds later. She asked if that was the police helicopter that had frequented our neighborhood on regular patrol during the summers. (We would run out in the street and wave at the pilots and they would blink the carbon-arc spot at us to say hello. Those were the days...). Curiously I looked again to see if that was the same light I had noticed a few seconds earlier and it was. I said that if that were the helicopter, we would here it as close as it was like we always did. My other friend, with sealed beam flashlight still in hand, turned it on and shined it on the ""object"" through the tree top. I told him I didn't think that was a good idea, but he being a year older (15), over rode that idea and did it anyway.  At this point the ""object"" slowly moved out from behind the tree top as if to get a better look at us or our light source and just hung there quietly.  He turned off his light, and about 2 seconds later the ""object"" began to move and he shined his light on it again and it stopped. I excitedly told my other friend to get our parents and she ran in and only returned with her mother.  She saw the ""object"" and assured us it was an airplane or our helicopter friends until we questioned her as to where the moving BEAM of blue-white light was and pointed out that the white light was WAY too bright for normal running lights on an airplane, it was WAY too low to be an aircraft of any kind without making noise or kicking up dust.  It was not until my older friend  said, ""...and watch this."" as he shined his light on it again and it began to slowly move (east) our way that she was convinced and noticeably shaken when he turned off the light and the ""object"" stopped! Here she nervously ordered us all in the house (mine being the closest)and to my parents surprise who thought were playing jokes. She also told them something strange was low in the sky and relatively close but they, still showing no interest chose not to investigate. We all four returned to the porch expecting it to be gone saw it still quietly hanging in the sky right where we left it.  We studied it for about 30 seconds when it began to move north. My older friend again shined his bright flashlight toward the ""object"" and it stopped once again.  We were all beginning to become concerned at this time when it began to resume it's northward course along a north-south street but slowly gaining altitude until it got to which is now by my estimation, 50-60 feet above the rooftops.  My older friend tried to chase it on his bicycle for a closer look and my other friend and I scaled a brick swimming pool fence and stood atop it to get a better look as it flew off over the neighborhood and sped out of sight within 1 or 2 seconds and disappearing after making an extremely sharp turn to the west. My friend's mother then used our phone to call Memphis International tower to see if anything was flying around our area. After what seemed to me to be about 15 minutes on the phone with them they said they could find nothing unusual. She retold these events to my parents as we kids returned to the front porch hoping it would come back but as far as I know, none of us ever spoke of this event again among ourselves or to anyone else. I'm just wondering if I am the only one that remembers this now.... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I did not have the courage to tell anybody about this and I was looking for the proper authority to whom I will relate everything that me and my friend saw that night. Me and my friend watched a wedding dance party that night and were walking in a dusty road about 1/2 kilometer from our house and when we reached the perimeter of the elementary school I heared a high frequency noise like the hissing sound of a blank cassette tape and I thought it was the stereo player they used to play music in the wedding party but it was already far from where we were. My friend looked back at me and asked me if I heared the noise. We looked around but there was nothing but darkness all around because there were no lighting posts in that place. Then I heared a very low frequency sound but not loud. I stopped walking and I looked around once again but saw nothing. We were already in front of the metal gate of the school when suddenly I looked upwards on my left side as the sounds came from and there, I saw a very big object which was moving or flying very slow and very low. The object was round in front and pointed at the rear (as it moved forward on its round part). It was not revolving and it moved in a straight path. I saw that there were lights, some bright red and some were like phosphorescent lights like the ones emmitted by the numbers of a watch. The lights were like those of a valve in a valvestate amplifier and they were not blinking. We stopped and sat on the dust trying to hide in the hollow-block wall while watching the object moved slowly towards the western part. Then when it was on top of us I saw the rear lower portion openned and two smaller flying objects came out of the openning and the 2 objects flew very fast towards the eastern part and the two flying objects emmitted a light blue color. When the two smaller objects returned they were flying very low and theyu were almost touching the leaves of the sugar canes and they stopped afloat in the middle of the plantation right in front of the school. It was very clear to see the objects even it was very dark. They measure more or less like four passenger buses placed side by side and thay did not make any sound. One of the objects protruded something like a mechanical arm and it reached for the dusty dry soil and seemed to bury itself in the ground. We hurriedly jumped to the other side of the wall and peeped through the holes of the designed cement blocks of the wall. I saw the mechanical arm uprooted some sugar canes and brought it inside an openning. Then the two objects flew towards the big thing and entered into the openning. The big object moved in a vertical path higher then it stopped afloat. The lights went out and it did not move while remaining afloat in the air. The form and details of the big object became clearer as it moved upwards. Then it started moving sideways towards the north still in a very slow phase by that time it was soundless. The light turned on and grew bighter and brighter until it was very painful for my eyes to look straight into the object then suddenly it flew in an unbelievable speed toward the west and disappeared. The following day me and my friend went back to the sugar cane plantation to see the place where some were uprooted but in our surprise there were no holes or diggings in the site.

That area is pretty much all farm country, and at the time there was at least 8"" of snow on the ground from a previous snowfall. The night was clear and very cold...around 20 degrees Fahrenheit.  I came to a stop at a remote four-way intersection, and sat at the intersection, and carefully looked both ways for traffic. While looking to the left, a circular light suddenly appeared on the snow, as if someone was shining a spotlight straight down. The light was approx. 30 feet in diameter, and was about 150 feet from my position.  There were no houses in the immediate area, and there was no sound being made. I was driving my winter car, an old Camaro, and the curvature of the window restricted me from looking up to see the source of the light, and the window handle was broken, so I couldn't roll the window down in order to put my head outside to get a better view.   At this point I sensed that something very strange was happening, and pretty much floored the accelerator to exit the area as fast as possible.   When I got to work, I was relating the incident to a few of my co-workers, when another worker (an off-duty policeman) arrived and announced that his police radio was bristling with reports of strange lights and ufo's all over the region.

Even though I was in first grade, I knew what ufo's were from watching Project Blue Book television show.  We both immediately thought it was strange that something soo big made no noise and was able to hoover like that.

It also had a green flashing light on the right side and a red flashing light on the left side - making it appear like a commercial aircraft.  However, that was not possible as the vehicle was traveling WAY TOO SLOW and Low. It made NO NOISE, possibly a very faint hum for 1-2 seconds.  No engine, jet, or turbo-prop noise whatsoever.  We typically see the ""Dash 8"" fly over from time to time and we can hear it coming.  NOT so with this.  The positions of the lights made the vehicle appear to be triangular in shape.  I would estimate its speed well under 100, more like 50 mph.

Thought maybe it was a chopper, but then the lights were spread apart a good distance like an airplane wing so that was not possible.  Then no noise.  My 10 year old son was with me, who also enjoys watching the sky for airplanes and he remarked, without my saying a word, that it appeared to be triangular in shape.  I was in complete denial at this point!  Upon arriving home I searched for ""slow, low, silent moving aircraft"" and came upon the tons of articles on the flying triangles.  This surely had all the makings of one.  Oh yes, one additional item I noticed, the flight path followed US RT. 6 - no question on that one.  It came from west to east and I could see from the top of the hill that it was following Rt. 6 and after proceeding to our home, could see it in the distance - flying the same path that US 6 takes.

I had at this point told my friends to take a second look at the light and we were all baffled as it repeated its strange movements, the strangest patterns were the perfectly verticle upward and downward motions of the light, and it was close enough to see that it was not a plane, or a car driving with its headlights on over the mountains.

The road I was on headed straight towards the light that seemed fixed in the sky and as I kept driving (about 15 seconds or so) I realized that the light was no longer on then horizon, but now in my local area not more that a hundred yards in front of me and had transitioned from a yellow/golden light to a what appeared as a physical object with lights. As I continued forward I noticed a blue blinking light similar to an airplane, yet the object was completely stationary in the sky (so much so that I thought it may have been the lights on a radio tower, but I knew there were no radio towers in this area.)  I ended up driving almost directly under it and noticed there were more lights. I noticed about 5-8 different lights of different colors. They where blinking in unfamiliar patterns, not the standard, regular, repetitive way an airplane’s lights normal blink, but they seem to blink faster with irregularity much more swirly and flashy than standard airplane lights (like an artistic light show).

It was dark out and the object appeared to be black and in the shape of a triangle and about as long as a city bus. I passed the object and could not view it anymore as it was a behind me.

I cannot remember the time that night that this incident happened but if I had to guess i would have been around 2 am of april 17th... I woke up to my boyfriend screaming: ""What the F--- are these lights?  And he got up out of bed immediately, he almost jumped out of bed literally.  He became very pale and disoriented.  I opened my eyes, and I saw an amazing event happen right before my eyes..  From what I can remember there were about two solid ""fire ball lights""  in a perfect circle the size of about 3 tennis balls.  and they were moving around in such a synchonized pattern, almost a pattern of something that existed all on its own.  It had sort of a magnetic movement...  The balls were moving very fast in a circular sideway motion and they would leave a trace of light behind, which made an amazing design in front of us..  It only lasted for about 4 to 5 seconds and then it completely dissapeared.  The lights were not on the wall or on the ceiling, they were floating in the middle of the room.  Now, there are no open windows in the room, they are all covered with blinds and dark curtains.   So there is absolutely no possible way that they were being reflected from outside.  I also heard a few knocks in the door, but my boyfriend says he did not hear the knocks.  After this happened, he ran outside and saw nothing.  My heart rate went up for about a whole hour after this incident and he could not go to sleep.  He described this adrenaline rush the whole night.   Then my cell phone messages were all messed up.  The saved ones: it kept on saying that they were no longer there. But then later it came back. This is the first time i actually saw something like this in my life, and I think is absolutely fascinating.  I wish it would come back so that I can really figure out what it is. Maybe it will.   I know 2 other people who actually saw the same thing that night , strangers, and the reason I know they werent lying is that they actually were the ones to tell me the date and describe it into details...

Approx 2 years ago, I was driving home in Decatur, GA. I saw what I thought was a helicopter hovering about 25-35 feet above the road.  I slowed down as it had a bright light shining. I thought it was a police helicopter searching for a suspect and given the proximity to the ground, I thought they had him cornered.  It was so close it looked as if it were going to land, so I slowed more.  Not hearing any noise, I opened my window and noted that there was still no helicopter sound nor the strong gust of wind from the blades and there were no police cars around or sirens.  Realizing that it was not a helicopter, I quickly sped up as I passed underneath while looking back (sideview and rearview mirrors) I traveled about 40 yards, and it was gone.  I then drove down and made a u-turn and looked back, nothing. I sped home, about 1/4 mile away and scanned the area, and nothing was there.  I got my son's telescope from inside (about 30 seconds to get) and came out and surveyed the area especially in the direction of the police station where the copter is kept. No helicopter, no lights, nothing.  ITS APPEARANCE: Since I was looking for it to be a helicopter, my description will not be that good.  I noted it was large but cannot give dimensions but I could appreciate that it was blocking out more sky than it was supposed to be.  It easily spanned 2 lanes and had height.  I recall a bright light and seem to recall three, but at the time, I thought it was the police with a searchlight so I focused on 1 light and where it was shining.  I only became suspicious after noting that neither it nor my surroundings were behaving consistent with a closely hovering helicopter and it was too big.  No trees were blowing either. visibility was clear.  No clouds.  It was behaving as if someone was steering it.  Were that not the case, it would have struck the tall trees or poles near it.  Unusual movement:  Its movements were smooth and it moved side to side slightly.  BTW I drive that way daily and looked for anything else that c! ould explain it.  I stand by my conclusion.

I them followed them to the point they would meet and saw the lead fighter jet. It was lower and much closer then the rest. It was almost over head. That is when it got strange. In front of the lead jet was an object. It was a very light pink color. It was as light a pink as the sky was a light blue. If the object were to have shifted color to as light a blue as it was pink you would not see it. With that being said. This object was traveling east to west. The lead fighter jet was right on its tail. There was no exhaust coming from this pink object. There were no visible lights. It seemed more organic then metal. its shape is hard to discribe. It was like an hour glass with it's ends pointed, but the middle was not as narrow as an hour glass. It was flying across the sky and went behind some clouds followed by the lead jet. I waited hoping it would come visible again and then ran into the resturant to find someone, any one to come out and look. This only took seconds. When I returned outside I scanned the sky but the clouds blocked any further sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I first contacted the Center for UFO Studies in Chicago in 2006. I am reporting it here because I am still perplexed by what I saw. It was a clear Fall evening in Silver Spring, Maryland and I was reading a book in my den.  The window shades were pulled up and the windows were open because it was a relatively warm night.  Above the treeline, I spotted what appeared to be a star or planet that seemed to be unusually bright.  I glanced at the object from time to time between reading the book and listening to my teenage kids who were home at the time.  I grew slightly intrigued by the object because it appeared to be hovering while the other stars seemed fixed in there locations and an occassional plane would fly by in the distance.   I thought it may have been a helicopter but the there were no red lights, blue lights or search beams that I associate with helicopters.  Downtown Silver Spring is an very urban area located 5 minutes from Washington, D.C., so helicopters are not an unusual sight at all. The object disappeared below the tree line and re-appeared about two minutes later. I called my then 17-year old daughter and asked her to look out the window and tell me what she saw.  Her first words were, ""what in the world is that?"" She stated that the lights were not like anything ahe had seen.  And, she was right.  The lights were white but had a halo effect that seemed to indicate that they were pulsating. There was a slightly bluish tint to them also. The object appeared to be 500 ft above ground level not even a quarter of a mile from the the house.  For 25 minutes I watched it(my daughter did not want to watch it anymore)hover, glide horizontally, rise vertically, but never leave the area.  Suddenly, it began to glide towards the house (I say glide because it was not flying like a helicopter or a plane.)   I called my father who lives six blocks away and asked him to go outside a look in the sky and tell me if he saw anything unusual. He said he wasn't sure but there were so many stars out that night.  While I was talking to him the object glided above the corner lot located two houses from our house.  It then glided over my neighbors house at tree-level, probably not three hundred feet above ground.  I was amazed at what I saw.  It was a black triangle about 3/4 the size of a football field. It was definitely a solid object.  It made absolutely no sound at all.  I know this because it passed over my roof while I was outside in my front yard.  Again, it was a very clear night.  It then disappeared, I guess that is way I can describe it but I don't know.  Let's just say that I could not see it anymore.  I called my newsroom and local stations. No reports had been received. The next day, I approaced my neighbor and before I could say anything she asked me if I had seen the object.  She stated that she had never seen anything like it and, in fact, she and her friend tried to follow it down our street but it vanished in the sky.  Again, I have no idea what this object was, but it was an experience I will never forget. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

This happened last winter while I was delivering papers for the Anchorage Daily News.   I saw the same craft if not another that was identical to the first sighting on atleast 5 diffrent nights.  Four of the sightings were in the same location and around the same general time of between 1;30 and 2;00 am.  The fifth sighting was in a diffrent location and was about 45 minutes earlier .  This sighting was due north of the usual location of the sightings.   The craft was this night traveling south from north and was traveling at the same steady speed and about the same altitude.  The speed I would judge was about 20 to 25 mph and was silent of noise or vibrations.  If it was a painted craft it would be of a black color.  It had white lights that strobed on the outer end edges of the rear part of the triangle with a solid burning white light in the front point of the triangle.  It was a bit brighter I think than a normal landing light on a plane.  I saw no green or red light as one would expect to see on a normal plane indicating port and starboard. The thing that was of intrest to me was that if it had been just another 45 minutes later the thing would have been over the same area that i usually saw it for the previous four times.  As it happened this night I was running a bit early and therefore was in another part of town.  The area of town is with housing additions and very thick wooded areas in between them.  There i a mountain ridge to the east of the area about 4 miles away.  To the south is the town of Palmer and the Matanuska River and the Knick River and the Knick Glacier and the rough and rugged  Chugach mountains.  Every time that I saw the caft was always the same altitude and speed and was traveling from north to south, no noise  heard.  I tried to take a photo of the craft but my digital camera was not the best in the world and is only 3 mega pixels and did not make it worth saving.   I am 38 years old and have had experience as a Captain in the Oklahoma State Guard and my fathe! r was a police officer and Chief of police and I have had experience in observation from many points of view during my life and I have explained this to the best of my ability.

And I could just hear it as if I was in a little room with a radio turned on loud.It just sounded like something was hover around.It was so weird, I wanted to look out the window but I just couldn't get up, I don't know if it was my mind that just was scared to find out what it was or if it was something else. All I could remember is that Loud sound but at the same time it was silent..I don't know how to explain it and there was a white light that'd go pass my window, I had blinds so I couldn't see out it.This was going on for about 30-45 mins.I was thiking it was just a car but that sound couldn't possibly come from a car, I've never heard it before and what about the light, it just sounded like it was hovering around really fast then just staying in one spot. Anyways I don't really remember much or how but I ended up falling asleep.. Then likean hour later it happened again, That sound ringing in my head just woke me up this time I woke up scared, not cause the sound being loud in my head I don't know what it was, but I woke up and just sat there listening to that sound hover away.It was weeks later maybe a month I was hearing it again. Weird my dad had just got up to pee(it was night time),I told my dad about my weird headache and how it sounded like something was outside my window! , I'm su re a UFO that I've never heard before such a sound like that staying in one spot, I was telling him maybe I need to see a doctor cause that headache was just, not normal. Then we got into some other conversation completely off subject then all of a sudden I started hearing that sound again.

I got up, made a pot of coffee, and went out to sit on the porch.  The moon was big and bright in the south east.  I turned off the 'street' light to better enjoy the moon.  Then I noticed it.....just about 1- 1 1/2 inches to the right of the edge of the moon.  My first impulse was to think of a plane, but it had too many lights for a plane.  Then it began to sink in that it was not moving. I reached for the binoculars and began watching it.  It appeared big. It had either blinking or rotating red and white lights.  There may have also been some green but using the binoculars I would hesitate on the green. There were 4 each white and red  lights.   They were all in the same horizontal plane giving a 'cigar'  shape impression. Of course they could have been rotating around something. It did not move.  After a bit i began  to perceive slight movement in relation to the moon.....but  it was due to the moon  advancing.  The object was  stationary. After several minutes a most remarkable thing began to occur. The large object began to ever so slowly divide into two smaller objects......as if two attached craft were separating. They ever so slowly parted until they were about an inch apart. After several more minutes they began to move 'outward' from earth.  I say that because the elevation did not change in relation to me or the moon.   this caused me to believe they were going 'away' from me.   I watched them with binoculars until they were out of sight, which was quite some time.   This also indicates they were moving 'out' and away.  The elevation did not vary in relation to the moon.  I watched them for a total of about 30 minutes.

I'm aware many have trouble believing this especially if they themselves have never seen anything.  I'm glad there has alway's been soemone next to me!  I have had less then a hand full of occasions in my life actual telepathic communication involving a sighting and other encounters.  On this particular night I was sitting in my living room and all of a sudden heard the words ""Eric ! Come out side we have something to show you !""  I told my two Son's to get their shoes on as we need to go out  side and see a UFO !   they did so did I.  I for what ever reason knew right where to look exactly   I don't know how I knew this,   I told the boys one 16 at the time the other 14 to look right up there and watch.  My youngest Son for some reason walked back toward the house and looked up at the sky and toward the home away from the scene.  Suddenly  four huge round lights proceeded to turn on  all straight down then three across turned on,  it was sort of like a flicker as it came on i.e.  a florescent light that is aging .   The lights were the size of a nickel held out at arms length possibly a dime.    They made no sound.  My Son watched it just as it was happening and we both had drawn exactly what we saw when we returned to go inside.     Then all of a sudden this light which was the shape of a thumb nail and the same size at arms length had illuminated directly to the left of this cross just as it has illuminated completely  !  This light was about one finger size length away from the cross to the left of the object and it was very bright as if a old style blue flash cube had went off !     Just then the cross began to shut its lights off just as fast as it turned them on in different order .   My Son for what ever reason did not see this part happen,  he may have looked down,  however I never looked away and saw everything !  The Cross was in the Eastern sky and almost directly overhead of my home.    The color of the circle  shaped  lights was white and it was perfectly inline and appeared to be in space , though I really do not have any reference to go by at the time,  only that this is what it looked like.    I would assume if this was a craft it would have to be miles long ! and left us with a sense of Aw  !  This cross was filmed by a Gentleman in South St. Petersburg on the same night as I heard about it on the radio,   he has refused to release the video from what I heard.  He said he was standing out front drinking beer with friends as it appeared and he happened to have his  camcorder.         I had a one plus a digital camera but did not have time to get them out of the box on the ground and did not want to take my eyes off of the cross as it had just finished lighting up and I was waiting for what it would do when the light next to it forced it to shut down .  I had immediately walked back up to the house and as I reached the steps I was hit with a really bad feeling as I felt much disbar about what happened   as if the feeling was sent down to me,.    What I felt like.  there was panic where the cross was and just then a second telepathic message came.  As I walked up my steps I stopped and heard  ""Eric,  we just cannot return  until this has been resolved ""    I remember distinctly hearing my name again as the first word.  I am still today trying to figure out the meaning of this and why it was shown to us or me,  and since it has happened I have not seen or heard anything.  * I have no photo,  although my Son is good with programs and he did a photo shop reconstruction and it is perfectly accurate.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,27.79451493256262,-82.67515963391138

They travel a a couple thousand feet.  This was much higher than that.  To the naked eye it appeared to be large and round.  My first thought was that it might be a helium balloon, but logic told me it was in the wrong place for that, the wrong time of day, and the wrong sort of weather.  The south end of Sunrise Mountain is about five or six miles from my house.  I estimated the altitude of the thing to about 10,000 feet more or less.  I stepped into the house and retrieved binoculars.  The object had not moved.  When I focused on the object I saw it was actually three round shapes fairly close together.  A large round plate was partially hiding another slightly smaller plate behind it at about one o’clock to the first, and a third round plate, appearing smaller yet, at about 2 o’clock to the biggest one.  The relative sizes gave the impression of three objects each at a slightly increasing distances and slightly different altitudes.  They appeared to be dull metallic silver. There were no lights on the objects.  I watched for about a minute, maybe less, and then, through the binoculars I saw all three objects “keel over” in unison by about 90 degrees at which point they appeared thin and flat.  I called my wife and son and, with a second pair of binoculars, tried to help them spot the objects.  However, they wear glasses, are not used to spotting small objects, etc and they never saw them.  In between trying to help my family to see them too, I watched for another couple of minutes.  Finally, the clouds intervened and hid whatever they were from further view.  My house was about as half mile South of the flight path into McCarran Airport. Commercial aircraft continued to land during this time, basically following Sunset Rd into the airport with landing lights on below about three thousand feet.  They and are a common sight.  This was not a helicopter or an airplane or a harrier jump jet, etc.  All three objects were clearly visible and I have no explanation for what they could have been.

Bright Lights on the High-Line,Havre,MT,2005-09-17T22:00:00,fireball,Several Minutes,"Occurred : 9/17/2005 22:00  (Entered as : 09/17/05 22:00) Reported: 12/28/2007 5:36:14 AM 05:36 Posted: 3/4/2008 Location: Havre, MT Shape: Fireball Duration:Several Minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60542.html,"Bright Lights on the High-Line 	Well this sighting time is not exact, as this even has occurred spuratically over a few years after a first sighting caught my attention and sparked my hightened awareness to the lights that surrounded me in my rural montana sky. At the times of these sightings i ranged in age of 17-19 years old. If there is any doubt as to my credibility, i assure you i have nothing to gain from wasting my time with a false report. I am however completely astonished to see that other people in Havre, MT have had VERY similar accounts on dates that i very well could have been seeing the same thing! So i apologize that the dates are not accurate, but the account however is most definately accurate, as i can best recount.  	The most vivid memory i have of these fireballs was not my first, but i must however tell the story of the first sighting of these so called fireball or bright light. So it happened that me and my very best friend, who is also witness to this and a few other sightings, were driving northeast on what would be an unmapped dirt road on a state map, but the locals all know this as a network of back roads connecting local amish (hudderites) communities and leading to the highway that goes to canada. So here we are driving on this dirt road, staring at the stars above and smoking like chimneys just enjoying the company, when we decided we had better turn around as this dirt road goes forever, and we didnt intend on going the full route. Upon turning around and driving for sometime we approached over a hill and i noticed something i definately didnt see going the other way. Now over this hill the landscape evened out, as is common in the hilly area of havre, and i asked my friend if she saw it, and what she thought of it. Open minded as we are, we speculated that it must be a light up on a pole on someones farm. Still stopped we stared for some time at it, it was noticeably brighter and more orange than a streetlamp, or a light on a pole at someones farm might be, just a little fireball with consistent edges that didnt move. However upon careful consideration this light had to be up higher than any light on a pole could be, and way too low to be a star, and too bright for that matter, and too orange. That kind of gave me the creeps, especially that it was hovering in the southern sky, same direction as where i live, and the road i got to travel home alone on. The both of us would recount this story nearly the same, storytelling ability aside, i have given my best memorial account of this event....which led to many other sightings of exactley the same object, and this most noteable one i will share with you next.   	At the time of the first sighting, it  must have been early before winter, as it was cold, or i would have got out, and before there was snow on the ground. However i clearly remember this most memorable sightings season, as there was plenty of snow, and everything was white, making a nice white horizon off in the distance where the hills rolled off into the beaver creek park. This time me and my best friend, again at night, anywhere between 9pm-12am, were traveling on this dirt route forementioned in my previous account, i noticed there were three lights off in the distance, and in the same area as the previous sights to a tee, now i had seen three lights before in a straight line formation, however they never moved. Now this time me and my friend were already stopped when we both realized the lights at the same time, they were going to dance for us. One, two, three lights spaced evenly apart all jumped up, leaving a tail that dissipated, to a higher location, and jumped then to a lower location, that was lower than where they were at initial sighting, this happened rather quickly, the jumps taking about 3 seconds a piece. After each jump the lights would all disappear and then reappear, it was like as the tail faded so did the light. It was a pattern obviously. Appear, jump leaving a tail, disappear, reappear in new location. In that order. Now as they are appearing and reappearing and whatnot, im telling my friend to flash the car lights at them, like maybe we could get a response. To no avail, but it was worth a shot, in my opinion they were obvlivious to us. They did eventually blink out, they did not appear to travel away, as in get further away then closer, they stayed at the same distance away from us.   	Now i grew up in Havre and was always fascinated by its bright sky with so much going on in it, and it was all visible. Over the years there are certain things you see all the time. Sattelites, jets, planets that are brighter on certain days, meteor showers, every cosmic even that goes on in our horizon is visible to us, because thats the beauty of Montana. I say this so that i can distinguish to you that i have the common knowledge to differentiate between something explainable to us, and something that is not. These fireballs are to me one of many things, one is it is possible alien spacecraft, manned, or unmanned, who knows. It could be military training, or military related, as there are Nuclear bombs all along the hi-line from what i hear, not sure if any in the immediate Havre proximity, but theres alot of land out there, and i know of one you can see on the way to great falls. What if those lights are what cause crop circles? I was always interested to know weather or not the local farmers ever had one appear. What if this is actually a craft lifting off or studying something. It could be one craft or many crafts. If its one craft it would have to be a very bright, small craft. If it is one, then it would have to be dark and those would have to be its lights, but im only speculating at this point, relaying what goes through my mind when i recount this memory.  Now i hope this helps other locals out there, and i encourage all to share theyre stories of weird lights over montana. What a perfect place to see a UFO, so clear and so much unused land. Just like new mexico and nevada, there is alot of unused land. Could the government be using it? Speculating again, ahh what can i say to a wandering mind when it comes to matters like this. Thanks all for listening. -Smartone",2008-03-04T00:00:00,48.5666,-109.7389

At approximately 8:40pm on 9/14/2005 as I was leaving my friends house to give my girlfriend a ride home I noticed a high flying very bright white dot fly behind some clouds. I thought maybe it was a satellite dish.  As I was watching it I noticed that it was moving very fast, unlike a satellite or airplane, it was very bright.  After about 30 seconds of watching it I noticed that about 5 more of these started to appear all over the sky all around the same time. These bright lights were moving very fast, all over the place.  About 15 seconds after the other lights showed up an much bigger object appeared. The very large object was bright and slow.  It was not moving near as fast as the small lights, it was traveling slowly, it was dimming in and out. It would be bright and fade out, then get bright, fade out, etc.  After fading in and out for about 10 seconds it completely disappeared, that is when I ran inside to get my 2 friends because I knew this was very strange.   When we were all outside, the large pulsating light was gone but the smaller lights were still in the sky flying around.  About 2 minutes later, the large light appeared again very briefly, disappeared, and was on the other side of the sky.  Surrounding the large light were about 5 of the smaller lights, just hovering around it.  This lasted a very short amount of time and they all started to disappear one by one.  On the opposite side of the sky, the last little light we saw shot out into space at a very high speed until we couldn't see it anymore.  Not even a minute after the last light shot into space, 2 Air Force jets flew  by. I knew these were jets for obvious reasons (lights and sound).  The UFO's had no sound at all. ((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea whether this is a serious report, or not.  The witness provides only an e-address.  We will request additional reports from the other witnesses.

Driving home late one night in October 2005 (around the 15th) with my family we looked up into the sky and saw between three to five circle lights high in the sky.  They were amber-yellow in color and were in a line-like formation.  We stopped the vehicle and exited to get a better look.  We heard no sound and the lights remained in the same location in the sky for a few minutes.  While watching, the lights would disappear one by one and reappear in a different location.  Eventually the lights all disappeared at the same time, vanishing completely.  The reason I am reporting this incident over 2 years later is because today for the first time I saw a show on the Discovery Channel which showed almost exactly what we witnessed.  Before seeing this show I thought that we had been the only people witnessing such an event.  Although the show is taken from 1997 footage I have never seen it before.  The difference from what we saw and the show was that the lights we saw disappeared and reappeared in different locations in the sky. Also, instead of seeing nine or so lights we saw between three to five at any given time.  I also witnessed these same lights at a different time and location while driving home with a friend from a band competition.  It was around 1:00 in the morning and these lights were in the opposite sky (east instead of west).  My friend and I did not stop driving but watched while we drove.  These lights seemed to be moving across the sky in the same line-like formation.  After I made a turn the lights were behind us and a few minutes later we looked back and they were completely gone.  There was also a third encounter with these lights on a different night around the same location as the first where I was alone and saw the same lights.  I was unable to determine if these lights seemed to be individual or that of one craft.  I have not seen these lights since 2005.  All of the witnesses are well educated and do not believe in supernatural beings which is one of the reasons we d! id not w ant to report until now.  I am currently a college student half-way through my second year pursuing a chemistry degree (at the time I was a senior in high school).  My mother is also a college graduate with a B.S. degree in English.  My father is not a college graduate but has schooling after high school.  My brother is a high school student preparing for college. Finally, my friend, the last witness is a college student.  None of us can agree on what we saw and do believe it was something very unordinary. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We were parked right next to the drop off to the Arkansas river and the fence to the little basesball park behind the skate park. We were facing the bridge of Pueblo Blvd as it goes over the Arkansas River. We were sitting there for about 20 seconds before we noticed there was an odd light hovering above the Pueblo Blvd. bridge. It was a bright white light, but the light from this object seemed to only radiate outwards horizontally, diagonally upward, and seemingly upwards. It did not appear that the light could have been seen should you have been lower in elevation than it was in the slightest. The elevation of the craft was approximately the same as our current elevation, as the bridge seemed to be 25-30ft lower in elevation. We could not see what the shape of the craft was. We were amazed because it was hovering directly over passing cars, but those cars apparently were not aware of the bright white light we saw above them and no glare from the white light shown off the cars or the road. It sat there for about 15 minutes, ever so slightly wavering back and forth along the length of the road, and to our amazement no cars beneath were aware of this bright white light above them. Then the light turned off and there was nothing where it had been. About another minute later the white light turned back on, but it was closer to us, over the river, about halfway between us and the bridge it had previously hovered over. This time, there were two more lights apparently attached to the craft. The big white light on top, a small orange light to the bottom right beneath the white one, and a small red light to the bottom left of the white light, just slightly lower than the orange one. All of these lights were round at this time. The white light appeared to shine like a light bulb, in every direction equally, and out of the middle of this appeared part of the light was focusing like ! a spotli ght. The glare from the shifting spotlight effect started at our upper left, then appeared to scan across us to the bottom right, then back to the upper left. I began filming the light with my video phone, and the light moved closer to us over the river. This was the closest it had gotten to us. Just as my 45-second recording ended, we noticed a pair of headlights behind us driving toward where we were, and we watched to see if it was a cop. You're not allowed to be in the park past 10pm, which we were doing, so we wanted to know if it was a cop. Well, it was. We could see the spotlights on it and the emergency light fixture on top. It drove up behind our car and we started our car and started to drive off, the whole time the ufo was still shining brightly, proudly displaying itself over the river. The cop followed us out of the skate park area onto a one way road out of the park with no turn offs. We didn't look back, but the cop's headlights were very bright and very close behind us. All of the sudden the headlights turn off. We look back, and where there had been a cop driving behind us not even 30ft behind, there was nothing but an empty road for about 125ft behind us. There was no where for the cop to turn off and the road behind us was well lit by a street light. That cop car simply vanished.  The next night we returned to the same spot. There was that same light hovering over the same bridge, but this time the light was just slightly dimmer, and the white light attached to the craft appeared to be a pyramid-shaped bright white light that was rotating counterclockwise. Each edge of this pyramid shaped white light seemed to be darker than the flat surfaces emitting the light. Again, while it was hovering over the road it did not have the lower orange and red lights turned on. It hovered over the bridge for about 10 minutes, then the light turned off and it vanished. About five minutes after that, it turned its light back on, appearing on our side of the bridge, but off to the right above the tree line. This time, the red and orange lights were turned on again and the white light was too bright to see the pyramid shape. It kept the same elevation the whole time, but moved around very very slowly over the trees. It then turned all lights off and vanished again. About 5 seconds later, it re-appeared in the direction of the Arkansas river, but at least 4 miles farther away. It moved back and forth for about 15 seconds, then turned off again. About 5 seconds later, it appeared even farther away on the horizon, moved around for about 15 seconds, then turned off again. We sat there for about half an hour and it re-appeared between us and the bridge, over the river, but this time slightly lower in elevation to us. This was the closest it had gotten to us. The red light on the bottom began to slowly increase in intensity, then decrease, then increase, and back and forth. The main white light appeared to scan us again and the craft began moving even closer to us. This time it didn't appear it was trying to scare us off by slightly moving toward us, this time it looked like the thing was coming for us. My friend started his car, peeled out backing up while turning around, then peeled out toward the exit to the skate park area. The white light behind us came right up to where our car had been parked, and m! y friend floored it toward the exit to city park, as it exits onto Pueblo Blvd. The light did not follow us out of the skate park area, it just came right up to where we had been parked and we lost sight of it. At the closest, this light was about 4/5 of a football field away from us. The only thing we could think is that it was a military drone aircraft of some type.  Also, this craft never made any sound we could hear. Both nights it was about 10pm and both nights were very dark with very little star visibility.

It was a beautiful, clear warm night.  The stars were out in full effect and I was looking up to gaze a bit when I caught glimpse of what I immediately thought to be a UFO flying north directly over my house (1 block east of Lake City Way).  It's very difficult for me to describe it's size because there was nothing for me to compare it to in the air.  I believe it was from 1000-2000 feet away from me, moving slow enough for me to watch it for 15-20 seconds.  It had three circular lights underneath it with smaller lights around the 3 big ones.  The lights where a dim yellow / white hue, they weren't shining down, they were just merely on.  There was nothing at all blocking my view from it, but after 15-20 seconds it simply vanished.  It didn't vanish into the horizon, or disappear behind a cloud, nor did it do any cool star wars tricks, it just faded away in front of my eyes.   I should also note that there was no cars on the road near me, no airplanes or helicopters above me and this thing made ZERO sound whatsoever.  It should have been loud as hell the distance it was from me, so it was very confusing to my senses.  I stood outside for another 20 minutes trying to see if it would come again, and in that course of time I saw 2 shooting stars and a satellite way above earth, so I am 100% positive it was neither of those things.  I have always semi-believed in alien life forms, but maybe it's the kind of thing you will never fully believe until you see it with your own eyes.  I know what I saw.  The moment I saw it I knew I was looking at a UFO.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

I've decided to come forth about what I saw (and tried to video tape) because of this specific report. The similarities between our sightings seem very close  However, my sighting was on May 30 2007 and first seen at 19:45 to 20:15 - I observed these for around 30 minutes!  When I first saw this object, I saw only one - then later I saw two. To the naked eye it looked like a very small white sphere that did not move - sort of like a planet. But it looked very different when viewed through the binoculars. At one point while viewing it with binoculars, the center of it suddenly flashed a strange metalic gold.  I tried to video tape this object from inside my home while my camcorder was on the tripod - I could see this object in the East directly above the neighboring trees nearby around 7:45 pm. I started video taping around 7:49 pm. After a few tries (only caught a few bits of it on video), I ran outside to have a closer look at this with my 10X50 binoculars.  After observing it more closely for several minutes, getting a good look at what it was (see drawing ) I then decided to run back in the house and try to tape this again. I grab the camcorder and ran back outside and started to video tape again at 7:57 pm. Again, I was only able to get a few quick shots of this object on video. It was VERY hard to find this in the camera viewer lens of my JVC 25X optical camcorder - and its much to hard to find it on the LCD screen during daylight - and it was too small to pinpoint and focus on the object.  I continued to try off and on attempts at capturing it on video - not easy to do in clear blue skies. I had to use the trees and far distant planes with contrails to help reference about where they were above in the blue sky . The video overall is about 9 minutes (because I would pause for a bit, then try to record through out the video). These objects were observed from  around 7:45 pm to 8:15 pm. The last part of my video records a few frames of both objects at 8:15 pm just before they head up a bit higher above the one huge fir tree then they head NORTH against the 7 MPH winds that were coming FROM the WNW!. I gave up trying to record them, and ran inside to see if I could still see them.. but could not. I immediately checked the weather conditions and it confirmed to me that these were not balloons because they headed away to the NORTH against the winds that night. I also took a screen shot of the weather report at that time.  The video is not very good at all, and I cuss up a storm and at the time of recording these, I could not see them in the viewer lens, and was not sure I even caught them on the video.  After reviewing the MiniDV tape over, I did indeed catch several frames of them as I would zoom in and out where I was guessing they were in the blue sky. I used Exsate DV Capture software to be able to show the date & time embedded on the MiniDV tape. I then compiled image shots from the video in the order shown on the tape and put them together as a swf and posted them online for viewing  - Select from the drop down box 800 to see this in LARGER VIEW:  http://media.putfile.com/PDX-UFOs-May-30-2007  Note regarding some of the images: I also included various shots that shows the trees - or planes in the far background. These are what I was using as a reference point -  I would then try to zoom from those areas to where I estimated they were hovering.  My initial thought of these were balloons.  But when I went outside with my binoculars, I could see these were NOT balloons. And did not act like balloons. But even then, I thought they MIGHT be. But after trying to tape them and observing them for around 30 minutes, while they hovered above in the same general area not being affected by the wind, I realized they were probably not balloons - especially after watching them head away NORTH against the wind. Even after I looked at the weather report and the tape I really did not think it was enough to report this -- that is up until I found the report on your site and decided to come forth about what I saw.  I am just so relieved to read that SOMEONE else in Portland, Oregon saw something similar to what I saw!",2007-08-07T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

Back in May there was a lot of hype about the BLUE MOON & JUPITER coming from SpaceWeather.com 	 At around 10:50 (May 31st, 2007) I went out to view the BLUE MOON & JUPITER.  I was standing on my deck facing the East and slightly South when I saw what looked like a vertical column/vapor/cloud to the left of Jupiter.  There was a something that looked like a star rising up and out of it but then disappeared the higher it went.  To the right of the moon I could see a dim star.   I live in the city of St. Louis and most stars are lost in the night sky for us. This just felt a little weird but I am sure there is a probable explanation. After about twenty minutes I went back out on the deck to look at the BLUE MOON & JUPITER again. When I looked up I saw a small airplane with what I will call a vapor coming out of the back.  It was really up high and very small.....in the daylight it would look like smoke coming out of the back of it like when we were kids......could this have been a crop duster and do they do that at night?  It was flying like an airplane NOT LIKE WHAT I SAW EARLIER. That STAR LIKE object seemed to be rising up and out of the vertical column of cloud.  I know the difference.  I have gone over this incident a hundred times in my mind and yes, I do realize that very often we don’t always see what we think we see but I wanted to tell you about it anyway.  I am 66 years of age but this is one of the strangest things that I have ever encountered.  By the way I did check the news on the computer the next day to see if anyone else reported it but could not not find anything.  Then I rationalized that there were certainly enough people viewing the BLUE MOON that night and surely someone other then myself would have seen it.  So now I am left with the dilemma of what was it if anything?????  Carol  From SpaceWeather.com…..  BLUE MOON & JUPITER:  Tonight's Blue Moon has a companion: Jupiter.  All night long, the giant planet will be located right beside the Moon.  You can see them with the naked eye or, for a real treat, scan the pair with a backyard telescope.  Behold the moons of Jupiter, lunar mountains and craters, and maybe even the Great Red Spot: sky map. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

There were no airplanes flying within the immediate area that I could see, and the total time between taking and reviewing the photo to looking back at the skyline was no more than 15 to 30 seconds. Because the craft is in such poor focus (compared to the buildings in the photograph) I believe it was much larger than it appears and in motion at the time the photo was taken. This assumption is also based on the fact that I do not recall it being in the frame as the picture was being taken.

My ex-wife and a friend of ours were driving on highway Ga. 441 going south at around 10:00p.m.when we all observed what we thought initially was an airliner about the size of a 727 in a nose dive into a pasture on the east side of the road.The speed and angle of its descent made us believe that a loud crash was imminent so I slowed and stopped the car in the road since there was no other traffic. We heard nothing. Our friend, who was in the back seat said ""there it is"" and pointed above the trees that bordered the pasture about 100 yards off the side of the road. Above the trees,at about 100 ft. from the ground an elongated black triangle with a light at each corner floated noiselessly.One light was green, one red,and one was yellow. The red light was shining down into the trees and moved as if looking for something below. We observed this for about 2 minutes and decided that we did not want to be whatever it was looking for so we left. This was a clear, star filled sky. The aspect of this event that puzzled us as we discussed it on the way home was the speed of the object's descent and how it came to such an abrupt stop in mid-air. We dropped our friend at his residence and went to ours. My wife and I were pretty spooked and got no sleep that night. For some reason we never discussed this further; within three weeks we broke up, got a divorce, and have had no contact since.

It was a warm summer night in Cape Canaveral, FL.  No moon as I recall, the sky was very black and the stars shone brightly.  My fiancé at the time (now husband of 22 years) and I were stargazing on the beach off of Lincoln St. on the boardwalk.  To the left of us was Kennedy Space Center, to the right of us The Pier.  I would also like to note that there were no launches that night.  Since I grew up in Cape Canaveral this I would have remembered along with seeing these objects.  Suddenly out of no where there appeared a very bright light that seemed to change in colors.  The object hovered above the ocean just to the right of the Space Center.  It would move in and outward, then it would appear to rise in the sky and drop suddenly and stop.  It moved in directions that I have never witnessed before!  It made no sound that we could hear, only the oceans waves were heard.  A second object then appeared and both of these moved around almost as if following each other, then at other times they would be doing different things.  One would be moving towards the beach and one would be rising up or down above the ocean.  We both have never seen any aircraft move so effortlessly in a manner that these objects did.  My husband and I both asked each other if we were both witnessing the same thing, wondering if we had lost our minds!  We watched the objects for probably a good 15 minutes doing it’s dance in the sky.  Suddenly the first one or lead object seemed to move in quickly at us (but still kept a distance away), like it knew we were watching it, then backed off to where it was then in a flash both of them were gone leaving what seemed to be a streak in the dark sky where they had moved so quickly out of our site. Not a trail, but a streak that vanished in a second!  Over the years we have told many of our friends of our experience, but never thought to report the incident until I ran across your site.  I have looked to see if others perhaps saw these objects that night, but did not find any.  Since I can not remember the exact date I will have to estimate it.

This craft of some sort came out from behind the left side of the apartment building.  It was hovering low but it made no sound.  It moved super slow and seemed to be there forever.  Long enough for all of us kids to go get our parents and they were standing out there looking at it too.  I don’t remember if I walked closer to look at it but it seemed to me that if I had stood on the block wall that circled that apartment complex I could have touched it.  I think it had lights that went around the edge of it.  I don’t remember what shape it was just that it was dark and like nothing I had ever seen before.  I don’t remember feeling afraid or in danger.  I can’t even remember it going away or if it was there so long that I lost interest.

I’ve waited long enough, so here is my sighting and I hope someone else saw it or can help me figure out what it was that I saw. 	It’s been awhile, springtime in 1986 and I think it was past mid April, and I must admit, I don’t recall the exact date, but it didn’t seem to matter at the time, the weather was nice. The place was a back water slough at the south end of Plumas Arboga rd just past the over pass of highway 70 in what is considered part of the town of Marysville California. 	My younger brother, his friend and my cousin ( all about 16 years of age) went cat fishing at a jack slough that evening around 17:30. We were on the east side of the slough which ran north and south, and would be facing east while we fished, ( towards Beale AFB at that) and were gathering firewood before the sun went down. 	My cousin was next to me and suddenly sid, ""Hey you guys, what’s that?"" I was hunched down toward the east getting ready to start the fire, and turned around and looked back toward the west. The sun just went down past the levy and the sky was clear, there was a little glare, and when I first looked back I didn’t see anything. My brother and his friend started yelling, “what is it, what in the hell is it?” I looked at them and realized they were looking almost right over our heads, I looked up and I saw a glowing sphere, approximately 3 feet in diameter, about 10 to 12 feet over our heads! I was in awe as I quickly began to rationalize what I was looking at because I am skeptical when it comes to this kind of thing, but this was not ordinary and it was right there in plain, clear site!. 	It was a round bubble looking sphere, transparent, with a small bright glowing light in the center. That outer perimeter of it was slightly glowing because of the small light from within it. It was moving dead east about 2 to 3 miles per hour on a straight course for the AFB. It did not make any noise, did not move up or down or side to side, just straight and very steady. The younger boys were getting excited and kept asking me what it could be. I kept staring, watching it almost every single second, and paid attention to everything that was happening to the best of my ability. 	It moved steady over the water, I believe the cooler air would cause some sort of fluxuation or rift with any man made floating craft especially something so small, but nothing, straight it went. There was a reflection in the water, and a shadow as it went over the opposite side and towards the opposite levy from us. Over that levy was nothing flat, plowed up farm land as far as the eye could see, and I knew it, so we ran south toward the bridge, went eastward over the bridge and watch it float over the field. We didn’t know what to think. We watched it travel slowly for about 10 more minutes and  then, without a sound, about ¾ of a mile away, it curved  up at 90 degrees and shot away! 	We talked about calling someone, but, couldn’t come up with anything that was going to sound serious or rational. I should have called anyway, and I regret it to this day. 	But it didn’t stop there. A few days later, my cousin, who lived across the street, and about  75 yards from the first sighting, called on the phone screaming for me and my brother to get to his house right away, the light was back. 	We ran as fast as we could, and when we got there we could hear him and his mother in the back yard, so we ran to the back yard and there it was, the same sphere, floating just  like before, over his fence, over the small field, over the levy, over the exact spot where we first saw it, over the slough, the east levy, over the field toward the AFB and then disappeared just like before. 	To my knowledge, it was never seen again. I will send some images via email. Thank you for your time. ps I was 23 years old.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,39.1587,-121.4726

I was driving home from the Los Verdes Golf Course on the Palos Verdes Peninsula during the summer of 1986. Truthfully, it has been so long that I may be off by a year or so on the date, but it was the middle of summer. LVGC is on the west side of the peninsula, near the top of the hill above the Pacific Ocean. The time was about 5 pm or 6 pm and the sky was clear and sunny.  As I began to drive down the hill towards the ocean on Hawthorne Blvd, I noticed a strange flying object, near the cliffs on the water. It was moving slowly, no more than 20-40 mph. The position of the object was south of the Point Vicente lighthouse by about a mile or two. The object was very angular, oblong and shaped oddly which is why I believe that I noticed it at all. We were used to seeing small planes, helicopters and the Goodyear Blimp flying around the peninsula.  The thing I witnessed was not any of those. It did not appear as if it should be able to fly. No wings, no rotors, no jet engines (it was not disc shaped either). As I drove down the hill, I had a pretty good look at it, but it was probably about a mile or two away (as a crow flies). I have attempted to sketch what I saw in the ""1-2 miles away"" drawing. This first half of my sighting lasted about 15-20 seconds. Then as I was driving down the hill I lost sight of the object behind fences and houses.  Once at the bottom of the hill, I pulled my car into the Safeway parking lot and got out. I had a really good look at the thing for about another 10-15 seconds as it flew between some hills. My second sketch depicts a side view of the craft. Again, this view showed the angular construction of the object but this time it was closer. The color was dull gray. I could clearly see rectangular, opaque panels on the side of the craft. A notched cutout was visible on the bottom near the front. No lights at all were visible but again it was still very light outside. It was moving slowly at low altitude, no more than 500 ft up.  I have never submitted a report of this incident. Back when it happened, I absolutely expected that I would soon be reading about it in the newspapers. Nothing was ever reported that made the news, at least not that I saw. I am still amazed that a bunch of people did not see and report this flying object. The only thing peculiar that I can think of regarding the location of the object was that it was near the old NIKE missile site up on the hill. This NIKE site was converted and now houses city government offices. During the twenty odd years that have passed since I saw this thing, I have never seen a picture of a UFO on TV or otherwise that looks like what I saw that day.

In the center of this object, stretching horizontally across the object, the lights emanating from the object changed colors frequently, and one could clearly distinguish that this was not a star or planet. My boyfriend and myself both noted that this was not a star or planet from it's slight movements, and the line of lights which changed colors, and noted that it was not like any aircraft which we normally see from where we live, because of it's movements, and sometimes the lack thereof.  We heard no noise from this object. I began cooking supper, but occasionally checked back on the object, which was there several times when I checked on it, but eventually disappeared. One interesting note, in another account of the January sighting, the person witnessed the UFO on the 15th, we witnessed it on the 19th, however, the witness was on HWY 301, which is not far from our house.  We live on Cahoon Rd, off Normandy Blvd, which runs into, and ends at HWY 301.    Normandy Blvd., Jacksonville, FL 32205  This incident can be verified by my current boyfriend of 4 years.  I did notice several conventional style aircraft flying in the same area that night which may be able to substantiate this story further.  .....................................................................................  2) The electrical assault incidence:  This may sound very strange, but on my word of honor, this is the truth, and did in fact happen. In 2003 or 2004, my memory escapes me as to which year exactly in which this occurred but, one afternoon I was washing dishes at the same address as the above incidence, and I was alone in my house, as my live in boyfriend was at work.  I became aware of a strange frequency which I could hear which seemed especially 'targeted' at my right ear.  This frequency was a lower pitch than the frequencies I normally pick up on from time to time, and seemed strange that it seemed 'targeted' at the right ear, instead of being heard by both of them.  What was also strange was this frequency was also felt as well as heard.  As I experienced this frequency, I also experienced a strange sensation in my head, almost like a slight stun to my brain.  Though I found this to be quite odd, it did not become unpleasant until a few seconds later when from this frequency I suddenly experienced what felt like an electric shock to the upper right side of my head, which felt like I was being zapped by a stun gun!  This immediately brought me to my knees!  After about a minute, I returned to my feet, (quite startled, scared and somewhat pissed off), only for this to happen once again! Immediately after somewhat regaining my composure, I grabbed a pistol and searched the house for an intruder and a possible explanation, but I discovered that I was indeed alone in the house, with the doors locked.  I had never before experienced anything like this, nor have I since, however I am now quite frightened when I hear frequencies. I debated with myself the idea of calling up the military to see if they were doing some kind of military weapons testing using frequencies, but declined to do so, as it dawned on me that they probably would not tell me the truth, and them knowing I would sue them for testing on me, I figured that it probably might not be a good idea, as they could (and would), probably kill me by zapping me, if they chose to, rather than being sued, if this occurrence was a result of military testing.  I also pondered that this may be UFO related, as I have had 'other' strange occurrences happen in my lifetime, which I suspect could be UFO related. I have no answers or explanation as to who is responsible, or why this incidence happened, but would truly would like the answer to this.  Have you ever come across any instances like this in your research?  If so, would you please share them with me?  Any input on this is greatly appreciated! .....................................................................................  3) Time loss incidence #2:  In early spring of 1997, I was traveling from Louisville KY, on my way home to Jacksonville, (I lived on the Northside of Jacksonville at this time, but was spending time with my boyfriend at the time, who was a mechanical engineer working in Louisville, while my best friend stayed at my house, held down the fort and cared for my dogs.  One of my dogs was in the pound, and I went home to rescue my dog.) I had stopped at the Pio-Ono (GA) exit on 1-75 late at night, to get gas and coffee, before leaving the parking lot, I put in a fresh 90 minute cassette tape, of some recorded music, (45 minutes per side), which had CCR on one side and Aretha Franklin on the other.  The tape was rewound before I left the parking lot, as I used 90 minute cassette tapes to help 'time' the trip. I got back on I-75 headed south, (I was quite sure of this), and was on my way down the road.  In what seemed like just a few minutes back on the road, I went to take a sip of my coffee, and it was cold, at this point I knew something was weird, as I had just bought the coffee moments before, and it was quite hot at the time, and I take creamer in my coffee, and powdered creamer does NOT dissolve in less than hot liquid, yet the creamer in my coffee was perfectly dissolved.  I then became suddenly aware that the tape I was listening to was well into the other (Aretha) side, and I had not changed it! I kept going on my journey to spite the strange occurrence, pondering an explanation.  A few moments later, I discovered that I was not traveling South as I was sure that I was, but was headed North instead.  (I was starting to weird out at this point). I got off the next exit, and turned around, and started heading South again.  It took me about 20 minutes to reach the Pio-Ono exit once again, and it was at this point, that I understood that I had experienced another time loss episode.  I later told my best friend, and boyfriend (at the time), about the incident, which you can contact both of them concerning this. .....................................................................................  1996 UFO sighting, Jacksonville FL:  One evening while sitting home enjoying an evening alone, (no boyfriend in this incidence LOL, and this event took place at my Northside Jacksonville residence, the same one as the incidence above), I was lounging on the couch, listening to music, and I happened to look out the window at the night sky, and noticed an object fitting the exact same description of the UFO in the #1 sighting in the sky.  I observed it just hovering there, moving slightly up and down and sometimes back and forth growing sometimes dimmer, sometimes brighter, and changing colors.  I realized it had to be a UFO. I watched this object for a good half an hour, when my roomate/friend came home, and I told him about the object.  He checked it out, agreed that it was probably a UFO, and after a while, he went to his room, where I did not see him for the rest of the night. I watched the object for a while longer, and suddenly it just disappeared like a light being turned off! This can be verified by my ex-roomate.  .....................................................................................  Time loss incident #1, Jacksonville, FL, 1994:  About 10:45 PM, I went to the convenience store to fetch a soda and a pack of cigarettes before the store closed at 11.  I lived on Deerfield Lane in the sticks off of Starrat Road in North Jacksonville.  This was the only store for about 5 miles, and wanted to get there before the store closed.  This store was only about one half mile away from my home, so the entire trip usually only took 15 minutes tops, even if I stopped to chat with someone, or their was a line, etc.  It was the norm for me to put off making the trip until the last minute, because at the time I was writing a book, and was very much caught up in the process of doing so. When I left, my boyfriend Brian, was sitting in the recliner watching TV.  This too was the norm, as he would retire for the evening customarily after I made my evening run to the store. I went to the store, got my RC and smokes, and headed back home as usual.  When I returned home, the lights in the house were dimmed, and the TV was off.  I thought this very strange.  I started feeling quite spooked for some strange reason, which is NOT the norm for me.  I walked in the door, and there was a very pissed off Brian waiting for me interrogating me as to where I had been!  Of course, I thought he had lost his mind, as I had just been to the store and back as usual. I asked Brian if he had lost his mind, and explained/protested that I had just been to the store and back as usual.  This infuriated him, as he said that I had not been just to the store, that the store has been closed for hours, he began ranting and raving about how he went up there looking for me, I was nowhere to be found, how he called my best friend, blah, blah, blah, and pointed at the clock and said it doesn't take 3 hours to go a half a mile to the store, blah, blah, blah, and proceeded to have a conniption!  I looked at the clock and it was after 2 AM!  I then thought that he had lost his mind, AND was picking a fight with me, that he had moved the hands on the clock. He then tells me to call my best friend Brenda, and let her know I got home safely.  I did. I found out then that Brian had not moved the hands on the clock, that in fact I had a strange and unexplainable time loss eppisode.  (I'm still not convinced that Brian had not lost his mind though, from the conniption he threw.  I then nick named Brian, ""Flyin' Brian"".  LOL.)  Brenda had been very worried about me, as was Brian. I could not explain what had happened during that time, but after that, everytime I had to travel down that stretch of road between the convenience store and home, I was terrified, though I could not offer any logical explanation as to why! Shortly after that, I began having ""nightmares"" in which I could swear I was awake, and these things were happening to me.  I would pinch and even slap myself to make sure I was not dreaming but.... I would 'dream' that I would be awakened by a presence in the room.  I would get up, look around and sometimes there would be typical greys, sometimes no 'seen' being was there, but a presence was felt none the less. I would try to wake up (Flyin') Brian, but never could wake him up when this happened. In this dream, I would wake up, and get up and look out the bedroom window into the field out back which was covered in blackberry briars, and sandy Florida soil, with dips in it, where it was not exactly driveable, and see lights like 8 or ten vehicles lined up outside, complete with dust and sand flying up, in this field.  I could swear that I was awake, but apparently this was a dream, because the next day when I would inspect the field where the lights were, no vehicle tracks were apparent, nor were the blackberry thickets matted down.  This was a fairly regular occurrence.  And like I said, the field was not exactly drivable. Brian and I broke up not long after that, and to this day, I refuse to go down that stretch of road. This incidence can be verified by my ex-boyfriend Brian, and ex-best friend Brenda as well.  .....................................................................................  Fall 1986, UFO sighting, New Bern, NC:  One evening in the Fall of 1986, I went country cruising with a friend and coworker and we decided to take a break from riding, and parked in the Croatan State Park just East of New Bern, NC, and not far from Cherry Point Marine base.  Yes, we had parked to smoke a joint, as hey, we were in our mid-twenties at the time, and to just talk.  (I am now in my mid-fourties, and no longer smoke weed.) As we were sitting in my friend's truck smoking the tater and chatting, we noticed an object, that again matches the description and maneuvers of the other UFO's in the above instances. Both of us, having lived in the area for quite some time were quite aware of the aircraft, military and otherwise, which flew regularly over the area.  This was NOT the normal aircraft which we were accustomed to seeing, and no, the pot was not especially spectacular either. The next day, there were articles in the paper about a rash of UFO sightings seen across the US and the world. This can be substanciated by my friend.  About 6 months, maybe less before this incidence, my mother told me in the strictest of confidence, and after much prying as to what was bothering her, that she was hearing 'signals' one night, kind of like when one hears frequencies, only in something like Morse Code. My mother lived directly across the street from me, and I did not hear them.  My mother never drank or smoked a tater in her life, didn't take so much as an aspirin, and was a very honest, Christian woman.  .....................................................................................  Fall of 1978 UFO sighting, Hendersonville, NC:  About 2 weeks before I was to be married, my mother and I were sitting up discussing ""if I was sure I really wanted to get married or not"" mother and daughter speech.  It was a pleasant night, and we were sitting on the couch with the lights off, and the windows open to her 2nd floor apartment. Mom alerted me to check out the object in the sky.  The object, again matching the same characteristics and maneuvers as the ones in the accounts stated above, only with the slight difference, that there was one large one, and three other smaller vessels which moved about in the sky around the larger one.  They would move in directions that clearly differentiated them from any aircraft we had ever encountered or knew of, and would change colors in tandem with the larger craft. Sometimes these vessels would hover in a triangular pattern around the main vessel, and at times zig-zagged about, or go straight up and down.  We watched these crafts for about 25 minutes, until all of a sudden they took off at tremendous speeds.  We knew from the speed they were traveling, that these had to be UFO's. Unfortunately, my mother is no longer with us to substantiate this story, she died in early 1987 of a rare disease, sideroblastic anemia.  My ex-husband however, can substantiate that Mom and I told him about the incident.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,30.266904680969628,-81.6163728336584

Monadnock, in the air and moving very slowly.   Right away, we saw one object, and then another, pop out of the first object and fly off to the east until it was obscured by the dorm called Cheshire (the event took place in the rear parkinglot at Franklin Pierce college.   Other students noticed us looking up in the sky and quickly the object drew a crowd of about 4 boys and three girls, with other students gazing at the object as they walked by.  Most of them were drunk, both I was absolutely sober.   Some of the girls started to freak out because they were scared and walked away.   Me and my roomate tried to walk as close to the object as we could but we estimated it as at least 3 to 4 miles away.  Originally, my roomate said this object flew right over his head.   The objects that popped out and flew away happened very rappidly, and seamed to have yellow contrails they left behind them breifly.  They seamed to be white and yellow in color.  We ruled out it being a star, a plane, a planet, or a satelite.  We went and got a camera but by the time we got back the object was so far away that we couldnt focus and get a good picture becuase the object looked like a star or a plane in the distance.   The object we assumed was some type off unidentified military object or possibly a extraterrestrial object.  Eventualy we watched this object get too far away and it was not discernable from any other stars in the sky.  I happen to think this event was military related.  After a while I noticed many (5 or six) other craft that looked just like the first object, but were staying stationary and very far apart ( 5 miles) and seemed to be flashing red , white and blue lights in successing order.

It looked like there were spikes on it (the spacecraft) and it was moving fast toward a company near our house.  Then when I tried to get my celphone with a camera and when I came back out it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2006-05-15T00:00:00,,

I enjoy going out to the hammock and just relaxing for a while before going to bed.  But on this night I looked up and saw a sky full of stars so I grabbed a patio chair and decided to recline in it and just stargaze for a while.  The hammock is under trees and I’m unable to see the stars from there.  One very bright start caught my attention and I had been focused on it for a while when my partner came out to join me a few minutes before 10:00 p.m. EST.  He reclined in another chair and we talked about how clear the sky was.  We saw a couple of shooting stars and made remarks about them but I kept going back to this very bright star.  As I lay back focused on this one particular star it just vanished right before my eyes.  I didn’t say anything at first thinking a cloud may have covered it but then I noticed a very faint light, possibly a satellite, moving across the sky from south to north.  As I continued watching this faint light it intersected exactly where I had seen the star.  At this point I commented to my partner that the star I’d pointed out earlier had just vanished.  As I continued to look in that area of the sky I noticed another faint light moving, this time from north to south and again it intersected the point where the star had been located and continued to move across the sky till it was out of sight.  My partner noticed this moving object and we wondered if it was a satellite.  There were no strobe lights, nothing bright about it.  It resembled a very faint star moving pretty fast across the sky.  Within 2 minutes of the star vanishing before my eyes and seeing the two faint objects moving across the sky we both saw a crescent shaped object moving from northwest to southeast at a very high rate of speed.  We both pointed at the same time and said, ""Do you see that?""  It seemed to be an amber color, very dimly lit and no running lights or strobes, it just seemed to glow.  My partner wondered if the light was reflection of the towns light on the underside but as I mentioned earlier, this is a small town and it’s pretty dark.  I couldn’t estimate the altitude although my partner said it appeared to him about the height of an incoming passenger plane.  It was so fast as it flew above and completely silent.  I was still curious about the disappearing star and the other two objects that when I saw this object it was a complete surprise.  From our view point it we were able to clearly see it for about 5 seconds before it was beyond our viewing range.  I kept putting off this report but the sighting is something I think about everyday.  It’s still very clear in my mind.  I still go out almost every night before bedtime and I spend my time looking to the sky.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,40.9812,-76.9587

The tree tops were swaying back and forth and my initial thought that it was a helicopter. As I approached the object closer there were bright flashing lights and was a saucer about 15 feet above my car.

PD))    In reference to the above report, I cannot say whether it is a serious report or not. However, having lived in the Central Florida region for about 20 years, I can say that many strange things have been seen along State Highway 60 and US 441.  I have seen things in the Polk County and Osceola area many times and so have others I know.  This area is desolate cow country as well as farming areas growing sod for new homes and crops.  The most desolate is between Lake Wales and Vero Beach, Fl. On the east to west 60 route and north south 441 area between Lake Okeechobee and Holopaw, Fl a small community where 441 meets 192.  Highway 60 and 441 intersect at Yeehaw Junction.   I would also like to add that south of Lake Wales on US 27 in Avon Park there is a military area known as the Avon Park bombing range.  This past spring south of Lake Wales in the direction of the Range, I noticed lights the same as those seen over Phoenix several years ago. The duration of the sighting was about an hour and I was not the only witness.  I should have reported it then, but I think the out come would have been the same.  They did not fall but where stationary, at times all lit, at the same time in a flat arc, and at other times the lead light would extinguish and immediately the rear light would come on.   Prior to this formation, all the lights were traversing through the night sky but staying in the same general area.  As I recall this was between 2100 and 2200 in late April or early May.

Three sailors disappear off Australia Great Barrier Reef, amid unusual circumstances. Australians still puzzling over yacht mystery (DPA)  23 April 2007  SYDNEY - Friends and relatives of the three crew members of a 12-metre catamaran found adrift last week off the Great Barrier Reef on Australia’s east coast have not given them up for dead.  Despite authorities giving up the search for survivors, loved ones said Monday that they hadn’t lost hope.  “We’ve got family over there,” the wife of one of the missing sailors said. “They’re chartering boats, they’re going out looking, ... and we’re going to find them.”  When the Kaz II was found Friday, the sails were up, the engine was running, a laptop computer was on, the table was set for a meal, and three life jackets and the emergency beacon were still on board - as were the wallets and mobile phones of the three Perth sailing chums.  No distress message had been sent.  Adding to the mystery were neatly folded clothes at the stern of the luxury boat. The only sign of distress was a tattered sail.  Police said they thought the men may have fallen overboard during a storm eight days ago and ruled the chances of finding them alive almost zero. The search was called off Saturday.  “This is one of those cases in which there has been a lot of speculation, but there is nothing to indicate other people were involved or there may have been some kind of crime,” Townsville police spokesman Warren Webber said. “We can come up with various ranges and hypotheses and theories as to what may have happened.”  A forensic examination of the boat and its equipment has not unravelled the mystery.  Sailors point out that a table laid for a meal and neatly folded clothes don’t jibe with the rough seas that Webber says may have tipped the trio overboard.  David Dellow, a Townsville sailor, told Australia’s ABC Radio that he suspected the boat had been boarded by pirates.  “How do you get three guys to disappear at once?” he asked.  His scepticism about a weather-related catastrophe was echoed by Whitsundays Yacht Club chief Jeremy Cooper.  “Even two is explainable, with perhaps one going in after the other. But three? You just can’t imagine why that would happen,” Cooper said.  Credit:  Khaleej Times Online, April 23, 2007.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,,

He said that they weren't sending off weather balloons but he did recieve a report of a similar object 2 weeks prior from someone in a nearby community. My best explanation for the object is that it was an airplane moving away from my direction which gave the illusion that it wasn't moving and that it appeared to fade away when it got far enough.

I just got off work and stopped at my folks house in Carson California to pick up my son. Carson is about 18 miles south of down town Los Angeles. It was about 5:30 PM on a weekday in July in 1978 or 79. My folks house is in the suburbs with curbs, gutters and alot of homes.  As I pulled up in front of the house an old friend pulled up accross the street to see his family. We stood on the sidewalk talking. It was a perfectly clear afternoon with a strong breeze, no clouds and a real blue sky. A blue sky is very important to me. There were several kites flying real high in the sky. As we were talking I noticed that one of the kites was very high. I point out how high it was to my friend but he looked and didn't see it. He always had bad eyesite so I just let it go. While talking I kept looking up at this one kite. It didn't act like a kite. It didn't bounch around in the sky like a kite, it just stayed still in one spot. Then it quickly came down lower. I told my friend the string must have broke. He looked but still didn't see it. Then the kite starts moving from spot to spot in the sky. It moved real fast. I said to my friend this isn't a kite. Then I noticed it kept changing colors. It changed from light gray to dark gray, almost black. My friend still doesn't see it. Then it hit me, this is a balloon. It's a silver gray balloon that is not fully filled and the wind causes it to change shape and the dark color is really shadows on it. Then it dropped down lower and I could see it. It was not a kite or a ballon. This flying thing was about 1500 feet above Carson High School and I'm about 1/4 mile south of the school. The sun is in the west and I'm looking north. I can see it clearly. It was not as long as a fighter jet but was wider. It made no noise or so little I couldn't hear it. This thing is 3 sided. Best way to discribe it is if you took a football and cut it in half from end to end. Now throw the bottom away and just use the top half. Now flaten out the sides so they meet at a ridge on top.The sides and bottom are not flat but slightly convexed. So this thing has a bottom and 2 sides with a slightly pointy front and rear where the sides and bottom come together. It was odd shaped. It is mostly a shinny gray. There are no windows or joint lines that I could see. There are no visible lights but there are light and dark gray lines that move from end to end along the sides and along the bottom. These lines look like gray bar codes that randomly move quickly and slowly from end to end. That's why it looks like it changes from light to dark and also seems to have shadows at a further distance. So here is this shinny gray thing rippling with gray bar code lines in plain site and my friend can't see it.  He's squinting and I'm pointing to no avail. Then it takes off straight up and out of site. About 10 seconds latter it comes back. This time it is a little lower then before and a little clearer to see. My friend can't see it. I can't believe he can't see it. Half of Los Angeles has got to be looking at this thing. It is in sight for about 30 seconds slowly turning from side to side. Then again it goes straight up and again out of site, never to be seen by me again.  5 to 10 seconds later I saw 4 military type fighter jets fly over Carson and go straight up in the air after it with after burners roaring. There was no way they were ever going to catch this thing, it was far faster then the jets. I ask my friend did he see the jets? He said he did. I watched this thing for about 5 minutes.  I checked the paper and watched the news for days but nothing was ever reported. Haven't seen my friend in many years, bet he probably still thinks I'm crazy and until about a year ago, I had my doughts. Why did the military and apparently only myself see this thing? I think my daughter unknowingly figured it out. She is an artist, a painter, she mixes and creates colors for her art. I have blue gray blindness. I only see certain shades of blues and grays. Most of the time, I only see grays. To me, the sky is mostly gray with a hint of blue on occasion and only on a few days out of the year do I see a bright blue sky like the day in question. While talking to my daughter, she said that I am missing alot by not seeing the different shades of blues in the sky. Then it hit me. It's not only what I don't see, it's also what I do see. This thing in the sky, it wasn't gray it was probably blue and the bar code lines, they were probably shades of blue not shades of gray. This thing could camouflag itself to the sky. That's why my friend and everybody else couldn't see it when it was in front of them. The military saw it with radar. I saw it because its camouflag colors fell outside of my color spectrum because of my blue gray blindness. Maybe on a grayer day for me I wouldn't have seen it. Its grays to me would have blended together to a camouflag but on this day with a bright blue sky, it stuck out like a soar thumb. Over the years I've learned not to talk about the stuff I see in the sky like this thing and the other stuff because people do look at you like your crazy. On this day I know what I saw and it was real. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date in July 1978 is approximate.  PD))",2006-07-16T00:00:00,33.83698671328672,-118.25955594405595

About two hours into the trip, I heard a loud noise and had the sensation that we were being hit by a semi-truck.  At that point, time seemed to stop.  However, there was actually no ""real"" noise that I know of, and we were not in an accident, as I had felt.   As soon as I felt things return to normal, everyone in the car (there were five of us) turned to each other and asked ""what just happened?"".  Everyone in the car had felt the same thing I had.   I remember my parents were somewhat concerned about feeling like time had stopped and immediately checked the clock, but it was the time it should have been.   Can anyone give an explanation for what could cause this sensation?  It has been a long time, but it still perplexes me.  It would be nice to finally have a reason behind this phenomen.

We had been at my late mum's friends house which is about 10 houses away from ours these gardens are bigish so the its eye view clearly but not a 2 second walk. Anyway we was leaving my mum's friends house heading east back up the street towards my home at the time,i will just add to this our house took forward on a bend the street was straight until the end where it bent and left our house at the top eg if you turned and headed down the street you would crash into our house if you went dead straight and not followed the bend. We was walking the birds where singing noise of cars etc in the distance this wasnt a busy street just a street on a estate in a village close to the countryside.so we could easy here summer noises the sun was shining and it was bright and by now the sun was at the side of us. As we walked all the noises stopped enough to make us aware and glance round it was as if all had stopped there was a absoulte silence. this went on for about 10 seconds until still heading towards our house feeling a little strange by it all when from nowwhere we all saw three missile shaped objects about well roof level aganist a 2 floor house and my parents house at that one went straight throught he roof and the other above only just and the other at slighty lower than the roof one but along side the house these where travelling north direction  moving at about 10mph at a size of about two buses in length and a double bus height made which looked a metallic material and of a dark metal colour these where shaped as a missile but with large fins one near the front a smaller a top one and a back one maybe more but the angle could only see these.and no noise and no flames etc the one which went through the house went straight through like a magician walking through a wall. They carried on until they went out of sight from us behind the houses on or left then all returned to normal to noise the wind which also had seemed to still at the point of silence. So we ran towards where the had flew hoping to see them from behind but they had gone no sign of them all was normal.With this we ran back to my late Mum's friends house telling my mum and friend about it with as expected oh right well done attitude.But we asked them about the stillness and they hadnt noticed anything. When myself and my brother and friend reset off back towards my old house all was normal and when we entered our house all felt normal and looked that way to strange. If anyone asked about was it aliens hey i dont know but my not knowing opinion would be i would say human the design shape metal colour looked human made how do i know this i dont just a what i think.maybe a dimesion shift or time travel silly thoughts more like, but kept me wondering all these years maybe i will never know.

We were firing artillery that night and I was on the Observation Point along with a number of other soldiers.  I cannot remember how many objects we saw that night but I am sure of one.  The object appeared at a high altitude.  It was a crisp winter night with little or no moon.  All of the stars were quite clear.  I am used to looking for satellites in the night sky.  I was a COMSEC Officer with the 1/230 Field Artillery Battalion.  Along with Forward Observers on the OP were a number of Active duty evaluators who were assigned to our unit for evaluation.  The object caught someones eye and soon we were all viewing object.  Each of us trying to find an explaination.  The object which appeared as s small star in the sky just kept moving in very bazaar movements.  It zigged and zagged but it seemed to stay overhead.   Of course we were on a very important military base and all considered it some kind of spy satellite.  It seemed to looking at us.  The movements were so unusual that we had to call it a UFO.  Some thought it might be a weather balloon.  No balloon would stay in a pattern such as the object that night.  It was not a flight path of any known flying objects I have ever seen nor my fellow soldiers many of which had years of active duty.

UFO sighting back year between mid 80's early 90's  This sighting had to have been mid  80's  early 90's I dont know the exact date but I was a young boy at the time living in harlan, IN. on Mayhurst Dr. street very end of street on left side was the house I lived in with my family my childhood first home until we moved not far to a double story house on st. joe center rd.  you can see on a google map the road and the cementry circle satellite view on map street is mayhurst rd. at end of street left house.  Harlan Indiana look for post office use map zoom in you'll see a mayhurst rd. with circle  that was were we lived at  cementry next to it which was a little spooky. but this I know without a doubt happened for real. I know because the behind our back yard 2 neighbors were standing in the driveway looking straight up at this thing.  it must of done something to our physci or memory  because we all saw it including my mother she remeber's but only slight trace's of the memory  the best I can recall and remeber is seeing this thing floated or hovered silently about 38 feet above the ground at about house level it come across the corn field and stopped directly in plain view out of our back yard just above backyard's neighbor's house or gravel drivewayop level it made no noise was a classic circular on sideview all around the disc shaped craft was perfect circle lights going around counter clockwise in a timed unison every circle that light up was a different color like red green orange blue white It seemed these counter clockwise flashing of lights which was flashing half a second or so probably had to do something with its propulsion of the craft it was clearly not of this planet I tell you like an anti gravity craft something I never have seen.  While staring at this craft with awe I remeber I looked back at the sliding glass door from back porch and my mom was looking at it too, I then  looked and 2 of my neighbors from the house's driveway it was hovering above with these flashing lights  going around and the 2 neighbors were standing directly below it pointing and marveling at the bottom of the craft. The ufo was a brownish color like metal.  this ufo had to of done something to our memory because the only thing we could remeber next was it fading away in the distance hovering at an unknown rate. I drew a picture of it to my mom's friend but we were all like in a state of denial or something but it really happened! This thing was for real I know what i saw but god i wish i had had my mother take a snapshot with the poloraid camera we had back then you know the instant flash  and picture. It was so weird but happened and I guess its one of those things when you see something like that you dont think of anything else rational or think of getting the camera because all you can do is stare at this thing that is really there but you cannot believe it.  messes with your physci because your brain can't register what you are seeing as normal or  rational but it's there. I'll probably never ever see another ufo in person again because it is  so rare but I know this was real and happened maybe if I had hypnotic recogoniction or something  I could unlock the rest of what I saw but can't remeber it happened id bet my mother's life on it  that this was for real.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,41.2268,-84.8741

It seemed to circle around the objects which where flying in a ""V"" pattern. The objects had just passed over us heading SW when I entered the yard and appeared to be about 500-1000 ft. in the air. There was no noise the entire time. I looked back to the NE where the objects had first caught my wifes attention. I then saw one more by itself it moved oddly from N to straight south then back north about halfway where it started from and then shot across the sky in the direction the other objects were heading. The light from the edges was an amber/orange color. I would never have believed it if I hadn't seen it. I have seen lights over Phoenix before, but never anything like this.

As it began to clear the trees, the consistency of the lights without flicker and movement made it clear that this thing was not high, but to my best guess, maybe no more than 10k.  It didn't move fast at all but the strangest thing was it had zero deviation from its heading, and never even until it had passed out of view made any noise at all.

I was outside taking a break from my work place and standing by the parking lot facing south / south-west. From this vantage, I regularly see distant aircraft on their approach or take off from LAX. This time I saw an elliptical object about 40 to 45 degrees above horizon level. What got my attention was that this object was black, or at least some really dark color that looked black. The day was pretty clear, as in very little haze or smog as well as very little wind. The black object was moving in a steady line from left to right. It was difficult to tell the speed, since it was difficult to tell the distance. However, I do believe it was at least a mile away if not farther. There is another building several yards across the parking lot, so I could not get any distant reference. It did seem like it’s size would be of a large helicopter (maybe a little smaller than a Chinook, but bigger than a corporate Bell) and it’s speed would’ve been comparable at that distance. At first glance this is what I thought it might be since I couldn’t think of any other type of aircraft which would be so black and not looking like a plane. What changed my mind was it’s sudden flash of white light.  At first I thought it was a reflection of it’s surface from the sun – something I see often from other planes out of LAX. The light was very brilliant white like a large star in the bright, clear blue sky. After about 6-8 seconds, it flashed again. This I thought was very odd, since the reflection off the sun should only happen once unless the object reversed which of course which it did not. After another 6-8 seconds it flashed again. The “shape” of the flash outside of the flare and halo, seemed to be square-ish, as in having right angles. Like that of a light reflecting off a flat mirror or glass. The light was also large and seemed to cover at least half of the object -- the right half from my POV. The reason I’m able to tell you the details of the light is only because it continued to flash in what seemed regular intervals. This was the second most outstanding thing, because at that point, I walked to the middle of the parking lot trying to figure out how the flashes were possible. The light was brilliant and large – nothing like I’ve seen from any aircraft. If it was the sun’s reflection, then the only thing I could think of that would cause regular-interval flashes would be if the black object was rotating in some fashion catching the sun’s rays in each rotation. If it had continued on it’s way and I lost sight of it, I probably would not have sent this report in, since I have never seen what I would consider a UFO before even though I had been interested in the phenomena. The reason I am reporting this is because of the most outstanding point of the event: with the last flash, maybe the 6th or 8th, the black object disappeared. Simply vanished. I actually laughed at this because it went against normal reality. When I was watching the object, I was trying to make sense of it: a mylar balloon, or something highly reflective. I've never seen or heard of a highly reflective balloon that was that large and black and traveling in a nearly horizontal fashion at that relatively low altitude. But not even a balloon simply vanishes from one second to the next. I scanned the nearby sky around it and stood there for another five minutes, but never saw it again. I could not make out any trail or debris, or anyting. The black flashing oval was unique enough, but to have it disappear completely is truly something I can’t explain. There was only one person I saw walking down the parking lot at that time and he obviously was unaware of anything. By the way, my background is in photography as well as film (cinema.) I also took a flying course in Colorado when I was younger. I believe I am highly aware of what many types of aircraft, from large and small planes to helicopters and blimps look like. Especially living in Los Angeles, we have all of that traffic in the sky. I am also quite familiar to atmospheric distortion and light conditions, so I don’t think I was seeing something that could easily be explained away. Thank you for this opportunity for me to report.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,,

The one on the left would get as bright as the moon or brighter and the other would come close to it as if to become one.

The image of flashing bodies of light all of which emit whit, red, green/blue flashes in each body.  I am familiar with Jupiter and some of the other mention of celestial bodies that do this, however cannot find any documentation on the reports that I reviewed concerning the area of the south east coast of Florida.

The have no speeding movement however do have a formation.  such as that one body forming an iscosoles (sp) triangle, semi circle bowl shape or two triangles, and also by ""connecting"" dots.  I have seen them form a wave like the 'approximately' sign on a typewriter key.  On several occasions laying on my back on the beach there are clusters of them up to the number of single lights, 12 forming all the designs I have mentioned.  They are completely well defined as still compared to moving air craft, as I mentioned before they move quite slowly when they deminish as they are moving what appears to be away from me, or are easily shrouded by cloud cover but remain after the cloud is gone.  All of them do sparkle as you have described as 'light hitting a diamond'.   The colors are all the same with my eye anyway, red, green, green/blue white.  they do flash however side to side.  They do not have a starburst effect.  They are easily seen with binoculars and the flash is side to side on all of them.

As I was looking at them the lights seemed to flash or pulse I guess because the lights never went out, they just brightened up and back down very quickly. They went right down the line, the two front ones (north lights) then to the next set and then to the last (south side). After the last two brightened, all of them disappeared into on single light that took off to the north, very, very quickly. Looked like a shooting star, but much much faster. I mean, real fast. Within a minute of this, I heard jets or other familiar sounds of aircraft in the area. Not right after I witnessed this, but within the minute. There is a military base nearby and I have witnessed many planes in the sky, but I could not explain this ad had to tell someone.

He thought the star was a ufo and to comfort him, I looked for other stars to point out. I pointed to the southwest sky and sid that there was another one. Upon looking though, I noticed it was changing changing colors from blue to red to white etc. He even asked why it was flashing and I told him that it was probably the effects of the atmosphere...what do I know, it sounded good to me.

He told the guy that I'm working with that it was changing colors from red to white to blue, and I said that was exactly what I had seen. On monday the 21st, I saw Bill and asked him about it. He said that it was in the southwest sky, and then I knew I saw what he had seen. He said that he looked at it through a telescope, and that it was surrounded by five other lights that would go on and off intermittently. He said that it had moved at one point also.

As it climbed overhead, it began to fade, until there was nothing left to be seen… ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the source implies a nighttime sighting.

There was also an orangie-redish haze above and below the craft. The craft levitated for about 2 min., moving up, down, left and right. After it executed this manure, my Ipod shut off.

At about 22:00 hours, I observed a blue, pulsing light begin to emit from the forest floor about 7 miles to my northeast, northeast of the town of Pe Ell.  The light was low in intensity at first.  However, the light then lifted off the ground to an alititude of about 600 feet off the forest floor.  The light it was emitting became very brilliant and lit up a section of the forest below it in excess of .5-1 square mile.  Using my binoculars, I could not make out what the light was being emitted by.  The light faded from bright to dark, then back again.  Then, the light simply stopped.  Overall, the event lasted about 10-15 seconds. I did not say anything over the radio to the other workers in the area.  Soon, another worker asked if anyone else had seen the blue light.  I answered up and we skeptically compared notes.  We had observed the same event. Fifteen minutes later, or around that amount of time, the light reappered in the sky and again began to flash a high intensity blue light.  The light then moved quickly to the forest floor and through the trees the blue light could be seen, pulsing an amazing blue/white color.  The light again disappeared after about 15 seconds.  The other worker again witnessed the event. Another 5-10 minutes went by and the light returned in the trees, although much dimmer this time.  The light began to gain altitude, to about 1000 feet.  The light flashed, then circled up into the night sky, flashed again, and was gone.  The light circled counter-clockwise as it ascended.  None of the other workers had seen the light and the two of us that did see the light have been taunted since, albeit very friendly, about how we must have been on some type of illicit drug that night. Two days later, while stopping to get gas in the town of Pe Ell, I walked into the local convenience store.  I struck up a conversation with the attendant and she told me the following, regarding some type of search and rescue operation: The night before, a hunter, in the woods south of Pe Ell, observed what he thought was a meteor hit the ground near his location.  The meteor was not moving very fast as it descended.  It hit the ground and began to emit a blue light.  He got closer and the object began to flash a blue color.  He left the area and called 911.  Two deputies arrived, took his story, and proceeded to the area.  They assessed the situation and called for backup after observing the flashing blue light. A friend of mine called the dispatch center and asked what was going on.  They advised a plane had crashed outside of Pe Ell, but they were very vague about it.  Some type of search and rescue operation was underway.  Access up the logging road was restricted to police only.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,46.5704,-123.2974

The base is on a plateau overlooking several small towns and a few other small Forward Operating Bases.   Looking out to the northeast, (where we have seen many other sightings as another I described earlier), I noticed several small beams of light barely noticeable by the naked eye.  We are aware of what military/insurgent operations in the area and what types of signs might be present.  Looking the night vision and heat sensitive optics, we could see them.  With the heat-sensitive optics, not as much.  Myself and the fellow Marine tried to shrug it off as just lights placed by locals or even coalition forces that perhaps we were not aware of.  But through night vision, the beams appeared to go up to an extremely high altitude, and near the base had a glow, as noted vaguely through heat-sensitive optics.  There were two-four beams at any given time over the early hours of the morning.   As we had to stay aware of base security, we couldn't focus completely on these but they were intriguing.  I'm not placing the fact there could be a largely logical reason for these, but it felt weird, and the beams of light had weird characteristics.   This was months ago and I have just found this site, and it's hard to recall all the details, but I do know that they faded sometimes, and would come back brightly at times.  This was only really visible through night vision equipment.   And the areas that the beam on the ground was focused gave off heat and a bright glow, and was in areas not completely populated. The area is not like Baghdad, it is mainly vast desert and spotted farmlands and towns.   This was very bizarre to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

When he looked up it moved to the back of the house.  When he went to the backyard the light hid behind trees as if it did not want him to notice it.   He looked at it for about two minutes and then it flew up into the sky and vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Years have past and I have only now decided to report what I saw so the date and time maybe not accurate, but have recently decided to see if anyone else had reported on your web site what I had seen and to my surprise other people have reported the same thing around the same time and place.  This is what happened.  I left a friends house in the down town part of Santa Barbara , I think sometime between 9pm and 11pm on Thanksgiving to drive back to my house in Ventura.  The parking lot directly behind his house was surrounded by trees, 2 and 1 story houses.  I walked to my car and just gave a glance up to look at the stars as I normally do on a beautiful Santa Barbara,CA nights when I noticed that there were no stars, but just a very odd light that was dull orange in color, it was bright, but gave off no hue as bright lights do.   I then took in a wider perspective and noticed that there was not 1, but 3 of these strange orange lights.  They were aprox. a 100 yards between each light forming a perfect or near perfect triangle.  One single light at the front and  the other 2 light were at the back.  On the outside of the triangle lights I could see the stars, house and street lights, etc., but between the orange lights it was black, therefore the triangle was solid.  The triangle ""UFO"" moved south to north aprox. 20 to 30mph and was aprox. 100-150 ft. above me.   What really struck me was that a moving flying craft that large and that low with orange lights that I still have not seen since, made no noise as it went overhead, It was completely silent.  As soon I lost sight of it, I got in my car and tried to find it again, but could not.  I have been around airports and military compounds all my life (39 yrs) and have never seen a flying vehicle that had the shape, lights, and audio characteristics of this ""UFO.""

I turned 180 degrees around and saw an object moving at a uniform distance above the roof of the house in front of me, about 2 ft. above the roof, coming towards me from the backside of the structure, and it occurred to me that it was maintaining a uniform distance above the roof as opposed to an arc over the house from the other side or a path that would lead it way past the house---it was 'hugging' the roof as if on purpose. The object was a sphere, maybe 1 1/2X the size of a basketball, emitting a VERY bright blue light but a light that didn't hurt my eyes as I watched it come over the roof to stop about 5 feet above the ground maybe 15 feet in front of me, between the house and where I was standing. It emitted NO NOISE, NO ODOR, and no noticable spinning or other movement---it just hovered there---I then began to think---I believe that all of my mental processes had ceased as I watched it, from complete amazement and captivation, with no fear or any emotion. However, as soon as I began to ""think"" about it, this object went from right in front of me to over the horizon, perhaps 1/2 mile away up the hill I was on, and disappeared. Again, NO NOISE ans NO anything---it just ""left"".  As I ponder what I have seen, the most powerful part of my memory concerns the following: I believe that it would have stayed there in front of me until I began to ""think"" about it, and as soon as my brain kicked into gear, it took off at light-speed+ to get away from me, protect itself or whatever. It could differentiate between observation and analysis---these are just my feelings---no proof of anything, nor any harm done.  I have decided to call it a ""probe"", something sent to gather inormation as I saw how it was hugging the roof-line as though it had a useful ""range"", and I would go farther to guess that what it ""records"" is brain wave activity or something like that---based on it's reaction to my ""discerning"" that it was there.  I'd like to know the answer someday----you never can know for sure!!  Aloha,  ((name and address deleted))  Malulani St. Kaneohe, HI 96744 ((personal data deleted))",2006-07-16T00:00:00,,

I also have heard of other similar sightings and felt this may contribute some important information. The event took place in early July 2006, the night was clear and weather was warm. Some friends of mine took a sailing trip to Thompson Island, located in Lake Superior, this is about a 4 hour sailboat trip from the Thunder Bay Marina. The unidentified craft was seen at night. Some of our friends had decided to sleep on the sailboat in the small bay that the island offers, however due to the warm July weather 5 of us had decided to take the 15 minute walk to the other side of the island and tent. Rather then tent, we actually decided to lay our blankets out upon the beach and lay beneath the stars. We  rested on the beach and talked late into the night, during this time 2 of the 5 of us drifted off to sleep, the time was now nearly roughly 3 or 4 am. The stars were out and visible all night and we had been looking at constellations and the stars all night. Well in mid conversation,  one of us was distracted by what seemed to be a star and commented “ Guys look at those stars they seem really bright”. So all three of us looked upwards and the same distance as a star would seem away was a ball of light, it seemed to be a star at first but it was getting brighter without at doubt, upon closer inspection it seemed to be slightly blue/white light, the type you would see in some peoples headlights for there vehicles, and as we looked.. off to the right side of the sky faded in two more lights of the same type and size. They moved parallel to each other and then moved into a triangle formation with the third and original light. They then stopped all motion, and unexpectantly began what seemed random looping and changing of direction, something a plane/ helicopter/ or satellite could not accomplish, the movement was from nothing to very fast in no time at all, after doing ! what see med at random series of movement the three lights split apart and moved away in different direction. This whole series of events happened in probably 5- 7 minutes, and was viewed from this remote island in the middle of Lake Superior by 3 people.

Flying object that looks like a Hawk or Eagle,San Antonio,TX,2006-07-31T02:00:00,other,5 minutes,"Occurred : 7/31/2006 02:00  (Entered as : 07/31/06 02:00) Reported: 2/16/2008 11:10:57 AM 11:10 Posted: 3/4/2008 Location: San Antonio, TX Shape: Other Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61649.html,"Flying object that looks like a Hawk or Eagle I saw a hovering object in the softball field at work. It was around 2 AM and as I slowly walked closer to it I noticed it looked like a huge hawk or eagle that was as big as a man. It was hovering w/ it's wings closed. I heard a low mechanicle sound coming from it. I also heard some tones like you would hear on a computer or telephone. I picked up a rock and threw it at the object. I saw the rock deflect off of it and when the rock hit it, it sounded like it was hitting metal. The object spreaded it's wings in mid air, I briefly saw tiny green and red lights flash on it, and then it made a sound like a hawk or eagle as it began to fly towards the south. I would guess this thing was 5 to 6 ft in height, and had a 15 to 20 ft wing spand.  Afterwards I read this one story online that a college kid from Colorado went to Mexico with a couple of his classmates that were from that country. They were hiking near the US-Mexico border outside of Texas in the late 1990s. They were resting between two hills behind some large trees near an isolated road. A military type vehicle drove up and stopped. The college hikers were out of it's view about 30 yards away. Four men got out of the vehicle, three of them appeared to be Chinese and one a Mexican National. The three men that appeared to be Chinese seemed to be speaking in an oriental language.  About two minutes later the college hikers saw this huge bird fly up and landed 20 yards from the four men. They went and got the huge bird and carried it and placed it in the back of their vehicle, then drove away.  I thought this story might have some connection to what I witnessed in July 2006.  My guess is that this bird type object could be some sort of spying flying object that an Asian country such as China is conducting on the U.S.  I've heard of several large bird sightings in the Southwestern USA for years.  I just find all this to be interesting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I never actually saw anything outside my window and it was not until we returned home to Oklahoma and I uploaded that pictures onto my laptop that I noticed something entering from the top of the screen at a downward angle.  In the next picture the object is in full view and has leveled out and actually looks like it is keeping up with the airplane.

The light was brilliant, it reminded me of a glowing gem. I was thinking that I should go and get my telescope when it suddenly began to get dimmer. A short while later it was barely noticeable and it looked like a very distant orange star. It did not seem to be moving at all. It was about 10 or 15 seconds from dazzling light to nothing. Just as it winked out, the Police chopper, Air 1, flew past my location going North. I noticed that it also has an orange light on it along with the blinking blue and red flashers. It also makes quite a bit of noise, the object I saw did not make any sound at all.

What we saw was essentially the same as described by the other witness. The lights were observed in the WSW at approximately 35 degrees above the horizon. I was able to observe the lights through binoculars and they appeared to be two separate rectangular lights spaced closely together. I was also able to discern a third, faint, strobing light near the two rectangular lights. When the lights faded out the rectangular light on the right went out followed immediately by the rectangular light on the left. During the time of this observation through the binoculars there were three separate sets of these lights spaced evenly on the horizontal. The lights apparent size was that of pea held at arms length. It was impossible to estimate the altitude of the lights. No noise was heard, however the sound of the surf would almost definitely masked the sound of any distant aircraft. At the time I thought that they were possibly the exhaust of jet fighter aircraft as the aircraft were flying at level flight at an angle directly away from my position, however the lights reappeared three or four times in approximately the same position over a period of several minutes. This, in my mind, rules out that hypothesis. 	A few minutes later, a single light appeared slightly to the south of the original lights at roughly the same angle above the horizon. The light remained stationary for approximately 2 seconds and then expelled a similar light from the left (my left) which quickly descended approximately three times the width of the original light as if it were in free fall then both lights faded out simultaneously. Initially, I thought that this might have been a flare dropped from an aircraft, however the short duration of the light is not a characteristic of a military-type flare. One or two minutes later another similar light appeared in roughly the same position as the one previously described. About one second after it appeared the light seemed to streak to my left (east) a short distance and then quickly faded out. When the object moved it produced streaks of light behind it (opposite the direction of travel). That marked the end of the observation. Nothing further was observed. 	I am a Captain in the Army with 18 years of service, have served in combat and I have a B.S. in geology. The other witness has served in the military, is a combat veteran and has a degree in and currently practices law.

The lights were a soft yellowing white, in a V-shape and there were approx five lights on each side.  The lights moved as one across the sky, fairly slowly and when they got to about 10 o'clock in the sky, the lights made a big sweeping U turn and then shot off very fast into the sky.
