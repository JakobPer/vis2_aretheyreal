In short, order two more bursts of these sounds alarmed me.  I went to the window.  The house is adjacent to a water detention pond that is fenced off, and the ground slants towards the pond.  This area is behind the fence of the backyard of the home I live in.  I can't see the pond from my room; just the slanting land to the right of it and part of the fence.  Actually, my room is the ONLY vantage point of this area in the house. Alarmed, I pulled the curtains back to see if a shoot-out or home invasion might be taking place in a neighboring area.  It was very dark.  In the extreme right corner of this detention pond area, on the ground, I saw a very bright light.  I judged it had to be at least 20 feet across because on foot it is close to 1/8 of a mile from my window.  I say this because although it was very dark (my landlord refuses to put lights in the backyard, and the house is next to this area and some woods also) I could see this object with startling clarity.  It was not smalll even from the distance of my viewing point. After it emitted the last burst of gunfire, I unfroze and called 911.  I described the situation to the dispatch officer.  She said, ""We are getting other calls about it,"" and basically disconnected me after asking for my name.  I watched from the window for over two hours:  To my knowledge, no police approached the object on foot, nor was a helicopter dispatched.  On the left my vision was completely blocked by huge oak trees.  I could vaguely see house lights from another sector of the neigborhood that is adjacent to this detention pond.   At one point, trying to peer through the leaves of these trees from my vantage point in my room on the second floor, I thought I saw red and blue lights (police cars) near those other homes. It was very brief.  They probably took a look and ran. The object pulsated from dim to brightly starlike over and over again. It appeared disabled or unable to achieve a getaway.  I don't know why I had this feeling that it was disabled. I was hoping to watch it make its getaway but missed that event.  These things can disappear, btw, without a grand getaway. The object made itself known with the extremely loud gunfire sounds, so it obviously wanted to be discovered but not approached. I told the police dispatcher about the gunfire so likely if the police approached, they of course would not attempt a close encounter but rather a distant viewing angle. I have seen many UFOs in the USA and in foreign territories. I was shocked and dismayed about this thing being ON THE GROUND and making warlike noises.  I looked at the area this morning and saw no evidence of scorching or gunfire destruction.  Perhaps the sounds were meant to achieve another goal...a 'look at me but don't dare approach' message. I watched as long as I could but eventually fell asleep.  A few months back I saw two of these starlike things in another neighborhood, practically on top of a house.  I had an eyewitness with me.  Interestingly, it was also adjacent to a detention pond in that neighborhood. My contact info on this form will be scant but a 911 call was placed by me and I gave them my full name.  Again, I was told others were alsocalling in while I was on the phone with the dispatch officer.",2014-09-18T00:00:00,29.775480377035134,-95.78561259640104

Unidentified flying object sighting:  At approximately 22:20 on September 14, 2014, I stepped out the door of my computer room, which faces the west, in order to see if I could see any Northern Lights.  I did not see them. A small group of colored moving lights caught my eye.  It was approximately due west of my house in Centralia and just above the horizon, which in this case is a hill known as Cooks Hill.  The lights were just above the hill, probably at around 15 – 20 degrees elevation from a true level horizon. The light was bobbing around in one area and not moving in any one direction.  I watched for about five minutes and then went to get my binoculars.  With the binoculars, it was more clearly about four lights.  They were positioned with a green light at the top, then perhaps two red lights in the middle, and another green light at the bottom.  There was also the typical yellow light amongst them but it was hard to hold the binoculars steady so that there was some jiggling of the object.  The small area covered by the lights would be about the size of the full moon.  The yellow, red and green lights, in size and brightness, were much the same as airplane lights in size and brilliance.  But if they were from an airplane it was not going anywhere.  I watched for about ten minutes, total, and the small group of lights just bobbed around, up and down, side to side, much as a fishing bobber that was being dangled above the water but not in it.  I could hear no sounds of an aircraft. When I went to turn on my computer at 22:29, in those few seconds, the object(s) was gone. It could possibly have been a helicopter but the prolonged bobbing around motion in the same spot does not seem like a practical explanation.

I was just sitting outside tonight, looking directly above my head in Atlantic Beach, FL.  Staring above and to the western sky, I saw what resembled descriptions of the AZ lights.  The difference was the lights I saw seemed so far away that the speed they were exhibiting is indescribable. These lights were so far away though that if not witnessed continuously would resemble stars. I kept my head turned upwards, with my gaze staring in a single position, and the lights moved outside of my periphery.  This was my way of determining the lights were moving.    At certain points, there seemed to be 1 to 6 lights illuminated at once.  Then, all but one light would be visible.  Then the lights seemed to illuminate the way a Cuttlefish displays its luminescence.  The semi-circle luminescence moved to the northwest. Looking at a single point in the far away sky, I would stare at the last point I saw a light, and then the light would disappear, and then the light would reappear at a different point.  I knew it was a different point because I hadn’t moved my gaze and when the light reappeared I had to move my eyes. The lights seemed to at some moments to be in a semi-circular configuration, maybe 4-6 lights, and then they would dissipate to 3, and then just 1 light. At intervals the lights seemed to kind of flash heat lightening, but the “heat lightning” would move quickly like the individual lights did. I look at the sky often and have never seen anything like this.  I am quite shaken. Did anyone else witness this?

Military jets, helis, and a b2 followed. Last night, in the early evening, right after dark, I was leaving the local Ruidoso grocery store.  As I pulled onto the road from the grocery store, my wife and I experienced a mystifying event that carried on for maybe 20 minutes.   As we exited the parking lot of the grocery store I noticed a large and extremely bright orange orb directly above us.  I started yelling with excitement for my wife to look, and at that moment, the orb was now right in front of us and suddenly split into 3 orbs all large and amber/orange in color maybe 1500 feet above ground level.   The orbs began traveling at a high rate of speed to the north.  I then rolled down my window to look at the sky and see if could hear anything.  No Sound.   At this point, I notice 2 fighter jets traveling in the same direction, at a high rate of speed, and these planes I could hear.  The jets were left in the dust.   Out of disparity to maybe get a glimpse of this phenomenon again we proceeded to a look out point a couple miles up the road.  We pulled over and began scanning the sky.  My wife saw the orbs first and drew my attention to where they were.  This time there were 2 orbs above the Tularosa, NM, region.  They were hovering in the horizon for a couple minutes then went dark.   We waited a couple minutes longer and two more jets came from the east heading in the direction of the orbs at a high rate of speed.  As the jets approached, the orbs made themselves visible again, and went straight up several thousand feet, then dropped back down instantly to where they were right above the horizon, as if they were trying to get the attention of the jets, maybe to taunt them.  The orbs then collided into one another and disappeared.   The jets made several circles in the area of where we saw the orbs.  After a few minutes the jets turned and made their way back towards Holloman Air Force Base.  Two large helicopters then appeared and circled the same area for a few minutes, and then also made their way back to Holloman as well.   We then proceeded home.  Maybe 30-45 minutes after being home, I heard a large turbine engine.  I thought it was another helicopter.  To be sure, I ran out to my back deck, where it was open, and to my surprise a B2 bomber came directly over me, very low, maybe 2000 feet AGL at approximately 500 knots heading towards Roswell, NM.  Its force shook my house and alarmed many people in my neighborhood.  It was definitely a B2 it was enormous.  I am also a pilot and know the difference between these aircraft.   The day before this sighting a friend explained his father was in Alamogordo, NM, (White Sands Missle Range) and experienced a shock wave of energy as he was walking into the Home Depot.  It alarmed others.  The phones, internet, land lines and credit card machines all went dead the day of this event for most of the day.  There were jets flying all day long.

My job is a server admin at a local utility.  I'm also familiar with many types of aircraft and the flight paths around my area.  I considered myself to be educated and use good logic.  In the past I've seen things in the sky that at first I could not explain, however on further thought I am able to determine what I had seen in logical terms.  This is the first time I could not come to a logical reason for what I saw. I just finished up being an aide in my son’s Religious Education class at Church and was walking to my automobile.  Out of my left eye, I caught an orange light in the sky to the North.  I then turned to look at it and noticed several more objects in trail, not flying in any sort of formation.   I then looked to the Northwest in the direction of Luke Air Force Base and saw several others appearing from that direction.  After viewing in Church parking lots for several minutes and taking two pictures, my son and I drove about a half mile north.   The objects were almost directly over us at this point, and appeared to be a round flat light. I took another picture.  As I was viewing them the lights appeared to go straight up and disappear into a thin cloud.   We drive about 1,100 feet east from the point to get a better view.  One last object appeared from same direction as others; however this one appeared to be larger than others.  This last object disappeared straight up before I could u! nlock my phone to take a picture. This was not in any flight pattern I’ve seen in the 12 years living in this area.  And I could look behind and above me to see the normal pattern of planes flying in/out of Sky Harbor and through its air space. At first I thought they might have been military helicopters.  However I’ve seen flights of helicopters out of the Arizona National Guard base before and they tend to fly in formation and lower.  Also each object had only one light with no visible tail rotor light.  Further I ruled out hot air balloons because the lights were two small for that (the entire balloon usually lights up at night). Next thought was that I was seeing afterburners on jets out of Luke AFB.  But this did not fit either.  Flights out of the AFB are usually around four to six jets, and flying in some sort of formation.  Also with 30 plus fighter jets in afterburners, the noise would have been horrendous.  These objects made no observable sounds.  Also if these were jets, they would have been moving much quicker in horizontal flight. My final thought was they could be Chinese lanterns.  However since they flew nearly level for quite some time and then went vertical, this would rule them out.  Balloons with some sort of light attached to them.  Further given the proximity to Luke AFB and Glendale Airport, I find it hard to believe that a group would get permission for such a launch.",2014-12-12T00:00:00,33.5178,-112.36670000000001

A few minutes later, the light on the far left faded out and disappeared.  As we got into town, the two that remained got closer together and seemed so close they may be touching.  Then they faded into darkness as well.   The entire event lasted about 20-25 minutes. One thing to note, there was a spotlight display happening at the same time from in front of the grocery store in the middle of town, we could see it from a few miles out of town.

At approximately 8:30 PM on Dec 10th, 2014, while driving home from the Phoenix farmers market, I witnessed 3 orange spheres in a triangular formation.   I was traveling southbound down Gilbert Rd, approaching the stop light at Queen Creek Rd, and the objects were to the southwest of my location.  They were solid orange and very bright.   I continued southbound on Gilbert Rd to Ocotillo Rd and they remained stationary or moved very slowly.   At 8:35 I arrived at my home near the intersection of Gilbert Rd and Ocotillo.  The neighbors across the street from my house were putting up their outdoor Christmas decorations.  I pointed the lights out, and they saw them too.  The objects had moved southwest from the original sighting, but were still clearly visible and unusually bright.  We watched them for a few minutes and I began getting things from my car.   The neighbors said, “The lights are gone,” and a few minutes later, they said, “There they are again.”  I stepped out of the garage to look, and snapped a photo with my phone.  This time there were two of them horizontal to the ground instead of three in a triangle pattern and they stayed lit for three or four minutes until they disappeared.   I went inside and told my father in law about the sighting.  A few minutes later, after getting my son ready for bed, I looked out the 2nd story window.  I saw that the three orange balls of light had reappeared in a straight line, parallel to the ground but were further west than before.   I ran downstairs to get my father in law so he could see them and we went into our backyard for observation.  They lasted for about 10 minutes before finally disappearing.   I finished getting my son ready for bed and sat on the couch to continue looking out the window. Around 8:55 the lights reappeared and I went to get binoculars.  The binoculars didn’t help due to low magnification capability and a few minutes later all of the lights faded out.  I went back upstairs and kept an eye on the area through the window.  Then at approximately 9:00 pm two lights appeared further away than they before, so I went to the upstairs balcony for a different perspective.  I took a few more pictures with my phone.  This time they lasted for ten or fifteen minutes before disappearing.  At 9:25 a single light appeared in the same area so I went back out to the balcony.  The light had moved closer to my position from the last appearance but I still could not tell what it was.  While I was observing this light, two more lights which were evenly spaced appeared to the far right of the original light,  a few seconds later two more evenly spaced lights appeared to the left, and finally two more lights which were also evenly spaced appeared to the left the other! four. There was a total of seven lights in a straight line. There were three sets of two lights evenly spaced from each other with the original light further to the left. They were above the height of the street lights from my point of view and above the tree line in the distance.  They lasted for a few minutes before they disappeared but I managed to take some more photos with my phone.  They all disappeared at 9:31 and I went inside. At 9:35 a helicopter flew slowly through the area. I continued to look out the window for a couple more hours but they never reappeared. The objects appeared to be near the Gila River Indian community and south of the Chandler Municipal Airport.  Being a former Air force Security Police K-9 handler and living near the municipal airport I know what planes and helicopters look like.   These objects made no sound, they did not have navigation lights, they were not Chinese lanterns, or any kind of drones that I am aware of.   After doing a bit of online research I found that lights like these have been seen in this area more than once this year and sometimes they occur multiple nights in a row usually between 8:00 and 10:00. I called the Chandler Municipal airport and the Chandler police dispatcher but they had no reports of unusual activity. I will keep an eye on the sky and maybe I will get a better glimpse of the objects next time.",2014-12-12T00:00:00,33.29885793871866,-111.86506392757661

I live in northern Waterbury atop the highest mountain with a beautiful view of the mountains and also surrounding towns. As I was looking out the window, I saw a large orange glowing object that almost resembled a lightning sphere, but without the jagged edges.  I've lived here for 13 years and have never seen anything in that area that would be light play or a reflection of any type.  I called my 9 yr old son over to the window to see it.  As we were looking at it 3 distinct objects started descending from the sky. At first, they looked like giant orange fireballs but we were able to clearly see that they were actually a orange glowing trail behind 3 solid objects that were quickly descending down towards the ground.  You know when you see a plane fly by and it leaves the trail in the clouds behind it?   Well, thats what these looked like.  I could clearly see at the beginning of the orange flame like trails, 3 solid masses.  They appeared to be black or dark grey in color.  They were descending from above the unmoving large glowing orange object that we first saw. I would imagine a meteorite or anything else crashing into our atmosphere would look similar to what I saw.  I was immediately scared and actually called the Waterbury Police to make a report and spoke to the officer who responded and came to my home.  Whatever they were they each left a trail of what looked like fire behind them.  Within 10 minutes there were helicopters that proceeded to cover the general area where I saw the strange lights.  It would have been over the Naugatuck/Waterbury line near the I-84 interchange with Rte 8.  I heard and also saw at least 2 army blackhawk helicopters that seemed to be working together that scanned that area and all the way into Thomaston or atleast thats as far as I could see from my view.  They had extremely bright lights on though not the entire time as though looking for something.  At one point I could see at least 4 helicopters (some not loud like the army ones) covering the general area at the same altitude they were originally vis! ible from and then lower to the ground.  They did this up until close to 12:30 in the morning. There is no way they would waste that much money on fuel and man power on a phone call from one citizen.  Clearly something came down that shouldn't have.  I have noticed strange lights and irregular movement in this area before but nothing at all like what I witnessed last night.  I'm actually still scared about what I saw and would feel better if anyone else saw what I saw or has any information on what it was.  I wish I could just shake off the feeling that whatever came down last night wasn't good.",2014-10-10T00:00:00,41.55679782082325,-73.03441525423729

I reported to 911 as we were observing it.  The 911 operator called back about 40 minutes later advising that she reported our sighting to the FAA and suggested I submit a report to you. At 8:05 PM, about 30 minutes after sundown my wife and I were in the back yard.  The sky was clear, half moon very bright.  Light from the sun was still glowing in the western half of the sky.  No stars were visible yet. My wife pointed to a very bright star almost directly overhead.  It was a Venus type brightness.  I realized that it was too early for stars and is Venus currently visible at dawn.  I then assumed it was a satellite reflecting sunlight which we often see.  I quickly realized if it was a satellite it had to very large, like the International Space Station which we are familiar with.  The ISS is not visible for us at this time.   I immediately recognized the “star” object was not a satellite because it seemed stationary almost directly overhead.  It was absolutely not moving across the mid-point of the sky at the pace we often seen evening satellites moving. Looking at the object for ten plus seconds it suddenly became several times brighter.  The new brightness lasted about five seconds and then quickly dimmed to less brightness than it was originally.   A few seconds later a white cloud appeared around the star like object.   We describe the size of the cloud as 20-30 diameters of the “star” object.  I arrived at that diameter simulating the size of the “star” object with an ink dot and thereby extrapolating the size of the cloud.  The cloud was semitransparent rather that a very solid white; however it was definitely white.   Suddenly a bright “star” like object moved out of the cloud area at an angle to the right and from our perspective it appeared to be moving downward as if falling toward earth.  The “falling” object was far less bright than the original object. I had my cell phone in hand so I dialed 911 to report the sighting in case it was some type of high altitude explosion.  The cloud and falling object were visible as I made contact with the 911 operator and gave my report.  The cloud and then the object faded from view while I was still on the phone, which I assume was about a minute. I checked the exact time of the sighting by my cell phone record of the 911 call. After the sighting faded, I looked around in the sky and because of the fading sunlight, there were no stars or planets visible.",2014-09-05T00:00:00,32.757366003227546,-97.34710441097364

Early on the morning of December 21, 2014, I had noticed a bright flickering amber-colored light in the north horizon.  I watched it fly south, toward my direction, in a non-linear fashion until it was practically right overhead, still slightly to the North.  The single light dimmed temporarily before flaring up and breaking up into 3-5 different pieces that all went separate directions at different speeds.  When the original light broke up, it brightened immensely and seemed to fall apart, with the separate pieces having tails similar to a small fireball.  Some stayed illuminated, some dimmed to faint red dots barely discernable from the night stars.  After about 15-20 seconds, all of the lights had dimmed to blinking red dots flying in separate directions. About 2 minutes after this event occurred, another amber-colored light appeared on the Northern horizon, in the same exact area and followed the same general path in the sky. The flickering amber light flew to the same general area that I had seen the previous one in, and broke apart in the same manner as the first, dispersing fireball-like lights in separate directions that all eventually turned into blinking red lights.  The lights changed direction and speed, but never fast enough to seem like a shooting star or something falling into our atmosphere. I was compelled enough to call the local Non-Emergency line to report this incident, and they actually dispatched two units to my house fairly quickly, within 10 minutes of my call.  I was surprised to say the least.  By the time they had shown up, the lights were gone and I was left defending my sobriety and right state of mind.  After a few minutes describing what I had seen, the police jovially dismissed me by stating, ""Sadly enough, I don't have the Magic School Bus, and I can't fly up there and investigate what you saw.""

I may have checked the sliding door to make sure it was locked, I may have been sleepwalking. I may have hit myself to make sure I was awake. I can’t say that I went into the woods behind our house to investigate, though I remember complaining about two small “bug-bites” on my stomachs side (I think this is were it was) to my sister.  Beyond this I can not determine events real or imagination. The entire event was very hazy and surreal, though I believe I checked to make sure I was really awake and not in a vivid dream.  I do remember a dream I had previously of a space ship in the woods around the time of November 10 1997, date not approximate. This spaceship was in the mountain passages in the Old Farms area.  This I was sure was a dream though. This moon like glow occurred near the Old Farms swamp area.  I do not know if these two subjects are related at all beyond the same area where I experienced them.  I think the spaceship dream was related to science fiction media. It was a very white light that seemed to be glowing from the woods towards the house, and nothing more that I can determine.

After a somewhat boring evening with 3 friends and I, we decided to go climb speak the word baptist church in a somewhat secluded area in Golden Valley. We picked this location because it was between a pair of ponds and there were limited residential homes so we could be loud and attend our activity freely. We parked about 2 blocks from the church (on kentucky ave s) in order to avoid getting the attention of any passing police vehicles that commonly passed the church parking lot. As we headed southbound on kentucky ave s, I noticed that through the thin tree line, there was wider than tall tear drop shaped object rising out of the water at a rate of about two feet per second. The object had three lights in a triangular arrangement on the bottom; facing about 30 degrees from a vertical plane equally away from each other. The lights were bright enough to see the beams clearly, and we were about 200 feet away at this point, as we were walking toward the object! which was directly through the thin tree line at the end of the block. My friends were distracted by conversation, but as I walked about 20 feet behind them I began to call out ""hey! guys look at that!"". At roughly seconds within that moment the object had reached a stand still, hovering barely a foot above the tree line. Just as my friends were attempting to locate the object I so clearly witnessed rise from the water, a charging sound came from the object, similar to ""zwooooOOOP!"". Then the sky was illuminated by a flash from the object and the object accelerated away towards the south eastern sky in a 20 degree incline at a horizontal plane at an astonishing rate of what seemed to be just below the speed of sound. The only reason I state this seeming speed is due to the chugging brake like sound that came from the object as it accelerated from hovering above the pond. Any faster rate of acceleration and a sonic boom would have likely made for a rude ! awakening of the residents in the area. We proceeded to discus! s the ev ent and climb the church anyway. I will never forget what I saw that night, especially the minute I witnessed the scientifically unexplained event.

Approximately between 6:00 and 7:00 pm, I was walking from my car to my front door and noticed a very bright white headlight of an aircraft in the cloudless night sky coming in my direction from north to south crossing an area of the property that I have never seen planes or helicopters fly before.  It wasn't as high an elevation as jets use but was that of possibly a low flying smaller aircraft.  I stood thinking it was a helicopter coming from Atlanta to LaGrange but was not sure so I decided to stop and watch it fly over.  I waited but with the sensation that it was approaching I soon realized it was either moving very slow or not moving at all.  I was just about to tell my husband to come out side when the light or power was turned off on the aircraft and the sky was black.   Within a few seconds two horizontal stacked rows of 5-9 red lights appeared in a straight line at the location where I had originally seen the bright light in the sky.  The red lights went ! off and within a few seconds of nothing but black, the lights reappeared in the same formation but appeared to be blue in color.  These went black also within seconds and the red lights reappeared.  These lights continued alternating colors going off and on multiple times and I went to the door and called my daughter and husband to come out and look.  My daughter took a picture and a video of the object and the row of red lights.  The video nor the camera took a picture of the object as my daughter was certain she had done so.  The I phone would not work but always has in the past.  But she did see the row of red lights.  As my husband came out the row of lights had disappeared and the object had reached within a mile of my house and at this time only had a couple of red and white lights underneath it as a plane would have.  It was much larger than a Cessna plane but the night was so black I could not distinguish the shape.  A smaller plane was flying west to east behind us and the ! aircraft we were watching made in less than a 1/4 of a mile width a U -turn before reaching us and proceeded back north at a somewhat faster pace than it had approached us towards the Newnan, Ga, area.",2014-12-18T00:00:00,33.1846,-84.9076

Most of them kind of flash a color that looks likes red, white, and blue at the same time (instantaneously) some of them are a lot more active, almost as if they are patrolling areas.  I can't describe the shape because they seem to shift and some of them blink just red.  As weird as it sounds, I feel like they can tell when you stare at them and when you pay attention to one or two for a long enough time and then turn around there is almost always another new one that pops up in sight that you can tell was observing you when you were paying attention to the other one(s).  There are also more circularish ones and square ones too with multiple lights.  These are the ones that cruise closer to the ground in an almost sneaky manor.  The ones highe! r up almost look like a fleet.

First I noticed that the Big Dipper was very bright and then something right below it, near the horizon, I noticed a ball of colored lights twinkling.  At first I thought it was an airplane but it didn't move. It just twinkled bright red and green lights.  I knew couldn't be a star because all the stars are bright and white. I went to the livingroom to get a pair of binoculars to go outside to view it from my patio. My husband was still sitting at his desk at his laptop as I told him what I was doing. He went outside with me to see if we could view it better. Sure enough, there it was...still shinning brightly with red and green lights, like a small ball just twinkling on the horizon looking southeast of our house. It never moved from the spot just below the Big Dipper and the rest of the stars. In other words...its position only moved with the earth's rotation.  Since my husband works nights and doesn't get home until approximately 12:40 am, I'm usually up waiting for him to get home. We don't head off to bed until some time after 1:30 am and 2:30 am. So we will probably look again for this bright twinkling ball of light tonight.  By the way, my husband called a friend who is a deputy sheriff on duty until 6 am.

Usually what I see can have at least a plausible explanation.  I have nothing for this sighting.  All about details in this description which will be lengthy.  But I want to document everything I can remember while fresh.  All ‘measurements’ will be between 2 fingers at arm's length. Temp 14 degrees.  Unusual for November 12th 2014.  Skies clear blue overhead.  Very low  thick cloud banks to the north about 1.5 inches high.  Some spotty clouds to the west low.  Sun starting to set.  Had also observed a small sun pillar sometime between 4:45 and 5:10.  Unsure when. Traveling between Clarks and Central City on HWY 30 southwest bound very close to 5 pm as I saw 1st anomaly. A white streak appeared about 24” from the horizon (see previous measurement scale).  The streak resembled a jet trail (straight) about 1.5” in length appearing at the 10 to 4 position in the sky(relative to a clock sitting on the western horizon).  I thought I should’ve seen this before and concentrated on it.   Solid for 10 seconds.  Then faded within 1 second disappeared.  I immediately thought I had seen a meteor trail.  Cool I thought.  (I have seen a few before in the daylight).    Then another one appeared within 15 seconds.  (close to and about the same size as the first.  A little more north I’d guess and maybe slightly higher).  Watched it the same with the same result in 10 seconds as the first.  Still convinced I saw another meteor trail. Within a few minutes, I noticed the first light orb in the same area.  A little larger than venus and about 2 to 3 times as bright.  The light was NOT white like venus, but reminded me of a flashlight.  Yellow/white.   About 15 seconds I watched that.  And it slowly faded to NOTHING in 1 second.   Still my mind convinced myself it was a plane reflection.  I have seen many reflections that have caught my eye.  But this one was different.  What was different was I could ALWAYS see a plane AFTER the reflection.  There was nothing. When I was younger, I would hear and watch fighter jets training in NE Nebraska on clear days.  Usually on a Saturday.  And would watch them ‘dog fight’ as they puked out flares (that would arc and burn and leave a trail that would last for 5 minutes) and did their maneuvers.   Was always cool to watch. I kept trying to convince myself that HAD to be it.   But nothing quite fit. Then I saw the next one.  Just as bright.  Not appearing to move much as the first one did.  Again 15 seconds … nice and bright then faded within one second.  No plane. This is about the time I knew what I saw…. DID NOT make any sense. I saw another one in the same area about 1 minute later.   Nice and bright.  Then I saw the second one appear to the left and a bit higher 3” from the first bright one.  Now I see two at once.  Not changing the distance between them.  The bright one to the bottom right and the dimmer one to the top left.  After 15 seconds… the lights faded within one second and disappeared.  No planes. Just before Central City, I pulled off on a gravel road.  I put some electrical lines between me and the area I was watching.  (all this is higher and to the left side of the setting sun).  I waited about 3 minutes. For the last time, I saw a light orb.  Nice and bright it appeared.   From my viewpoint AND with the power lines for reference.  It drifted UP from my viewpoint about 3”  (this could be moving closer to me OR could be moving up OR could be moving higher and away from me).  The light faded as all the others.  No plane.   That was the last strange thing I saw. The light either had to be a reflection of the setting sun or made its’ own light.  But I saw NO objects in the air.  No idea about why the trails and the light stayed visible to me about the same amount of time and faded from clear view to nothing. TK",2014-11-14T00:00:00,41.1596,-98.00079999999998

I was just outside our house in Escondido at approximately 4:40am on the morning of 9/16/2014. My husband just went back inside for a minute.  I was staring up at the sky, stargazing as I very often do. It's a treat when I get to see a meteorite or even a passing satellite.  But this time... There were two very bright, but very high lights passing from East to West.  I've seen many satellites passing in my life, and if I had to guess, they were many miles from each other, but within about 5 degrees from each other in my field of view.  They looked like most satellites do when passing, a white to red/orange reflective light, but they were slightly brighter than other satellites I had observed.  One following the other perfectly. Then, a few seconds after I saw them, they rotated about an axis and switched positions while still moving West, and continued on in perfectly swapped places.  Then the new lead light continued on, while the new trailing light veered off South and disappeared.  The leading light soon disappeared (faded) as I would expect of a satellite reentering the earth's shadow. All of this in the span of 15-20 seconds.  My observation covered an arc of about 45 degrees from the time I noticed until the remaining light was not visible. I have observed many passing satellites, the space station, the old shuttles in my life.  I am a smoker who is up late night and early morning and go outside and stare at the sky.  I've never seen an event like this, and my main reaction was to repeatedly say out loud, ""What is that?""   And this was of course one of the few times I've walked outside without my phone on me, not that I think it would have recorded a viable video even if I had gotten to it in time.",2014-09-18T00:00:00,33.13055039787798,-117.02199071618035

He says it was medium blue with a white core, and I say it was lime green with a very bright centre. either way, the block only has one light about fifty feet away, and the area around the apartment buildings is VERY unlit, so this thing really lit up the common area in the two seconds it whizzed in a straight line towards lake Michigan at twenty feet above the ground lighting up the area around it, again it was very bright and colourful and it left a ""trail"" in our eyes  that lasted for a few seconds, kind of like seeing a bright flashlight in a black room. This was not a meteorite or anything as I saw it fly to an altitude of maybe 150 feet before it dived and went by the window. shooting stars dont change course nor do they fly straight and level (at 20 feet) above the ground.   We both work a lot and were not drinking at the time, we were just playing sky rim when we saw it.",2014-11-26T00:00:00,44.1099,-87.71

It appeared to me that they were even gaining altitude.   I lost sight of them as I went under the I-10 interchange.  When I came out the other side past Pecos Park I caught a glimpse of them right as they blinked out of existence separately, but rapidly in succession.  Some background info: I am an avid aerospace enthusiast and have flown several air craft myself.  But I am not a licensed pilot.   My father, who did not witness these, but the previous ones in the 90's, said he had seen nothing like it.  He is an aerospace tech who works on jet engines and was a former aircraft mechanic in the U.S. Air Force.

This must have occurred on our quick walk to the balcony  Another gentleman (AIRCRAFT MECHANIC) claims he saw them moving around, and then they became stationary, which is how they appeared to me, i.e. stationary.  Distance from shore:  it seemed close, maybe less than a mile…but I cannot be sure  Size:  again, I really cannot be sure.

It was around 9:30pm when my friends frantically called me outside. (I am a lover of all things UFO, so they couldn’t believe they were seeing it and I was missing it.)  They saw 6 diamond shaped shadows with bright red-orange lights in the center. They lit up one after the other, all in a row, and each light lasted 5 seconds before fading out, one after the other.  They started almost directly in front of our condo 1-3 miles out from the shore and much higher in the sky than the advertisement planes that fly over in the daytime.  That first time two of my friends both got to see them through the binoculars and saw that the light in the middle seemed to change like an LED light- red, orange, green, yellow.  As the lights were going out, my boyfriend called me out, and I just barely missed it.  They said the diamonds appeared to be close enough they were touching and as soon as the light faded they disappeared completely.  We were discussing it- they were all very solemn, I was more excited/upset I missed it- and a little less than 10 minutes later it happened again.  It gave us all cold chills. There was something so ominous about it-maybe just because the unknown of it was terrifying.  I saw as 1 red-orange light lit up, a second, a third… there were 6 again, though they appeared to be in a slightly diagonal line from our perspective, but still lined up. I was not able to see the shape of the crafts.  They seemed to be farther and farther apart from one another which each sighting. There was also a group of folks who came from our condo out on the beach taking pictures. (Unfortunately the only clip we were able to record was as the last two lights were going out.)  After the lights went out and theories started circulating between us I told them to watch for military jets- as they are often seen trailing UFOs in many reports. Within 5 minutes a black jet with a blinking white light came soaring over the beach. There were at least 5 or 6 jets flying- circling over the beaches and out in the spots where we had seen the lights. This gave us some perspective on the size of these crafts, which  were very easy to see even that far out, whereas we had to strain to try and count the blinking lights from the jets.  We had given up seeing anymore, though we remained on the balcony, shaken, and maybe 15-20 minutes had passed, the jets had all vanished, and we saw them again, even further down the beach (toward Myrtle Beach, from North Myrtle Beach). This time I only remember seeing 5. Each time we saw them they lit up one at a time and disappeared 1 at a time.  This happened a few more times- At least 6, but maybe 7.  Though, by the last time or two there were only two red lights visible. There were about 10-15 minutes between sightings- more if the jets were circling. It seemed that intermittently between sightings there were more jets scrambling around. Its as if these crafts disappeared as the lights faded. Over all the event lasted about an hour and a half.  There were 4 of us outside after the first sighting (for which there were three) and my boyfriends mother saw it happen one time, making 5.  We tried our best debunking different possibilities. It wasn’t fireworks as it didn’t move. Mother tried to pass it of as kites or flares, but there was no smoke, no movement, just blinking lights of different colors.  And the three of them saw diamond shapes with their naked eyes. It certainly was unlike anything we had ever seen before and from my search, seems it is definitely NOT the first time something like this has been seen over Myrtle Beach.",2014-10-10T00:00:00,33.83166,-78.65013

Airport is very near sighting.  There appeared to be one light from a second object following behind though low clouds may have obscured other lights. At first I thought a light then two then the third were stars but then noticed they were moving and not quite white like the other stars.  Then I thought it was a plane but first the plane was too high to be landing and it was a strange flight pattern coming directly west from the Atlantic ocean.  Then I noticed the lights jumping directly up and down a number of times.  I followed the lights over too long a distance for it to be a searchlight and the lights were distinct like distant stars or maybe aircraft lights.  It seemed strange and especially with the single light from another craft following close behind at the same low altitude. Conditions were not ideal because of the low clouds over the horizon.  The lights appeared visible to me intermittently through the clouds.  Don't know if they were satellites or even how far away they were but I was not looking high in the sky at all.  Wasn't super alarming but strange and no obvious explanation.  No one was nearby on the beach at night and no one with me.

We were walking around the park and heard something that sounded like a mixture between a jet engine and a helicopter.  We all looked up and saw a fairly large, slow moving craft flying pretty low.  We can only describe the craft as a black object with the shape of a sine curve, or something like a pringle chip with upward arches as the wings.   Although the craft blended in with the sky, we could clearly see its shape due to a smooth, bright green, neon light tracing the edges in that exact shape.  The final detail was a large, orange, slow blinking light on the back of it. We were near my house and I was headed home a few minutes after the sighting and I told my mom about it because it had been heading in the direction of our neighbourhood.  She said that a few minutes before I had arrived she heard the exact same sound and that the noise had shaken the whole house.  She described the sound as a plane about to land right above our roof.  I have been doing research since last night on any aircraft with that sort of shape but have found nothing. ((ADDENDA/RESPONSES FROM WITNESS)) #1 Thanks for the quick response!  The only lights were the large orange one and the solid green light tracing the shape of the craft.  I am an art student fortunately, but don't have much experience drawing vehicles.  I will definitely do my best to include an image by this weekend if not tomorrow.  #2 Hello, This is basically what it looked like from our perspective with a neighborhood across the road and the faint outline of the mountains in the background.  It seemed to be less than 1 or 2 miles away and fairly low to the ground considering it shook our house.  Again I believe the craft was black because it blended in to the background but the green and orange lights were what we could see perfectly.  Not sure if it is some sort of military aircraft or anything but I couldn't find any sort of craft with that shape.   Thanks!   #3 Great! That's fine with me.  I don't have really any knowledge of planes or military aircraft but the three of us got a little freaked out and couldn't think of anything it could have been.

There  is no way it was a cloud because of the way it changed its direction and speed.,2014-09-10T00:00:00,32.9588,-96.9812

PD)) At about 22:45 in Bothell, WA, I was on my back deck and saw numerous objects (I believe 6) fly overhead.  They had no lights but were clearly visible I'm assuming due to the city lights below.  They looked silverish-gray but that is probably the city light reflecting off them.  They were in a ""V"" formation.  One in front, two directly behind the first, and 3 behind the two.  The row with three, the one on the far right was off centered however.  Appeared to be pulling away from the others but I can't be sure as I only saw the objects for a few seconds before they went over the tree line.  There was no sound at all.  I cannot give an exact altitude but I'm guessing 1000-2000 feet due to the speed across the sky.  Basically west to East.  If they were at 10,000 feet they would have been the size of jumbo jets and going at least mach 4 or 5 so my assumption is much lower altitude.  Again, no sound at all which is not possible if it was a low-flying (or high flying) formation of jets. I cannot guarantee they were separate objects as it's a pitch black night sky, but it appeared they were, as one was out of formation.  My first thought was maybe a big drone but the speed was too fast and the off-centeredness does not make sense. I'm sure others saw what I saw too as it's a populated area.  Very strange and never seen anything like it. ((CORRECTION FROM WITNESS)) Sorry it was 22:45 (10:45 pm)...give or take 10 mins ((END CORRECTION)) ((2ND CORRECTION FROM WITNESS)) Sorry it was 9/20.

Also seen Blue Angels many of times and it did look like an Angel formation, very close together.

It resembled that to me as in the size and speed at which it moved.  But then I noticed once it got from directly overhead to a slight northwestern direction it seemed to stop and then move in a flat eastern direction slowly for about 2 minutes.  If I had to judge distance the movement from the beginning would have been 3 feet in line of sight from southeast to northwest then about 9 inches in line of sight eastern direction before continuing northwest out of my site behind a obstructing tree.  I saw several plans flying at high altitude flying near or directly underneath this object and it was obviously way higher than them. Like I said it looked like a mid day star but moving.

My friend and I, two community college students from Sacramento, had just gotten out of our classes and were hanging out together on campus.  We were sitting in a spot of grass near the library, which is a fairly open space with a clear view of the sky. Both having had a long day, we were reclined in the grass staring up at the sky when at about 4:40PM, we both noticed something white making its way across the vast stretch of blue. At first glance, it appeared to be a feather being pushed by the wind, but we soon realized it was at much too high of an altitude and was moving far too fast. Upon further inspection, we could see that it resembled a scalene triangle, and spun about and tilted at odd angles while it flew across the sky.  We brushed this off somewhat nonchalantly at first, laughing at the absurdity of the sight. After all, it had been a long day, and we assumed that it was, indeed, just a feather or some other spec of debris, and our eyes were playing tricks on us making the object in question look stranger. That is, until the next object came in. It had only been 10 seconds after the first, if even that, when another white object hovered across the sky in the same manner. This object was perfectly spherical and was not moving about in the same sporadic way as the first. That is, if it was, it wasn’t noticeable because of its shape. It was at the same altitude and was within our view for the same amount of time as the other, a mere 20 seconds or so of a quick and soundless hovering as it made its way across the plain of our vision.  	We reported the sighting via hotline right when the incident was over. My friend tried to capture photos and videos of the 2nd object in question, but it was so high up and thus appeared so small that it wasn’t picked up by their iPhone camera. Being that these two objects were so small and were silent, we’re unsure of whether or not there were any other witnesses.",2014-10-03T00:00:00,38.57580181028241,-121.45009956553221

Hello, I am H (this is an alias) I just turned twenty-one years old, and I live in a small town in Washington, the town of Washougal... It's near Portland, Oregon; maybe twenty or so miles away.  Anyhow, I have grown up in a culture of sci-if loving, alien-addicted ""extraterrestrial life is out there"" exposure and I, myself accept that it's quite likely that we are but one of many civilizations of advanced life in the vast universe.  Lately in Washougal, the sky has been pristinely crystal-clear, and a few times, I've tried to remedy my chronic insomnia at night by going outside, in the chilly October air. On October 3, at around 4:14 a.m, I was looking up at the stars when I noticed something unusual, in the southernmost part of the sky.  As I focused on it with my eyes, I could see that it was roughly cross-shaped - but instead of being totally straight, the arms of the cross angled downward in an arch, and they emitted a blinding light.  During some 'bursts' of light, I looked away, to avoid the bright light.  There was a solid, oval-shaped ring around the cross, which would occasionally strobe rapidly with every color in the rainbow... It was an astounding and mind-boggling display. I could not make sense of it, if it truly was an earthly aircraft. I watched this object for well over an hour, and it stayed -hovering- in the same general vicinity... A part of the sky in-between two massive Douglas Firs, which were clearly visible to me, well over two miles away.  I suspect -with that point of reference- that the cross-shaped object was about three-to-five miles away...  It was hovering unsteadily (it seemed to struggle at times, sinking as though it was losing power; and then darting upwards, unexpectedly - going speeds that could not possibly be achieved with our current technology).  It wobbled around unsteadily in the same vicinity for an hour and a half, before it began to gradually ascend up, like a rocket, except without any atmospheric resistance... It just cut right through - the object shot straight up into the sky. It's light-trail was so bright, large liquid-like streaks trailed behind the object, like nothing I'd ever seen before. That's when I noticed that the bright light seemed to move much like a fluid, acting with many properties of water. As the object rose higher and higher up into the atmosphere, it's silhouette very rapidly disappeared... It was gone at this point.  When I entered my house, it was 5:52 am, and I held an uneasiness in my stomache. I had always considered ETs to be out there, but experiencing an actual UFO in the sky, so near you... it changed the way I feel about a lot of things. I understand the persistence and perseverance of the UFO community after my experience. I'd like to tell family and friends, but I know that I'll be judged harshly for it. It's awful, how so many ignorant people laugh believers off the stage. At the very least, I'm happy to be able to share my first experience with an identified flying object.",2014-10-03T00:00:00,45.6173,-122.236

I would write it off as a spectacular green falling star except I had seen this same thing back in 2007.  In 2007, I was driving south on I-25 just south of the CO & NM state line when I witnessed the same event.  The only difference was that in 2007, the area was completely open ranch land with rolling hills.  As I approached the area I thought it had gone to ground, I witnessed a green glow in the pre-dawn sky.   After I got closer, I realized the bright green ball of light or fire was hovering around 30-40 ft above the ground.  It had a conical shape light extending from the green ball to the ground that reminded me of a street lamp shining on the ground.  I'm not positive, but I believe the cone shaped light was not green but white or yellow.  As I came over the last hill to where the green ball and cone light were, where I intended to try to photograph with my cell phone, it had disappeared. Unfortunately the green ball & tail I observed last night went down behind that small mountain so I did not see if it hovered as it did the previous time.

I noticed a red pulsing light between some houses across the street from our place, around the corner.  I mentioned it to my mother and then I lost sight of it. Once we approached the main road, we saw the light again, across the street from us, high enough up.  From that distance it looked to be about the size of a nickel, sometimes appearing to grow to the size of a quarter and sometimes a little bigger.  I noticed it seemed to follow us, so we stopped moving to make sure.  When we stopped moving, it was ahead of us, but moved back toward us.  If we stood still to watch it a while, we noticed multiple lights and different colors (red, blue, green, white, yellow and purple).   It also seemed to pulse at regular intervals, as if to convey some kind of code.  It moved up, down, sideways, go around in a circle, backwards and then would do some type of movement which looked like it was riding a wave. It in fact did follow us all the way to the store and back home again, until we lost sight of it. Note:  I did see something similar on 09/12/2014 while driving up to the country, I first saw it on one side of the car, seemingly following the same path, then lost sight of it, then saw it again on the other side of the car for a while until I couldn’t see it anymore.   The whole thing lasted about 20 minutes. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) To whom it may concern,  I feel pretty silly about all of this but a few days ago, I found a video on Youtube showing an LED kite which apparently, some students from Rideau High School in Ottawa were flying a few streets down from my place, on the very same night I thought I saw a UFO (09/16/2014).  Here is the video I saw:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEwCBT-1KsI From this video, it's pretty obvious that the object seen is NOT a UFO, but from my perspective and location it looked rather blurry in the distance and moved oddly and could have easily been mistaken for a UFO or something other than a kite.  It definitely looked nothing like what you see in the video but exhibited the same colors.  That is why I I feel pretty confident that what we see in this video must be what I saw - same night around the same time.  I still feel pretty silly.  The only thing I can't account for is the red light, which, like I said, had followed a friend and I on a country road a few days before.

Two extremely bright shining lights appeared high in the sky - looking north. They were lined up horizontally and evenly apart by the same distance, but were pretty far away from each other, as they were so far away.  I could hold up my fingers in front of me, with my index finger and my middle finger in the shape of a ""V"" and the two bright lights were evenly spaced - perfectly with the tips of my fingers, making a perfect ""triangle"" shape with my hand and fingers placed this way.  I was basically holding a ""peace"" sign in the air, to try and judge the distance between the two lights.  (The two lights would be the base of the triangle, and the point at my knuckle, between the index and middle finger would be the point of the triangle. These two bright white lights appeared to ascend high into the sky quickly, moving the same direction toward the northern star. The view of the north star is directly north of my house way up in the sky, so I have a perfect view of the northern star. The lights were moving really fast, but they were moving straight up, and appeared to be going straight toward the star.  The further away they got, the dimmer the light was.  They appeared to dim evenly, and this made me think they were going in the same direction at the same speed. Eventually, they got so small you could no longer see the light.  The best way to describe it would be comparing it to a balloon floating into the air, and watching it until it was so far away, you could not see it any longer.  These two lights were VERY intense in color. We have planes fly overhead at night often, and these were NOT planes. It was the strangest thing I have ever seen. It was a clear night, with stars visible, and light overcast. No lightning, bad weather, etc. The best way to describe the light would be Car Headlights. They were bright like car headlights..Also, I need to note that these lights were not directly overhead, they were off in the distance (toward the north) at least a few miles away, or probably even further. WE have a tall tree in our neighbors front yard, so from the top of this tall oak tree, the lights appeared about halfway from the top of the tree to the north star in the northern sky. I am curious to know if anyone else in my area reported the lights?",2014-09-18T00:00:00,34.80443913043478,-96.70345652173914

She took a right onto Island Pond Road in Derry, NH, after passing the fields on either side of the road, she noticed two hot air balloons floating along up above her to the right of her car.  She quickly shot two pictures through her windshield.  The first showed one balloon, a large yellow balloon with a smile face on one side of the balloon above the tree line from the angle she shot the picture at.   The second picture she took a moment later shows two hot air balloons, the large yellow smile face one and a multi-colored balloon with white designs, what seems to be a cloud still higher up above the multi-colored balloon and two shiny circles above and to the right of the smile hot air balloon.   There is also what seems to be a double vapor trail and two white shapes which could be clouds to the far right in the upper corner of the picture; it's a bit hard to tell.   When she sent the picture to me from her smart phone, I was able to use the touch screen to enlarge the picture and it looks like the two large white circles are lights with a rectangular gray colored shape behind the bright lighted circles.  There is nothing else near it and we are both baffled as to what this could be. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible reflection from glass in front of camera??

I never looked away, but I tried pulling up my camera. I was just about to head inside after it had passed over the trees, but then I saw another.  I was so transfixed by what I was seeing, I couldn't bring myself to come to my senses and get my camera ready, and I figured it would have been really difficult to see anyway. There were 4 of them; one right after the other.  It's hard to describe what they looked like, and I'm hoping they're just some form of aircraft I've never seen before. There were five large, round, blue lights: one in the center and one on each end of these rectangular-shaped wings.  They seemed to be black, and flying not much higher than the trees in my area.  They were fully symmetrical (even though it's hard to see in country darkness) and flying very low to the ground. Once all 4 had flown by and I the sound started fading in the distance, I rushed inside to see if anyone else had seen or heard them.  Perhaps 10 minutes later, there were maybe 20 other aircraft flying at a much higher altitude which we all just assumed were military jets, though that would be unclear.  They were extremely loud and were going in the same direction as the aircraft that had initially passed by. I have yet to be offered an explanation as to what the first 4 were and I'm hoping I can find someone who might be able to tell me what they were or saw the same thing.

On November 23, 2014, at 6:20 pm I believe I saw an unidentified flying object.   My room is seperate from the house.  To get into the house I have to walk up the back deck leading to the back door of the house.  So, on my way into the house from my room I looked up into a pretty dark sky.  Cloudy.   There directly northward were 3 lights.  Pretty big lights.  The shape was indescribable from the distance. I examined them as closely as I could.  They had my attention because the more I looked the more I realized that these are not the airplane or helicopter lights that are commonly seen at night in my SE Portland area near the Sellwood Bridge.  (Which by the way is currently under construction.)   On any night one would have no problem spotting airplanes coming from the south.  More common than ones coming from the north.  I've seen as many as 4 helicopters hovering over the city at one time late at night from 11pm and on.   Anyways, there I stood on the deck right outside th! e back door looking at these 3 lights that I noticed moved around very strangely in ways you could not expect from conventional aircraft.  Side to side.  Down, up and in circles.  While it was hard to see the shape I could see they were orange and red in color.  And sometimes just white.   As 2 of the lights slowly began to fade away, 2 more extra bright lights slowly began to appear from the horizon.  They moved higher and higher.  The first 3 had some manner of formation but were definitely independent of each other.  The 2 new bright lights came in formation but then split up as they got closer to the rest.   For a short time all 5 were together before 2 of what I believe were the first set of 3 faded away out of sight.  The 3 remaining did a slow dance.  Unpredictable in nature.  And offbeat.  At least 2 or 3 more times I saw 1 or 2 fade away and another 1 or 2 appear to rise from the horizon.   There were too many objects in my vision down lower for me to see where they may be coming from but if I were to guess I would say at least 5 or 6 miles aw! ay.  Probably more, not sure. I shot some shaky video. They only appear to be dots of light on camera.  But, I asked my mother to come look and she watched them for at least a couple minutes.   The entire spectacle lasted about 10 minutes but who knows how long they had been there before I noticed them.  The airport is about 15 miles northeast of where I live. East of where I saw these UFOs.  I live about 15 blocks from the river.  After doing a quick search my mother discovered that there was a UFO sighting earlier the same day in Paris, France.  Sort of similar to what I saw.  I feel like there is more details I should be giving but I'm forgetting.  I called my brother who lives within 2 miles away to look up and see it.  His girlfriend answered the phone and as I was giving my reason for calling they started to fade away.  When I got off the phone they made at least one more brief appearance before disappearing for the last time.  I guess that's all for now.  I'm working on getting a hold of l! ocal news.

We can only conclude that the report may be a hoax.  PD)) Hello,   I witnessed something last night I cannot explain.  I got home around 6:30 and decided to take a load off and chill on my deck. I wear prosthetic legs and those things really rub me raw sometimes.  So I tossed them on the bed and quickly made my way to the deck to enjoy a beverage.  I was sitting there relaxing when a storm began rolling in from the west.  I figured I had  few minutes before I had to drag myself back into the house, so I watched the clouds forming and lightning flashing in the distance, amazing stuff!    As the storm was about a mile off, I noticed a shiny object in the clouds, lit up by lightening. I thought it was a jet liner trying to get to CLT before it got diverted.  Boy was I wrong!   The more I watched the more I realized it was not a plane. It would seemingly tele-port from one area to the next in and out of the storm, and then far away. Needless to say I was stunned, and I totally lost track of the time and the storm. Within minutes the storm was right on top of my house, and so was the silver object, which I can now see was a huge ball! I watched, helplessly as it danced in and out of the clouds seemingly feeding off the lighting. I was terrified more of the object than of being struck by lighting. I've watched enough shows on cable to know what happens next.  I could feel all the hairs on my arms and stumps standing up! But I wasn't sure if it was from the object or the storm! The thing was no farther than 300 ft from the top of my house at one point! It appeared to be about 100 feet in diameter and changed colors rapidly. Unbelievable! Of course this is the one time I left the phone on the kitchen table...  That is the last thing I remember doing last night after I saw that damn thing! I woke up today a bit disoriented, and sore.  Any help or explanation from you guys would really set my mind at ease.",2014-09-05T00:00:00,35.23324977973568,-81.17918458149781

They where so close, that they lighted up the tops of the houses and trees with a red orange glow. They where about 40 to 50 feet in Diameter ""Size of a small house"". The craft at the center where spheres, and had an orange red arch welder like corona around the ships that extended out from the ship about 10 feet or so. These ships approached from the south ""Texas Area I Am Assuming As These Exact 3 Craft where sighted in Texas August 28th 2 days before they arrived in Ogallala"" and where headed over Ogallala in a northern heading at an extreme high rate of speed ""faster than a supersonic jet by far"". Directly over my home, 2 of them came to an almost immediate stop. Amazing to think of the forces required to do this ""try slamming on your brakes in your car when your going 40 miles per hour and you will be violently thrown forward into the dashboard, now try to do this while going thousands of miles an hour and slamming on your brakes! Instant human jelly all over the dash board!"". These craft purposely hovered over my house, and for 2 to 3 minutes made percision maneuvers and formation flying. The third vehicle was so low to the tops of the houses as to be actually below the tops of the trees. All 3 craft lighted up the night sky with a red/orange hue and glow. Also cast this glow onto the tops of my house and nearby tree tops and roofs of other houses. Then with utterly amazing speed they shot off north towards the resort lake here in ogallala nebraska, in which many many people must have seen these craft, because they where so bright, and doing such amazing things! Since seeing these craft I have learned that thousands of people have been seeing them over! the last several years in ever increasing numbers! In fact, G! oogle: & quot;Red Globes In Sky"" and many hundreds of recorded and reported sightings have been uploaded to youtube and other websites of these vehicles in action! Where is the media and government on this??!! This is clearly happening on a massive scale over every major city in the United States and Globally!!! Clearly a massive media and government cover up of these Red Orange Orb Craft is now underway! The fact that these VERY SAME 3 craft where seen over Texas only 2 days before, means that who ever is piloting these craft ARE PURPOSELY MAKING THEMSELVES SEEN ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES! Who!? Why?! And where is the Government and Media on this obvious MASSIVE DISPLAY over America and Globally!!! And P.S., why in a obscure cow town in Mid-West Nebraska, did these space craft pick the home of the Chairman & CEO of the International Space Agency to specifically hover over! Hmm....?! Very Perplexing! My sighting was co-observed with a local resident of Ogallala who is my Neighbor, whose name is Kenny. This was confirmed by a good friend Les, who is with the Coast Guard on Lake Ogallala, who actually missed this amazing event by leaving my house only 3 to 4 minutes before these events unfolded. These are indeed some kind of ships, and ARE NOT Flying Lanterns or Comets or Helicopters or Aircraft! These craft where so close to us, we saw them very well indeed! And my background of 16 years in Military and Civilian Aviation, I KNOW WHAT IS SAW! Also I am a Scientist and have much knowledge of these things and events, and THEY ARE CRAFT! I do NOT believe they are under Human Control, other than that I am clueless!  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV46wzG5zHCPeVaN433uYLQfeO1VLZtTs  See the above video playlist.

We can only conclude that the report may be a hoax. PD))   Hello,  I witnessed something last night I cannot explain. I got home around 6:30 and decided to take a load off and chill on my deck. I wear prosthetic legs and those things really rub me raw sometimes. So I tossed them on the bed and quickly made my way to the deck to enjoy a beverage. I was sitting there relaxing when a storm began rolling in from the west. I figured I had few minutes before I had to drag myself back into the house, so I watched the clouds forming and lightning flashing in the distance, amazing stuff!  As the storm was about a mile off, I noticed a shiny object in the clouds, lit up by lightening. I thought it was a jet liner trying to get to CLT before it got diverted. Boy was I wrong!  The more I watched the more I realized it was not a plane. It would seemingly tele-port from one area to the next in and out of the storm, and then far away. Needless to say I was stunned, and I totally lost track of the time and the storm. Within minutes the storm was right on top of my house, and so was the silver object, which I can now see was a huge ball! I watched, helplessly as it danced in and out of the clouds seemingly feeding off the lighting. I was terrified more of the object than of being struck by lighting. I've watched enough shows on cable to know what happens next.  I could feel all the hairs on my arms and stumps standing up! But I wasn't sure if it was from the object or the storm! The thing was no farther than 300 ft from the top of my house at one point! It appeared to be about 100 feet in diameter and changed colors rapidly. Unbelievable! Of course this is the one time I left the phone on the kitchen table...  That is the last thing I remember doing last night after I saw that damn thing! I woke up today a bit disoriented, and sore.  Any help or explanation from you guys would really set my mind at ease.",2014-09-10T00:00:00,35.23324977973568,-81.17918458149781

All of a sudden, I noticed what looked like a fluorescent light tube in the sky,in front of the sunset. It was perfectly vertical, appeared to be emitting it's own light and not moving, although the sunset was sinking below the horizon behind this tube. The tube remained illuminated in a white light. It remained stationary until the sunset was gone and at that point it began to fade until I could no longer see it.

I decided to take the long route just to enjoy the night and drive around the neighborhood a bit (opposite direction as my usual route, wouldn't have seen this occurrence had I not taken new route). As I pulled out of my driveway and turned to progress down the street, I noticed a large (perspectively about the size of a pea held in your hand) green light in the sky absolutely railing Southwards. It progressed in speed for a matter of a few moments, grew in brightness, and then abruptly disappeared as I kept my eyes peeled in the direction that I saw it in with no avail with the intentions of another sighting. I have communicated with a few acquaintances of mine, and apparently they have experienced the same thing. What absolutely astounded me was the clarity of the light, it was quite blatantly either very low to the ground or a type of lighting that I have not witnessed bef! ore in my life. Equally astounding, though, was the apparent frictionless flight that this object had attained. It was the cleanest moving, brightest object I've ever seen in my life. Others that have seen the same thing claim that the same two details, being the frictionless flight and the brightness of the light, were aspects of the sight that stuck with them and astounded them as well. It was an odd feeling night, at that. Had a very different feel to it.  This is one of many experiences that I have had witnessing UFOs, not strictly of this sort (this is the first of this sort that I've seen). Also, the first I'm reporting.

I have had several sightings in our area in the last 6 months.  I grabbed my binoculars and went outside to look.  To the south I could see the mountains, (we call the Clockum, & Mission Ridge) and above that was a cloud layer, and above the cloud layer in the blackened sky were flashing red, white and green lights, that were flashing in what appeared to be a circular motion.  I could see them flash but they would disappear and reappear as if they were going around something.  I could see 4 different areas in the sky where these lights were flashing in this way.   They stayed stationary for at least 20 minutes, then one started moving southwest and finally disappeared from my view. The others stayed fairly stationary. I contacted a third friend and told him to look. He too has seen a UFO on the same nights as I have, and even got video of one.  He looked in the sky, and could see them, he also saw a blue light in the sky. He took a picture and sent it to me.  He has since blown up the images on his computers. I then looked over towards the southwest and could see an orange orb stationary over the mountain top.  I could see an orange and red glowing object thru my binoculars, it was also quite large without binoculars, as I pulled the binoculars down to look with the naked eye, then looked thru the binoculars again it was gone.   I looked back over to where the flashing red and white lights were, and they too were gone.  So crazy. This is happening often here.  My 4 dogs were highly sensitive while outside, barking a lot.

This craft was huge and a dark red almost like a dark cherry red.  It was totally lit up and glowing.  I could'nt really see any details except it was basically disc shaped  and maybe 100 feet long and not very tall.  It looked like 2 plates joined together. This object looked totally different than anything else I've seen lately and it looked like it was sitting on the west side of this hill on the grass.  During my 5 to 10 minutes I watched this object it moved from right to left about 200 yards really slow like at a walking pace.  Then it just seemed to disappear like a light switch turning off.  There were several other craft in the immediate area but they were really low key and barely visible unless you had binoculars.  There was no sound heard except for the crickets outside.  This is the second time in 9 days I believe I've seen a landed craft in this same spot and the other night on 9-12-14 I just happened to be filming with a camcorder and captured a craft that changed color from orange to white and basically moved from right to left about 200 yards on this hill. It could be that it was flying or hovering in front of the hill but even that is basically impossible for a normal aircraft. These craft (with the exception of the red disc) all look the same. They look like an ice cream cone turned sideways so the white light or orangish light is  on the left and there is a black pointed tail shape to the right. They look like craft seen on Area 51 footage that I've seen in amateur footage. There were other white and orange lights that joined this craft that I have on f! ilm on 9-12-14 and a second craft looks like it's sitting on t! he right corner on the top of this hill.Anyway this hill in Corte Madera has these huge objects that approach from the east and hover over the left corner of this hill like a lit up Christmas tree and then they go backwards and down on the S.F. Bay side of the hill and then either the same object or another identical object will do the exact same thing and sink down behind the hill. If you are standing up in the hills you can really notice this activity and I wish more people would notice this. Any doubts I had that these might be conventional aircraft seen at a distance were laid to rest one night in April of this year when I was directly involved in one of the most bizarre close encounters-landing-other worldly encounter that was so unbelievable I still can't believe it.,2014-09-25T00:00:00,37.925684000000004,-122.513884

September 21 2014 To whom it may concern,  	Last night at approximately 10:40 p.m. on Saturday September 20th 2014, I witnessed a circular object hovering above a building right outside my work place.  I had just clocked off from work and went outside to grab a change of clothes.  Four of my co-workers were outside smoking a cigarette. When I came out they were all staring up above the building directly across from the south side employee parking lot which was approximately 30 feet from where we were.  As I glanced up to see what they were looking at I was immediately shocked at what I saw, a bright orange circular ball. The object appeared to be the same height as a small aircraft but with a much brighter light. It was bright orange but not solid orange.  It had changing orange hues within the craft, similar to the movements of fire, except that it looked more solid then fire.  The center appeared to be changing from a darker orange to lighter orange.  The object hovered for about 30 seconds from the time I stepped outside to witness it.  After hovering the object took off at a very fast speed high up into the night sky. You could still see the faint orange ball traveling for about two minutes before completely disappearing.  At that point you wouldn’t have been able to differentiate it from a star. The best description I can give you is that it looked like a hovering fireball, however when it zoomed off there was no orange tracer like fire would leave.  Also, while the orange ball was hovering there was very slight horizontal movement from left to right.  My co-workers and I agree that it mostly resembled a floating fireball but with a solidity to it.",2014-09-25T00:00:00,43.61444520153551,-116.24467802303263

From my backyard in northeast Los Angeles, at approximately 5:18 pm on November 24, 2014, I looked toward the western horizon after sunset.  The sky was a deep cobalt blue with the rapidly approaching night.  I then saw a pair of red lights blinking in rapid succession due west about 50 degrees above the horizon.  The apparent size of the lights was comparable to the apparent size of a star. The lights moved in a steady fashion and in a slow apparent speed.  They moved forward as if flying side by side from one another (instead of in a line, trailing each other).  The red lights were approximately 15 degrees apart from my vantage point. The distance between the lights did not change during my observation.  The lights blinked in a definite pattern which did not change (left-left.….right-left-right-right……..left-left….right-left-right-right…..in rapid succession.)  The two blinking red lights moved slowly north and then continued off to the northwest until no longer visible at approximately 5:26pm.  There was no sound associated with the lights as far as I can tell. The relative positions of the lights as they moved gave me the impression that I was witnessing a massive winged aircraft flying silently in the sky, with each blinking red light located at the end of each wing.   However, no aircraft (spacecraft?) assembly was discernable between the two blinking lights.  No other lights were associated with my observation, such as the constant glow of green and red lights one normally sees in civilian aircraft.

At the midpoint of their travel path from my vantage point I estimate the objects were 5 miles from me.  They had an estimated separation of ¼ mile with the orange red light source in the lead.  That separation was maintained for the entire sighting. It took an estimated 90 seconds for the objects to traverse the sky from east to south west. I listened for engine noise but could hear nothing, even after I turned off my radio and fan.  This is odd as I have lots of commercial and military air traffic in my area.  Aircraft even at 40,000 feet always leave a noise trail as they pass over my property. I was hesitant to make this report but I have never seen such an event as this!  The orange red object did not appear to me to be a normal aircraft.  As it was essential a point source of light I do not know what it was. My location is approximately 5 miles due east of Interstate highway 59 exit 35 in Mississippi. I am a retired Lockheed Senior Manufacturing Engineer with 25 years of service in the Space Shuttle External Tank program at the NASA Michoud Facility in New Orleans.  I am also a 4-year Air Force veteran who worked on an ICBM launch crew.  Bona Fides are available if needed.",2014-09-18T00:00:00,31.010699999999996,-89.4561

I again looked up, and there in the sky we both saw a triangle shaped flying object with flashing red lights that alternated with turquoise blue when it slowed down or changed speed.  At one point it for a moment hovered a bit.   We realized then, it was perhaps a UFO.  The pattern it flew was like it was “mapping” the sky.  I mean, it did not fly straight and then away.  It would come back from the North and then South again.   My friend ran into her home. I continued to watch it from my window.

There was an indistinct shape faintly outlined against the night sky, which I took to be a plane, that had a steady golden light on either end, where the wing tips would be. As I watched, the lights faded out completely and the object was no longer visible against the sky. It had appeared to be approaching me over the slight dips and swells of the landscape in that area. The area is devoid of trees, mountains or hills, and there are no large buildings to obstsruct the view. It struck me as odd so I began to scan the sky as well as I could and continue driving. About a minute later, I saw a golden light ahead of me, more towards the Nampa area now, which was the direction I was headed. I thought that if it were the same object it must've been moving fairly rapidly, or the light may've just not been as bright, making me think it was further away than it was. The night was completely clear with a little over a 1/4 moon, which if it was considered to be at a 12 o'clock position,! the light I was now seeing would have been about 7 o'clock. This light also dimmed until it faded from view. I was now intensely interested in what might be flying overhead. Two minutes later, I saw the light again, but this time it had either split into two objects or had been joined by another, since I could see what appeared to be two separate sets of lights. The lights now appeared quite a bit closer to me than before, much as the first ones had-and I'd estimate that to have not been over a half mile from me. There was one fairly bright golden light (I would say that it was nearly as bright as a very bright star, but not as bright as Venus appears)that remained steady, but the second object had, first one light, then as it dimmed and went out, a second one lit, and as IT dimmed and went out, a third one lit, and then it dimmed and went out, as did the single light. The 3 lights that lit and dimmed in sequence were almost verticle from my point of view, and the sequence! of lighting and dimming began at the top and ended at the bot! tom.

Low earth orbit? Clear night, many stars visible, moon was close and bright but only 90 percent full.  What I thought was a bright and low satellite (bright solid white light, no blinking) was traveling (to the west of my position) steadily from the north, southeast bound.   I observed it for about 3 seconds (it covered 10 horizontal degrees in that time) when a much dimmer (further away looking and blue tint) object came from approximately 5-7 lateral degrees above the bright object (or above and to the west of it, from my vantage point) and changed course, following the bright objects path.  The lesser object stayed about 15-20 horizontal degrees behind the bright object when the lesser object CLEARLY changed course to follow, but the bright object gained another 10 degrees between the two (either the bright object sped up or the lesser object slowed but it seemed like the former).  They traveled another 20 lateral degrees south, towards the moon (just a reference point), an! d I noticed a third object (looking exactly like the lesser object) dropped down from approximately 10 lateral degrees above the bright object (which then began to travel more southeast than south) and it CLEARLY changed course to follow the bright object.  The two lesser objects were close together at this point (2-5 lateral degrees between the two), obviously chasing the bright object, and all three covered about 10-15 lateral degrees before the bright object just faded out (like a fast dimming off) and the two lesser objects separated about 5 lateral degrees and, together, turned more east but still heading south until they got too far for me to see.  All three objects covered 5-10 horizontal degrees at a given time.  NO blinking lights at any point from any of these objects.  I believe this was low earth orbit, not in the atmosphere.  At about 22:50, the same night (sept. 4), .25 miles west of SR-17, on Merion Rd., I was looking at Ursa Major when another object that looked like the lesser objects from earlier, dropped down 10-15 degrees in about 3-5 seconds, steadily, and slowly stopped and began to blink a red light.  It dropped from the furthest (from the handle) east most, top star of the “pot”, but barely on the inside of it, below the lowest and furthest star in the “pot”, stopped, began blinking the red light, lightly, and just behaved like a plane at this point, heading west slowly.  It took about 20 seconds for it to travel west, below ursa major, and then appeared to stay in that vicinity.  I left after about 5 minutes of keeping an eye on it but it got dimmer and dimmer so it may have been getting further from me.  I was facing northwest of my position on Merion Rd.  There are always military craft out in that area, day and night, and I have come to the conclusion that the only options, of what these were, are either military and extra terrestrial, or just extraterrestrial.  Unless, of course, there are private industry high altitude to space fights and chases going on.  Very strange and active night.  I have NEVER had such solid clarification of objects I see in the sky (that aren’t regular aircraft) being under immediate intelligent control.

Except when I looked closer at it, it was flickering incredibly fast between mostly white, but also blue and red. The lights flickered for the duration of the event. It then occurred to me that the shape was not regular for a star and rather than a dot, it was a long cross-like shape.  At first it appeared stationary, but then I found a place to view it where I could set it against a stationary object in the foreground, and observed it was actually moving. It listed to the left, or right, sort of randomly and moved slightly downwards several times. Movement seemed random, just sort of listlessly floating around, and then it started rising up. As it rose, it became slightly more dim and moved up very, very slowly, appearing as if it were moving away from the earth at a very acute angle of ascent.  We live near an airport, so I see and hear planes coming and going all the time, and this did not appear to be a plane. The flashing lights were reminiscent of a police siren, and it was far too far away and/or small to be a plane. I observed it with binoculars, but could see no increased details. Eventually, after twenty to thirty minutes of slowly moving away and up it became too faint to view and by then the sun was up enough that we lost sight of it.  It continued moving in a Southwesterly direction for the duration of the event in an area of the sky that lies south of the airport I am near.

Giant levitating triangle followed our car with four people inside from Stone Cliff to Oak Hill.,Oak Hill,WV,2014-11-25T18:30:00,triangle,2 hours,"Occurred : 11/25/2014 18:30  (Entered as : 11/25/14 18:30) Reported: 11/26/2014 9:40:37 AM 09:40 Posted: 11/26/2014 Location: Oak Hill, WV Shape: Triangle Duration:2 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115633.html,"Giant levitating triangle followed our car with four people inside from Stone Cliff to Oak Hill. I was taking an evening drive with my sister and our two friends.  Around 6:00 pm we drove to Thurmond to look at the stars and watch the night sky, which was clear at this time.  We stopped the car and got out at the Stone Cliff sand bar.  We sat and watched the sky for around 30 minutes before we noticed a very bright, bouncing light up on the ridge line across the river.  Then we noticed there was two other dimmer lights that moved as a unit with the bright light, this is how we realized it was triangular.  The lights on the craft became very dim at times, but then they would brighten. We got in the car and drove up on the bridge at Stone Cliff to get a better view.  This is when we noticed the craft stayed parallel and kept up with us as we drove, though it was still across the river and hovering up over the ridge line relatively far away from us.  It moved  and rotated very quickly, faster than any plane, helicopter, or satellite and it was also very large, but completely silent.  We drove toward Thurmond near the ranger station and pulled over again, and this is when we noticed the craft crossing the river and hovering toward us.  The triangular shape became larger as it neared us, it hovered over the tree line and stayed behind us.  We were fearful at this point and began driving back toward Oak Hill.  The craft followed the road, hovering above the tree and ridge line, while maintaining a close distance to our car.  At one point the giant, levitating triangle was directly above us. On the drive home from Thurmond we pulled over several times (at Red Star and Hilltop) and got out of the vehicle in order to view the triangle.  The craft stayed within our vicinity most of the drive back to town, but I lost sight for a short time.  I regained sight of the craft when we came to the intersection at Route 19, because I saw it hovering far above the road, and the lights on the craft seemed to be bouncing again.  As we neared the lights of Oak Hill I lost sight of the triangle once more, but when we arrived at my house the craft had followed us there.  The triangle was closer to the surface of the earth than it had been before, hovering above the tree line. We stood on my drive way and I showed my mother and other friend the craft.  The time was around 8:00 or 8:30 pm at this time and clouds had began moving in and the craft had become very dim.  The craft moved to a clearing in the clouds above my house, at this time my friend had no trouble viewing the craft, as its lights had become bright again. All witnesses agree that we saw an extraordinary levitating triangle in the sky, though it was clearer and brighter at times.  Only 4 of us witnessed the triangle at Stone Cliff, but 6 people (that I know of) saw the triangle when it was in Oak Hill.  The whole sighting lasted around 2 hours, most of the viewing at Stone Cliff and Thurmond, but it hovered over our neighborhood for a quite awhile (until we lost sight due to cloud coverage).  I know this is an incredibly long UFO sighting, and strange because the triangle noticed and followed us.  I believe it could have easily abducted us if had it wanted to, but the triangle only observed us without interaction.

To my pleasant surprise, just two months since my first UFO sighting over Lake Union in Seattle, I witnessed four unusual light shapes again tonight - very close to the same location they made their appearance in July.  What caught my eye this evening were 4 bright lights slightly north east of the Space Needle from my vantage point where I was gazing south toward the Space Needle. Each object appeared triangular shaped with lights at each point. However, it seemed there was a light in the center of each as well.  They struck me initially as probably being lanterns, though unusually shaped if in fact lanterns.  As I kept my eye on them they did not seem to characterize lanterns floating through the air due to their tight triangular formation while moving upward then sideways in perfect synchronicity.  One object was positioned to the left of the other three in their triangular formation.  The object on the left from my view faded within approximately 20 seconds after I first spotted them all. I snapped a 26 second video, then two photos of the remaining three objects from my iPhone while standing on my front deck then lost view as they moved further east and were hidden behind a neighboring building.  I ran through my house and up my dock to zoom in on them once again.  I was able to snap two more photos, though they did not appear clearly in the brighter light from this angle.  They seemed to turn southward and disappeared within about 20 more seconds from my new viewing spot. Following their disappearance there was a single helicopter hovering over the middle of Lake Union facing the direction these objects had been seen. I will include the video clip and the original two photos that are the most clear I was able to capture. ((NUFORC Note:  Second similar sighting by the same witness over Lake Union.

Two 3-legged/pronged shaped UFO seen flying along interstate between Elizabethtown and Louisville,Elizabethtown,KY,2014-09-06T00:00:00,triangle,15-45 minutes,"Occurred : 9/6/2014 00:00  (Entered as : 09/06/2014 0:00) Reported: 9/6/2014 10:22:54 AM 10:22 Posted: 9/10/2014 Location: Elizabethtown/Louisville (travelling between), KY Shape: Triangle Duration:15-45 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113320.html,"Two 3-legged/pronged shaped UFO seen flying along interstate between Elizabethtown and Louisville I was on a Megabus route from Nashville TN to Louisville Kentucky, sitting on the top level in the very front of the bus in front of the large window.  The entire duration of the sighting probably lasted forty five minutes from when I first noticed it but only maybe 15 minutes of it in full sight as it would dip above and below the tree line as we traveled, the craft not in sight for the full forty five minutes.  The entire time that it was in my view it was either flying to the side of the bus or directly ahead of the bus to the left side of the interstate.  I first noticed a formation to the right side of the bus that I could not make out what it was, but it was composed of blinking red and white lights almost as an airplane would look, and very far away and high in the sky.  At the time the formation was so odd, it was almost in an L-shape, almost looked like an apache, but I've seen many of those fly between where I live in Nashville and Fort Campbell military base, and as it dropped in altitude I realized that that was not what it was.  As it continued to drop in altitude and it was still flying in front and to the right of the bus, I could see more detail in the lights and it took on a V or chevron shape.  Then as we traveled the craft went out of sight, and that's when maybe 10 minutes later I saw one appear very close on the left side of the interstate.  (the shape of the craft was not changing, only what I could see of it and make out.  I suspect that my first view of it only seeing the lights in an L-shape, that the cra! ft was actually facing sideways, whereas the rest of the sighting I am looking at the back of the craft as it flies forward.) It would change elevation very fluidly and speed up and slow down.  When I saw this craft appear, I realized that it was not a V or chevron shape (that i thought could have perhaps been explained by a B52 stealth bomber-like military aircraft) but that it was actually the shape of a three-pointed star or a three-pronged/legged craft with white lights on the tip of each prong and flashing red lights in the center.  That is when I took my phone out and started filming video of it and when it came closer into view I managed a photo of it.  The large craft that I watched on the left stayed consistently in view for at least 10 minutes.  Then a few minutes later, unfortunately I was not filming at this point, it dropped very very low, maybe only a couple hundred feet above the treeline (created by the wooded area that lined the interstate) and the ambient ! lights from the cars and street lights on the interstate manag! ed to sh ed enough light where I could see the underside of the craft, and that is when I realized that it was not a V shape, but a 3 pronged or legged craft.  The entire underside of it was illuminated to a light beige or grey color (I did not see any shine on it) and I could see the full shape of it.  When it came so close to the ground I realized it was an extremely large craft and something I would not estimate to only carry one individual, rather a craft that would have been designed to carry either multiple smaller craft or cargo.  There were clearly no wings on it or propellers and no other signs of any external mechanisms that could have been propelling the craft.  Also, the way in which the three legs of the craft were aligned did not seem to be in an aerodynamic fashion as you would see on triangular shaped military planes or aircraft, but rather a 3-pointed star with the legs equidistant from each other that was able to somehow fly very fluidly and very quickly.  I have no! idea what was propelling this craft as there were no signs of any trails or substance (like fuel) being emitted by the craft.  I also did not hear any strange sounds during the sighting, or see any kind glowing haze, smoke, or aura.  The nature of the blinking red and white lights that adorned the edges and tips of the pronged craft lead me to believe that they were actually light bulbs flashing just as you would see on a plane, but the craft was clearly not like anything man-made that I have seen before, or that has been known to the public as any type of aircraft or drone.  (I tried to also take video or pictures of this instance but my phone camera would not capture the lights as they were not bright enough and too far away.)  Then later as the bus was coming into Louisville off the interstate and the large craft on the left had disappeared over the horizon/tree line (it dipped down very low and I could no longer see it) I look to the right of the bus and can see two lights in the distance, just barely larger than stars.  I could see the red and white individual lights clustered together and realized that the two 'stars' were actually the craft I had seen, and that there were 2, not just one.  For at least a minute, I could watch them ascend and drop altitude, very, very quickly, rising directly upwards and falling directly downwards.  They were then very far away with an enormous distance between them vertically.  The UFO that was highest in the sky flew ahead of the one below it, then stopped, and the UFO below it flew ahead so that it was i! n front of the one above it.  Then they seemed to be changing altitude.  Unfortunately by this point the bus was in the city and my view of the UFOs was eclipsed by a building and I could not see them after this point.  During the sighting, I did look at other people who were on the bus with me and could see them also watching the craft, looking perplexed, but as it was between 12am and 1am, most on the bus were sleeping or had earphones in listening to music, so no one talked about it to each other, but it was very clear that others were seeing it as well.  The strange thing to me is that I have google searched trying to find images of the craft that I saw and I cannot find anything like it.  I have looked for images of all shapes of UFOs, all known military aircraft new and old, including drones.  As I said, I do have multiple videos and images of the craft that I will try to upload from my phone, but I am not on my computer right now so it will have to be in a few days when I am home.  Thank you for receiving my report.  I really want to know if anyone else has ever seen something like this before, and what it could be.",2014-09-10T00:00:00,37.7149671875,-85.856540625

On September 23, I woke from sleep, needing to go to the bathroom.  Next to my bed is a large window that faces due east.  When it is warm I like to prop the window open for fresh air, which I had done this night.  Before I went to the bathroom, I took a look out the window as I usually do.  It was clear and cool and many stars were visible.  I saw Jupiter maybe 10 degrees above the horizon to the ENE, Sirius to the southeast, with the constellation Orion above it.  I know the stars, planets and constellations pretty well as I have been interested in astronomy since I was young.  I own a nice telescope I use on occasion. What was unusual was a bright star like object about 10 degrees above Jupiter and slightly north of it as well.  This object was a bright white color, brighter than both Jupiter or Sirius.  I was a little confused because I look out the window every morning and have not seen this star before. It did not appear to be moving at all.  After about 15 seconds, it suddenly dimmed to a very small pinprick of light, and then dimmed out altogether.  I looked carefully to see if a cloud had passed in front of this star, but it was very clear.  I did see one faint patch of cloud, but this was nowhere near this ""star"". That's it, that is my sighting.  Not very eventful except that I keep seeing objects like this on a regular basis.  Back in April I was going to work early in the morning when I got the impression to look up, and I saw a very bright light just like the one I saw tonight, which also quickly faded out a few seconds later.  Over the past five years or so I have seen about half a dozen lights like this.  You can't help but feel that these objects are appearing for the express purpose that you see them. I am not a nut job, but I know what I am seeing, and I am seeing these objects on a regular basis.  I have a very difficult time believing it is just a coincidence that I repeatedly look up just as some bright military aircraft or other object is hovering in the sky, and then quickly turns off its lights, or jets away.  Altogether, I have seen UFOs about a dozen times in my life, three times up close with much detail.  But the last few years I seem to just ""look up"" and there they are.  What they are I have no clue.   I am rather religious and do not believe these objects are from other planets, I rather believe they are spiritual in nature.  Still, why do I keep seeing these things?  Most people never see a single UFO in their entire life, I have probable seen at least a dozen.  What does it mean?   Oh well, that's it.  I have turned a very short and unremarkable sighting into something big, but when you keep seeing these things, it begins to get to you after awhile.",2014-09-25T00:00:00,41.8394,-73.1255

It was a new moon with nearly no light in the sky yet.  It was a clear night full of stars.   As we rounded a switchback to face East North-east, we saw what looked at first to be a moonbow directly in front of us.  At that point it looked to be “rising” from behind the mountain that we were driving up.  If one compared it to the size of a full moon high in the sky, it would be 100 times that size.   Once we pulled the car to the side of the road, we realized it was a sphere, rather than a two-dimensional semi-circular object. It had a thick, white, glowing rim that was the thickness of a typical rainbow.  Using the “full moon in the sky” size reference again, the white glowing rim was initially the thickness of two full moon’s diameters, side by side. We noticed that the walls or “inside” of the sphere was a translucent white. In the two minutes since we’d first seen the sphere, it had grown – either by expanding or coming nearer to us…we can’t be sure of the perspective.  It had slowly, smoothly grown in size, doubling and then tripling as the “wall” of the sphere came closer to us. We took several pictures as the sphere approached, getting larger (timestamped at 4:53), and there is no sphere visible in those images on either my iPhone or my friend’s camera. The cameras captured the lines in the road and the road signs, but absolute darkness otherwise. The sphere enveloped us.  That is, the translucent wall approaching us and moved past us – over us, through us – and as soon as it did, we could not see the sphere anymore  – neither it’s translucent walls nor the thick white, glowing rim/outline.   In that moment, the wind stopped blowing (had been 20-25mph) and ambient sounds ceased.  Then, the night sky returned to how it had looked before we initially had seen the sphere; wind and sound returned to normal. In reviewing the data on my JawBone UP 24 (fitness band that tracks my walking motion), we spent 25 minutes out of the car, walking/moving (4:39am – 5:04am).  That was a surprise to me. My friend and I agree that to our memory, the entire episode lasted 5 minutes. After watching the sunrise, we stopped at a breakfast spot on the way down the mountain and overheard a tour bus operator asking people if they’d seen “the giant orb”. We shared what we’d seen and it was the same experience in terms of what it looked like and that it seemed to expand or get closer.  At the time, we hadn’t yet realized our experience with loss of time (I discovered that while looking at some data points while writing this account), so we don’t know if that driver had a similar experience.  We did not think to get his name. In coming down the mountain, my friend and I both noticed that everything we saw and heard seemed to be in “high definition.”  That is, colors in nature – plants, flowers, etc. – were (and still are) oversaturated.  We’re more sensitized to sounds and tastes.  I’m not sure what to think of this experience, and so post it here as a possible step in making sense of it through others’ insights, or perhaps similar experiences. Mahalo",2014-09-25T00:00:00,,

When we were at around Winton Churchill Blvd and Steeles Ave, I noticed in the sky what I thought was a comet or something similar.  It looked like a plane contrail except it was heading downwards, and it was very, very white.  Like, there was a large white cloud covering a good portion of the sky behind the object, but this stood out noticeably.  What first brought to our attention that this was not contrail or a comet was the fact that it didn't dissipate or move separately.  Instead, the entire thing would occasionally move down a bit (though this may have been because we were travelling towards it, but it did look like it was moving on its on).  The closer we got, the brighter the object would become. The distance from our car to the object I would estimate between 5-8km. As we were heading further north we lost track of the object because of the trees blocking our view. When we arrived at the destination, we went out in the back to see if we could find the object. In total, I would say we lost the object for about a minute and a half. Where we were now would have been closer to the object, to the point where I was expecting to see detail. However, it was nowhere around us, and was instead very far off in the distance. I can't stress enough how far away this object became. It went from being a very large white object in the sky, to a very bright dot off in the horizon.  As we viewed it, we noticed it occasionally moving sporadically in all directions, but not going too far. I took a picture at this time but all that it shows is a very faint bright white dot (it was much more visible in person). I took a video too but the quality is extremely poor and it is pretty much impossible to see the object. I didn't think to take a picture earlier, because at that point we weren't really convinced it was anything too unusual.  I have to specify how far of a distance this object must have traveled when we lost track of it. It wen't from being completely still in the skies (aside from possibly moving down slightly every so often), to being almost unnoticeable in barely over a minute. I can't even guess how far it must have traveled in that time.",2014-09-25T00:00:00,43.59003236477425,-79.6629041573536

They flew swooping down towards the lake and lit up the whole area.  Across the lake were some high voltage power lines and these disks would intermittently hover over the lines and then fly over the lake.

We were having fun watching and catching fireflies before getting ready for bed.   The sky was clear, the night sky starting to fill with stars.  My neighbor had built a telescope to look at the moon with me and I was looking forward to it. Suddenly, the whole yard filled with bright, white light.

I don't recall the chronology of the rest of the evening's events, but this is what happened:   I became intensely frightened when I saw the white moon.  I realized it couldn't be a moon since I saw no craters.  My mother screamed and carried my sister into the house.  My dad hugged me and we joined our telescope-making neighbors, watching, wondering what we were seeing, he didn't seem frightened.   3 other neighbors joined us and one man said it was a UFO.  I knew what that was.  It remained in the same place for about 20 or 30 minutes and then went straight up and disappeared, very fast. Unfortunately, I am the only person still alive that was in my backyard that night.  I know my mom spoke to other parents about it and one person/child there was in school with me.   But nobody from my grammar school remembers it. I didn't recall the exact date, only what grade I was in and time of year, firefly season.

Dead stop, and took a right turn to move away from me, to the South.  Then it disappeared.  The whole thing took between 3 and 6 seconds, I think. I watched, and within a few seconds, saw another one pop out from behind the tree.  It was moving in the opposite direction of the first, from East to West.

I kept watching and it was like de ja vu.  2 more lights just like the second on exactly the same path, same timing, but I was moving towards them as I watched and I saw some other movement on one of them that was so fast it was hard to catch.

It was too low to be a sattelite, WAY too fast to be an airplane (VERY fast), and COMPLETELY silent.

I was with my friend star gazing, looking up at the sky while lying on a blanket, what happened next occurred at ~23:30 on 9/23/14.  Two pale red lights one sitting right next to the other, appeared out of nowhere, about 3° separated from each other.   They appeared almost directly above us in the sky and hovered there for roughly 10 seconds, they were 90° perpendicular to the ground, dead center in the top of the sky from my perspective, from that point they moved across the sky in an extremely fast fashion at an approximate heading of 180°.   They continued to move across the sky until they disappeared into the atmospheric haze at roughly 10-15° elevation.  During this time it was completely silent, no sounds of motors and/or jets, no flashing beacon/anti-collision lights from aircraft wings or empennages, just two solid red lights.  Based on pure speculation the lights appeared to be roughly 20,000 feet in the air and for them to be moving across the sky in excess of 15-20 degrees second that would have to mean they were moving extremely fast;  Far faster than any aircraft that I know of.

Well, here goes!  After listening to channel 590, CTVSS Northern Ontario News yesterday to confirm sightings of UFO's during 2014 in Canada and USA, specifically in Pennsylvania this past week, I'm coming out!   We had company arriving on August 21st, a Thursday.  A lovely husband and wife team w their 7 month old daughter.  On Friday night, my husband and his friend decided they would camp out on the boat house deck and admire the sky which was filled with stars, not a site u see living in Toronto due to the light pollution. I cannot say exactly what time it was but I'm going to assume it was 10:30-ish, when I and my friend decided to go out to the boat house deck to see how the guys were doing, as it was cool and the dew was coming down.  I brought 'a' glass of white wine w me to enjoy, my friend has had no alcohol at all as she is a new mom and I know your going to ask how much we'd been drinking!  The boys were enjoying a couple of glasses of red wine, when all of a sudden when the three of them were looking off into the Western Sky at the time looking for the Space Station which can sometimes be seen. It was not visible that night, however, I was looking into the North-North East part of the sky when a orange yellow w a hint of red fireball appeared.  It seemed to have just beamed into view and gradually grew larger and larger when at one point it just stood still and then made a U turn and slowly went the other direction as the size grew smaller and then just disappeared!

Green and purple lights over Central Greece for 7 nights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Confirmed to be lens flares.

I’d like to start by apologizing beforehand for any grammar mistakes, as English is not my native language (I’m Greek). During our stay at my father in law’s vacation house in a village in central Greece (Euboea island), I took an interest in night photography (Milky way, constellations etc.) with out newly bought Sony A-5000 large sensor camera.  To my wife’s request, I went to the other side of the house, with a beautiful view at the Aegean sea and the islands of Skiathos and Skopelos and took some night photos of the lights at the port of Skiathos. The first 2 photos I took seemingly had a strong lens diffraction, at least it seemed this way from a glance at the 3 inch screen.  So I continued taking night photos of the lights of Skiathos.  When I got really bored and looked at the sky thinking “maybe a couple more photos of the milky way before sleep,” I saw over my head for about 3 seconds a black disk flying with no sound and going south, towards the village of St. Anna.  When I started feeling my legs again, I remembered the 2 first “bad”photos and reviewed them again using the zoom rocket.  I don’t really know what these lights are, but they kept appearing each night and I kept photographing them.  As I am not a UFO or an X-files fan, I shrugged my shoulders and my life continued with nights out for dinner, walks, playing cards with friends, that is to say I didn’t spend much time sitting in the balcony and shooting in the dark until morning. But every night I devoted half to one hour to this strange occurrence. Unfortunately as today (August 29) we had to leave and return to Athens, last night was the last photos I took, but I’m pretty sure the lights will continue as we speak.  And since Internet access was limited in the village and we didn’t have a pc, we could only do this here in Athens. I send to you by email 5 photos (including the first 2 I mention above), but I have over a hundred, most of them the same (i was shooting with the '3 images continuously' mode) and some not really impressive.  Some of them are a bit out of focus or maybe a little shaken, most of them were taken with the camera sitting on the top of the wall balcony of the house and trying to lift the view by wedging under the camera the neck hanging cord or the lens protector etc. I would also like to mention that the lights were not visible by the eye, every image was taken with a 10 seconds shutter speed or more, so as you can understand,  I was shooting at nothing, hoping that the lights would appear on the screen.  I also experimented by taking a couple of images with a 2.5 seconds shutter speed and the lights got really dark.  I have also taken some of the last images using RAW together with jpeg, in a hope to prove that the photos are not manipulated in any way.  If you think that these images are worth considering,  I would be happy to send to you more or all of them, as well as any relevant information i can. Thank you for your time!

Saw blue ball of light fall from sky then craft seem to check it out then skip across sky like a rock on water extremely fast.,Sayville,NY,2014-08-28T20:30:00,fireball,7 minutes,"Occurred : 8/28/2014 20:30  (Entered as : 8/28/14 20:30) Reported: 8/29/2014 2:12:01 PM 14:12 Posted: 8/31/2014 Location: Sayville, NY Shape: Fireball Duration:7 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113029.html,"Saw blue ball of light fall from sky then craft seem to check it out then skip across sky like a rock on water extremely fast. At approximately 8:30pm last night I was standing in my back yard in Sayville, on Long Island, New York with 3 other witnesses having a conversation.   I happened to be facing south with my eyes just starting to drift upward when suddenly I saw a ball of light fall from the sky leaving a trail behind it.  The object was blue-ish in color and large as to say it must have been closer than the stars and possibly even in the neighborhood.   I stopped what I was doing and said “ woahh did any one just see that, that definitely wasn’t a shooting star, it looked like something just crashed.”  It happened that this object fell directly over the Great South Bay.   I was very shocked by what I saw because I have been a bit of a star gazer for quite some time and I know what a shooting star looks like.   After about 2 more minutes of staring up to see if anything else occurred, I shrugged it off and walked in side to do something.  I returned to the back yard approximately 6 to 7 minutes after the sighting, my uncle had been still gazing in that direction in curiosity, when about 30 seconds after I returned he said, “There is something else over there.”   I looked and I saw a flash of light skip twice on the sky in the area where the other object had crashed or fallen, I was even skeptical at first and said, “No, that can’t be related.  It’s probably fireworks, or something, searching for some explanation,” when all of a sudden, the object seemed to have finished what it was doing in that area and began to make abrupt evasive seeming maneuvers across the sky.  However, it wasn’t just one long flash of light, the best way I can describe it is it was like a rock skipping on water, using some kind of propulsion mechanism which must have been the light that we saw each time it appeared, and with each burst of light the object was propelled tens of miles (from my earthly perspective, and it may have been much longer given the distance that it was into the night sky)   In approximately one second at a time, beginning its r! etreat f rom the scene of the first object by making an abrupt left turn then headed north and the light appeared about 5 or 6 more times before vanishing into the sky about 60 miles or so in about  7 or 8 seconds, or you might say the light appeared once every second of its journey from point A to point B where it disappeared. 	I live close to MacArthur Airport, and I see planes all day every day, and every kind of plane there is, I also worked at a Skydiving facility with seasoned pilots and worked around planes so I have a good sense of what we are capable of in aviation, so a few things I know is that this was not a plane or any known human aircraft, there were multiple commercial airliners in the vicinity to compare it to and this was traveling many times their speed.   This was also too close to the airport for this not to have been picked up on by radar, something crashed or fell into the Great South Bay, and something seemed to have gone to recover it and then tried to escape without being seen, or is it possible that this was the same object recovering from its crash landing and the reason I say that is because it looked as if when the craft was traveling away from the scene it was using some kind of propulsion system thus creating the light that we saw each time it moved another handful of miles across the sky,  but it’s obvious that whatever energy or propulsion system that it was using is not one that is known to the public, because one thrust sent it very far, also being that it was not just one constant light, it felt as if possibly the craft was struggling to escape, however on its final thrust it just vanished into the sky. 	The observers consisted of two women in their 50’s and a man in his 50’s as well as me a 25 year old.  The other male observer and I have knowledge of technology, assumed ufos, and the night sky.  I have observed the sky for many years,  I have witnessed many meteor showers, including a shooting star that night, we also saw a satellite pass later that night, and the sky was very clear and cloudless, stars were extremely visible, meaning we had many known objects to compare it to.  I live in an area which is close to Fire Island, which is an area that is well populated with tourists and parties and these objects had to be visible and most likely seen by other people there.  I will add that last week I also witnessed similar lights but much higher in the sky coming from the exact direction that this object disappeared into.  I can not say if it is related but it was very similar although this incident was much more intense and much closer.  Thank you.",2014-08-31T00:00:00,40.7359,-73.0821

As it moved it seemed to slow to a hover, as it was almost overhead, then resume its leisurely motion.  After it passed overhead, it slowly began to curve to the northwest.  All of this took 1-2 min. and the object kept the same appearance.   Then, maybe 30 seconds later, the whole spectacle repeated itself.  A second slow moving red light followed the same path as the first one.  By the way, the original light was still visible, still heading very slowly to the northwest.  I do not recall if this second light did any hovering as it came overhead.  It did the same turn to the northwest as did the first object.  Then to conclude the event, about 30 sec. after the second light made its northwest turn, a third light identical to the first two came again from the south, following the same path and speed as the first two.  This one, like the first light, appeared to slow and hover for a few seconds as it came overhead.   Then it resumed its slow pace, turning to the northwest as the others had.

They all proceeded together in the same direction up Johnsville Road, completely silent, and suddenly all of them disappeared at about the same time.

My lights always stay on a few minutes after the car is turned off and then they automatically shut off.

August 30, 2014.    At about 4:15 a.m. sighting I usually wake up once in the wee hours of the mornin, and ritualistically, I then go to the kitchen to get a “swig” of orange juice.  I had just done that and was going to go back to bed, but remembered that the gated parking garage, adjacent to the short “high-rise” condo complex that I live in, was not gated for the past two days.  Since I have a vehicle in that lot, and the vehicle is exposed to the street, I decided to take a look out of my living room window, which overlooks the parking lot, to check on my truck.  I had been a little worried about the truck overnight, because we have a ton of auto burglaries on our street, and in general, a lot of scuzzy people walking around up to no good late at night, early a.m. In order to get a good look at the parking lot, I had to lie down (on my belly), on my carpet.  We have a large window but the shade is always drawn, so I decided to lie down and look out the window.  Truck was fine and I didn’t see anyone around but I noticed some lights on in a dilapidated building kitty corner to ours.  Since I wasn’t feeling sleepy, I went and got my binoculars and took a look.  I was checking out the dilapidated building when it happened. I THINK I heard the low hum first.  The rest, I am absolutely 100% sure about.  I looked to my left, and a GIANT rectangular, flat, object was “floating” slowly in my direction from up high – gliding long side up, and then closer and closer.  It sort of “twisted” slowly, which was a movement that I found incredulous for any manmade air craft.  It made no sense.   It then hovered for a time (maybe 2 minutes?) and it was “facing” me at a diagonal/slanted  angle.  There was a white light (not blinking) on each corner of the craft.  In the first moments of seeing this thing, my brain was trying to categorize it as an airplane or some kind of military jet and I couldn’t understand why there were only white lights as I know that our aircraft use colored lights to indicate port side or starboard.   Then the shape of the object was clear to me.  It was SO CLOSE and SO LOW.  And since it hovered for what seemed like a long time, I had a long time to look at it.  But even so, I feel fuz! zy about what it really looked like with specific details.  I know that at the moment I realized it was absolutely a UFO, I was in absolute shock at what I was witnessing.  Then, it put itself on a more horizontal level, and glided up, and headed in a northern direction. I live in a part of the city that has heavy construction so I speculate that the craft was interested in all of the construction going on, but I also assume it knew I was watching it. My husband was sleeping in the other room.  I didn’t call out for him because I didn’t want to disturb what was happening by making a huge commotion, and even though I wished so badly I could go grab my camera I didn’t want to miss a moment of what I was seeing. Weather:  it was very, very dark out (for an urban city).  Our street actually is not very well lit, which is unusual for the neighborhood.  The sky was dark, but I could tell it was clear overhead and I could see off on the northern horizon that there was a heavy band of low fog.  That was the direction the craft took off for. I could NOT believe what I was seeing.  To say the experience was shocking is an understatement.

On the evening of 9/9/14, I was at a house in Winsted, CT.  I was there in a professional capacity, and am not at liberty to disclose information on the house or its resident(s). At 7:15 pm, to close approximation, I was sitting in a chair on the front porch, smoking a cigarette.  I was facing due west. The sky was overcast, low-lying cumulous. From a point on the natural horizon (forested hill), west by south-west, I saw an object with the appearance of a fireball-type meteor, i.e. “burning,” orange-color, about an order of magnitude brighter than Venus. It ascended at apparent high velocity from the horizon, dead vertical.  I initially thought it was a firework. It ascended at constant velocity to approximately 40 degrees celestial latitude.  Then it stopped and had no motion, as though it had contacted a solid obstacle.  This is to say that its velocity instantly ceased.  It then had the appearance of a star in the sky, except that it was brighter than Venus, as stated.  It was below the solid cloud deck.  It illuminated the cloud deck, as though its radiance was omnidirectional, at least on hemispherical coordinates. This sequence of events repeated til I lost count.  I approximate the total number of objects as, three dozen. When several of the objects had ascended, they formed an asymmetrical grouping, maybe five to fifteen minutes of arc separate. When several (the number was different each time) were collected, the grouping ascended up into the cloud deck, cohesively, and faded from sight per the opaqueness of the clouds. There were approximately six such groupings and ascensions. While gathered in these groupings, which resembled tight constellations of exceedingly bright stars, as if “waiting for the next one” (teleology inferred), these objects sometimes separated into two or three components. Sometimes one component would circle the other, or others, which remained stationary,then apparently rejoin and reintegrate back into a single object. Several times one object moved or was ejected from the grouping, at apparent high speed, one to several degrees of arc laterally. It then reversed direction instantaneously, like a ball deflecting off a wall, to instantly stop at its original location. The luminosity of all these objects never varied, except when several times they seemed to show internal structure, as of two or more of them fixed to a nonluminous body or frame, not inconsistent with the several lights fixed to an aircraft. This differentiation was at threshold visibility, on the order of 15 or 30 arc seconds. One time, and one time only, the differentiated light detached itself from the presumed structure of the object, circled the object and returned to its original place, before this differentiation ceased and the object again appeared as a unitary “fireball”. This entire phenomenon was soundless. There was no engine noise, or propeller chop, or any sound from this event at all. The phenomenon ceased at 8:00 pm, to very close approximation. The phenomenon was witnessed initially by myself alone, then by a resident of the house. About halfway through this event, a neighbor walked by, and I called out to him to come observe it. He then went and came back with his wife. The four of us together witnessed the last twenty minutes or so of the event. So far as the subjective, human aspect of this event, there was unanimous bewilderment, astonishment and incomprehension. I know of no airfields or military bases in that direction to, with certainty, the New York State border; I do not know with certainty of any airfields or bases in that direction whatsoever, albeit at some distance they undoubtedly exist. Because the ascension of the objects was dead vertical, and there was no variation in the luminosity of the objects, I assume the distance of their apparent origin from my location was equal to the elevation of the cloud deck, whatever that was at that time, divided by the declination of the region of the cloud deck where they vanished, which would be to say ~9/4 the elevation of the cloud deck. If called upon to guess, then if the cloud deck was ~2000 m high, the apparent origin was 4 or 5 km distant. I know that to be an area of state forest and farmland. At the beginning of this event, many coyotes at different locations began howling and wailing, and continued doing this until the end of the event, when they all simultaneously ceased. By 8:00 pm, conditions were as normal. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Sir, Last night, 9/9/14, I submitted a report about an event that occurred a couple hours prior, in  Winsted, CT.      I tried to be as factual and precise as I could. But reviewing that report, I see I was sufficiently disraught to forget my high school geometry. Given the altitude of cloud deck, whatever that was, and what I reckoned a point at somewhat less than a vertical right angle, the distance from my location to the apparent origin would have been equal to, or slightly more than, the altitude of the cloud deck. I feel that this event was important. I hope that my report will not be rejected because of my error, but that this correction can be made to the report.      I apologize for any convenience. ((END ADDENDUM))",2014-09-10T00:00:00,41.9481,-73.0945

I live in Linglestown, Pennsylvania, and was watching television on the couch at approximately 9:32 p.m. (eastern time) on September 9th, 2014, when something caught my eye from the window.  I stood up and looked out, and saw about eight yellowish-white dots in the sky.  I then called my mother over to see them and by the time she got to the window, about half of them faded away.  About three seconds later, they were all gone.   Obviously I didn't know what they were, so I examined their placement in the night sky.  They were too high up to be anything like fireworks or spotlights and there were too many of them to be airplanes or shooting stars.  I had no clue what they could have been. 	After the initial shock of seeing what I thought was a UFO, I went outside to see if I could find the dots again.  It took me about three minutes of staring at the sky to realize that nothing would be coming back.   I then proceeded to go inside and get on the computer to research my finding.  I looked and looked and came up with nothing.  My mother then informed me that she had read about UFO sightings on PennLive (our local internet news source) recently.  Hearing this, I knew that I had to tell a professional about my finding, so I found your webpage.   Please help me to figure out what this was that I had just saw.

It was traveling quite fast but it was only about 2,000 FT in the sky.  It just kept coming for about 2-3 minutes without any interruptions!   Then, of course, came the part when the object disappears.  And what is the reason for this? There is usually a quite logical explanation.  The craft does not want to be seen.  As above with this theory, came an airplane coming out of Mitchel Field Milwaukee.  This airplane was coming at the object at a fairly good distance but a general area.  The craft immideatley started flickering in and out and of course like all reports the object disappeared. Was this the end of the night?  No.  Awkwardly, came a bright white light looking like the spotlight of the front of an airplane at night just like it.  It was also in the flight path from the area.  Right when my father pointed this object out and looked at it for about 10 seconds it just sat there; it was moving before he told me to look at this ""thing.""

Two groupings were seen, three lights in front, two in rear.  Lights were moving relative to each other and stars could be seen between the lights indicating they were not connected by any solid object.   All lights were moving at generally the same speed in the aforementioned direction.  The first three lights moved only slightly in relation to each other.  The trailing two lights moved at great speed in relation to each other, where one light moved 270 degrees around the other light in approximately 10 seconds.   The movement was not in a perfect arch, again suggesting the two were no physically connected.  While the trailing lights were performing the 270 degree movement relative to each other, one of the leading green lights became intensely bright relative to the others.   This could best be described as seeing a laser pointer that was suddenly pointed direc! tly at the observer.  This lasted approximately 5 seconds.  Lights did not blink and were constant, and their brightness in comparison to each other was similar, with the exception of the sudden brightening of the one object.   Light intensity could be described as that of a slightly brighter than a standard green airplane navigation light at approximately 1,000 to 2,000 feet (as compared to known aircraft landing at CHS on most any other night). Absolutely no noise of any kind was heard during the entire sighting. Lights were first seen approximately 45 degrees from directly overhead and it took approximately 60 seconds to move to the corresponding 45 degree angle.  90 degrees were covered in approximately 60 seconds.   The objects were seen for another 90 seconds, moving to the NNW, until they slowly faded from sight.  No additional movement relative to each other was seen at that point. Many flights go over the house in the direction of Charleston international airport.  The direction of these lights was different in that it was 30 degrees to the west of the normal flight pattern to the airport. Sky was clear, no clouds.  No haze was observed. The pattern below generally reflects the relative position of each light although there were subtle variations of this during the observation.  The distance from the lead light to the trailing light was the distance from the pinky to the thumb with full spread of fingers at arm’s length when the objects were directly overhead.  The distance from the two trailing lights to each other was approximately the size of a half dollar at arm’s length. 							X 		X							X X  						X 								  Given the speed the trailing two objects moved relative to each other, it gave the impression that these objects were not at any appreciable height.  The general speed of the objects across the sky was much slower than an aircraft landing at CHS.  A landing aircraft takes approximately 15 seconds to cover the same 90 degree arch these lights covered in 60 seconds.  However, landing aircraft are only visible for approximately 20 to 30 seconds where these lights were visible for 90 plus seconds before they slowly faded into the distance.  That gives the impression these lights were higher in altitude which contradicts the impression of a lower altitude given by the relative movement of the trailing two objects. My wife observed the objects for 10 to 15 seconds before calling me outside to see them.   We were the only two witnesses that we know of.",2014-08-31T00:00:00,32.80388723163842,-79.9688566101695

The first of the three headed in a straight line traveling a southwesterly direction, at a slow steady pace, travelling across the sky for roughly one minute.  When it neared some thin clouds it seemed to fade to nothing, as if it were going through the cloud.  This light appeared and disappeared alone. The second two lights were the same color/shape/brightness as the first, but followed each other across the sky and appeared shortly after the first faded out.  They stayed about the same distance apart and traveled in the same straight line, also fading to nothing. There was a short break between when the first light and the second two were witnessed, approximately 10-15 seconds.

I thought to myself I don't recall any light being out there against the mountain terrain.  I kept driving looking over to the red light glow and then noticed a beam of light that shinned from it onto the ground like a spot light and I said it must be a helicopter. Well I continued to observe it and after about 30 seconds it turned off and I could tell it had elevated itself a bit higher from the ground as it was fairly close to the ground.  It stayed there for about a minute then I noticed it started to move towards my direction at a high speed and I thought I don't think helicopters move that fast but as it got closer all I could make out was a perfect round red sphere ball, and then what really got my attention was that it was apparently following something big and I could not make it ! out that well but all I can say is that is was big and black and as it crossed the freeway in front of me about maybe half a mile in front and it was flying very low, had no lights, but as it crossed the freeway the front side of it was already across freeway and  the back of it was still had not crossed the freeway. It was big, looked square in the back could not make out the front as it zipped by fast and the red orb following it. It had to be at least 200 ft in width by a good 400 ft in length is my guess. Last night didn't have much moon light but as close as this thing crossed in front of me it was big and I did roll down my window to see if I could hear engine noise and I heard nothing. It flew from north to south and the big black object just blended in into the night so well that after it passed across the freeway you could make it out anymore except the red orb flying behind it. I wish I could give you better details. I am not the only one that saw it as there was ! chatter on the CB from other drivers who wondered what it was.!

As I turned north to walk behind my car, I saw several orange lights jump up into the sky very quickly, one after another.  Each one popped up within a second or less after the one before it.  I have photos of ten of them, but I think there was an 11th one that is not in the photo.  It seemed like there was a straggler. They stayed somewhat low above the horizon for about 30 seconds.  (You can get a good idea of this in the photos.)  I took a total of ten photos while they were in sight.  Then they suddenly turned to the east, (they had been heading south towards me, and I was slightly to the west of them) and flew out of sight pretty quickly.  There was no sound from them the entire time. These lights were much brighter and bigger than any star and much smaller than the Moon. You can get a sense of this in the photos.  I did not see any flashing lights, just steady, orange lights moving across the sky.  They did not have any of the lights that a typical airplane would have. I did consider the possibility that they could be Chinese lanterns.  However, they moved much too quickly and with too much control for that to be the case.  In my location, I wondered if they had taken off from the Arlington Airport, which is not a manned airport (it has automated landing).  That could have been approximately where they took off from, because they looked reasonably close.  However, they could also have taken off further north than that.  The lights were bright enough to be seen from a good distance. There was not a noticeable wind in the area at the time I saw this.  I think Chinese lanterns would have stayed around much longer, even if there had been a strong wind. When I expand the one photo of three lights, I can see the orange glow.  It’s not real clear.  I took the photos with my iPhone. However, you can get a sense of the color.

We were camping on private property near Lexington, SC.  The event happened late at night while we were watching the fire and talking.  One of the troop leaders said that he had been watching a satellite that was crossing the sky, and then it had just stopped.  He pointed out to us where it was.  At first it just looked like a star in the sky.  It seemed a little odd because satellites usually blink and are not a constant light. After a while the light started to move around erratically.

I'm making an educated guess based on the cirrus clouds in the sky with the object, that it was around 17000 feet in the air.   Although it was so high it was very easy to notice because it had a very shiny, metallic surface (like tin foil or stainless steel) and reflected the sunlight.  It appeared to be a single, solid object.  I am unable to to determine how large it was, only that it was very easy to see, as the sky was almost totally clear.   The object made no sound as it hung there motionless for about 1 minute.  I had enough time to point the object out to my friend and give him at least 20 uninterrupted seconds to observe it too.   The object then took off so fast that it almost seemed to have disappeared.  It left so quickly that I would have missed it had been blinking.

This was right after my high school graduation.  I had went over to a friends house and we were celebrating, I was not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol. At the time I was 17 about to turn 18.  I was with my friend named ((male name deleted)), who is of the same age.  At the time we were your typical high school students, full of energy and ready to tackle life. It happened when we were out on his back deck.  We were rather bored, and it was beautiful night, the stars were shining very bright and as we lived in a rural area away from any major cities we could see them more than most people. It started when I was stargazing out on the deck, and happened to notice an equilateral triangle in the sky (composed of lights).  As I had never noticed any perfect triangular constellations it really peaked my curiosity.  I maintained gaze on this figure for quite some time and I realized that it was moving. It was moving back and forth in ways that a normal aircraft wouldn't, left to right and up and down, repeating the same motions.  I eventually signaled to my friend ((male name deleted)) that I thought I saw something weird and asked him if he could see it too.  He said he did. At this point the triangular shape started to descend, or I assume it did as the equilateral points of the triangle began to spread out very slowly. We watched it for a good 15 minutes before my friend ((male name deleted)) said, ""I'm going in, quit staring at it, you're bringing it closer to us.""  He then went inside genuinely scared that we were causing it to come to us. Shortly after I decided to go in with him as I thought he was right and me being foolish and young didn't investigate further or continue to gaze at it. I should also mention that there was a strange feeling of telepathy, as though the object knew that I was looking at it. That is all, thank you.

The left side appeared to be doing different light shapes some like a stick Xmas tree and some were red and round in shape.  It continued to blink in different sequels and once in a while a laser light would come out and either shot out or blink to the other ships on the right.  Once in a while the laser would do some funny doodle.  The lights in conclusions were green yellow red and white.  The ship appeared to be round.    The UFO's on the right were lighted with straight line lights the light were more faded but I could make out 7 lights on one and 9 lights on the other.  They appeared to be communicating with the right sided UFO with the laser lights.  I tried to take pictures, but my cell phone had lost its charge.

I heard a faint puff sound and noticed that the bright star shaped figured had been shoot at or had exploded on one side.

When I looked at my exposures on the computer later that night, I noticed that the object had registered a circular, ostensibly autonomous light trail (instead of a clearly defined line that a planet would make as the earth rotates).  That is, it moved (or the camera moved) during what amounted to a 4 minute exposure. I am fairly confident that the camera did NOT move, as it was firmly planted into the sand and the shutter controlled with a remote release.  Also, there were lights from a few small cabins on the other end of the shore directly below the unidentified object which registered clean and with no evidence of camera shake or movement.

It was shot from my iPhone , however when you see the video you can clearly the object and me chasing the object thru the sky.  It disappeared then appeared out of nowhere in a different direction.   I'm really wanting to share this with everyone because its rare to sight ufos where I live in Florida.  It was not a plane, nor a star or a satellite simply because it was moving consistently, the colors, the way it illuminated, making unique movement as if it was forming symbols for communication.

My wife and I were at Disneyland on the night of June 4th 2015.  We were sitting on a low railing around a planter, waiting for the 11:00 pm light parade to start.  It was approximately 10:45 pm.  We were directly in front of the ""Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln"" building, facing west toward the circle that is the beginning of Main Street.  A man sitting to my right on the same railing got my attention by saying to me (while he was looking to the sky directly above the circle), ""Are you seeing the same thing I'm seeing, or am I going crazy?""   I followed his line of sight and observed what I at first glance appeared to be a giant dark smoke ring at cloud level (approximately 2000 feet).  I answered him, and said, ""No, you're not crazy I see it.""   I then said, ""What is that?""  He then said (as neither one of us took our eyes off of the object), ""I don't know, that's what I'm trying to figure out.""  At that time, my wife (sitting to my left on the same railing ) said to me what are you looking at, looked in the same direction and observed the same thing, she then asked me what it was. I told her I did not know.  Clearly this was not a smoke ring of any kind because by this time (by which a couple of minutes had passed), if it had been a smoke ring, it would have dissipated.   Upon further observation, this was an object partially obscured by being at just the bottom level of the cloud layer.  As if it were using the clouds to camouflage itself.  This object appeared to have a slight oval shape.  And I would approximate it to be (at being 2000 feet above us) about 300 yards long and 250 yards wide.  As we watched it began very slowly move due north (towards Cinderella's castle ).  I would estimate its speed at no more the 30 mph.  The object traveled a distance equivalent of about six times its length and slowly disappeared upwards at that point, the clouds around it envelopeing it until it was out of sight.   I remember as the object moved slowly through the clouds you could see the clouds billowing around the leading edge of the object.  It emitted no sound that I could detect and hid so well in the clouds that you could only see its dark silhouette, the front of the object having a darker appearance than the rest of the  silhouette, giving it an almost transparent appearance.  At about the same time the object started moving, my wife and I stood up and walked five feet forward to the curb of the street to get a better look at the object, and we remained there till it was gone from sight.  I did not get the other man's phone number as I should have, but after I acknowledged that I did see the object he showed no interest in talking about what we had seen, and when the parade was over, he walked away into the crowd of people.  So unless someone else happened to see this and comes forward with what they saw, it's just the corroboration of my wife and me, and we will not deny what we saw.   I did take photos of the object that are difficult to make out because you are looking at an object obscured by clouds at night.  Although in one of the shots you can make out the leading and trailing edges of the craft.",2015-06-15T00:00:00,33.83243273727648,-117.89132517193949
LOW BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT CHANGES TO ORANGE.,Sumner,WA,2015-06-04T23:45:00,light,10-15 minutes,"Occurred : 6/4/2015 23:45  (Entered as : 06/05/2015 23:45) Reported: 6/5/2015 4:05:59 PM 16:05 Posted: 6/15/2015 Location: Sumner, WA Shape: Light Duration:10-15 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/119/S119349.html,"LOW BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT CHANGES TO ORANGE. Around 11:45 pm on Thursday, June 4th.   I wanted to go outside with the dog to cool off.  We walked out the front door of our apt and turned left.  She was sniffing around for somewhere to pee, and I see this super bright light, low in the sky.   The sky was dark, thin veil of clouds, could barely tell they were there.  Lots of stars out.  This light was odd because it seemed to be located near the flight path,  (Sea-Tac is about 15 miles away) and was extremely low-–lower than the planes flying.  It looked like a bright white light and I couldn’t tell if it was moving.   Sometimes I get self conscious watching the sky because I can imagine what people think of me always watching the sky at night.  My neighbors had their parents in their 5th wheel near where I was standing.   I decided to get my binoculars out of the car and hoped I could see from there so that the neighbor’s parents couldn’t see me.  I could not see anything from the car so walked back to where I had been.  At first, the light looked like one bright white light but as I watched it, it changed to a fiery orange.  That’s when I noticed that it was moving very slowly.  I could tell because there is a row of decorative tall trees at the barrier of the apts and the mobile home park.   The light was above the trees in the beginning but it moved to the left, then lowered a little so it was below the treetops and then moved to the right about 2 trees over.  Once it cleared treetops again, it got very orange and at one point, through the binoculars, it looked almost like two headlights.  Problem is, I think the kids dropped my binoculars because it looks like double vision so not sure if what I seen was really how it looked.  What was odd is that normally when I look through them, if I’m trying to zone in on a single light/star in the night sky these days; it looks like two but far apart.  This light looked like two orange headlights close together, really close together.  It kept moving to the right now and it moved back to the left one more time and t! hen must have moved away from my sight beyond the trees because I never saw it come out either side or up over the trees again.   This whole time, the dog was lying down in the grass and her rope was lying near my feet. Suddenly, a cat walked in front of us and the dog lunged to chase it and I nearly fell.  I decided to go in at that time which was about 12:10pm.  This sighting lasted probably 10 to 15 minutes.   It seems that somebody in our town had to have seen this.  I am thinking it was clearly visible near Sumner/Milton border. Many years ago when I lived on Wood Avenue, I had a most amazing sighting – the brightness of that light reminded me of this one as well as how low it was. That sighting lasted about 2 hours and it changed to green, blue and a most beautiful teal color. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Yes, Thursday, June 4th - sorry.

((NUFORC Note:  We have tried to contact the source of the report, principally to inquire whether the report is a sincere one, or whether it might be a hoax.  PD)) Last Thursday night, I was sleeping at home, when I woke up with the feeling that somebody was breaking in my house.  I went to have a look, and as I went to get up out of bed, I found myself paralyzed in place.  I felt really scared, like I was having a nightmare or something.  When I tried to close my eyes, I couldn’t close them, and I looked around up in the air, I assumed myself to be in a dream, but I couldn’t wake up, so I started scream, and before I could get a sound out in a single second, I was floating above my bed and I felt a deep very low frequency hum like a large transformer was inside my body.  Then I could see behind me back at my bed, and my cat, who sleeps by me, didn’t even seem to care or notice that I wasn’t in my bed anymore.  I was absolutely terrified and right, as I was about to scream, I started floating toward my wall of my bedroom. To my shock, I went right thru the wall, like I was a ghost or the wall was liquid, and as I saw thru my wall, I was feeling this vibration intensify greatly, like a force of my body was going to explode from inside out.  I passed out completely, and when I remember waking up, I realized that I was in some type of white science looking laboratory room of some sort.  I again, assumed I was dreaming, until I saw a face looking down at me.  It was a large head, with black bug-like eyes, and in my head as I went to scream, I heard it say don’t be afraid of me, you are safe with me.  I don’t know how to explain it, but it said it thru my brain, like a mind reader would read your mind.  The voice sounded like I was saying it to myself, instantaneously to myself. Then I went to ask, what’s going on, and before I could talk, again it said don’t worry, and said we’re zeta brothers.  I didn’t really understand what that means, but as I could see more clearly, I immediately noticed, that the! se weren’t people at all, it was an oblong looking bug eyed grey skinned, probably around 3 feet tall, with a silver suit made of some kind of spandex.  It had a tiny little slit where the mouth was, and just holes for ears.  It's head was wobbling on what I remember thinking was a tiny neck right in the middle, and it's hands looked like they were really skinny and long, with almost no texture, just like the texture of the lining of a hot dog casing.  This thing that I can only explain look wise, as an alien creature. When I asked it to go home, another one came in the room, and they were talking to each other without talking, and one said, something in a weird sounding almost African type of language, and they came back next to me but in an instant, no walking, just teleporting back to above me, and the other of the two took off my pants, and put a strange circular light orb on my genitals, and it was very painful.  I immediately felt as though I was being burned on my penis, and it then took the ball off me, and the pain instantly stopped. Then the one holding the light ball disappeared in a flash out of my view, and the other above me said I want to show you him, and a different taller bright white one of these things came out walking with what looked like a little girl, but with some of the facial features of these creatures, and it looked up at me and said “you know who I am”, This scared me terribly and immediately I remember falling back asleep. When I woke up again, it was the next morning and I was back lying in my bed, without my covers being disturbed, and immediately assumed it was very scary nightmare.  Then, I when I went to get out of bed, my ankle felt as though the same vibrational burning sensation was coming from under my skin by my bone in my leg, so I looked down, and noticed that there is a small maybe 1/8th of an inch circular cut out and burned mark on my leg, but it goes down like 4 layers of my skin, as if someone had literally punched a hole with a paper punch out of it, and then burned it closed.   For the past few days, I haven’t really been able to tell if this was a dream, or real, but strange feelings happen to my leg and I hear weird static sounds in my head when I feel it.  I keep also, seeing a strange pattern of a triangle, with two circles in it, which looks like some sort of geometric constellation when I start to fall asleep every night since.  I don’t know still if I was just dreaming of this, or if it really happened, but I can't explain why I am still feeling and seeing weird things, or the hole on my leg I found the morning after this all happened.",2015-06-15T00:00:00,43.6059213740458,-84.80228625954199

Afterwards we smoked another cigarette off to the side of the gas station and witnessed something in the sky.

It was flickering and looked like the wind was trying to blow it out, rather like a signal flare, but it went out in a way it couldn't have been one.   We drove into the woods towards Corvallis, Oregon.  Upon leaving Newport, my fiancé asked what the time was, and I answered with ""12:01 like midnight.""

It was a clear day and a really nice view, so we decided to stop and hangout for a little bit.  We tossed some rocks around and chatted for a bit as we looked out over the valley.  We could see the Roanoke Airport and observed several planes taking off and landing during our time.  The Carilion Hospital was also in the distance and we watched as an emergency helicopter took off, and landed.  In short, we had a great view and a pretty good perspective of the area. As we watched, I suddenly noticed a bright orange orb hovering over the valley, near the airport.  I watched for a second trying to figure out what it was.  The orb started to ""dance"" in the sky.  It shot left, then back right, up a bit, back to the left.  It was moving incredibly fast compared to the planes we saw in the area.  I noticed two of my friends had stopped talking.  I asked the group if they were seeing what I was seeing.  The two who had stopped talking acknowledged that they were watching the same thing.  We began pointing it out to our other two friends and soon 4 out of 5 of us were watching this dancing orange orb in the sky.  We tried to reason that maybe it was a fighter jet doing aerial tricks, but the speed was so great compared to the other planes and it seemed to stop on a dime and change direction.  The orb stayed the same size during its maneuvers, so it wasn't getting any closer or farther from our position.  Just bobbing and dancing, shooting back a! nd forth. We watched as another plane landed at the airport, and had a good comparison on size and speed.  This object did not have the outline of a plane, just an orange orb that never changed shape.  The whole object glowed orange. As we were pointing it out to our fifth friend (he wasn't wearing his glasses), the object was now the furthest to the left of our view as it had been during our observation.  It then began slowly (more slowly than its previous speed) moving to the right in a straight line, going toward the only other mountain in our view of the valley (Roanoke Star Mountain).  Our fifth friend finally was able to see it (or so he said) as it went straight behind the mountain.  We waiting a few minutes, expecting it to come out from the other side of the mountain due to its trajectory, but it never did.  We waited and didn't see it again. It was starting to get dark, so we decided to head off the mountain.  As we talked about it, we all got chills reliving the experience.  We all also agreed that when we first started watching the orb, we got goose bumps and immediately knew what it was.  None of us had had any previous UFO experiences, yet we all felt we knew instantly what we were looking at without speaking to each other. This experience happened a while back, but I still remember it vividly and wanted to make record of it due to all the activity in the Roanoke area.  I plan to go back to Bent Mountain this summer sit and look out over the valley again.  Maybe I'll see the object again.  If nothing else, it is a spectacular view.

In the southwestern sky you could see a small object with something trailing behind it.   At first we thought it was a flock of geese, but when we looked through binoculars we could see that it was some kind of craft with vapor or smoke coming out the back.  First thought, plane in distress, but it was moving extremely slow and kept on the same trajectory until we couldn’t see it because of the trees in our yard.   I got in the car and drove to an open spot to see if I could spot it, again, afraid it was a plane in distress, but I could not locate it.   We watched the news that evening to see if a plane crashed, or nearly crashed had taken place, but there was no mention of anything.  It was definitely not a flock of geese, and it could not have been a meteorite as the vapor didn’t trail that far behind and it moved VERY slowly.

It was so low that the house shook.   I rushed out side to try to catch a glimpse of this helicopter and to report it to the FAA. I was in for a huge surprise.  It sounded to me as if it flew a short distance away and then came racing back towards me as if it was a bat out of hell!!   This happened more than a few times.  At one time it seemed to stop over the house and hover there trying to intimidate me.  As crazy as this sounds, I could not see it.  There seemed to be some roter wash, but the noise that the copter was making was almost deafening and the house seemed to be shaking so hard that it was going to fall apart.  And yet I still could not see any nav lights or it.   It finally left after a few moments and has not been back since then.   No neighbors came out to investigate the racket and my wife did not hear it across the street. A interesting side note is this:  I happened to look straight up and saw at about 10,000- 15,000 ft a red orb circling directly in what appeared to be over my house.

I wasn’t sure what to think at first.  I had never seen anything like it.  I kept looking and was amazed when it moved instantly, effortlessly, and noiselessly about 50 meters to the right.  It hovered there for about one minute, then disappeared, so I continued to walk and turned in an easterly direction, thinking that was all, but I turned back to look and it was there again, then disappeared.  Again I walked, turned around and it was there, watched and it disappeared.  This happened once more before it disappeared altogether. I am 55 and have lived in Alamogordo for most of my life.

I was standing and looking directly eastward and about a quarter of a mile away and (from my perception) about 20-40 feet above a treeline, I saw an extremely large shape in the sky, very sharply pointed in the middle, which I saw first, and extremely wide and long in its width, which all of a sudden just seemed to slowly appear.  It almost reminded me of a large bulky arrowhead in the width, but the sharply pointed center looked like the two sides of a triangle. In the middle of it, above the largely pointed center, was a round shape that looked almost dome-like or conical.  I could not see the length of it as I was looking directly at it as it was heading west, and just could see the front and width of it.  Perhaps the craft was just super wide and not long in length at all, which is possibly why I did not see its length.  It was moving slowly, not fast at all.  The middle portion (triangle dome-like center) looked a bit lighter than the rest of the craft.   As I continued to stare at it – pretty much frozen and afraid to blink - I then saw what looked like a hot sidewalk effect, for lack of a better description, or a waviness slowly forming around this thing, and then it looked as though piece by piece I could see through it until it faded or melted into the sky, almost as though it was camouflaging itself in the night sky.  If I hadn’t been looking in that exact direction at the moment I did, I would have missed it, despite it being so large, because of the way it sort of fit in with the sky.   As it got a little closer, I noticed light from underneath it but then I also noticed that it faded into the sky more and the shape became sort of lost or not as discernible as it had been.  What did become more discernible, though, were the lights.  By the time it was nearing my home, I saw one larg! e circle with about 15-20 red globes of light within the circle.  I sensed that the lights were underneath something, but the object was not discernible around or over the lights at this point.  Everything looked just really dark.  But I knew it was there and I sensed it was there.  The lights seemed low, perhaps 500-600 feet.  It was silent.  The circle of lights then moved very slightly in a northwesternly direction over my house.   At this point, I became afraid and grabbed my dog.  I ran from the back door through my house to the front window as it faces north, to see if I could follow it, but when I looked at my front window it had disappeared.  It was just gone.  I did not go back outside. It is difficult to judge by measurement the size of what I saw without using the words huge or large.  If I stand in the same spot where I was standing when I initially saw it above the treeline about a quarter of a mile away and hold up a quarter at arm’s length, then I would have to hold perhaps 3-4 quarters across to cover the width of it at that distance when I saw it first appear in the sky. I live fairly close to an airport (about 30 minutes south) and am very familiar with the sights and sounds of airplanes, whether they are flying high or low, daytime or nighttime, but this was not like anything I had ever seen before.  It didn’t make one sound, and was large.  There are always planes flying in their flight paths over my neighborhood, but strangely enough, there wasn’t one plane in sight during that time or that I could hear.  Just silence. My husband and son weren’t home at the time, and I did not have my cell phone on me when this occurred as I was just letting the dog out and had left it in the house, never thinking this would be happening, so unfortunately, I can only tell you what I saw with my own eyes. After telling my husband and son about my experience, they showed me pictures of a stealth bomber, but it did not resemble what I saw.  They also showed me pictures of Chinese lanterns, but again, the lights that I saw did not resemble Chinese lanterns. This was such an unnerving experience for me.  I wish there was some sort of explanation.  I can only hope that someone else will report seeing something similar on that night  – it certainly would make me feel a lot better.  And I can tell you without hesitation that this was most definitely not a plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was Sunday evening, August 2nd, 1987.  I drove from Madison, Wisconsin to see a Madonna concert at Alpine Valley Music Theater near East Troy, Wisconsin.  I would often leave early to avoid drunk or otherwise impaired drivers. It was approximately 10:25 pm and the concert was about two to three songs away from ending.  I walked up the central path to the top and stood in a grassy area near the exit.  I turned around to watch the concert a little longer. I immediately felt compelled to look up and to my left about 90 degrees.  I saw what looked like a big, bright star to the northeast and beyond the venue.  I intuitively felt that this was not a star and that it had intelligence. This object was stationary and prominent like when Venus appears closer and brighter.  Only this was different, in that it looked a whole lot closer.  It could have been as little as 1 mile away, which would place it just south of East Troy, Wisconsin. Because of its size and the feelings I was having, I made note of its location. I used the “fist as 10 degrees” method of measuring it in relation to the tree tops. I estimated this object was approximately 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon and it was approximately 10 degrees above the tree tops. If you go to the Google Earth image of the Alpine Valley venue, zoom down to where I was standing and face northeast.  You will see the trees on a hill, beyond a building on the eastern edge of the amphitheater.  The trees are flattened on Google Earth, as it is not the actual street view, but a zoomed to level view. I continued to observe this solidly bright and unmoving ""star"" for approximately 10 minutes.  Watching it for approximately 20 seconds at a time, then back to watching the end of the concert. Suddenly, I heard the roar of jet engines overhead.  The loudness of the music was mixing with the sound.  Two military jets, (which I assumed to be A-10A Thunderbird Warthogs from Truax Field in Madison) approached from the west and crossed directly over the venue at approximately 500 feet.  I was losing details of them in the bright lights of the music theater, but I could clearly see the central underside of them.  The military jets were heading directly towards the object.   As they passed just to the east of the amphitheater, within about 10 seconds, the object that had been a stationary “star,” moved suddenly south in a horizontal line, then straight up, then horizontally south again and disappeared!  It was breathtaking to witness!  I did not report it to any authority at the time, but a decade later, I reported it by phone to the National UFO Reporting Center.  I followed up with an email.  Apparently, it did not make it into an official report, so I am reporting it again.",2015-04-17T00:00:00,42.7945,-88.3994

At 7:21pm I was departing out of the Brotherhood Lounge in Olympia after a few drinks to catch the last bus to Aberdeen/Hoquiam which left at 7:20pm.   As I ran out the door of the bar I turned the WIFI off on my phone and bolted across the street.  I don't recall any traffic coming towards me or around me as everything appeared silent, so began to cut across the parking lot near where the bus departed, as I was near the middle of the parking lot this bright light appeared above me.  Knowing that is was not the moon as that was visible in the sky this orbital light was practically a spotlight illuminating a circle on the ground around me.   Phone still in hand I pointed upwards to it and held the photo button down snapping these 4 HD shots before my phone went black and rebooted itself immediately with the Apple icon.  I laughed because of how the damn thing decided to reset itself and with the quickness.  Next thing I know time warped, it slowed dramatically as alm! ost like moving through Jello.  I recall being angry that I was force-ably being slowed as I needed to catch that bus as it's the LAST bus to the area I was going to.  Struggling through the atmospheric pressure I saw the light around me became a yellowish/orange hue.....now I've seen something like this before many years ago but was startled at this moment. I recall the light above me feeling like some sort of stealth silent helicopter as waves went through my body like being in a MRI/CATSCAN and then everything went bright white and POW!  Next thing I know I'm standing in thick fog bank of the side of the road feeling a bit bewildered of my surroundings but yet calmly okay.   Nervous, I light a cigarette and immediately my body rejects it causing me to vomit, I take a second drag and it happens again.  Music begins playing through my headphones I'm wearing which were previously in my backpack as I cut across the parking lot.  The music is the Gorillaz song 99-2000, I look to my left and her comes the bus through the fog. I pitch the smoke and wave the bus down, it stops....door opens and the gal driver says, ""I almost missed you there as it's not a normal bus stop.""  I thank her stopping and go to place what typically costs me $3 into the drop box and she say's it's only $1 which I kinda shrug off as the money dropped and figured I just payed it forward on some deal they have going on.  She asks me if I am okay, I say yes and get on the bus....as I look down at the people on the bus they all had this ""odd"" smile on their faces and a orange glow or aura about them.  I sit down and end up messing with this guys backpack reorganizing his stuff in it without him noticing.  I comment to the bus driver how she's doing a fine job cutting through this fog and the guy who's backpack I'm messing with, without looking at me says we are dealing with ""Flice"" which is supposed to be fog ice....like I was supposed to know exactly what that meant.   I zip his pack up without anyone else noticing and listen to the song playing through my headphones and then realize as we pull out of the fog bank a ways, we are actually about 20 minutes to Aberdeen, WA. I know now that I ""reappeared"" in Montesanno about 40 miles from Olympia and I somehow beat the bus which takes about an hour to get to where it picked me up. WTF!??!?!??!?  I road the bus in to town and got off the bus doing a quick magic effect with my hat and a tangerine which I gave to the driver when she acted surprised and thanked her for the night. Once off the bus, I light another cigarette, and immediately rejected it, vomiting again and walked to a local bar called the Ace of Clubs. I forcefully choked down the smoke between gags and then went inside. I turned my WIFI back on and light flickered as I walked in. I didn't make eye contact and asked the female bartender for a PBR....and began uploading the photos I took to a group on Facebook that I'm a member of and start typing out what happened via my phone.  I began to tremble a bit and the photos give me a problem with not uploading in sequence and I'm pissed at my phone as I continue to type and that bartender asks me if I am okay?  I look up at hear and say, ""No...yes...well no...I'm not sure....something just happened to me that I cannot explain.  Will you please look at me and tell me if I appear intoxicated or under the influence of drugs or something?""  She tell me I look perfectly sober and I began to tell her what happened showing her the images.  She listens, I cry.  She walks away and walks back I tell her some more and then her husband comes over eye looking all blurry but with a grin on his face as he begins rubbing my back.  He was a large man with very warm hands and asks me if I am okay?  I tell him the same thing I originally said to her and begin to describe the light I saw and he walks away shaking someone else's hand and I grab my phone, jacket and bag and split trying to video chat my buddy via my phone and having total glitch errors with it all.  I walk across the street and check my bank balance and light another cigarette to no problem as I walked off towards my mother's house.  I don't know what truly happened from that parking lot in Olympia to that fog banked road in Montesanno but I do know that this IS exactly what happened to me.",2015-05-08T00:00:00,47.03031595092024,-122.89693098159509

There were two aircraft on final approach to SW FL International Airport that were headed SW, coming from the north along the gulf coast.  The orb flew past them quite close and was at about the same altitude as the planes.  When it went past the second plane the orb lowered its altitude from buzzing the first plane, which was at a bit higher altitude.   The orb then circled to the west and headed over Pine Island at about a 45 degree angle up and disappeared into some clouds.  The speed of the orb was about two to three times that of the commercial aircraft.  There were 3 of us that watched it and besides wondering what it was, we were wondering what was being said in the cockpits of the aircraft…  I tried to take a video, but the batteries were too low on my camera to use it.",2015-05-08T00:00:00,26.61642169811321,-81.97006591981133

I don't know how to compose this in an organized way as the sighting of these objects had me over the edge.  The night of the eclipse wasn't the first time I had witnessed these ufos, but it's one of the most memorable. The sky was extra dark so my boyfriend and I had a better view of the sky, as it was mostly clear and the stars were extra bright.  We were looking at the eclipse first and began to notice strange lights flashing all around the moon.  These lights were like plasma green, blue, magenta, and red, and purple.  They zoomed across the sky in a spontaneous way. The moon seemed to have some strange filter over it as if these objects were trying to do something with the moon.  Around the moon it looked like there was sparkling objects moving around.  Like glitter or something. It's so hard to describe because it's nothing I've ever seen before.  There were clouds and these objects would hide in them.  Whenever they would exit the cloud the cloud would get a visible hole where they were penetrated and would move in that one spot where the ufo had passed through.  It wasn't the way normal clouds move.  It looked like there was also stars but they weren't stars. They had lights to them and would shoot out similar objects from them.  The lights were blue, purple, green and red.  It also looked like there was something very very black. Like a black hole or portal.  There was at one point a green portal and in that area the sky became distorted as if sucking in whatever was in that area.  There were also purple portals and blue portals. It was so amazing and I wasn't sure if ot as my eyes messing with me but my boyfriend saw the same. These objects were aware that I had acknowledged they were there. I had a sense of being looked at from a distance and I knew it was them.  They began to shoot out balls of plasma colored purple or magenta. They shot it right a my direction. There were objects in different shapes like pyramids that were spinning and they were cloaked.  Like transparent but I could see the shape.  They would distort the sky in the area they were passing through causing ripples in the sky as of the sky were water. There was also disk shaped ones.  More than 10 just zooming across the sky. At one point I was staring at one specific cloud where a portal had opened up. There was a black object that was incredibly huge.  It had a shape of a statue. Like the Statue of Liberty with spikes and very tall.  It looked like that but at the same time seemed to be morphing into something else.  Then the cloud covered it and I saw the portal get smaller and smaller. A lot of these objects were cloaked. There is a lot more to this and the weeks following it had a lot of the same events mostly consisting of the cloaked disk shaped with the clouds. These clouds had lights in them and didn't look like normal clouds.  They would change shapes quickly and looked like they were writing out something in the sky in a strange way. It also had weird figures and faces.  Like if they were trying to get me to understand something.   At that point I panicked and went inside. I know this sounds unbelievable but it is true.  If I recall anymore I will report back.  I would also like to add that on the weeks following this there were a lot of airplanes or helicopters in the sky as if they were searching for something.

April 16th, 2015, right around 8:25PM.  I was outside talking to my girlfriend on the phone while standing in my driveway scanning the clear, evening skies.  I do this often as I very much consider the area near my home a UFO hotspot.  I've had quite a few UFO sightings over the past 3.5 years and all were from this spot in my driveway. But since the last experience was October 19th, 2014, I was mentioning to the GF that it had, ""been a while since I'd seen any unusual space activity.  Not even a falling star"".  She replied, ""Maybe that means something big is about to happen"".  I'm looking down my driveway facing west toward Corona, CA, at this time.   As soon as she finishes that sentence, maybe 1.5 miles away from me, I see a helicopter flying north to south in persuit of a brightly lit, beachball sized, orb at about 90+ mph and 1000+ feet above the 15 freeway.  I ran to the end of the driveway in time to see them both disappear behind the foothills headed toward San Diego.  Probably 8 seconds total viewing time. I finished talking to the girlfriend and jumped on the computer to see if anyone else had seen what I had. I quickly found a group of 3 separate people sharing their experiences and I added mine as well. Like I said earlier, this is just one of a few sightings I've had over the past 3.5 years.  Some have been very bizarre, to say the least.  But as crazy and unbelievable as some of these reports may seem.  From my experiences, this phenomena is true and it's as real as you and me. If you haven't yet seen a UFO but always wanted to, here's the secret… There is no secret.  Day or night, get yourself in the habit of looking up everytime you go outside.

I was looking east but the sun was more to the south/southeast.  I saw 3 stationary, cigar shaped objects hovering over Discovery Bay in a north/south orientation, so I was seeing them from the side.  They were only about 1-2 miles from me and at about 800-1000 feet of elevation.  Each was probably about 150’ long and 30-40’ in diameter.  They were very shiny silver metal, perfectly smooth, almost like liquid mercury, but they held their cigar shape perfectly.  They were symmetrical from front to back.  There was nothing on the outside other than the very shiny, reflective metal.  No lights or windows, no fins or engines, no wings or antennas. They hovered for maybe 10-15 seconds, then they started to move south at a fairly slow rate of speed.  They all moved at the same time, at the same speed, but they weren’t visibly attached to each other in any way. Then after proceeding south for maybe a mile or so, they suddenly turned to the east and in a split second they sped up to the fastest I have ever seen anything move and  almost instantly disappeared.  The turn and acceleration were virtually instantaneous. I never believed or disbelieved in UFOs prior to this incident.  I was 20 years old and hadn’t given it much thought.  Ever since this incident, I know they exist because I saw them with my own eyes and they were not anything of this world.  They were far too fast, advanced, and different from anything created by humans, especially at that time (and even still). Some people have said to me, ""Maybe they were jets from NAS Whidbey.""

Some blinking both colors.  Zipping in all directions at various speeds, but some moving so fast, I could barely follow them.   Some would interact. I remember one pair in particular that blinked furiously as they came together.  They spun around each other and then just zipped away at angles and speeds that seemed impossible. I never saw the smaller lights interact with the larger light, but by then, it had drifted behind a nearby woods and was hard to make out. I went to get a second witness to the event.  By the time I got back, all the lights had winked out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2015-06-05T00:00:00,40.4027,-85.2055

It's been 20 years, so I cant recall exact dates, but here's the story:     I saw a program about the wave of sightings in Mexico...the researcher issued a challenge.  He said to go out and watch the skies...give it about a week he said.  And tell me you don't see something strange.  So I took him up on this challenge...I've always been interested so why not. I rode around town on my bike looking at the skies. after the second day around dusk, I decided to pull over and eat the sandwich I had in my backpack.  I stopped on the bike trail very near the final approach path to Bakersfield Airport.  Being a pilot, I like planes, so I thought I would sit there and watch the planes for a bit. After a minute of two, I see what I think is a 737 on final.  After observing it for a few seconds I notice that the 'aircraft' is changing pitch by about 5 degrees ""nose"" up ""nose"" down and kind of sliding through the sky...almost in a push, push fashion (hard to describe in text).  Like it wasn't meant to be flying in the atmosphere.  So I thought that was unusual, and then I noticed that the object didn't have a  vertical stabilizer, so I start looking closer and notice...it doesn't have any wings. It's a disk!  About the same size as a 737, viewed from about a half mile.  Dark grey in color...looked like lead.  I got the impression that it was once piece. The object continued and was obscured by a tree so I get on my bike and ride around the turn in the path so I can see this thing.   After observing it for a few more seconds the craft has a sudden change in velocity, 90 degrees to the west and accelerates at an unbelievable rate, in fact it was almost like it just instantly was at the high velocity, not even really an acceleration.  It  heads of west until it appeared about the size of a quarter (about 1 second) and disappeared.  Best estimate is that it was doing maybe 10,000 miles per hour as it departed the area.  No sound whatsoever. A couple weeks later I see an ad in the classified section of the paper that reads 'Did anyone see anything strange in the skies of Bakersfield on xxx date at about xxx time.  If so, Call this number: 1-800..... I didn't call that number. If that's not odd enough for you, what strikes me as even odder is that I was out looking for this thing and all of a sudden...there it is.  ???    I have several other experiences to share that happened since then if your interested. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Saturday, July 25th, 1964, at 12:00 Noon, How can I ever forget this day.  It was a beautiful calm day.  Being I just shortly got my Driving permit at age 15, My Father told me to use the Family Car a 1956 Pontiac to drive home a employee of his.  He lived Below the Hill in Roscoe, Minnesota, 56371.  Just minutes away from his Business.  I drove, with passenger Dads car, North from Roscoe about a mile for a joy ride first.  This town is build on a wash out with a hill on both sides about a mile apart.  This will brings you at a creek that runs under the road.  The conversation was we were talking About being on our High School Base ball Team when School Starts in September,  That's when I saw the silver disk.  It was so visible and close against the blue sky.   I started yelling at the passenger. Look at that Silver Saucer!!  I then braked hard and pulled the car to the side of the road near the creek and parked.  I kept the engine running and shifted in neutral.  We both observed a Disk/ Saucer to the North of where we were parked about a half mile away.  We observed the Silver Saucer/Disk at first hovering about 250 Feet Above a farm to the N.W.  It made no sound, No lights or windows could be seen.  It then moved to the next farm a half mile away to the east and Hovering over it for about a minute.  It then crossed the road to the East, really got a good look at it being so close.  It hovered over a pasture.  Each time it stopped it Wobbling like it was having a hard time controlling it self.  It then moved over the pasture area slowly, stopped and Hovered and then started an upward diagonal assent.  The acceleration then speeded up to and incredible 3 second to the cloud level and Vanished.   We were terrified at the speed not knowing what this was, where it went and if it was coming back to flank us.  I turned the car around south and headed back to Roscoe as fast as dads 389 Pontiac car would go.  I drove back to his Business both of us running in telling what we just experienced.  Dad and several customers then armed themselves, went out side and saw nothing.  Several other sighting were reported that month in that county and area.  Later that fall 1964, a U.S Air force Radar team was dispatched to Regal, Minnesota Just 18 Miles Away.  The Radar team was set up with 4 railroad Cars with Radar Equipment and living Quarters.  Some of these Air force personal during their off duty time would patronize my dad's night club business on Saturday night with their Air Force uniforms on.  I had to work those nights.  Seeing the uniform, I ask what their were up to in Regal, Minnesota.  They responded it was Top Secret.  After 6 months or so I got to Know one of the Air force personal Quite well as their deployment was coming to an end.  He told me that the reason they were dispatched was because of all the UFO sighting seen on radar in our area.  He said, the mission was that an Early warning detection system was deployed if the soviet Union launched a missile, that's what they told the Paynesville press but we were looking for UFO's mostly because this is a hot spot he stated.  I told him what I saw on July 25, 1964, and he said, that why were are here, so many sightings were reported.",,,

Hancock Field is the international airport located in Syracuse, New York.  My home at the time of the event was approximately sixteen miles east of the airport.  By happenchance some years later I acquired a paperback edition of Project Blue Book which contained black & white UFO photographs.

It was in April 1970 and I was 11 at the time.  It was a warm clear spring night, time was around 19:00. I lived in Hamburg, NY, a suburb of Buffalo, NY. I was outside, shooting baskets at the hoop mounted to our garage (10ft).  Facing the basket to my right stood a cherry tree approximately 12-15 feet tall.  Our property in the back was 250 feet from the street behind us.  That street was lined with Maple trees, approximately 40-60 ft. tall. I was shooting basketball, as I stated earlier, when I noticed an orange colored light in the distance above the tree line.  The houses on my street were pretty much out in front allowing a backyards view of anything in the sky. I thought, “That’s not a plane or a helicopter, it’s too low.”  The dot I was observing was about a ¼ inch big and about a mile away.  It was now I could see it was getting larger and still no noise was heard.  I then thought “it’s not a plane, or a helicopter, I don’t hear anything. Within seconds It got to be about 3” ball of orange light and I could tell it was just above the tree line.  Now within a half mile it became obvious it was a UFO.  Within seconds the ball of light was almost above me and was approximately 30ft wide.  My jaw dropped as it came apparent as it was within 500 feet that two individuals were in the craft, they were silhouetted by the cabin orange glow of the craft.  Both were humanoid, one was sitting down and the other standing up.  The heads were bulbish as in wearing helmets and not the grey type heads as reported today. I yelled to my sister to come out of the garage but as in this took place a couple seconds it was gone.  I could not view it after about 200 feet past me as a house and trees on the corner blocked me.",2015-03-06T00:00:00,42.7091,-78.8301

I was trying to determine whether I could see Polaris or if it was obscured by distant trees, with the intent of calibrating my 10-inch Celestron on a future night, starting with Polaris.   While I was scanning that northern sky with the binoculars, a craft came into view.  It was a triangle, blacker than the background night sky.  There were white lights at each of the three corners and none elsewhere nor any of any other color.  The lights were not ""pinpoint"" lights but rather appeared to be large flat circles of light that appeared to be flush with the underside of the craft's body.   Above that triangular craft, there were two craft that were almost certainly smallish (perhaps military) jets flying a parallel course.  They were flying some significant distance apart but essentially lined up wingtip to wingtip.  Comparing the triangular craft to those jets indicated the craft was simply enormous--easily 2 to 3 times the length of an aircraft carrier.  There was no sound.   I am reporting it at this late date only because it's just tonight that I remembered there was an e-mail in my archive where I'd given a precise date to a friend about the sighting.   I spent 25 years in science and engineering as administrator overseeing many millions of research dollars on a wide variety of projects.  One proposal to DARPA (unfunded) just a couple of years before the sighting was for the construction of a similarly-large but entirely different sort of craft as something of an aerial aircraft carrier.  As far as I know, no such craft has been funded nor built, though I reckon it's possible and perhaps has not publicly disclosed.  I do know funding was given to a major corporation to explore potentional for such a craft.   I simply do not believe the craft was ""ours"" as there simply had not been enough time from that allocation of funding for such a craft to be designed nor even a prototype constructed.  I've no doubt the two jets were military and shadowing the triangle.  I'd read reports over the years of triangular craft so while I was excited to see such a thing, I was not really shocked or surprised.  I kept my binoculars trained on it until my view of it became obscured by the trees I reckoned might (and do) obscure Polaris from my backyard view.  I have several telescopes and several binoculars and have spent a *lot* of time under the night sky.  I've seen a few other unidentifiable things over the years, but nothing like this--an object that was *clearly* a ""craft"" of some type, obviously under intelligent control, in flight.  (And that flight seemed to be perfectly matched to the two jets overhead with neither the jets nor the triangle lagging or overtaking.)",2015-03-06T00:00:00,36.41691493506493,-97.88815064935065

We took off from Austin and were ascending at an altitude of about 10,000 ft I would guess maybe a bit more since we're only about a minute and a half to two minutes in the flight.  I get nervous flying so I always need an isle seat so I can look out the window.  After a brief rest and trying to relax from the take off which is the most difficult time for me I decided I couldn't rest or relax so I sat up and decided to look out my window because this seems to get me out of my feeling state and into a visualizing state.  Well I look out and down to my left and there at about the 7 o'clock position and I would guess maybe 1-2 thousand feet below and about the same out away from the left side of the aircraft was a huge round metallic ball about the size of I would guess two Volkswagen cars on top of one another.  These are all fair guesses because without any! thing to compare it to it's kind of hard but the one thing I know for sure is the shape and color and the fact that it didn't belong there.  I always said I felt it had to be moving at a good speed because we were at lease it seemed not pulling away from it very fast.  I guessed we were traveling at about 350 still increasing and climbing so it's speed I would guess maybe at 200 because I did watch it for about 20 seconds until it was too far behind.  At the time I was not into ufo stuff so it wasn't a big deal but non the less I new it was odd and out of place.

What was amazing about the 13 aircraft was they were able to connect together with each another and then they were able to completely detach themselves which occurred a number of times.   The 13 flying aircraft completely defied logic with the flight pattern they were flying on since they possessed the capability of attaching back to one another at will.  It is beyond anything I have ever witnessed in my life and for any two known aircraft to be able to fly that close to each other would have certainly resulted in a crash, let alone 13 total aircraft being able to do so.

I worked at a local restaurant in Mokena.  I was in charge of cleaning and closing up the store.  It was getting close to closing time when I went out back to take out the garbage.   On my way back into the store I saw 3 strange red lights flying north above LaGrange road.   At first, I thought it was one giant craft in the shape of a triangle.  But I waited for the formation to pass under some stars, and when the stars didn’t black out like I had expected, I realized that it was 3 craft flying synchronized in a triangle formation.  I knew what I was seeing because I’d seen the videos before and watched some UFO documentaries.  I may not necessarily believe in aliens, but I knew what I was seeing was unexplained.  I immediately ran inside to grab any witness I could.  I was shouting, “Hurry, It’s a UFO come on!  It’s those ones you see on TV!”  Only my co-worker ((male name deleted)) came out to see. He recognized the formation too and tried to record it on his iPhone, but it was dark and! nothing showed up on the video.   Another co-worker of ours came out too, but by then 2 of the 3 red lights had faded away, so it didn’t seem like anything extraordinary to him.   I resumed closing up the store.  I was quite shaken up and even told some customers about what I had seen.   About 15 minutes later, I was outside again taking more garbage out, when I saw 2 more red.  These 2 lights weren’t flying in any formation and they were flying much faster than the first 3 I had seen.  They were traveling the same route:  North up LaGrange road curving East over I-80.  It seemed as though the 2 were trying to catch up to the other 3 lights.   Before I went home, I stopped at the BP gas station located at LaGrange and 191st st.  There were to Mokena police officers in there, and I was so shocked by what I had seen, I even had the nerve to ask the police officers if they had heard about any UFO sightings, at the risk of sounding crazy. They didn’t hear anything and I did get the feeling they thought I was crazy.   I later found out that there happened to be multiple famous UFO sightings really close by in Tinley Park.   I’m only now reporting this because I had recently been watching a documentary that put a few more pieces together for me, and I hope this information may be able to do the same for someone else.

Starting around 1998 we began to notice silver egg-shaped objects following aircraft around Charlotte International Airport.  I would estimate dozens of clear sightings from 1998 until 2001.  Most of the sightings were on clear, sunny days but some on cloudy, overcast days.  The craft were mostly viewed following south to north, which would be more with departing aircraft but on occasion they would follow aircraft on high-approach, north to south.  Sometimes above and behind and sometimes below and behind. I am ex-career Air Force so I have a pretty good knowledge of aircraft and flight behavior.  This was always a formation type pursuit as if they were pacing the aircraft.  If I were to judge distance I would estimate up to a quarter of a mile behind at times but on occasion we would see one directly above or below usually 300+ feet from the aircraft.   Objects would pace the aircraft from seconds to a few minutes and sometimes it was not uncommon to see the object switch and follow another aircraft.  This would go on from five to ten minutes and sometimes more.  Altitudes generally ranged from 3000 feet up to 5000 feet. The objects were always silver-metallic and egg shaped.  About a third of the size of the aircraft, generally a commercial airliner, 135 or DC-10.  There were no other markings on the object but you could clearly see it was sphere shaped and no flat surfaces visible.  A very polished and smooth looking object.  When the object left it was in an instant like a bolt of lightning.  Just a streak across the sky and then gone!  Can't imagine the G-Force it had to undergo when it disappeared. Never did set a pattern to when they would appear but it was often enough that neighbors and people we knew from around the general area would see them and talk about it.  Occasionally would witness objects with pulsating, multi-colored lights pacing aircraft at night but not very often.   Spent most of my young adult life on or around Air Force bases but have never witnessed anything like that before, or since I left the Lake Norman area.

The date and time of this sighting is approximate.  I am entering it here, as well as a more recent sighting, after doing a bit of research for my own personal interest. Sometime in the early Spring of 2007, I was taking a country drive with my then-girlfriend at night (about 11 o'clock pm).  We were headed west on a road about a mile south of feedlot just north of Pratt, KS.  As I was driving, I saw a bright green light streaking overhead in roughly the same direction as I was headed.  It moved quickly and seemed to burn out.  Its altitude was probably around 500 to 1000 feet above ground level.  At the time, I'd simply assumed that it was a meteor burning green as it passed through methane gas emitting from the feedlot below.  I suppose that is what it could've been. The reason for me bringing it to NUFORC's attention is that I happened to be perusing the report database and came across a report fitting roughly the same description of the event I witnessed in '07.  Having always assumed that what I saw was just an easily explained event (meteor cooking off methane gas as it plummeted earthward?), I did a quick internet search of green meteors.  What I stumbled across was the supposed phenomenon of ""green fireballs"" and an Air Force research project from the early '50s called ""Project Twinkle"".  After reading the declassified conclusion of the project, I believe that my sighting does indeed fall into the category of an ""Unidentified Flying Object,"" though I doubt that it had much to do with any ""intelligent"" origin. I appreciate the NUFORC resource and I'm glad to see that it is still going strong after all these years. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

By that time I have chased after him to the door and see a black triangle craft slowly clearing my roof line (I have a roof overhang) into the open part of my front yard. (1/2 acre) I could see the bottom of the  craft and saw lights at the points of the triangle but there was no sound.  Our pine trees were 29 yrs old at that time and the craft was just above them moving very very slow. I tried to get out into the front yard but my husband was rigid in the doorway and blocked me from leaving the house. We watched it moved east crossing the street over a heavily wooded 4 acres of land until we could not see it any more. My husband tells me that he could see an object moving toward our house from way off and watched it til it moved over our roof and ran for the front door.  We were so stunned by this event that all I remember was that he went back to his tv room and we never discuss this again.  I wanted to but he did not!  The sky was clear and not black like there was some moon light. We lived next to the Ford truck plant property line and thats where it had to fly next.

I was standing outside, playing basketball and admiring the wispy clouds when something catches my eye, a black object hovering in my peripheral.  I turn 90 degrees to see it hovering about 1000 or so feet above the ground, not rotating, just hovering there.  I take a step towards it after staring for three seconds and it instantly shoots up about 2000 more feet and hovered there for another couple seconds before jetting off over my head in a very sharp zigzagging pattern at extremely high speeds and disappearing out of sight in a matter of 5 seconds or so.  I felt uneasy afterwards and then headed back inside. My memory on this is hazy as I'd somewhat repressed it in the back of my mind until two months ago when my psychiatrist helped me remember it.  This has recently inspired me to get into the field of ufology and find out what it was I saw that day, or possibly see something like it again.

Myers Beach, FL Shape: Sphere Duration:15 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/118/S118454.html,"15 orange lights observed traveling near Ft. Myers Beach, Fl. It was Friday, May 4th at approx. 9:05 P.M. Gf and I were walking north on Ft. Myers Beach, FL.  There were no other persons present.  We both observed at approximately the same time orange lights on the horizon.  We were near the Neptune Inn when we saw the first lights.  We observed them approaching.  They were approaching from a North-northwest direction.  They were bright orange, like a street lamp one would see from a distance of a mile away or so.  We saw three at first. I thought they may have been several planes on approach to Regional Southwest Airport (RSW), as we had seen several commercial jets fly over us on the way to landing at RSW. The lights were not in a line, but they were flying in a South-southeast direction approaching. They varied in height between themselves by 500 - 1000 feet between the 3 of them as they approached. Standing on the beach they appeared to be on the horizon just to the left of the last light on a building on the beach, an! d moving towards us from the North-northwest. The light would have been between St. James City, on Pine Island and Pelican/Cape Coral cities. Traveling over the Matlacha Pass National Wildlife Refuge which is several miles to our North-northwest. I am guessing, but they appeared to be traveling several hundred miles per hour. I had observed several jets inbound to South West Florida Airport earlier in the evening as they were making their final approach, pass over where I was at. Those jets travel at 200 mph on approach? These objects were moving at least 2-3X faster than the inbound jets were. The three traveled towards us, but not directly at us. On their current path of travel they would pass us out over the ocean on our left. As they neared the north end of Ft. Myers Beach island, the objects appeared to change direction. The objects turned in a southwesterly direction. The objects were flying well above the clouds. Perhaps at 2,500-4,000 feet. I am guessing the clouds ! were 1,500 feet ? that night. I have looked but cannot find th! at infor mation. Clouds were broken and not very large. We watched the objects as the traveled away and appear to disappear above the clouds. At no time did we observe the lights change to the standard red and white flashing strobe lights indicating a plane. We wondered what we have just seen, when 3 more lights appeared. They traveled in the same previously described manner. However the last light appeared to higher and it turned in a more westerly manner. We watched what appeared a commercial jet flight passing overhead, flying in a west northwesterly direction as we observed these lights The commercial jet appeared to be at 35,000 feet or so. These objects were well below the jet. In the approximate time of 10 minutes, we observed 15 of these orange lights approach in the same way as described, turn and head out over the Gulf of Mexico. Two of the lights traveled in a West-southwest direction. Those two appeared to be higher than the rest as they turned. All of the others traveled! in the south-southwest direction. The lights came in 3, 3 again, then 4, then 2, then 3 again. Just as one group disappeared out over the gulf, more would appear on the horizon. I live 2 miles from a large commercial airport in Illinois. I see and hear jets, and propeller driven commercial and private aircraft everyday and night. I watch them on approach from 10 - 15 miles away. These lights did not appear to be known aircraft. They made no sound. I saw no standard red/white, white strobe lights. I could not really tell shape. Perhaps round. Size ? 30 feet,  I'm guessing on the first light. I got a good look at it before it disappeared over clouds. All of the lights to me had like a halo type effect in appearance.  I guess luminescent would be a good word. I am am guessing its size in comparison to commercial jets that flew over us 1 1/2 hours earlier at a similar height. I tried to take cell phone photos. Only one shows two orange lights. Nothing definitive. I didn't have! phone set to ""night mode""... nuts. I deleted the ph! oto as Y ou couldn't observe anything of value.  What were they ? I do not know.  I reported this to MUFON almost 2 years ago.  I didn't know you existed..",2015-04-17T00:00:00,26.4707,-81.9181

It was chevron shaped, but was more rectangular and was longer.   My first thought was that it was a jet, but  it was flying far too low, and if it was we would have heard the engines, and it was dead silent.   My second thought was that it was a large bird, but that was quickly ruled out since it was huge, probably the size (length wise) of a plane.   We only noticed it because for a few seconds, it blocked out the stars with its shape (which was the only way I'm able to describe its shape since there were no lights on it).

I had an experience in 1968…  One-school morning I was waiting for my friend mark but he was a little late. Eventually he turned up and we made our way to school.  The streets were quiet back then and all the kids were presumably at school.  As we turned the corner I saw something glint in the sky. We ran up the road to take a closer look.  We came to a lamppost; the inspection door was slid down. There was a strange electrical smell which I now no to be ozone.  I looked up and there were 2 greyish silver disks in a stepped formation the highest craft had a long tube coming from it connecting to the lower craft, the lower craft had a long tube coming from it going to the lamp post, Mark and I were looking and waving, there was no noise just sitting there in the sky quite low down, eventually a skinny blonde haired woman came along with 2 little girls who saw the crafts, she looked frightened and ushered the girls on in a hurry.  My friend mark said we better go otherwise we are going to be late for school, I replied I wanted to stay and look at these things.  Mark walked off and I saw him walk around the corner and all of a sudden I felt panicky.  I called after him and ran round the corner. He was nowhere to be seen.  So I carried on walking to school, looking back to see if the crafts were still in the sky.  When I arrived at school, my teacher told me off for being late.  I looked over at marl and he had completed an activity.  On the way home from school the inspection door was completely off the lamppost, and I could see everything was burnt out. Next day the council removed the lamppost and put a new one up on the other side of the road, after this event I started suffering from panic attacks and remembered things that happened during my missing time. I remember being in the highest craft with a female entity; she showed me a device that looked like a TV with rounded corners.  On the TV I was shown a! clip of destruction and death.  Whilst in the craft the female! entity summoned me over the far side of the craft, she made a far gesture and something like a big window appeared like the side of the craft was transparent.  I hesitated as I thought she might push me out.  She reassured me and I went over she pointed outside and said your house. I could see the roof of my house. I kind of remember being transported back to the ground.  The female entity was small and thin, she wore a one piece hoody (onezie) but the face is blocked out.  At some point I must of been in the presence of these entities another time. I remember being on a craft with them I was told I had to go as they were being intercepted.  I didn’t understand what intercepted meant as I as just a kid, but could tell she was getting irritable with me because there was a sense of urgency, obviously there is more to this account than what I have mentioned as there are blocks.

This has been a family secret for decades.  I was not born at the time, but have been told by my Sisters and Father about the event.  My Father has told us not to tell ANYONE including family about what happened.  He feared people would think we were crazy.  My wife only found out after five years of being married.   This is how the events of the story were told to me.  Mostly by my sisters as my Father rarely talks of it still.  It was an August night, and my father (31 yrs old) and sisters (11 and 9 yrs old) were returning from Abilene after visiting my Uncle.  They had stopped first at the Tasty Freeze for ice cream for the trip back to Salina.  While traveling west on highway 40 my father noticed what he described as a blimp hoovering over the tree line.  The object was barely visible (no lights) in the fading light of the evening.  My father and sisters wanted to go see it, so they turned off the highway onto a dirt road.  They assumed it WAS a blimp, and wanted to see it up close.  This is were the stories are told differently by each, but all tie together.  This is what my younger sister says happened.  She says that they were getting close to the object, and the next thing she remembers is my Dad driving like crazy down the road yelling, ""Where is it!  Where the f@#% is it!"".  She said that her ice cream was completely melted, and the radio was real loud and all static.  She said she cried all the way home, because we never see our Dad scared.         My oldest sister was looking out the window, and also crying and screaming where is it.  My younger sister doesn't remember any beings are any other details about the ship.  She only experienced the lose of time.  This is where my younger and older sisters stories differ.  My oldest sister says that they or she because she didn't see or hear my father and sister were taking on board or somewhere.  She said it was like a blink of an eye ,and then she was on a table with bluish light all around.  She says that she saw no one but felt them in the room. The ne xt thing that happened she doesn't talk about to detailed, but says she felt extreme pain all over her body.  She says it felt like she was burning up inside, and that it went on for a long time.  And that it happened in sections at a time.  Then she said it was FLASH back in the car hauling ass.  Now my father won't say if anything  happened to him, but says they saw SOMETHING.  Both of my sisters said when they got home my Dad talked to my Mom in private.  Then they slept for the next week in my parents room, while my Father sat in the chair with a pistol on his lap and a shotgun next to him.  They said they could see him at night get up and keep looking out the windows with the pistol in his hand.  I was born 4 years later.   Recently i have been experiencing the Old Hag Syndrome.  I feel like someone is in the room with me, and is very scary.  My oldest sister is very freaked about this, and I told my Dad and I could see him look worried.  This is why I decided to tell someone about what happened to them. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",,39.0279,-97.2213

Hi, I am a South African foreign teacher working in ShangQiu City, Henan Province in China. I am 53 years old and have a University degree.  I have been skeptical of UFO sightings generally, but these objects I saw didn't look or behave like anything I have seen or heard of before. I was returning to my apartment on the evening of 29 April, 2015, when I noticed 6 separate colored lights in the sky to the south of where I was in East-central ShangQiu City.  The lights kept changing in color in no discernible sequence. Each separate light flickering along a short horizontal axis approximately 1 or 2 mm.  The colors of the lights were varied through the spectrum and they were rich strong colors, much like neon lights or the LEDs used nowadays for signage.  They were most often red followed by violet and green with the least common colors being yellow, orange and white. The objects were clustered in two groups. The first was a group of two that appeared highest in the sky about 45 degrees above the horizon.  They were about a fist's distance apart horizontally. The second group was lower down at about 25 degrees above the horizon, just above and to the right of a tall building.  They were clustered in a trapezoid shape with long axis being horizontal, about 15cm long and the vertical axis about half of that.  The lower left light/object seemed to be larger than any of the others as its lights clearly flickered along a horizontal axis of about 2mm. After about 15 minutes the left member of the first group began to move slowly and steadily following an arc that took it south-west through the second cluster passing between the leftmost light and the lower left light (previously described as the largest).  It then headed south at the same rate and disappeared below the horizon after about 35 seconds. The lights then remained in place for about another ten minutes.  At that point the leftmost light of the trapezoid cluster departed, also heading south over the horizon at about the same rate as the previous light taking about 20 seconds to disappear. What followed was interesting.  The remaining light(rightmost) of the group of 2, then began to move rapidly from side to side(horizontally) a distance of perhaps 3-4cm taking about a second to cover that distance each way.  It kept this up for about 5 minutes. After it stopped nothing happened for a few minutes then the largest object began to follow the southward heading at the same rate as the others and disappeared over the horizon.  It was followed shortly afterwards by the top right-hand member of the trapezoid cluster.  I waited for another five or so minutes then went inside as I was hungry and didn't want to eat too late, leaving the remaining two objects in the sky. I attempted to photograph the lights but the air was too hazy with a lot of ambient light from the city and the near full moon, so nothing much is discernible in the 3 or 4 pics I took with my cellphone. What intrigued me about these lights is that their behavior was unlike anything one would expect of aircraft in terms of the lights displayed, their ability to remain in position steadily for such a length of time as well as the behavior of the light that moved side to side.  I can't think of anything that might behave in this fashion. Today (6/5/2015) I saw a news article with video in the Huffington Post about a sighting in San Diego   http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/05/san-diego-unexplained-aerial-lights_n_7193002.html  and the lights there were very much like what I saw except they were definitely seperate.

About 10 years ago, I'm staying at my fathers house...laying in bed...about 9:30pm...lights are on...I'm just laying there.  All of a sudden the ceiling opens up....almost like if you took a hammer and demolished the celling...a whole about 2 feet in diameter, jagged.  I could see the rafters, the flex conduit, everything looks brand new.  A glowing orb descends from the hole....hovers maybe 1 foot below the ceiling, orange in color about the size of a basketball. It just sits there and rotates for about 20 seconds.  Of course Im thinking 'what the hell is this'?  After about 20 seconds the orb ascends back through the hole in the ceiling, the ceiling closes up and its gone. About 2 years later I get a call from my father...he says he has a story to tell me. What he tells me is that he's laying in bed...middle of the night, wakes up to a sound approaching in the distance.  He tells me it fly's right overhead.  Sounds like two large pieces of rock scraping against one another but somehow electrified and very loud...as loud as a guitar amplifier cranked all the way up on the roof.  The sound passes overhead and off in to the distance.  As it exits, he tells me that he could hear dogs barking off in the distance. About 4 years later, I'm laying in bed in Oakland, CA, and wake up and hear a strange sound. As I lay there and listen, it approaches and passes right overhead.  It's exactly the same sound as my father told me about. Like 2 large pieces of rock scraping against each other but electrified somehow.  As this passes overhead I see what looks like flame coming in through the blinds on the window.  I thought maybe the transformer on the pole outside blew up.  As the object left I can hear dogs barking off in the distance.  Same thing as my dad said. The next morning I went outside to see if there was a transformer that blew...there's not even a pole there...never was.  (In retrospect I question what that light was)...I don't think it was flame at all. About 2 years ago I was driving with a  girlfriend to go get a bottle of wine. Safeway was about 1 mile away and I've driven the route 1,000 times.  As we are driving back home make the familiar right turn off of the main street, and a few seconds later I notice that I'm lost.  I have no idea where I'm at.  I pass a school, some apartment buildings and a few small businesses.  I ask my girlfriend if she recognized any of this and she said no.  I see a stoplight up ahead so instead of turning around I decide to just drive up to the intersection to see where I'm at.  As I approach the intersection I realize that I am on the opposite side of the street where I should have been but headed in the correct direction.  All I have to do is drive through the intersection, going straight through and I'm right where I want to be.  Even taking a left turn wouldn't have put me in that orientation.  Taking a left would have put me on the wrong side of the street but not heading in that direction.  I would have been headed in the opposite direction. When I got back home I asked my buddy how long we were gone. he said about an hour.  It's a one mile trip!  To me that was about 15 minutes. The reason I'm telling you all this is because I was telling a friend about this the other day and he was saying ""there's a good chance you've been abducted."" I have no memory of ever having been abducted but I don't think that means a whole lot. I'm curious what you guys think about this and I'm doing my best to describe it....not easy with words. Please advise… ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2015-06-05T00:00:00,,

At 2:30 am, I went out to the driveway to start my car.  I saw a light in the sky that I thought might be a helicopter with a spotlight facing in my direction.  It looked like a white orb of light with beams extending out of it, similar to a star but much larger. About the size of a dime at arms length. Its position in the sky was where I sometimes see the life flight helicopter.  It was moving across the sky at a similar speed to a helicopter but was also gaining altitude.  The brightness of the light decreased as it got higher. The suburban neighborhood was completely noiseless at this late hour, no traffic and no wind.  It was very cold out, around 18 degrees.  The light never made any noises at all.  I often sky watch to look at stars and whenever I see any type of aircraft, no matter how high I can always hear the engine noises clearly.  This light was 100% silent. The movement of the light was a bit strange, almost jerky and I thought I could see a small green light on the top. The light moved behind a group of several trees trees at one point and then came out the other side. I could still see it a little between the branches. After it cleared the trees and continued going up and forward the light arrived at the spot in the sky that was exactly parallel to the direction I was facing.  At that point it suddenly stopped and immediately made a 90 degree turn.  So now the light was on a path that would fly directly over my head.  I think it might have slowed a little first before turning, just for a fraction of a second, but it basically just turned on a dime.  No arc or obvious slowdown, it just happened really fast. At this time the light was smaller and was comparable to venus on a very clear night (except that it was moving). The quietness of the surroundings and having this strange silent light suddenly turn in my direction caused me concern.  I know this is probably coincidence and not likely, but in my mind it felt like whatever it was saw me and turned to check me out.  I realize there may be a rational explanation for this sighting but at the time I was feeling too exposed standing in the middle of a large parking lot and had to say ""see ya"", and turned and ran inside. A few minutes later I looked around and saw no more lights. Could that have been a drone??  I am early 40's, music teacher and into science. Mostly physics and cosmology. Am into some metaphysics and ufology but try to balance it by also following the skeptic scene.  NEVER expected to see something unusual in the sky!

It was a great deal bigger - I would say at least 30 times bigger than the planes, moving very slowly, and it didn't look like a very discrete object.  Rather, it seemed almost like an organism, with a ""vibrational"" sort of form.   The hotel room was pretty soundproof, so I couldn't say if it made a sound, as I never even heard any of the planes.  The object was continuing its glide, parallel to the ground, towards the left of the window, when it suddenly stopped and turned itself up until I could see that it was actually a triangular craft, with the somber white lights on each corner.  The object, which was dark colored and reminded me of a sting ray, continued on its course to the left, until it disappeared from sight.   I stayed up for over an hour trying to capture an image with my camera, but the object never reappeared.

It was a very clear evening sky over the Rocky Mountain’s front range.  From my home in Berthoud, Colorado, I have unobstructed view of Longs Peak and the front range.  I watched the sunset just to the left of Longs Peak.  It was a beautiful golden sunset.   Suddenly, there was a “large laser beam of light” that came from the direction of the sunset and as it approached overhead, somewhat to the right of where I was standing, appeared a huge triangle shaped object.  It was not metallic looking.  The UFO was high in the sky at cloud level.  The object’s design was akin to ‘tinker toy’.   The three disc connectors were red and they were HUGE.  The connector pipes were long cylindrical golden tubes.  I could see clear sky inside and up through the triangle shaped object.  I froze and blinked my eyes because I could not believe what I was seeing.  I mean, I purposefully blinked. When I ope! ned my eyes, I made mental note of the red round disc connectors.  All I can compare them to is extremely large round 'red throat lazengers'.  They were kind of translucent looking but yet a solid shape.  The huge connecting tubes were like pure golden color and very long.  All three tubes were the same length – a great distance of length between the three red disc connectors.  I was stunned. I blinked, again on purpose, and there it was. It was then I thought the disc connectors looked like 'throat lazengers tablets'.  I could see no openings in the forward most red disc connector.  The thing was huge.  Very colorful. It made no sound.  I then blinked one more time and when I opened my eyes the UFO was gone.  Afterwards, I had a sense that I saw three beams and jettisoned object(s) out of the sunset.   When they got in front of my house they came to rest momentarily and then vanished.  Each beam from the sunset had the same trajectory and the UFO’s came to rest in the same spot,  high up and in front of the west side of house.  The object was five times the palm of my hand (though I didn’t perform this step in my observations).  All I can say the UFO was extremely large.  Each of red disc of the triangle was the size of an aircraft carrier, high up in the sky at cloud level.  I was confused and in shock.  It all happened in less than a minute.   I am 68 years old.  I study UFO reports, and have done so since I was a kid.  I was so confounded by what I saw it didn’t even mention it to my wife.  I told no one about it until January 2015, and again to a group of friends in Feb, 2015, when the subject of UFOs came up.   Just recently, May 29, 2015, I found this image: http://nationalufocenter.com/file/2015/04/COSedalia24Apr151.png  ...on George Filer's web site.  I couldn’t believe it.  The MUFON picture (April 24, 2015) is very close to what I saw and it was taken in Sedalia, Colorado, during a sunset!

Ironically, I believe the name of the trail we were hiking on was called Devil's Bridge Trail.  After we finished our hike my girlfriend decided to lay down and rest for a while while I continued to walk around at the base of the trail by myself for a while.  The sky was completely blue with not even a single cloud in the sky.  I looked up and saw a jelly-bean or egg shaped object (orientated horizontally) in the sky.  The object had a smooth, mirror-like surface which completely covered the entire surface of the object.  I guesstimate the object to be approximately two to three thousand feet up in the air (I am from Chicago, IL, so I used the Sears tower height as reference). The object did not move at all, did not make any sound and left no vapor trail.  I stared and studied the object for about a minute or so trying to figure out what it was.  Using logic, I figured it either had to be an experimental military craft or a UFO.  At this point in time my girlfriend had started to walk over to where I was standing while I was observing the object. I had turned my head away for no more than five seconds to inform my girlfriend of what I had been observing for the past minute so she could see the same thing that I was looking at, when all of a sudden, IT VANISHED !!  Can't explain it at all.   I did some research online and found out there was another gentleman who actually filmed the same object I had seen in the sky around the same time (I think he filmed the object in November of 2012 in Sedona).  You can view his video on youtube.com.  The object that he filmed was the same object that I had seen with the only difference being its orientation (his object was orientated vertically as opposed to the object I saw which was orientated horizontally)  Any explanation about what I encountered would surely help satisfy my curiosity.

I have a love for star gazing and we often look for planets and constellations went we are outside with our dogs at night.  This is exactly what we were doing on the night of January 15, 2014.  We live near a small airport and are accustomed to seeing them flying at all hours.  (Also, my brother is in the airforce so I feel very confident in what different aircrafts look like).  But what we saw was so unlike any plane I have ever seen. We first just saw a very bright light on the horizon, moving slowly upward. I had already found the north star so I knew it wasn't that.  I thought maybe it could be a launching of a space craft in FL, but decided in North Georgia we were probably too far to see it with a naked eye.   As we watched it we noticed it wasn't going up, it was moving in our direction. When it got closer we realized the bright light was a spotlight in the very front of the aircraft and could see the beam spanning out in front of it.  When it flew overhead, it made no noise, and was flying helicopter low.  (We can hear the planes when they fly over us even though they are much higher in the sky.)  The underneath of the aircraft is what really shook us. It looked like a carnival ride.  There were so many lights.  The whole underside was filled with them.  Some where white, and they didn't blink or change, but the other ones did. One minute they were red then blue, or orange, or green.  In no particular pattern! or variation.  They changed at different times, with no set time in between.  The white lights were always white, but the colored lights changed so drastically and were never in unison. It was so bizarre.  Our phones were in the house and we even talked about one of us running in to get to get one so that we could try to film it, but neither of us wanted to miss it. It was extraordinary.  The whole thing was probably around 15 or 20 minutes.  It was flying very slow and every low for how big it was.  It was V-shaped, almost like a fighter jet, but not quite.  The aircraft itself was had to make out the exact shape because it was black against the sky. I have never had a UFO encounter before and didn't really know what to do about it, if anything.  I am definitely not saying it's aliens!  I want that to be very clear.  (There is no real evidence that they even exist and without hard evidence I am still skeptical.)  I'm just saying that I could not identify it and it was like nothing I have ever seen or heard of.  I still think about it often and every now and then I will do some googleing to see if I can find a known, man made aircraft that it could have been.   That is actually how I came across this website (http://patch.com/georgia/barrow/ufos-sighted-near-winder) of people in my area who saw what sounds to be the same thing - a relief for me because I know how crazy it sounds.

Pointed it out to the driver, but he didn’t really pay attention as he was driving.  Less than 5 minutes later we had reached our destination.  I spotted another of these objects. This time the driver saw it, too. He said it was probably a tower. I told him it wasn't a tower. It wasn't blinking and it was orange, not red.He looked around at some other towers and agreed what we were seeing was NOT a tower. It finally just disappeared.  Other people seemed to be watching it, too.   Later from inside of our destination, we could see more of these objects.  They appeared further away than the one we had seen when we went in.  They were moving from the NE to the SW.  There were fireworks that night, but these were not fireworks nor were they Chinese lanterns. I have hesitated all these months reporting this as I’m sure people would think we were crazy.  But we both saw them.

While watching fireworks, at approximately 9:00PM, my friend and I noticed a bright orangish, reddish, yellowish object moving in a strange pattern across the sky, looked like a fireball.  It started at what seemed a fairly low altitude and then ascended toward the moon, disappearing just beyond the moon.  We then saw another, come in from a different direction, but looked and acted similarly to the first, then another, again looked and acted similarly to the other two.  This lasted approximately 5-10 min.   We then saw one much lower than any of the previous three had been, appeared to be barely above the street lights.  It was coming from the south, moving north.  It seemed to be coming directly toward us, then arced up toward the moon and disappeared before getting as high the moon.  We saw approximately 10-12 of these follow the exact same path.  Probably 30-45 seconds apart.   Other people appeared to be viewing them as well.  My friend tried to take pictures with phone, but they did not show anything that was discernible other than the moon in one of the pictures.  We did not talk to any of the other people. None of the objects blinked or made any sounds.  They weren’t fireworks.  They did not look like any aircrafts I have ever seen flying before except the ones we also saw the previous night in a different part of town.  Neither my friend nor I have seen any since.

While we were driving through the neighborhood, we both saw bright gold-orange lights above and behind some of the houses.  We didn’t have a clear view, as we were glancing these lights between houses as we passed them. At first, I had thought only I saw them.  As my husband saw me craning my neck to catch peeks between the houses, he said, “It is streetlights, babe.”  Then I knew that he has seen the same lights I had.  So I took his word for it and we dropped off the kids.  The kids had not noticed anything as they were in the back talking and distracted by teen things. As we pulled up towards the stoplight on Hwy 27, we saw the lights in the sky again!  Only now, they were off in the distance across the highway on the east side of Hwy 27.  What we saw in the sky were what appeared to be 2 enormous triangle shaped objects that consisted of 3 large and extremely bright gold-orange lights each.  **This could also have been 6 bright lights in two separate V formations??**  But to us, it appeared to be 2 large triangles with 3 lights a piece.  As we were watching the lights and freaking out, I was telling my husband that I knew I had seen something when we were dropping the kids off!  The lights moved farther away together for a few moments, then suddenly, right before our eyes, one of the triangles (3 lights) just disappeared!!  We had pulled onto Hwy 27 going south and keeping our eyes on the last triangle.  We were speeding down the highway trying to reach a particular side road that we could pull off on and try to record on my husband’s phone.**  As we were driving, I was trying to record and did a horrible job of it.  I was so excited/nervous that I never actually hit record, so I got nothing! **  The triangle of lights continued moving very swiftly to the southeast.  Suddenly, as we watched, this triangle just disappeared, same as the first!!  It disappeared in the vicinity of the Omni Resorts golf course. Right as it disappeared, we reached the side road and pulled off near the new Four Corners High School.  We rolled down the windows of the car and searched the sky to see if it would reappear or if there were any other traces of it.  My husband said that if it were any commercial aircraft it would have navigation lights (blinking red, green, blue, or white type lights) like you see on airplanes and helicopters.  There was no sign of the triangle. It simply vanished. I am not sure what this was.  This is not the first “UFO” we’ve seen either.  We are the family that saw a domed-disk UFO on Sept. 24, 2011.  We are still coming to terms with what we saw that night.  Then to see this last night is mind boggling.  I am wondering why many other people who were on the road have not reported seeing this?!  It was very obvious.",2015-06-15T00:00:00,28.23565,-81.66055327868852

Since cell phone reception is bad in the house, I stepped out to the screen porch.  As I was talking with my son, I noticed looking south of our property, 3 bright amber lights in a triangular formation.  From my vantage point they appeared to be the size of a stoplight that you would see about 2 cars away from the street intersection.  The luminosity of the 3 lights was much brighter than a signal light; more like a car’s headlight. I called to my husband who was in the living room and asked him to come and see the 3 lights.  He said, it’s probably Venus, Jupiter and Saturn all lined up.  I did see the planets lined up, but they were north of our house.  The lights I was observing was in the southern sky. When my husband came out and looked at the 3 lights, he was baffled.  Just for reference, my husband is a former Air Force Captain.  He also holds a degree in electrical engineering.  Needless to say he is a very logical thinking individual.  He was speechless as he gazed on the 3 lights.  Then as we were watching the stationary lights, all of a sudden a formation of 3 more lights appeared east of the first set of lights.  It was extremely close to the first set of 3. Size and luminosity was identical, but it did not form a perfect triangle.   The first and second set of lights may have been on the same entity.   My husband said “go get a camera”.  I went inside, looked for a minute or so, but all I could find was a pair of binoculars.  I went back, took a look through the binoculars, then I handed them to my husband.  I continued observing the lights with my bare eyes, but my husband was looking at it through the binoculars.   Then about 1–2 minutes into our viewing, the second set of lights began to turn off one by one.  The first set remained stationary.  Then about a minute later, one by one it began to turn off.  The last light did not turn off but began to diminish in size and luminosity until it finally was off. It was a clear night, where you could see lots of stars and planets in the sky.  What we saw was not a planet or star. It was not very high up in the sky.  I did not have to tilt my head to look up, as you do with the stars in the sky.  We just looked south.  It looked as if it was right on the other side of Lake Gentry.",2015-06-15T00:00:00,28.22573378378378,-81.23706891891892
"Flat platform with intense white, red and blue lights silently hovering only thirty feet or so above a residential area in town.",Fairbanks,AK,2014-11-20T22:00:00,unknown,30 seconds,"Occurred : 11/20/2014 22:00  (Entered as : 11/20/14 22:00) Reported: 4/10/2015 9:06:31 AM 09:06 Posted: 4/17/2015 Location: Fairbanks, AK Shape: Unknown Duration:30 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/118/S118432.html,"Flat platform with intense white, red and blue lights silently hovering only thirty feet or so above a residential area in town. Driving with a friend on the Steese Highway in town between third street and 10th Ave, we saw a very brightly lit craft hovering only about thirty feet or so above the residential area by the VFW. It caught my eye because the lights were so intense and it was just hovering there almost motionless, but not. At first I thought it was a new street light, but then it moved slightly and the body of the thing was either totally black or invisible. We were stopped at the light on third and Steese and nobody else seemed to see it except for the two of us--(I was going to pull off the road after the intersection but thought the best of it and moved on, so that could have been what others were doing as well, but it just seemed as though people ignored it completely). I rolled the window down to get a better look and listen to see if it was a  helicopter while thinking of it oddly out of place if it were. I have seldom, if ever seen helicopters hovering that close to rooftops of residential areas before without police and the rest of the gang there; it seemed out of place to me. It was about the size of a large single rotor helicopter though, and either had a flat bottom that held the array of lights, or it was just a flat platform altogether. I did not make out anything above the lights at all, as if it was completely invisible or inky black against the night sky. It made no noise and the platform with the lights was rectangular, but could have been triangular as far as I could tell as I was driving past it. I kept asking my friend to look for the craft itself and describe it to me but he had no explanation and couldn't see anything above the lights either. Even having his head out the window,to my surprise he still just passed it off as some sort of 'military thing', and paid it little more attention than that.. It tilted slightly and moved a few feet here and there kind of like a bee collecting pollen. I kept glancing at it as I went past, and looked for it in the rear view mirror after it should have come into view. Oddly enough, that made me start paying attention to the night sky a lot more. I shared my story with a few others just to see if maybe they had seen something similar, or to see if their reactions were similar to how my friend acted. I soon found two others who saw crafts as well, and for some reason both of them also shrugged it off too. I noticed that much taller and very brilliant street lights started to appear around town less than a week later. The first new street light I saw was at the Ford dealership which was practically the same height and intensity as those on the craft I had seen earlier, but they didn't span the same area at all, and were clearly stationary lights. Still, my eyes snap to those new lamps because the brilliance is very similar to what was on the craft. Last night, 4/10/15 at around 01:30, I saw another one of those strange crafts hovering over a community just off of Chena Hot Springs Road.  There was a bank of mail boxes coming up on Bias Drive and so this time I pulled over to get a better look. Again, I heard nothing at all and the craft seemed lazily going about it's business in the same manner as the other one I saw.  This one was moving slowly off towards the Steese and went over the ridge towards town.  I noticed two other people had pulled off the road there as well, and were standing next to a vehicle talking.  I was intent on gaining some higher ground over at nearby Weller School, so we only exchanged eye contact as I pulled away. At the school, there was no sign of the craft at all over the part of the city I could see. I get the impression that they pose as stars, or sometimes very bright street lights.  I also think that most people refuse to believe that they saw anything unusual, even if they can't explain what they saw.  I also noticed some similarities between my observations and that of others on this database such as the red, mostly white and blue lights, flat bottom, silent and stealthy aspects, as well as my having heard what seemed like a sonar sound before too while reading late one night--but I didn't look out the window to see if there was anything there.

My girlfriend and were in the driveway looking at the stars as we often do when a silver colored sphere came out of the east.  It looked like a shiny metal marble.  The object was low enough for me to see light reflecting on its surface.  It was totally silent and moved at a slow speed.  When it got almost directly over my position it made a very smooth and very perfect 90° turn to the north.  Not at all like the turning of an airplane. Just a sudden, very smooth change of direction.   At this point it was heading away from me so I positioned myself and my girlfriend to where we could see it when it was to pass underneath some very high clouds.  I had a very distinct feeling that it was aware of being watched.  It was at that time that it faded into invisibility.  Not a sudden vanishing but rather a two second fade into thin air going from a solid object to see-through to invisible.   During the entire incident my girlfriend and I didn't speak a word to one another.  When it was over I asked her to tell me what she just saw and her account was exactly the same as mine.  That in itself lends credibility to the sighting.  @ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2015-04-17T00:00:00,34.1118,-88.5506

Every time the UFO made an abrupt turn it changed colors, from bright red to bright blue and back to bright red.

My friend and i where driving s.bound on 65th 15th n.w. off to the right of us up in the sky my friend said what the @&$! Is that i looked and at first i was ugh there were 3-4 (i cant recall exact pattern but amounts i know are true) sets of lights in rows of 4 bright as all get out and close to us not normal flight elevation for area, as soon as we saw them they shut down one row at a time then the aircraft?  Started moving towards downtown seattle no sound could be heard at all I also want to add there where no planes around at first which was strange cuase there always is, as it cont.  There was a small plane off to the distance like past downtown seattle and much further up in the sky it seemed and aircraft ? /ship or /ships( will get to that in a moment) it moved swiftly towards sm. aircraft as if it had no worries to crashing into but didn't, it hovered for a moment and changed course and again no planes no drones ect were in the sky it was also a very clear evening in the skies, so it started towards wallingford, freemont area ,if you know ballard im going to give you an example of how big this thing was or appeared from 15th n.w. looking towarrds the hill that goes to wallingford is a few miles no.  And so.  Bounds and this craft was literally covering almost the entire hill still in almost invisible motion and still very low im talking like almost right on top of houses .we both are tripping jaws hanging all i could say is it has to be a stealth moving as it was it was becoming more and more transparent it was a triangle shape and black and huge i mean huge.  I said we gotta see what this thing is and where the blank is it going my friend can only say what is that almost speechless almost frozen in augh. We followed it up the hill , now on aurora ave n. going south my friend pulled out his brother binaculars that are little more advance ( used in maritime) and handed me his phone to take pic's instead i hit record and it d! id for a few seconds then, my friend switched with me so i cou! ld see a better shot to be able to tell him what it is . We cont. driving so down aurora it started to lightly rain, me looking at craft but also the road, i had pulled over a cpl times too let friend take photos well in the meantime he stuck out his hand with camara out the window and was video taping ,at this point we could see what looked like a ring of bright red lights just for a brief moment underneath it . We both were taking about how nobody i mean nobody the entire time had stopped , pointing or looking up at it and can't believe no one else is seeing what were seeing even on busy aurora ave no one even blew their horn or stopped further down to see what were looking at, which is strange cause if and when i see people as in grossed as we were looking up at something its natural habit to also look as far as im concerned from experience. All of a sudden it had vanished mind you still no sound at all nor planes, drones ect.in these moments i had got on the phone to tell a frie! nd to look up in the sky to see it ( he lives in renton area), he kind of chuckled and laugh and said said something silly im kind of known as being a goof ball really meaning being silly to make people have a smile and laugh ? and my friend traveling with me well i'll describe him as being stuck in the 80's which i'm also known for too. We continued to look for it as we drove towards the friend in rentons house, both in just aughh trying figure out what on gods green earth did we just experience and why no one seemed a bit cauntious of any thing but what they were doing my friend was trying to look back at video but a lil hard on sm screen but never the less it was there in fact theres more than one as well as photos well you might think this was the end of it ,yeah no theres more , my friend could not stop with almost obsessing of it? As we picked our other friend up in renton , i mentioned to first friend look Now theres all kind of planes up in the sky as we drove south! to my house ( bonney lake) we were at boeing field area and w! e notice d two planes that did actually look like our military helicopters there was twoo and they were in like a certain position as though they were protecting or watching or guiding something slowly moving they become into a different formation , one slightly lower than other and was moving down towards the ground then there were a bunch of planes coming from all angles going into boeing field as well as seatac and most likely renton airfield as well it was crazy. So my friend quit in the back seat except for a few uttered words ( what the heck was that ,still looking at pic's and video ,we soon discovered ( here's where i mentioned i would get to later ) well it seemed as though there may have been more than one craft and that they looked as if they flew into the bigger one not only that and many lights flying around in speratic motions there is what we have learned to be a devil or evil figurine in a red light cloud that appears as if was watching us amongst other formations of different objects very clearly seen ( also later everyone who has viewed it agreed).  My friend is now in a spooked mood but still cant get over it he continued to look up in the sky as i did too and still, well he had been looking out my kitchen window and was seeing objects again but smaller in size like orb size in a neighbors yard and came to get me too see i told him its just porch or garage lights of neighbors he again began to video tape and well theres many suspected things seen including the very pronounced red cloud demon he was so scared he couldn't leave my room I tried to distract him by telling him it was probly this or that just to ease his mind.  Well there's a short almost thorough detailed story of my moment with what seemed to be not of this world as i've known it , my friend however has really looked in more depth to video's and pic's and will have more to add to his .

My Wife and I crossed the Calcasieu River at Township of Cameron, Louisiana, on the ferry boat.  We were in route to Port Arthur, Texas, at about 2200 to 2230 pm.  The highway follows the river for about two miles south toward the Gulf of Mexico, then turns west towards Texas.  Along this part of highway 82 it runs along side the Gulf of Mexico and for 11 miles no one lives not one house.  Holley Beach is the 1st. place with people that you reach its a small summer beach resort. Its winter time clear and cold wind fron the north at about 15/20 MPH, moon has the country side lit up,   When we turned West over the water on the edge of the beach was this round gold/yellow what ever following the same route as we were, I increased my speed it did the same I slowed down it did also. about this time my Wife ask me what that was.  I told her that I didn't know, It was larger than our car, I couldn't tell how big it was because I had nothing to compare it to,  When we got to Holley Beach I stopped,  It made a right angle to the South and went out of sight out over the Gulf of Mexico.   We went on to Port Arthur, normally about a 1 hour trip, we got helt up at the draw bridge at Port Arthur for seems like 30 to 45 min, we lived about 10 min from the bridge, when we got in the house I looked at the clock it was 4:30,  Didn't think much about it then just kinda of confused,  why a normal 1 1/2 hour trip 6 hours.

They were chilling over the tree line.  If you were not from the area you wouldn't think it was odd.

The lights started moving faster out of view due to the trees.  When we hit Bristol and Dort again there wasn't anything in the sky.

I looked up to admire the sky and was surprised to see a silver sphere sitting stationary in the sky about 390 feet above me.  It was shiny silver, looked like a pinball from a pinball machine except it was a brighter metal, like silver.   I could not discern any movement at all as I watched it, saw nothing that appeared to anchor it, saw no exhaust, etc.  It was fascinating.   Having grown up with access to a naval base, I am familiar with military craft, and this was nothing like an aircraft.  It also did not resemble any craft I have seen out of NASA, and did not resemble a balloon, blimp, or any other known craft I could think of.  If anything, I thought maybe it was a new type of drone, but I haven't seen a military or civilian one that was a perfect sphere like this was.   I turned to call my husband! so he could witness it and when I looked back up maybe a second later it had vanished.  No contrail, no clouds to disappear into, fairly open horizon, and I searched the sky trying to locate it again, but it was nowhere to be seen.  I have never seen a plane vanish that quickly.   It made no sound, I observed no lights or color changes, may have had a slight haze around it, but if so it was so minor it caused little to no distortion of the craft or air surrounding it.  I did not feel threatened by it, more surprised and curious.   There had been a plane that passed by at a much higher altitude and at a different point in the sky several minutes earlier, but it and its contrails were already gone, and I saw one or two several minutes later, and the were also at higher attitudes at different points and had contrails.   Date and time of day are not exact because I didn't report it right away.  We were not using electronics so observed no issues with them.

Recently, I saw a UFO ship on my way home from work May 11, 2015 in the afternoon around 5PM, and it was full daylight out.  I was leaving Redlands in my truck while traveling West on the 10 Freeway, when I saw it out of my passenger window for several miles, out to the North, just above the City of San Bernardino's border with Highland California.  I saw it as I looked north out of my passenger window and out of the back window of my truck, until I drove too far West on the 10 Freeway to be able to see it anymore.  I had trouble staying in my lane because I was amazed at what I was seeing. Specifically, I saw it from the side as I looked North towards the backdrop of the San Bernardino Mountains.  There was no smog or haze interrupting my view. I had a very clear view of the ship under the much higher clouds for at least five minutes.  It was stationary in the sky, and it did not move an inch the whole time that I watched it.  It was not a balloon. It just hovered there, about 3/4 as high as the top of the San Bernardino Mountains.  I saw no ropes or chains under it to hold it in place.  I have no idea how something that big can hover still in the sky like that. Moreover, it was rectangular in shape.  (See attached drawing.)  I saw no lights on it.  It had no wings or propellor, and it was not emitting steam or smoke.  It was much longer than it was high.  I estimate it was 180 feet long and 30 feet high or more.  My view was limited to the side, so I could not judge depth of the ship.  The accompanying image that I have included shows the shape of the aircraft.  Regardless of the high cloud cover, I am sure that our government saw this enormous ship on radar.  I thought that it was something from the military because it looked like the same type of material that an airplane can be made from. It was silver/metallic with black lines that defined square separate sections of the ship, which made it look like it was manufactured. Most importantly, I thought that it would have been on the television news later that night, but nothing has been shown.  The very next time that I drove to work on the 10 Freeway, it was gone from that area of the sky.  I have ran a search on the Internet, and two people in Highland have reported to have seen a UFO in the same area later that evening at the webpage:  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/118/S118948.html  You would think that with that many people living in San Bernardino, Highland, and surrounding cities that someone would have noticed it because it was daylight.

My wife also did not report it because she held a senior teaching position and did not want any unnecessary attention.",2015-05-22T00:00:00,42.14263184079602,-75.90816368159204

The noise started off low and increased in volume until we heard a loud ""boom!""  It was so out of the ordinary that me and him expected to see light from an explosion and ducked down, ready to run the opposite way.  Instead, it got quieter, but the noise still continued.  We realized it was coming towards us and ran out to an opening in some nearby trees.  The sky was filled with low clouds and visibility was poor, but we were able to make out a trianglar shaped craft that was low to the ground, and made very little noise as it passed.  Yellow light was on both ends of the wings and in the center middle, like a circle.  The craft was dark gray or black.  We were only able to catch a glimpse and it was gone soon after. It's not common to hear aircrafts flying by so low and so quiet, and to fly directly over his house.  We have never seen anything like it again.  We know there is an air force base in San Antonio, but it was unlike any other plane we have seen so far.  All other planes that we have spotted in the sky at that time of night are very high up, loud, and have only red and blue lights.  This craft was much closer.

I was walking at a park in Chino, CA. (south side of the park) and I saw to the North of me, pretty much over Ontario, CA several extremely bright orange lights moving slowly and low (relatively speaking).  Three of these orange lights were in formation like a triangular formation with at least another two single orange lights near it.  These lights began to ascend upward and toward an eastern direction with their lights becoming dimmer as well. I would then see another orange light also hovering low and from the North direction it too began to ascend.  Finally, the last orange light came slow and low from the north as well. This one hovered for a minute or two and then also began to ascend.  I was able to take some pictures with my LG Android camera (older version) the pictures do not do the object justice compared to what I visually saw.  FYI:  The orange lights were bright and amazing, meaning, nothing I have ever seen before color wise in the sky.  For the record, the park where I was at west of it would be as if though you are headed to L.A.;  East of it would be as if though you were headed to San Bernardino.  South of it would be as if though you were headed toward Temecula or San Diego; and North would be as if though you were headed to Ontario, CA or Upland, CA or the Mountains such as Mount Baldy.",2015-05-22T00:00:00,34.0122,-117.6889
