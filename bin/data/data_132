I have been a local metro police officer for 20 years in the valley. Prior to working in law enforcement, I served four years in US Naval Special Warfare. On 01/01/2020, at approximately 19:20 hours, I walked outside into the backyard with my puppy.  The night sky was partly cloudy, but I could make out some constellations and other random stars to the south.  I could also observe a few visible aircraft heading in different directions as evident by their distinct red, green, and white navigation lights.  Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport is approximately 3 miles southeast of my residence. However, I was looking directly south in the sky when I observed two circular lights appear just above the horizon.  It was as if the lights appeared out of nowhere.  The lights were of an orange-yellow glow that pulsed very slowly, but in unison.  They did not resemble any known aircraft to my knowledge.  The waxing crescent moon was visible in the partly clouded sky directly west.  With the intensity of a bright star, the lights traveled northbound as they ascended into the sky.  The distance between the two lights was comparable to placing my right hand out in front of my sight line while holding up only my index and pinky fingers.  The lights moved very slowly as they continued to ascend in my direction. Moments later, the lights stopped at a fixed point in the sky.  The lights remained in that position for approximately 15-30 seconds.  At that point, the lights started to slowly ascend in a southeast direction. Not only did the lights move upward, but also away into the southern! sky.  Both lights dimmed at the same time and then disappeared into the clouds. As I started to walk back inside with the dog, I noticed another singular light emerge from the southern horizon.  It was the exact same light that I had just observed.  The light traveled in the same pattern with the same speed.  It stopped in about the same location for a similar pause before heading away as the previous lights had done.  Again, the singular light just faded into the clouds of the night sky. Before I could turn away, I observed a fourth light emerge from the same spot above the horizon. It was the same type of light moving at the same speed as the others.  This time, I opened the back door and called for my wife to hurry outside to get a look at what I was seeing.  The light was still ascending towards me when my wife stepped outside.  She looked on as the singular light stopped in the sky for approximately 15-30 seconds.  Again, she looked on as the light slowly made its way upward and away out of sight.  The whole incident lasted approximately 6 minutes. I have never seen anything like that before.  Neither my wife nor I could explain the absence of navigational lights.  In addition, we could not provide an explanation for either the pulsing orange-yellow glow, or the speed and travel direction that the lights were exhibiting. In the moments following the incident, the partly cloudy night sky cleared up entirely.  Several planes were again observed in the area, but none of them shared any resemblance to what we had just observed.",2020-02-07T00:00:00,33.33960089766607,-111.78126499102333

It was a clear night and the stars were out.  At that time where we lived was the edge of town, so better viewing for stars.  We were both looking up and having a conversation when out of nowhere three elongated diamond shaped objects flying in triangle formation came right into view directly above us.  The diamonds were completely noticeable breaking our view of the stars.  They were very dim and had no lights.  They appeared to be copper metallic metal and seemed to have a purplish glow below them.  At the time I thought you could see the cities lights reflecting off their hull.  But recently I’ve done more reading about anti-gravity propulsion theory (www.uaptheory.com).  The energy field around craft might be background lensing what’s behind the object for cloaking etc. This is an unproved theory of course, but I believe that this is a possible factor given that it was a starry night.  Anyhoo, they were flying at a somewhat low altitude, maybe 100-150’ above us.  I’d guess they were each 20-25’ long, at arms length about the size of a 4” object.  The craft were gliding steady at about 30-40 mph, and completely silent.  They were traveling from the Southeast and headed towards downtown Denver in the Northwest.  I was in the middle of a sentence when I went into complete shock.  We both gasped seeing them at about the same time.  I said “D.. do you see those?!”  We looked at each other and my friend replied “Yes!  What are they?!”  We both looked up and could no longer find them.  We talked about what we saw and both agreed we saw what I described above.  Unfortunately I’ve lost track of this friend.  He moved away to a different part of the state and we drifted apart.  I’ve searched for him numerous times online and can’t find him.  I’ve thought about this experience all my life.  They definitely stood out and were something I had never seen in the sky before.  I grew up on military bases and my father was in Avionics so I’d been around a lot of flying aircraft.  I used to sit just down the cliff at the end of the runway and watch fighter jets take off above me.  They were loud and would rumble the ground below as they passed over.  Their engines blazing out of the exhaust and the jet fuel fumes trailing behind.  These object had none of those traits.",2021-10-19T00:00:00,39.68000198902607,-104.7929670781893

Just ""hovering"" in the same spot in the sky. Low to the ground for an aircraft. It was at the height of about a power tower. It had multiple lights going around the craft. One was green. The rest were white that we could tell. When we passed it some on the road and looked back, the lights continued around to the back of the craft, too. Then, a once still object started moving and went out of sight. Not at a fast clip. Just moved right along. No sound. I thought of that later. When I had the window down.

Some adults witnessed the craft flying away This is an experience I had in the summer of 1996. At the time I was 10 years old. This experience was not only mine but along 5 other children. Four of these were my cousins and the other my youngest sister. Ages 6 the youngest then 8,9,10,10 and 11 the oldest. To this day only one of us doesn’t remember completely the experience;only fragments.  Summer 1996, Rincón. Puerto Rico. We were in this home along our family for a funeral vigil. These traditionally were done in the homes of the deceased. As the adults were inside the home (about 20 adults) us children were in the driveway playing with parachuting toy soldiers. This event happened around 3 am.  One of the boys as he was throwing the toy to the sky, pointed out at a shooting star.  At this moment I was sitting on the hood of a Chevy Nova. It has a large hood and a couple of us girls were sitting there. While we gazed at this “shooting star” it started zig zagging for a couple of brief seconds. It was the size of a dime in the distance  when literally in 3 seconds it was hovering 60+feet on top of the driveway. ( I could estimate this distance only because there was a street light pole nearby. )  This “shooting star” turned out to be a massive  50+ foot disk. As it prepared to hover down it beamed a brilliant red light, then altered to a blue beam and lastly it shot a very bright white light that came from the sides of the spacecraft. This very bright withe light caused me to lean back trying to take my eyes off it. As I did that, this light was so intense that it formed a  ring about 3 foot around the craft; where it looked like a daylight sky. I could actually see a couple of clouds but only around this ring space around the craft. This white beam lasted about 10 seconds.  The craft was the shape of a disk and as many people describe “silver” I would describe luminous with a striking resemblance to the color of the moon. I remember that for a split second it felt as if it was the moon falling on us.  Not only the size of it but it had markings that reminded me of craters. These were softball sized circles and dots that seemed “randomly “ placed.  I was still sitting on the hood of the Chevy Nova and it was to my right. I was under the craft only about a third of the way.  When the craft was at it’s closest it was very silent, just hovering still and it stayed within 25 feet on top of us. In the middle of the craft there were small windows that encircled an opening were a blueish light shone onto the driveway. These windows had a light pattern displayed.  As this was going on I don’t believe any of us were actually scared but just mesmerized. It was my little sister however that jumped off the hood of the Nova and ran off through the driveway to get my mother. It was at this very moment I had a bit of fear that because she was directly under the craft that she could be taken. My thought then was how would I explain to my mom that I didn’t look out for my sister. ( my 10yr old mind) My sister ran right under the craft because it was the only way to get to the house. As my sister goes inside the house. The craft started spinning in place clockwise. It then started making more of a light “buzzing” sound. It shot just up about 60 foot again. Still very close.  Suddenly the craft made a sonic boom as it flew north. This made such a huge sound that everyone inside the house came out and the power went off in the home for a few seconds. The adults (about 10 of them) saw the craft on the horizon as it stopped briefly on top of another house. But it didn’t do a sequence there. It seemed as it let go of some electric discharge and made another sonic boom as it dove underwater into the Atlantic Ocean.",2021-10-19T00:00:00,,

It was nighttime and I was headed east on M-21 from Davison back to Lapeer after I helped my parents as their car wouldn’t start, as I crested a hill several miles out I noticed light off in the distance in a area that shouldn’t have light (as it was in the area I lived). Several miles later I crested another hill and I was much closer and noticed the light was definitely in a farm area with nothing that should be illuminating this sort of light and thought maybe it was a wedding or something. There is just a small home with an open field and a line of trees bordering the field. As I got closer I realized it was just down the road from my house, instead of turning south to my house I went north towards the lights. It is a small rural town and there was no traffic and I was able to drive very slowly along the road trying to get a view through the trees/ brush until I finally got a view of it. It was a craft about the size of a football field hovering at roughly treetop level, it had marker lights along the edge like a man made airplane but made absolutely NO sound as it hovered, I was too scared to exit my vehicle but wanted a better view so we just rolled up the road a little but found only a smaller view several hundred feet down, but it was gone! The only thing I saw at that point in the sky was (probably) a mile away and I raced down the road to get another look and quickly realized it was far too fast for my truck.",2021-10-19T00:00:00,43.0519,-83.3346

VERY up close, very black.  Traditional 3-pointed triangle. This occurred back in 2004.

Confused, I saw a few stars reappear and that's when I realized that something was passing between me and the stars I was looking at.  About 100 yards away from me, at almost eye-level, was an object so black that the only reason I even noticed it was that it was blocking the stars.  Once I figured this out, I finally was able to see the craft itself - a large, black triangle moving through the sky at maybe 40mph.  It was the size of an airliner, 727 sized, not very thick though.  It was just high enough for me to see three very faint amber colored areas at each point of the triangle, underneath.  As it passed me I heard a very, very faint ""whooshing"" sound, almost like a loud sigh.  At the rear of the triangle were 3 more faint amber colored lights, barely visible.  From the time I first saw it until it had moved beyond my vision was close to 1 minute.  I work for the military and am very familiar with current stealth aircraft, this was not one of them.  It was not a F-117 or a B2 (even if it had been it would have stalled from the low speed).  My opinion is that it is a covert aircraft that has not been revealed to the public yet.

Possible UFO Sighting  Recently, I watched a great documentary on television that really got me thinking about an event that happened to my wife and me on 12/21/2010 next to Dover Air Force Base in DE about midnight. We were driving to VA from CT. The night was really dark when we approached Dover. I saw lights ahead of us above the horizon at a great distance from us. Having gone this way to VA in the past, I was used to seeing airplanes coming and going to the airbase. As we approached the base on route 13 south, the lights slowly approached heading north. I was surprised the lights (not blinking but on steady and being white) were taking forever to reach us. Being a private pilot myself, I looked for the normal green and red lights on the wings. The three lights, white, were in a horizontal plane equally spaced. There were no colored lights! Finally, as we passed the base, the craft was directly overhead. I looked up through the open sunroof and the object completely filled the sunroof so I could not see the entire outline of the craft. There was no marking but I could determine the color was gray, what you would expect for a military aircraft. Surprisingly, for being overhead no more that 400 to 600 feet above us, THERE WAS NO NOISE OF ENGINES. I found that very strange for supposedly a large military aircraft. Days later at home, I searched the Internet looking at large military aircraft at night to see their light arrangement. Nothing I found matched the placement of the lights I saw that night like the C-17, C-5a, etc. That fact always stuck with me as the years passed. Back to the present, I searched the UFO data base looking for sightings near Dover AFB around that time and date. I found an entry on 12/22/2010 describing a craft seen on a camera at the St. Anthony of Padua Grade School in Wilmington, DE, 54  miles north of the Dover AFB at 7-9 AM. Could that have been the craft I saw? I don’t know for sure but there could be a connection if my craft was slowly heading toward Wilmington, DE. My wife says she saw the outline of the craft as it approached. She said it looked like it had a kite shape. Today was the first time she ever mentioned it to me. So, I personally can’t confirm that fact since I was driving and tried to look at the approaching lights and watch the road ahead at the same time. As a further note, I have been keeping a personal diary going back to 1979 recording my daily activities. Because of that diary, I looked back through my entries and got the details of our trip that 12/21/2010 trip to VA and compared it to the UFO data base.

I was unaware there was anyone I could tell. In Warren Township, NJ, when I was 13 (2008). I walked into our backyard, took a left and went outside of the fence. I didn’t hear any noise that made me want to look up; I just went to look at the sky. We have these huge trees that when looked at from below, in the shadows of night, they look like broccoli (I called them broccoli trees). Directly over those trees I religiously looked at on summer nights, there was a blue glowing orb. There wasn’t any visible paneling, nothing textured about the object. It sat SO CLOSE to the trees, it was mind blowing that it didn’t touch them, hit them, didn’t even disturb the leaves. Prior to the ufo doc I just watched—I actually thought this couldn’t have been one. I couldn’t tell you what it was, but it wasn’t your classic saucer with organized lights. Instead, it was more like the tick-tack that was reported by the navy. Initi! ally I just stared into it—couldn’t move, was totally perplexed, yet intrigued. I then “snapped out of it”, SPRINTED (I mean as fast as I could move) to get my dad, get a phone or a camera, etc. I screamed for my father, dragged him outside and made him run. It couldn’t have been more than 10 seconds. When we got back to the spot, some 15 ft from our home, I pointed up and it was gone. It went from this vivid glowing orb, impossible to moss, just stalled above the trees—to vanishing. There was no evidence when I got my dad. He actually thought it was a joke, proposed a blimp when he realized I was serious, etc. he actually didn’t believe me until last year when the ufo report came out. (Our family friend also noticed we had the odd light formations in the sky that moved bizarrely. Those were there quite frequently, located in the west.  Honestly my father and his friend were over the top about them—but after seeing the blue orb as a kid, I’m not sure—these lights just meant! nothing to me. It was like I had already had such a shocking ! experien ce (that was embarrassing it didn’t matter). This incident has occurred a singular time in my entire life…. Completely unrelated, I’m learning that abductions may look a little different than we have known them in social media. So I will tell this story: one night I went to go to bed. This year before before last. I had left the window open that night. After going to bed I had this dream. In this dream I was being sucked out through my window? I mean I was awakened first, I actually ran into the hallway, made it to the banister in front of my parents room. I was holding onto this banister for dear life. The odd party—no one could hear me. Despite the sucking, these bizarre looking things walked straight through it and tried to take me. Then my memory was blank. Idk what happened. Not sure if they got me or not. The following day I awoke in my bed, covered in sweat, felt like I hadn’t slept at all (that was the one differentiable part from night terrors that does make me ques! tion this as bizarre. I wasn’t just symptomatic of a bad dream, it was like all of those events had occurred). I don’t get the feeling there was anything bad—I actually get the feeling it went so wrong, like they failed so terribly, they just tried to black it out.  Then leave me be. I have never had one of these “dreams” prior nor after. I also wasn’t exposed to any material that would have prompted such a vivid dream. I can tell you—I haven’t slept with my window open since. Pretty much, I feel like if this was an abduction, they decided I was too much trouble (they actually seemed to be upset with one another—2 maybe 3 of them, disproportionate, but they seemed shorter—were blue-ish/grey with dark big eyes.. Obviously they didn’t speak English, but one pushed the other in the chest and it seemed as if to say “wait we need to figure out how to fix this. You messed it up”. So that’s are the weirdness I have experienced. This is not a regular thing for me. I’m actually very! scientifically oriented. I have tried to find ways to explain! both of these—while the last is questionable, I just can’t deny what I have seen and I can’t find a proper logical solution at this time. The rest I suppose is up to you guys to discern what is appropriate and if it is at all in line with anything anyone else has experienced",2021-10-19T00:00:00,,

A Thought Communication Directed Me to Inspect (Photograph) A Single Stationary Craft at Dusk,Concord,CA,2017-02-18T18:36:00,rectangle,30 minutes,"Occurred : 2/18/2017 18:36  (Entered as : 02/18/17 18:36) Reported: 9/27/2021 12:34:42 PM 12:34 Posted: 10/19/2021 Location: Concord, CA Shape: Rectangle Duration:30 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/164/S164734.html,"A Thought Communication Directed Me to Inspect (Photograph) A Single Stationary Craft at Dusk While at a Da La Salle High School soccer game I observed an unremarkable object.  It was a clear sky at dusk without visible stars. An inner thought directed me to inspect a light that was in the sky.  (This directed type of thought had not happened to me before)  A normal mental signal of interest can be explained as yourself asking , ""What is that?"" This directed type of mental signal can be described as ""Hey, Watch This.""  There was nothing interesting about this light in a visual sense. With my Samsung SM-J700H phone I captured 4 images. Later that night I inspected my pictures. 3 of the pictures were unremarkable.  I blew up the one clearly defined photograph with Photoshop Elements. I was very surprised by the result. The object had obvious structure. It has a body with multiple 90 degree angles. It seems to have two pointed projections on the bottom that are both bent or angled towards one end of the craft. It also appears to have! a light or projection on top near one end of the craft. The craft also seems to have an aura or glow surrounding it. I can not give an accurate altitude. I'm a private pilot and have a very good sense of 1000' feet since this is the standard altitude for flying the pattern at the majority of civilian airports. My best guess is this craft was 40' in length, perhaps 2500' in altitude. Once again this is a very rough guess. I've included an aerial picture of the soccer field with a compass overlay. My position was at the center of the compass and the photograph was taken at approximately 300 degrees from my position.  I've also included the original photograph and an enlargement at high definition.  Personal Story:   I believe I had an encounter with aliens when I was 6 years old. One night, while staying at my Aunt and Uncle's House I couldn't sleep. I knew there was someone in the backyard that had come for me. Somehow I could see through the wall between me and the backyard. There was a large rounded object with 3 small human shapes. They had short bodies and longish heads. They were able to travel through the walls. The next thing I remember is being very frightened. So frightened that I asked my Aunt and Uncle to call my parents in the middle of the night and have them take me home. My parents did take me home. This had never happened before. This was in 1960, before Betty and Barney Hill.",2021-10-19T00:00:00,37.97817449664429,-122.0058100671141

NW Tucson, AZ. I was out in my back yard doing yard work at about 11:30am on 12/18/16. A reflection from the west at approximately 5-10 thousand feet (only an estimate, of course) caught my attention. When I focused on it, I could see that there was something that was metallic and rotating clockwise in a slow, stable, and consistent manner. It gave the impression of being something heavy (not a balloon), if that makes sense.  There was no noise at all.  We got a lot of military and commercial air traffic over this location: helicopters and all manner of planes.  We even saw the Goodyear blimp from this location  several times while we lived there, but this sighting was unique.  I had my phone and tried to take a picture, but the object was too high up for me to get a good shot. I ran inside and got my SLR camera (Nikon D60), quickly changed lenses to my telephoto lens, and ran back outside, thinking that the object might be gone by this point. It was still there, so I started taking pictures.  The object appeared and then disappeared from my view based upon how it was reflecting the sunlight. Since it seemed to be several miles away, I had a hard time focusing my camera on it, but I was able to get quite a few good shots. The object’s appearance changed many times while I was taking pictures.  It was very confusing, to be honest.  I’ve never seen anything like it.  Finally, it appeared to change shapes into something that looked like a small, white plane that circled the area where the sighting occurred.  Finally, that “plane” flew off to the north and seemed to morph into a larger white plane that headed east along a typical (for that area) commercial flight line.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

Walking through the neighborhood, I glanced up from my phone and was stunned by what I saw.  I decided to take a walk around my neighborhood in Dawes late at night. The intention wasn't to stare at the sky or do anything of that sort. I was watching my phone as I walked trying to figure something about with a video game. Dorky, I know. But it's the truth.  I was walking for a pretty short period of time, on the right side of the main road to the neighborhood. There is a bend at the end of the road that comes down to a neighborhood pool. I was coming right to the bend area, looking to my left, there is an open lot that has always been there since I was a child. The neighborhood is surrounded by slightly wooded tree lines. Regular 'ole trees.  At first I couldn't even discern what it was. But above the tree line of the empty lot, there was a craft that was shaped like a tear-drop and the millennium falcon. It was ridged. It came to a clear point, but understand this. When I first spotted this craft, I could barely see it. It was blending into the sky. It seemed like it was trying to. It seemed like it was pretty close, hovering over a denser area of the forest thing they had goin' on. There were no lights, no sound and no way anyone could have seen it unless they were looking around the sky. I was just lucky that I happened to look.  What was more interesting is that I was standing there, looking up at this thing, barely able to see super great features or many details, but it was clearly an object that was there, semi cloaking itself. It seemed like I caught them on their lunch break. I kept looking at this thing and felt a emotional impact from this craft. I thought in my mind, while also looking at it, can they see me? Which sounds dumb and cheesy, but that's what I thought.  It seemed like right as I was thinking this that it read my mind. It was like I was connected to this object because I happen to see it. It was a strange, odd vibe throughout the entire sighting up to this point. I'm feeling emotions of connection but also... kind of a creepy vibe, not gonna lie. It seemed like I caught them. I felt like they were perturbed. The second I got finished thinking my thought, it took off.  I was watching as it took off into the distance of the sky over the tree line. It had to have been flying to the east. When it took off, I could see the trail of color coming off of this craft. I stood there STUNNED. I heard no noise coming from it, I saw no lights, I saw no propulsion. I stood there looking around wondering if what I saw was real or my imagination. But then I heard a other-worldly noise that literally came back like a weird noisewave. I could hear it and I've never heard anything like it since, and I can still hear it in my head clear as day to this day. I felt it in my feet. Other people had to have heard this sound.  No one else came outside the rest of my terrified walk. I was the only person who saw this, I believe.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,30.68156511397423,-88.1366939544103

What I am going to write to you sounds really crazy and I am completly aware that the easiest answer would be that I have some kind of psychological issue and I would do anything to change my situation for any psychological disorder, but it is not. It would be very kind of you to read everything I write - I need all the help that anybody ever needed. 22 months ago I was happily working as a teacher in primary school. I was 38 years old, I was in a good and stable relationship and without any psychological disorders. Then from one second to the other I was completly changed. The first thing I reported to my friends and doctors was that I was no longer able to sleep - I was not tired or exhausted - I was always on the same level wide awake and full of power, but I was not sleeping anymore. I was also nonstop forming sentences in my head about what humans do to sleep, how I should feel... After nine days and nights I went to a psychiatric clinic. They gave me all kinds of sleeping pills- without any results. They asked me to exhaust myself, so I ran 22 km. Afterwards I felt completly the same, not tired, not exhausted, no mussle cramps. The nurses reported that I was really always awake when they checked, but said that maybe I just had a light sleep and woke up every time somebody entered the room. That is not the case. I went into a sleeping labor and my brain scan showed that I was in deep sleep - but while I was talking to the nurse, fully aware that I was talking. Then the psychiatrists asked me how I felt about my snoring roommate, how I felt about my boyfriend not visiting to much, about my parents being away... That was when I realized that I was and still am not able to feel anymore. Of course the psychiatrists thought that I supress feelings, but there is no reason for that, I have no traumatic experience, I felt really good before the change happened. To show that I am really not able to feel, I went bungeejumping with a pulse watch and a camera- I had a pulse of 70 before, while and during the jump. I can still read feelings of people, I always know how I should feel, but I am not able to feel anymore. Before I was changed I was no fan of horror movies because I would be easily scared, now somebody could be eaten alive next to me- I am not able to feel anything. I form nonstop sentences about how humans feel, how I felt before. The next realisation came when my mother asked me to imagine something positive. I realised that I was and still am not able to visualise anything anymore. If you ask me for example to draw a lemonade, I can do that. If you ask me to close my eyes and picture one I can not do that, I can also not imagine I taste a lemonade, I can also not go with thoughts to a desert island for example. I know that I was able to do all that before I was changed, but with the change I even forgot how humans work. I just form sentences like: Humans can imagine they are on a desert island. This is how human minds work. Why can't I. I would even go so far and say that I do not have thoughts anymore. I do not have something that comes to my mind and goes or that I can put aside. I just have this nonstop forming of sentences and they are either about how humans work or about how I explain my state to humans. I went to different psychiatric clinics, got all bodily functions checked. Nothing made a different for one second. For me every second is the same, running is the same as sitting, my body is in the same state all the time. The doctors gave me all kind of medicine, you could see that it went into my blood, but you could also see that it had no effect on me. They tried to stop these reporting about humans by giving me skills like biting on chillies or having a cold shower. I bit on chillies, had a cold shower and formed sentences about how humans feel when they bite on chillies and take cold showers. It is as impossible for me to stop forming these sentences as it is for humans to fly. I took all mkind of therapies from pottery to dancing... and formed sentences that pottery has an effect on humans and that it has no effect on me. While doing pottery I was exactly like when I was lying on my bed. It was and is such a terrible (without feeling, but not without pain) situation that I formed the sentence: I stop drinking and eating, then I will dye. So I stopped drinking and eating. The doctors and the clinic did not like it but agreed under the condition that they check my blood every three days and that I would start drinking if I changed and for example got hallizunations. Nothing happened - My bloodsamples were always the same, a always had spit in my mouth. I did not drink for 11 days and nothing happened. This is reported by the clinic. Of course the doctors thought I might maybe drink unconciously - but this is not the case. In the last 22 months there has not been any evidence that I do things that I can not recall - on the contrary. It is impossible to distract me. I am always completly concentrated because I do not have thoughts with which I can go elsewhere. I know that everything I write sounds unbelievable and that psychological explanations seem to be more realistic and I am taking every pill, doing every therapie - but I know from the first second on that something unbelievable has happened to me. I have never seen an alien, no alien has ever spoken to me, I have no idea what has changed me. The things I know are that I am hold in the same state for 22 months, that nothing is able to get me out of this state, that I have no feelings, that I have no imagination anymore, that I do not have a subconciousness anymore - everything I do is a result of a full conciousness and if you ask me what I have done the last 22 months: I have formed sentences about how humans function, how they feel, how feelings work, how they sleep or sentences for humans: How I work now (just like in this email) non stop. I have no idea why and for whom I form the sentences about how humans work. They are always in German or in English. I feel not pressured to form them, because I do not feel anything. It is just impossible to not form them. I do not feel anything when I form them. It is as if I teach some other alien form of living about humans or about how humans work. It is also as if I tell them how human language works. I really have no idea if anybody in this world can help me - nobody was able to help me for one second in the last 22 months and I have spent 16 months in good clinics. Please take this serious there is something that is using me to know more about humans- and I am completly aware that this sounds like a crazy person speaking. I have no idea if anthing can help me - I am caught between life and death, neither able to have one or the other. I even took 100 sleeping pills (Promethazin- neuraxpharm 50mg)- I should be dead - I did not spit them out, I did not sleep - I just formed sentences about what should happen. I am completly aware that if you respond your answer will probably be to look for a good psychiatrist, but of course I am und psychological supervision, but it has no effect on me - they can not help me and that is even what they are saying. If you want to see how I was before I changed you can have a look at my facebook page, it really changed in a second. I really need all the help that I can get and I really think there is a danger for mankind. You can also show this mail to collegues who work on the topic of alien contact. Thank you for reading this long mail. ((name deleted))",2021-08-16T00:00:00,,
1 or possibly 2 UFOs just above treetops,Mobile,AL,2019-10-03T09:23:00,chevron,30 min,"Occurred : 10/3/2019 09:23  (Entered as : 10/03/2019 09:23) Reported: 8/11/2021 11:08:45 AM 11:08 Posted: 8/16/2021 Location: Mobile, AL Shape: Chevron Duration:30 min",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/164/S164304.html,1 or possibly 2 UFOs just above treetops So this is not the first time I have seen a ufo but this was the closest I have seen one only about 100-120 feet above me as it just cleared the tree tops. I reported it to MUFON but did not have the photo uploaded on my PC also was also not sure of the exact date.  It is a very detailed story please be patient.   On October 3rd 2019 I had to replace a bandage on a rescue horse that I isolated on the other side of my pond.  My neighbor and friend was supposed to meet me there to help as she was basically a feral horse and had not been handled that much.  My neighbor was running late so I started over there just after dark. Maybe 45 minutes.  It was a waxing crescent moon at 0 degrees to the south. Driving down to the farm gate on the dam my phone slid off the passenger seat unbeknownst to me as I braked to open the gate.  As I stepped out of the truck and went to move around the open door a giant red light in the trees on the passenger side caught my eye and! as I looked up I lost my balance and ended up at the bottom of the bank fortunately I kept to my feet.  The apex of the front of the Ufo was passing over my head as it moved only about 20 mph I stood there watching it (and saw the moon between the wings ?)until the other end came into sight it was directly over my pond heading North and I then scrambled up the bank threw my torso into the truck frantically searching for my phone turned and opened my camera and was unable to load video I quickly deleted a couple of photos and took a snapshot of it as it was almost out of sight on the other side of the pond. Description one giant light at least 6-8ft in circumference flush with the underside of the craft cast no illumination on the pond other than reflection I could clearly see the entire outline because of the moon it was a medium grey I could not see any markings on it. The two white lights at each end of the craft were as big as the front one and did not cast a beam of li! ght.  After it disappeared from my view I drove through the fa! rm gate ( note. One of the horses on my home side of the pond reacted to it ).  I shut the gate behind me and my neighbor and friend showed up at the round pen to hold the horse about 5 minutes later. Had to use the head lights of truck so left running.  I told her I had to tell her something when I was done.  She held the horse while I cut off and rebandaged the hind leg which I do silently because I can’t be distracted not wanting to be kicked in the head. Once done I threw everything into a bucket and my friend was still holding the horse. My back as to the pond and I said you are not going to believe this and turned slightly to point at the farm gate on the dam and said “ I went to open the farm gate and almost fell into the pond as I saw this thing…” she interrupted me and pointing over my shoulder she said THAT? I turned and it was coming over again except over our heads at a different trajectory from south southwest to North northeast.  We stood and watch it pass over the tre! es again at an angle to the road beyond the round pen.  She does not believe in UFOs but she said she knows what she saw!  First photo is of the craft with time stamp. Second and third photo is where I spotted it coming over the treetops.  And Fourth where it passed over us at the round pen. I have since transferred about 5700 videos and photos from my camera I don’t ever want to be unable to I record any event I have not downloaded from phone yet but will send ASAP. I DO NOT USE EMAIL on my phone.,2021-08-16T00:00:00,30.68156511397423,-88.1366939544103

There was snow on the ground.  I believe it was between 6: 00 or 7:00PM.  The location was Taylor Drive in Springfield, Verrmont. I had eaten dinner with my parents and as I walked through the garage and onto the driveway I stopped in my tracks.  Over my head was a large object, triangular in shape, with colored lights on the points of the triangle.  I wanted to run back into the house to get my parents but I couldn’t move.  I was totally engrossed, enthralled, in awe;  I don’t have the all-encompassing adjective to describe what I was seeing.  The object seemed to be stationary and was making a low whirling noise, not loud just constant. I don’t know how long I stood there but I believe it was a little less than a minute.  The object started to go straight up and began moving in a circular motion with the lights blurred.  At this point I was able to move and I ran into the house to get my parents.  They saw the object flying away.  We watched as it flew in a northerly direction.  As it flew, the snow turned orange beneath it. After we had somewhat calmed down I left to go home.  As I pulled onto the street, a very big fireball went past me and kept going in the direction of the original object.  It also caused the snow to turn orange beneath it.

At the time, I took it as “Angelic Visitations”, but later in my life; have now understood it better. First, I would consider myself a Catholic and have Faith in God.  I started to have memory recalls around 2019. I remember going to bed in my bedroom when I was a child and eventually waking up to a “floating” like feeling, almost like you’re on a “cloud” rising in the air. The whole time I could not move, except for my eyes, I could look around. I remember seeing 3 Human-like Beings, the 1st primary Being in front of me, the 2nd to my right side and the 3rd behind me. They all were within 2-3 of me. I remember Light and an odd smell that was unique, not a bad smell; but different. I know they were Human-like, but it was hard to see them totally. They were not short, but not too tall, thin build, Human-like appearance. I took it as they were Angels, like an Angelic Visitation at the time, especially since I was a child too; that is how I understood it.  I recall them wanting to show me these events, these images. They were to the left/front of me several feet away and were like multiple floating monitors without any trim etc. moving left to right. Almost like on an invisible conveyer belt. The monitors were like a 22inch-27inch size. It was like watching multiple live events. They were very real and vivid. These 3 Beings wanted to show me this. I remember seeing natural disasters, including earthquakes, drought, and floods. I saw pain and suffering, famine and disease and wars. Horrible wars between Nations, I saw the real pain and felt the suffering emotionally.  As, I was seeing these events, because of all the emotions I was experiencing, the 1st primary Being in front of me told me that I was safe, and no harm would come to me. That I was ok. The Being communicated this to me thru my mind though telepathy. They knew what I was thinking and feeling. I felt like they cared and had compassion for me and humanity. The whole time I had no fear or felt like I was in danger from these 3 Beings. I felt safe. The only time I felt all kinds of emotions was when they showed me these events.  I know these events that were shown to me had not happened yet and were events that either took place in the future or possibly events that could be avoided depending on our own actions here on Earth. There trying to help us, that is the feeling I got from them. And we are more alike then different too. We have a common bond that we share between them and us, I felt that.  After being shown these events, I recall a short discussion; but cannot remember the rest. Afterwards, I recall waking up in a curled fetal position on a tweed fabric Lazy Chair in the main room. I thought I had sleepwalked or something, because I do not recall how I got there from my bedroom, considering I was asleep in my bedroom.  I recall 2-4 hours had passed by.  Several years later in my teens, I remember feeling a small oval object near my lower right jawbone between the skin and bone specifically. I could and still can move it slightly in all directions. I have experienced no pain etc. from this object in me that I am aware of. So, I have just left it alone and figured it is supposed to be there and move on. After, I had felt that object in my lower right jawbone as a teen, I had totally forgotten about it for many years and only recently recalled that I had that object in my lower right jawbone.  To this day, I have not recalled everything, but for what I am able to remember. I have been quiet about it for the most part; telling very few. I have only started to be more open about my personal encounter experiences since the more open discussions that are now happening regarding this subject matter.  I hope this helps and thank you for your time.",2021-07-31T00:00:00,43.066514168714164,-89.38736175266175

We drove up one of the rows the farm equipment would drive on so we wouldn’t get stuck. My friend parked the car on the crest of a hill where there was a beautiful view of the land and homes in the distance. It was dark outside, so we could see the stars in the sky. I remember there weren’t a lot of stars that night. I remember looking through the windshield as I was sitting in the middle of the back seat. I had a clear view of the sky in front of us. The windows of the car were all the way down as it was perfect temperature that night. You could hear the night time bugs and crickets. It was so quiet and peaceful out there. After being there for maybe ten minutes, I noticed a white light off in the distance. It was out in front of us and the light was slowly getting bigger. At first, because the light was moving, I thought it was an airplane. I lived a few miles away from the Greater! Rochester International Airport so I was quite familiar with seeing planes at night. One of the first things I noticed was that there were no blinking lights. No green, red, white, or otherwise colored blinking lights. From the distance, there were none to notice. My two friends in the front seats are now looking at this light, as well. We are all aware of it, and now, trying to figure out if it’s a plane or helicopter. As the light got bigger, there were still no blinking lights. It was not approaching at a speed that seemed like it WASN’T a plane or helicopter, so we still hadn’t dismissed it. As the light got closer, yet, we noticed no sound. No motor sounds, jet sounds, hums... nothing. So now, we are looking at this bright white light coming towards us, slowly descending since we first noticed it. I’m going to guess the light got to be within a half a mile out in front of us in the sky. The rate of travel never increased or decreased as it was coming towards us. Just a slow, smooth, motion. Once it got to the distance of that rough half mile away, the light shut off. The craft came to a stop and hovered motionless for a minute.  There was definitely something in the sky where the light came from but it was too dark to see the shape. It did not have a visible hard outline, but it was just darker than the night sky. Whatever it was, it was still there. At the distance it’s at now, we still hear nothing. It’s now hovering motionless, with no lights. I have never seen anything flying with no sound, let alone hovering against the force of gravity. To my knowledge, in 1991 the world governments didn’t possess anything capable of doing what this is doing. The three of us are now whispering to one another. The mood got tense, as we could only ask each other, “what is that!?!?” We have all firmly agreed this is no airplane, or helicopter. After floating motionless for a minute, a white light comes out from the bottom of the craft. It points straight down to the ground. We could now see the light is on a road at the outer edge of the corn field. The light slowly moved down the road, as if it were looking for something. The craft wasn’t moving, only the light underneath it was. I remember looking out to the passenger side of the windshield to see the shape in the sky. The light had traveled down the road far enough to where I was looking out the driver side of the windshield when the light stopped moving. It had shined to an intersection in the road where there was a stop sign. The light stayed focused on the stop sign for about 10-15 seconds then shut off. After the light was off, the craft hovered silently for another minute. When we finally noticed movement, the craft was slowly turning as it floated. We noticed it was turning because as it was turning, two orange “orb” looking lights became visible. I can only describe them as what looked like two jet engines on the back of a military jet. The orbs ! were spaced apart what looked like maybe 10-20 feet? It was hard to judge exactly how far apart they were because of the darkness. We noticed one come to view, and as it’s slowly turning,  then a second became visible. It’s now hovering with these two orange colored orbs we hadn’t seen as it was coming at us, originally. Still, no sounds. Hovering motionless in the same place for minutes. After the slow 180 degree turn, as we are looking at the two orbs, the craft started to slowly move. It was moving up, and away from us, at the same time. Both vertical and horizontal movement, so somewhat diagonal. I was still looking out the passenger side of the windshield at it. It slowly went up to the right a short distance, then leaned, and slowly traveled left. Almost like it was in a wave pattern, traveling side to side, while it slowly went up. After doing the slow up to the right, then to the left, it went back to the right. At this point, something amazing happened. It went from this slow “wave pattern” of flight to a sudden straight line. The orange lights did not get any brighter as it went straight. They remained a constant bright orange glow. As it had made a wobble to the right and straightened out it’s path, it suddenly took off at a speed I’ve never seen anything move at. It looked like something from a Star Wars movie, when a ship like the millennium falc! on went into light speed. The craft sped off in a split second, up and out into space!! No sonic boom, and still no propulsion noises, whatsoever. It was really what gave all three of us the confidence to say this was not a man made, earth born, craft. It left us in awe.

The UFO was provoked by my friend and I and chased us to my house. I am a director of operations currently for a major trucking company and have been employed with them for 17 years. I am a 40 year old white male born in 1980. I currently reside in Chattanooga, TN and previously lived in Atlanta, GA, Memphis, TN, and Knoxville, TN (University of Tennessee, bachelors in Finance) after high school. Currently single and no children. I was born in Johnson City, TN, moved to Longview, TX for 10 years and then back to Kingsport, TN in the summer of 1991. My sighting occurred roughly in the summer of 1993 or 1994. I would prefer to leave the name of the friend who was with me that also witnessed this event out of this report. We lived in the same neighborhood, Ridgefields, and went to school together. I have not spoken to him since high school and not sure how comfortable he would even be talking about this. I am not aware of his status today. I felt given the nuclear facility connection in my sighting, it was important given the ! recent events in this area to make a report for at the very least a data point. I will be emailing a Google Earth overhead shot diagraming this entire event. In the summer of 1993 or 1994, I am guessing June time frame, my friend and I walked from my house to the gas station down the road to get snacks. It was getting dark on the walk back home and I estimate the time to have been around 9 PM. As we entered the park near my home, we happened to look up into the sky and noticed an odd ball of light that seemed out of place. Initially, it looked like a planet in the sky, but slightly different with a shimmering around it with occasional red, blue, and green hues. It did not appear to be a star either. I am estimating roughly a mile for the altitude, but very difficult to judge. The direction and apparent altitude of this object would place it over the Holston Army Ammunitions Plant there in town at the base of Bays Mountain. This facility manufactures RDX and HMX used in nuclear detonation and other things as well as being a national defense stockpile.  Being young kids, we started making jokes and “provoking” this thing calling it! a stupid UFO and saying things like “Hey, we’re down here!” and other things similar, including expletives. I estimate we yelled at it for a couple of minutes or so. To our absolute shock, suddenly this thing started to move. I watched it descend towards the top of Bays Mountain. I would estimate it had a high rate of speed in the 300-400 MPH range while traveling parallel to the top of the mountain towards our direction. It covered the length of the mountain in a few seconds, much faster than an aircraft would take to cover the same distance. It then descended straight down and out of sight as it appeared to have entered the woods/neighborhood. At this point, we didn’t know what else to do but run across the park as fast as we could, scale the red brick wall around my housing development in what felt like a single leap, and run into my house and upstairs into my room. We were kind of frantic once inside, nervous and excited, and trying to figure out what just happened whe! n suddenly the object flew right next to my bedroom window in ! between my house and the neighbor’s house. It was an orb shaped object about the size of a large yoga/exercise ball. The color was a solid white, very similar to that of a standard light bulb, with a slight glow around it. There were no other colored lights on it at this point. It had slowed down to a very low speed and appeared to have tracked us down and was investigating my friend and I for a brief couple of seconds. I immediately ran downstairs to run outside again to try to find it, but at that point it was gone. I didn’t see what direction it left in. The next morning a black helicopter flew over my house and hovered for a minute or in the same area the orb had been before leaving. I cannot directly connect that to this event, but given what happened the night before, I thought it was very strange and uncommon to have a helicopter in the neighborhood like that.",2021-07-31T00:00:00,36.50270386100386,-82.5479583011583

There was limited space inside the camper so I opted to sleep in my truck bed on a cot.  Around 4am I was staring at the sky (satellite watching) and saw a dot of light larger than what I was expecting to see.  Thought it might be the space station but then I thought it was way to big for that even.  The dot of light was moving slow and steady in single direction in what I thought was space and when it approached cloudcover I thought it would be gone behind the clouds.  It kept going “under” the clouds.  This startled me as I realized it was not in space but below clouds.  It then stopped.  Just stopped. For about 20 seconds then began moving again at a right angle to the previous direction.  (the original direction was left to right across sky. After stopping and starting again it was going down)  Suddenly, it took off in an entirely different direction at such a high speed it could have been a shooting star.  It was gone.  There was no noise, no sonic boom which I would of suspected at that rate of speed.  NOTE: I was not intoxicated and I am actually a non-drinker to this day. I am not a ufo believer. I think that all things like this can somehow be a natural occurrence.  I don’t believe there are little green men blah blah.  That is why I never reported this sighting.  However, with the new information popping up on the news about these tic tac ufo’s I thought maybe I should report it as the movement and speed seem so similar to the tic tacs.  It was to far to tell if the shape was round or oval but the movement was incredible and bizarre.

Which is not completely foreign as Brunswick has a decommissioned naval base that does still do training, but typically not with jets. The planes seemed to be doing turns and going back and forth and not just flying through. While returning to Brunswick south on 295 roughly 15 minutes later, I turned onto the Brunswick off ramp that merges with Pleasant street. It is a sharp U turn off ramp, as you drive and before starting to turn there is a small field on the left that is lower than the roads so more like a valley; that is surrounded with pine trees.

On or about 17 November 1977, I was sitting in a parked car with an acquaintance on a major thoroughfare in Boston, in front of my apartment building.  It was nighttime and pitch-black except for a few stars.  We had been parked and talking for about 15-20 minutes when we both noticed the headlights of a parked car directly behind us coming through the rear window of his car.  The lights were extremely bright and it was annoying and we both mentioned it to each other.  We were thinking that one of us would get out of the car and go speak to the driver and ask him to turn off his headlights.  Before we could do that, as we were watching the 'headlights' of the 'car' parked behind us, to our astonishment the pair of 'headlights' rose directly perpendicular, passing out of sight over the roof of our car and moved on a tangential line high into the sky.  The lights made no sound, no vibration or other distinguishing thing.  I am not a good judge of distances but it may have been about 1/2-mile up when the pair of lights seemed to blend into one.  The light moved in an irregular but angular motion (without what I understand is the banking movement of conventional aircraft).  The white light changed into various colors.  This display lasted about a minute or so and then the thing disappeared.  The whole incident was absolutely shocking.  My friend and I realized how close we might have come to something 'more', and it was very disturbing.  There is no such thing as an automobile doing what those lights did.  My acquaintance was severely unnerved and said goodbye to me.  He said he wouldn't be associating with me any further, as if I was somehow responsible for what we both saw.  I have not had contact with him since that night.  I only saw the two 'headlights', which appeared to be and were mistaken for car headlights, which gives an idea of their approximate size.  I have not discussed this event until now.  I was watching some video clips of Bill Birnes reporting various UFO incidents on the internet over the past several nights and decided I would like to get this incident off my mind.  I was a sophomore in college at the time; it seems to me that I was old enough to know what I was seeing, and besides, I wasn't alone.",2021-05-20T00:00:00,42.3416629506008,-71.06563371161549

There were probably 10 -12 young girls (I believe I was at least 8-9 years old but no older than 10 or possibly 11) and several adult female parent chaperones. We were around a campfire eating pineapple slices from a can that had been heated in the coals of the bonfire when the “weather” (I use this term loosely) suddenly changed dramatically.  The temperature dropped, the wind started howling, and there were strange, violent, colorful flashes in the sky but no noise whatsoever that I can recall, save the wind in the trees which were violently shaking. What was most concerning and memorable were the chaperones reaction; I remember them going from laughing to serious to extremely frightened, all in the matter of mere minutes, and we as a group were hustled out of the camp site and into several vehicles almost immediately. We drove away quickly and spent the night in someone’s attic or room above a garage- it was dry and comfortable but unfinished and large enough to accommodate 12-16 people in sleeping bags. I have very little memory of this, and I cannot say with any certainty whose house it was (undoubtedly one of the chaperones) and querying my parents produces no concrete memory or confirmation of this aborted camping event. We left the camp site so quickly that night that the next morning we were woken up early! and driven back to the camp site to pick up our tents and coolers and other miscellany.  I don’t know what the lights were but I know what they weren’t: to the core of my being I believe it was some sort of extraterrestrial encounter. I have lived through dozens of tornadoes, electrical storms, “regular” thunderstorms and even the tail end of a hurricane in Florida, and this was not a weather event- or if it was, it was like no other before or after. For years I actually thought perhaps I was sexually abused during this incident as the memories are so frightening and real and palpable and utterly, completely, abjectly traumatic - I no longer believe this ( sexual abuse) but I have finally accepted within my own heart that there was some kind of contact.  I know in this day and age if a camping event were interrupted and all participants whisked away to an adult’s house, parents would be notified immediately and in real time. However, this was probably 1974-78 (?) and my parents (both still living and for the most part sound of mind) have absolutely no memory of this occurring. However when I reflect on it - which is quite often, considering it happened 40 plus years ago, the fear and the internal trauma is undeniable. I have a freakishly good memory - I remember what the house I lived in at 3 years old looked like, I could tell you what you wore the day I met you, and I waitressed for years and could remember your favorite drink after serving you once- and I cannot recall one thing that happened once the lights started, the purple blue black (yes there was actually “black” lights)... I remember being yelled at to drop everything and get in the truck (or vehicle ?) amd I remember my complete physical and mental relief once we! were tucked into our sleeping bags inside of the attic, barn, etc.  I cannot for the life of me understand what this incident was, but for the fact that “it” has been with me, living in my head, for more than three quarters of my life. It was odd, strange, exhilarating, frightening, awesome, crazy and oddly unnatural, if that makes any sense. I wish I could say I saw a craft, but I didn’t. There was, however, a feeling of immense pressure from above, like how the air gets pregnant with moisture right before it pours. There was an almost unbearable feeling of pressure (which is the best way I can describe it) bearing down from above- it was like the sky was lowered...? It made your brain hurt inside your skull, the pressure. I cannot describe it, or reconcile it, and I’ve tried for years and years to understand it. I believe it was an encounter of some sort.  Additionally odd, I drove from out east where I now live back to Minnesota a couple years ago and the closer I got to Minnesota, the more vivid I recalled these unbelievable, strange, frightening memories- although it was not a frightening or unnatural feeling or experience - it felt like coming full circle back to that very night. I wish I could remember more.",2021-05-20T00:00:00,,

I pointed it out to her and explained the difference, visually, between a satellite and an airplane.  An airplane has blinking lights and a satellite looks like a slowly moving star.

A friend and I were camping at the south end of Melaka lake, near the outflow for the Pratt River.  There was a group of Boy Scouts if memory serves me correctly camping at the north end of the lake.   It was about 9:40PM, it was twilight and a clear evening for star gazing.  My friend was in the tent getting settled for the night.  I was scanning the southern sky and enjoying a hot cup of chocolate when I spotted what first appeared as a meteor coming towards me from the south-south east. However, the “meteor” appeared different from other meteors observed in various meteor showers I had enjoyed in the past.  It was a brilliant white, with an electric blue aura around the core and the tail.  It also appeared to be at a much lower altitude than other meteor showers I observed.  In addition, it was changing direction and arched over me heading due west!  There was no sound, no sonic boom, as it passed overhead.  But what happened next totally surprised me. The meteor instantly stopped and hovered for about 3-4 seconds and I instantly concluded that this was not a meteor, but some sort of vehicle or object!  A meteor cannot violate Newton’s first law of motion.         Paraphrasing the first law:  an object in motion stays in motion with the same velocity and in the same direction unless acted upon by an external force.  And, this object applied the brakes and came to a stop.   A meteor in flight does not change direction, much less come to an instantaneously stop!! The object was a round brilliant ball of light, approximately the diameter of an AA battery held at arms-length. My estimate is that it was about 5 miles west of me (Pratt Lake where we spent our first night) and maybe 8,000 feet above me based upon watching aircraft flying over my house from SeaTac Airport and McCord AFB.  But wait there is more! After 3-4 seconds, the object broke its hover and began to descend in a pendulum zig-zag motion moving right and then swinging left and swinging right and left again, then descended straight down.  I lost track of the object as it descended below the tree line or a ridge (descent time to the trees about 3 seconds).  I do not know if the object landed or not. I exclaimed, “now that is something you don’t see every day”.  I watched for another 15 minutes waiting for the object to reemerge but saw nothing.   I concluded that I witnessed a UFO, which was under intelligent control and spent a fairly sleepless night hoping that I did not wake up in a zoo on some distant world, or in a display case as a menu item for the special of the day.",2021-05-20T00:00:00,,

It was just kind of glideing along and when it passed in front of us it was no more than 200 feet out from the bluff but right at our level.

After it drifted past it went another quarter mile or so and took off almost verticle and within 15 to 20 seconds there were jets chasing it at tree top level when they roared over us.

At the same time we were watching it someone in Afton Minnesota was watching because they also reported on that site. The Oshkosh report wasn't on there but I was glad to see it on this site and of course that was due to the late reporting of the incident.

On the night of January 1st, 2020, at around 11:55 EST I was standing on the balcony of my friend’s apartment on the 10th floor of his building.  I immediately noticed three strange glowing lights in the sky.  At first I assumed that they were some sort of balloons or drones floating in the wind, at which point I clearly realized that they could not be, as they were far too high in the sky.  They emitted no sound, and there was no trace of any exhaust.  The lights did not blink as a plane would.  Instead, the objects were continuously lit, though it appeared that the area of the objects that were lit varied over time.  At some points it would seem as if areas that were previously unlit became lit, though it was not a jarring contrast as with turning on a light switch, it was much more fluid.  This could be attributed to the fact that the objects were rotating. At first it appeared as if they were milling about in the sky, adhering to no particular flight path or course, simply slowly cascading about through the sky.  A few minutes into watching them, they appeared to consolidate into a triangular formation.  They maintained this formation, each maintaining the same distance from the other two, though they changed their orientation in the sky.  They did not appear to move about a central axis, but instead moved in relation to the other two.  It was an extremely fluid motion that felt intelligent in nature as opposed to the result of some natural phenomenon. The most striking and unnerving aspect of this encounter was the fact that these objects were CLEARLY rotating. I did not notice whether they were rotating in unison or each at their own pace, but each object was clearly rotating in a manner that seemed to be quite rapid.  After a few minutes, around 12:10 AM on Jan 2nd 2020, the objects—without changing their apparent orientation—grew smaller and smaller in the sky until they began to twinkle.  I assumed this phenomenon was occurring because the objects travelled very far away from us very quickly.  They then disappeared.  The entire encounter lasted 10-15 minutes. Throughout the encounter, it appeared that the objects went from being 2-5 miles in altitude to an impossibly far distance from the surface of the Earth.  They also changed their orientation in the sky quite rapidly, maneuvering in a way that seemed to be impossible to me given the extreme acceleration and immediate deceleration that would be required to move that way.  They went from being practically on the horizon to an orientation that required us to strain our necks to look up in a matter of seconds. Throughout the encounter my friend and I were so shocked that we unfortunately did not document the incident as properly as I would have hoped.  We managed to capture a video though it was hard to focus the camera on the objects in the sky.  However, the video still shows the unusual nature of the objects, as well as some of the characteristics I previously described.  The video will be submitted to NUFORC along with this report for your reference.",2020-02-07T00:00:00,25.7741427135084,-80.28951850011829

On my way back home (facing away from the twinkling star) I noticed what I thought to be another one.  This one was different.. it was changing colors but very slowly.  I couldn’t keep my eyes off it.  Between the color changes I squinted my eyes to try and make out a shape and I could kind of see a oval or typical “saucer” shape.  I was thinking “yeah right” to myself but this is where shit got weird.  This craft began to move very slowly.  I then knew it wasn’t a star anymore..  I kept watching.  It then moved to the left very quickly then STOP at a dime.  My heart sank and I ran inside.  My girlfriend tried to calm me down on the phone but I couldn’t believe my eyes.  Do drones behave that way?  Do they! fly then stop abruptly at a split second?  I personally NEVER seen one do it.

As we passed by the 615 exit, we both noticed that on the south side of the highway, our right, there looked like what we both thought was a low flying blimp just above the tree line.  I kept my eye on it for about 10 seconds, then said to her, “hey look at that blimp,  I wonder why that’s in town there are no sporting events or reasons to be around.”  What we saw appeared to be a wide bank of lights that was white in the middle and Green on one end, and Red on the other end like normal aircraft markings.  If I had to estimate size, I would say 20 feet wide or larger.  I thought it was a blimp because the whole light panel was quite bright, and the object was slow moving or stationary.  I can’t say if it was moving, or if it looked like it was moving because we were, but it was clearly very wel! l lit and low visible through the top of the trees.  As we got near the Heisley Road exit, right when we would’ve been under it, the lights just turned off and we couldn’t see it anymore.   The windows were up so I don’t know if there was sound, but when the lights went off, it was just gone, not flying around with the lights off.  I thought it was strange because in my mind if it was a blimp, or low flying known craft, there is no way it’d be legal to be flying with lights off.  There are a few local airports but this was not a plane that was on its way to land with extra lights on.  I was going to just write this off as weird, but I’ve been hearing about similar “drone” sightings going on around the country so I decided this was now worth reporting.  One detail I remember is that when the lights turned off, it was similar to when you turn off football stadium lights off.  You could see them dim out over a few seconds rather than just immediately disappearing like an LED.",2020-02-07T00:00:00,41.68905889570552,-81.32667975460123

It rotated on the ""Y-axis"" so that it was pointing south down 275 the same direction we were heading and while we were getting onto the expressway letting us both get a good visual to shape, color, and some distinguishing lights. It was a larger, black triangular shape with a series of lights underneath, but even more so, the three rectangular lights it had on the top back portion when it rotated/slightly banked 2 more times. Do we have military aircraft that looks like this? We’re talking 2:27 in the morning with hardly any other planes in the sky as well as flying extremely low. We managed to pace with it for some time before the wall on I275 blocked our view.  I estimate the sides of the craft to be about 250-300' long and probably about 20-40' high - it looked the size of a large box store up in the sky. The outside or ""skin"" looked to be absorbing the street lights off of Ford road as they reflected off the street and illuminate the bottom and edges of the craft but the light looked to be absorbed which provided a strange visual of the light moving along the ""skin"" kind of like when you heat up a piece of metal and at the part of the metal that is being directly heated being a darker color and then as you move away from the flame location the color changes - almost like a mirage or it was absorbing the light shining on it.  The craft made zero noise or sound.

Like in the movies but without the big flash at the end.I get chills everytime I think about it. I live by a military base so I have seen weird stuff even a close up view of a Russian spy plane that flew over me. I have the exact time and date of that. But what I saw was way more bizarre then what I'm used to seeing.  This next encounter is different. I was outside at night thinking to myself when I started to think about aliens having the tech to read our minds. I looked to the night sky and tried communicating. A massive bright light flashed in the sky like someone pointing a flash light in your face from a distance. Ok I thought maybe it was justa coincidence but I've never experienced a light like that. I tried again the next night to confirm that they can indeed hear me. I looked up in a different direction this time and the samething happened. A bright flash but not just one. It was two separate flashes from two different locations in the same field of view. I hav'nt tried to do it again since those two nights. Take what you want from this story of mine but that freaked me right out.,2021-10-19T00:00:00,44.3242,-79.99359411764706

We stared at it starting making jokes and then realized it could not be a drone or an aircraft due to the rate it moved and continued to loom out there in the distance. Just as it came into plain view, it instantly shot up into the sky and disappeared.

This time it was green and it was coming from the southern portion of the horizon line - moving quickly towards me getting bigger and brighter moving further up coast but then paused. Instead of filming or taking pictures I embraced the moment and blasted music in effort to communicate, for this was the second time this has occurred. The light beamed green and flickered bright white for quite some time. It remained in the distance but I started to feel good energy, as it remained where it was and stayed green for over thirty minutes time. As all that occurred, I sat quietly and saw that the beaming light beginning to beam and grow in size; it began to beam a beautiful and calming technicolor arrangement of lights as if it was telling me everything was okay and they recognized my presence. This carried on for another thirty minutes. In the last few minutes, it went back to emerald green. It shifted to the left zipping quickly then gliding to the right - back to center - up and then down almost hovering down to the horizon line and then boom it shot straight back into the sky moving at a rate that no man made craft could possibly move. Just as it disappeared, I saw (government) aircraft with flashing lights flying up and down the coast line and as they passed me they flew off into the northern coastal distance, minutes later circling back and passing me by flying further down the southern coast line. From that point on, I knew whatever it was was highly intelligent and emotionally in tune with me. Never was one to believe in superficial things but of course there is intelligent life out in space other than us.

It was around 8:15 or 8:30 in the morning, the sun was up and had been for maybe an hour or hour and a half. The sky was clear and cloudless. I was playing around and roughhousing with my 10 year old son when we ran into my bedroom. We live on the 12th floor of a 24 story building. and there’s a balcony off of my room which faces due East. The curtains were open. While play fighting with my son I looked out and saw a perfect sphere, dull metallic or gunmetal gray, not shiny, and eerily out of place. It was just hovering perfectly still and above some buildings what seems like probably no more than half a mile away, and I’d guess maybe 1000 feet in the air. It was not there earlier. It was silent and a little smaller than the size of the full moon, except it was not on the horizon. I would estimate that it was maybe 15 to 30 feet in diameter. About the size of a city bus, except it was hard to accurately judge exactly ! how far away it was, and thus its diameter and how high up it was are just my best guesses.  We keep fighting a little, and I pause and look out again and I ask my son if he sees it. He says yes. Pretty matter-of-factly, I say something to the effect of “I think it’s a UFO” and go back to fighting. He chases me out of the room and down the hall and then back, about 30 seconds or so later. It’s still there. We stop and look at it for maybe 30 seconds. I guess you’d say I’m something of an amateur photographer and my pretty high quality camera was maybe 6 feet away. So was my phone. I think about taking a picture of it but I don’t. I tell myself something like “It can’t really be a UFO. It’s gotta be something else.”  We start fighting again and run off down the hall. When I come back a little later the sphere is gone and I start giving myself a hard time for not taking a picture of it, but I was still trying to convince myself that it was something else even though I know it wasn’t anything common, practical, or easily explained.  I know it wasn’t the moon because it was in the wrong place for the time of morning. I know it wasn’t a star or a planet because we can barely see more than 3 or 4 stars even on a clear night due to light pollution, but I still checked the internet for locations of the planets and moon and so on. We are not near any heavy airplane flight paths, especially none that low, and the apparent size of the sphere made it much too big to be a plane. It wasn’t a helicopter, which do occasionally fly near here but you can hear those really easily. They are LOUD. It was too big to be a drone. I’ve never seen anyone flying one around here anyway, and no self-respecting Turk is up and out of the house that early on a Saturday, especially to fly a drone.  About a week later I experienced after affects. I awoke in the middle of the night and my entire body was vibrating and I felt a static electricity-like tingly sensation which lasted maybe 15 or 20 seconds until I startled myself out of it. Maybe a week or two later it happened again, but with less intensity. I've never felt anything like that before or since.  I'm still kicking myself for not taking a pic. And now I'm always looking up!",2021-10-19T00:00:00,,

I woke up at random at about 2am and noticed immediately a large orange, hovering light that was orb/sphere like floating just above our detached garage. The orange orb was larger than a basketball, I'd compare it to a large yoga ball, and was hovering slowly from left to right, moving through the trees but not higher or lower and not going horizontally very far either. I'd compare the way it moved to a large beach ball or blob of orange lava floating & bobbing in the open ocean, it moved ever so slightly up & down as it moved horizontally. I then witnessed many other kinds of strange lights, some joined in formation some seemed to operate independently but near by. There was a fairly loud but low humming, vibration like noise the entire encounter that can! be heard in the videos I took. Unlike my other two sightings since this one, I had a overwhelming sense of fear, doom & dread the entire time I watched these lights and had a odd sense that I should fear it & becareful ""it"" didn't see me or know I was awake filming it on my phone. Something about it gave me the impression it was ""scanning"" the surroundings though it's movements didn't appear purposeful or zoned into any one area.

I was laying in my hammock looking at the sunset on the horizon. I then looked directly above me at the same time as thinking that it would be weird to see a UFO above me, and the split second that I began to think that I saw a brilliant white solid orb blink into existence directly where I was looking. I called for my significant other to come outside and witness what I was seeing.  The orb did not move for the first portion of the display. It stayed stationary above me bright white solid light for roughly 20 – 30 seconds. I witnessed the clouds moving behind it however when the object started to move it zoomed to the north then stopped. The light went out and it revealed itself as a grey cylinder shaped craft. It looked as though it was trying to cloak or hide itself as it blinked a few times in and out of existence. When it realized that it was not cloaked (at least that is how it seemed to myself and my partner) it zoomed behind a cloud.  There are various air traffic patterns above my house. There was no sign of any planes, no sound of planes, and no sound at all that accompanied the sighting. The craft moved to the left out of the cloud cover and I was able to get a short video of it. As soon as our attention was drawn to the south due to air traffic returning the craft was gone.  The next night I went to try and see if I could see the same craft; as I read there were various reports only a few miles from my home the month prior two days in a row; however I could not see the craft. I did notice at the exact same time and airspace that the UFO occupied the night prior there were 4 jets that were crisscrossing the area and leaving visible chem trails. I am unsure what that was; however as of lately I have not noticed too many chem trails in the area since the beginning of 2020.  The night of the sighting and two night after I was not able to sleep. I normally have insomnia; however this time it was different as I notice time loss.

I tossed and turned for a while and then looked at the clock again and it was 1:22 am EDT.

Myself, my girlfriend and my immediate family we're on vacation and Marathon Florida. A small hotel/condo type resort on the Gulf side of the island. Directly outside of our room which was on the bottom story, was a doc, a short one. On the first night myself my mother and my girlfriend we're lying out on the dock looking at the stars as we often do especially outside of cities where they are very visible. And there's no remarkable background to any of this short of my brother is an ex army infantry.  First sighting  The three of us, myself, girlfriend and mother, we're lying on the dock stargazing. 15 to 20 minutes of this and my girlfriend for spots it and points out two dim lights, dimmer than most of the stars but not all of them, heading east towards the Atlantic from the Gulf. The lights are mostly overhead and pass overhead during the siding. The two lights are moving in tandem as if attached to each other but as it passes overhead they move apart and then closely together while maintaining a constant speed that appears faster than any plane or helicopter. There is no noise whatsoever. When the lights move away from each other they do so in a way that is mirroring one another. The motion of the lights moving closer together and farther apart was much faster than the forward motion of the objects. We could tell they were two separate objects because we could see the stars between them as they passed over us. There appeared to be nothing more than the two lights.  This was my first siding of something I couldn't identify or explain. This was due to the mostly unremarkable speed of the lights but the movements of them were so rapid and perfectly mirrored I could not come up with an explanation for any known aircraft. I was very excited about this and told everyone with us in our party, my oldest nephew one of two, that was with us seemed very uninterested as he did with most things at his age kept insisting it was a drone or drones. This I did not believe a prop driven vehicle even a drone could move so agiley as well as silently, also knowing that drones require flashing lights on them.  The next night I go out on the dock to do some fishing. And it is no longer than 15 or 20 minutes that I again see the slight. I believe it came out from the Gulf again but then seem to turn in what appeared to be a perfect right angle then slowed to a stop for just a moment and then jumping around very erratically sort of circling its stationary point and then appeared to shoot upwards I could see a slight curve to it as it faded away out of velocity I've never witnessed. It basically seemed to go straight up extremely fast after jumping around radically.  As I recall, every night myself or others went out for 15 or 20 minutes one of these lights would always appeare. With the exception of one siding I believe they were always moving from golf to Atlantic, just not always in a straight line.  The two most remarkable sightings where as follows. The first I want to mention is a night we got back late, probably after 10:00. Myself and my youngest nephew of the age 13 went out with me to the pool. Because it was so hot we did not mind going out in the rain. There was complete cloud cover and heavy rain. While we are in the pool he tells me to look up and we see again the same light, not real dim but not very bright, also silent, moving in a slightly curved trajectory and then making sharp right angles in a zigzag of about five points then jumps around around its original center point before appearing to shoot up through the clouds.  At this point I have been talking about them enough to annoy my family. Especially my older nephew who insists that it's nothing but a drone. So one night I convinced my two young nephews and my brother, as well as his two kids all go out to the dock and as I told them to give it 20 to 30 minutes and we'll see one. The lights did not disappoint. My older nephew was, ironically, the one to spot the light first. He suddenly said what is that a bird? And we all looked up and saw it as usual moving silently, other than that I cannot recall specifically how this one moved. But the satisfying part being that the older more skeptical nephew had no idea to explain what it was. Unfortunately my brother, the ex-military member, has terrible vision and thick classes and could not see the light in time, although his children did, he also had a camera because he likes taking pictures, but it was gone too fast and nothing was captured on film. I believe I had tried to film The light! s with a cell phone but was unable to get it to show up, probably because of the dimness.   The last siting I was out on the dock alone because it was late and I could not convince my girlfriend or anyone else to come out with me to see the lights. I expected to see them even though it was raining a bit and mostly cloud covered. This time was different because while sitting on the dock I saw the cloud cover edge out over the Gulf, and what seemed to be a gap in the clouds directly above me, slightly behind me from my point of view. Through this there were two stars I could see but did not pay much attention. Expecting it to come from the Gulf of his mostly looking out that way, not sure if it's significant but the whole time I started feeling very uneasy, possibly watched, I kept having this picture of something rising out of the ocean or some large almond-eyed entity suddenly appearing on the doc next to me. This never happened though. After 30 minutes knowing I needed to get to bed I was rather disappointed and started walking up the dock back to our room! . I took one more last look up and suddenly realized those two stars were not an opening in the cloud which did not occur to me until one of those stationary lights jumped around the other and then shot off towards the Atlantic and the second one almost mimicked the exact motions of the first and appeared to shoot upwards on a curved trajectory.   After the last siding it occurred to me these objects seem to move in erratic ways when we noticed them. And I can't help but remembering them and thinking they seem to shoot away or move erratically shortly after we started watching them. Maybe that's just me but to this day I can't find anything online about other people seeing this. I even asked a guy that worked at the resort what are those lights every night in the sky? He had no idea what kind of left and said we are near the Bermuda triangle which had not occurred to me at that point, I'm rather skeptical of the whole Bermuda Bermuda triangle legend.  To this day I regret not making more of an effort to capture these things on film. The more I think about it the more I think it was not a terrestrial aircraft. If anybody has any ideas please let me know, there was a military base fairly nearby, but I don't imagine they had any drones with those capabilities. I hope to go back someday, and hope that I witnessed these lights again prepared with equipment to film them.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,24.7163,-81.0767

I was a teenager and I was hanging out one summer night on the back of my grandma’s Lincoln in her driveway looking up at the sky. there was a couple street lights on down the way but where I was it was a little bit darker. I know that it was past 10 PM because my grandma was watching one of her tv programs and it was a summer night so all the windows were open and I could hear the TV on not really loud but loud enough to know it was on from where the car was parked. I looked to the east and I saw what appeared to be at first I thought it look like a rising sun and I thought OK that’s weird and I was sober I was a teenager and was not high on any drugs. I watched approach my direction coming east to west and behind me is a place called Indian lake and we lived right off of Indian lake you had to walk up the hill across the street and then down to a little place and you could go right to the lake and that seem like the direction path it was going but I did no! t know that when I first saw it. I noticed that the wind changed it got like very very very windy like insane like unbelievable and I couldn’t hear anything but that wind the TV I didn’t hear anymore and it was like I was in a different place. But I was still sitting on the back of the car I just sat up and was about to get jump off of the car and run into the house to go get my grandma but I couldn’t I couldn’t move and what happened was I watch this reddish orange thing change from like a bright orange to look more reddish color and when it would go over each Street light The street light would turn off and it would like light up a heavier I don’t even know how to explain it but the wind was insane. It felt like time stopped but it was windy and really weird it got to the point where the light from the ufo was lighting up the dark part of the street that I was on and it came over top of me about 20 feet above and I don’t know what happened but all I could see was an inten! se red/orange light I couldn’t even make out anything but the ! light an d at that time I was still trying to get off of the back of the car and my body wouldn’t let me do it. I felt weird and distorted like it was more seconds but it wasn’t it was almost 2025 minutes that it passed when I finally came to and was able to slide off of the car and freakishly jelly leg shakey leg run into the house to see if my grandma had witnessed what I witnessed. When it was above me and I couldn’t move it didn’t stop it kind of raised up higher and then took off and the wind was so insane and then absolutely nothing, nothing no noise nothing and then boom TV sound comes back on I think the power went out in the house because I couldn’t see anything and then all the power came back on after this thing took off. The street lights however stayed off but they did come on the next day and I found that to be really weird. After it took off it headed west towards the lake and I could see it and it was very bright and I ran into the house and I went right to my grandma! who was sittin on the couch and  she had no concept of anything that I just happened she didn’t see any lights she did say that the power flickered but then it came right back on so I don’t know and I looked at the time because she had a clock right there by the TV and it said like 1105 1106 pm and my heart was pounding and I just felt like I could run a marathon with the amount of energy I had pumping through me. After that night I would always make sure someone was outside with me if I was in the driveway like that I never saw it in the driveway again but I did see the same bright ball of light orange red up at the lake occasionally hovering it seem like it was like they’re like it live there or across the lake I’m not sure so maybe five times i saw if after that and had other witnesses but they just tried to explain away and I never got an answer about what it really was. it just produced an insane amount of wind when i encountered it.",2021-07-31T00:00:00,40.5152,-83.921

Greetings, all attempts at reporting this encounter have been ignored by media outlets. Nov 13th 2000 7pm MST. My son was looking out his bedroom window and saw three small patches of lightning. Then three glowing orbs appeared in the sky. I ran outside to see three large glowing orbs,one blue,one red and one yellow positioned directly over my property. I watched as the red one split in two then recombined into a single orb. I'm thinking oh my God My Phone and ran inside to grab phone to take a few pics.I managed a few pics with one close-up. I was then hit with a bright light and my phone went dead. Strange thing is there was no beam of light,I just list up a with this glowing white color. The beam disappeared  and the orbs shot off into the distance at a high rate of speed. One interesting thing to note: The entire time the orbs were present there was no sound. I mean no ambient sounds whatsoever. No talking, no tv's or radios from the homes nearby, no dog! s no crickets no cars no train, NO NOTHING. The moment the craft departed the ambient sounds returned. Since that day I've had 30 minutes disappear on a simple 10 minute drive into Las Cruces three times. No deviation from my ordinary route whatsoever but the 10 minute trip took 40 minutes each time. I heard this ambient(for lack of a better word) thought in my head during the event and ever since that evening. The thought is always there in my mind but I ignore it as much as possible. The thought is: Water please, we need water. We are dying, please you have so much.The thought has changed since the last episode of missing time. Now it's: we will return soon,be patient. We need the water help us please William....How do the know my base? This is really freaking me out. Have you guys heard anything similar? Certainly its not just me saying these things.

The time was close to noon on a sunny and relatively clear day with some clouds. We were drinking coffee on the balcony of my apartment on the 9th floor of a residential building south-west of the city center while looking at the city skyline, when we noticed an oval-shaped object resembling a horizontal black tick-tack 'flying' over the city in the distance. It was fully black, no lights of any kind, with an unusual trajectory that didn't seem normal. It was fast, going across the whole city there and back a few times, sometimes in straight lines, sometimes zig-zaggy. We didn't hear any sound coming from it but we could see it the entire time since we were at a high altitude, although when the object was on the other side of the city it was so far it looked like a small black dot. The whole thing lasted for about te! n minutes, when the object suddenly (and much faster compared to its movements prior to this moment) pulled up in the sky until it resembled a small dot again and disappeared high in the clouds. My friend and I commented the unusual trajectory of the object and its speed and came to the conclusion that conventional aircrafts (or objects of any kind for that matter) don't do that. Since both he and I are sceptical people we discarded the alien theory although we were intrigued by what happened that we witnessed. We called the local meteorological institution to inquire if they noticed anything unusual in the sky above Zagreb and they said they didn't.

Many of the cottages were lit up like Christmas trees, and we could see the interiors, so we were stopping and admiring them as we slowly walked along.  The cottages are old and surrounded by very tall mature trees.  As we stopped to admire one of the cottages, I happened to notice a very distinct large black oval shape in the sky, above the trees, blotting out the stars.  There was no moon, and the sky was full of stars so this was very noticeable.  The large oval shape was some distance away, just above the tree tops but I can’t estimate how far away it was.  It was very long and rounded at both ends.  It was also very tall.  It was huge.  There were no lights to be seen on it anywhere, and no wings, tail rudder, or any other appendage type of thing.  It was totally silent.  I called this thing to my friend’s attention and we watched it as it moved south very slowly and deliberately with absolutely no noise.

My wife was driving, I was in the passenger seat, my Brother-in-law was in the driver’s side rear seat and my Sister-in-law was in the passenger side rear seat. We made a right turn from Main St onto 2000 S and had just begun to descend the hill when my Brother-in-law said “What is that?” My wife then said “I don’t know! That is weird.” My Sister-In-Law saw it third but remained quiet. I responded a little dismissively at first and asked, “Are you guys just looking at the moon?” They responded “No! Look!” My wife had slowed the car to almost a complete stop and I looked out of the drivers side windows toward where they were gesturing. A large flat rectangular dull grey craft with lots of lights was moving slowly just over the houses. I was so amazed and alarmed that such a large craft was being operated in such close proximity to homes. At! the time I first saw it it was moving slowly but when my Wife and Brother-In-Law first saw it it was hovering. It had two rows of approximately 6 white lights on the bottom of the craft. It had rows of red and blue lights on the sides and top. Some of the red and blue lights were flashing alternately. The lights were large and seemed to be structured. They seemed disproportionately large and there were so many of them. We detected no sound from the craft. A helicopter in that close of proximity would have been loud. I’m not aware of any drones that are that large but I would assume that a giant drone at that close of distance would have been loud as well. The windows were rolled up during the sighting so we cannot confirm that it had no sound but it definitely didn’t have any conventional flight characteristic sounds that would have been audible at those close proximities with such a large craft. We estimate that the craft was somewhere between 30-40ft long. It moved slowl! y along the row of homes but biased slightly toward the street! we were driving on. It passed through the field of view of the driver’s side windows and into the field of view of the rear window. It had traveled closer to the road as it was heading eastward. It appeared quite large with so many lights. My mind was trying to establish what category of craft it fit into but it didn’t fit into any category that I have witnessed before. It was so flat and rectangular and quiet with so many lights, it seemed so different than anything I was familiar with. We continued to watch it fly slow and low and quietly down the street. My wife started to turn the car around so we could follow it and we watched it disappear Eastward below the row of houses at the top of the hill. It appeared quite large still as it passed the houses at the top of the hill. It passed so low over the top of the houses that it quickly passed below our field of view. I’m a Biomedical Engineer.

Earlier that evening I was playing with a friend, we were around 10/9 when this happened, said friend left to go home to eat his dinner leaving me alone. I continued the game we were playing by myself for about the next thirty minutes. As the sun began to set I remembered I lost track of time and would miss that nights episode of WWE Smackdown so I started walking home.  A brief description of the neighborhood I lived in, it was a small subdivision with only four main roads and a small connector road. My friend and I were playing on the back left road and he lived on the front left road and I lived on the back right road. So my walk home was a straight shot. I was a quiet neighborhood and most people besides the kids who would come outside stayed inside or in their backyard. Most nights we’d be back inside before or by nightfall. So I was the only person outside .  As I began to walk on my street I was about a 1/4 of the way up the street when I noticed a bright light above my head. At first I dismissed it but after a few steps decided to look up. At first glance I thought to myself “Dang the stars are shining bright tonight” and looked back down. Then I gave another look and stopped, as I looked up I saw a craft with a circular main body and three rectangular extensions in the shape of an equilateral triangle. That is to say each “arm” stuck out where the tips of the triangle would be. The entire body of the craft was a whitish yellow and glowed but no light seemed to be illuminating the sky or ground. It was fairly close the best description I can give of it is of a plane close to returning to an airport. It also made no noise. I stood there in shock for about 20 secs or so. The craft continued to fly forward slowly but covering a lot of ground, it was near the backyard of a house in the cul-de-sac and nearly out of the neighborhood.! At that point fear kicked in and I started to run the rest of the way home.  As I was running up the drive way and under the porch awning I looked up again to see the craft and back tracked and was flying over my house. But it was from the front to back of my house not retracing from side to side if that makes any sense. Nothing happened after I went inside that night. I did tell my friends the next day and my class the following Monday.

I had not done any drugs at that point in my  life, was currently living at home and was raised in the Mormon church.  I awoke suddenly to my pitch black room....sweating with a feeling of unease, a feeling of a presence. When I tried to move I realized I was totally paralyzed expect for my eyes. I scanned the room with my eyes. To my absolute horror I saw a large column in the center of my room that was darker than the darkness of my room. Something was there, my eyes struggling to adjust, fighting for every last detail of what was before me. Then like in the blink of an eye I beheld my visitor.  It looked like a very tall bipedal bird like figure with very long plague doctor like ""beak"". Huge grapefruit sized black eyes that were more outside his face than they were inside. Sporting a slick black lab coat or duster fit for a Matrix movie. Bald head with curly white skullet, large raptor like hands and feet. Upon witnessing the entity I became overwhelmed with terror and passed out from shock.....  I awoke suddenly again and remembered very quickly of what had just happened.  I was still paralyzed and began to scan the room with my eyes but did not see any gradients in the darkness. It's gone I thought. Then the entity stood up and backed away from my bed. It had it's face so close to mine that the darkness of the room I was scanning was actually its eyes so close to mine I could not tell. The crippling fear returned in an instant and I felt like I was going to pass out again. At that moment it ""spoke"" to me. It sounded like a extremely low vibration that translated itself into English in my head, in real time.  It called me by a name that was not my own. But I recognized this name as my own. A name that is not supported by our language. Once he had addressed me by this name all the feelings of fear ceased and I was overcome with a feeling of peace,love and safety. I then shifted into a alternate personality, the personality of the name I was being addressed by. I came to realize that this was the name of my soul, the name of the entity who is me occupying this human body. Turns out our terrestrial bodies and terrestrial names are just egos. Egos are like spaceships, vehicles for a special purpose of navigating the waters of eternity.  At that moment I remembered a lot of stuff that I can't explain. I remembered that I was on a mission. Somehow my life was a planned injection into the system for some other goal that in the moment I remembered, but now I cannot. It explained to me that it could perceive the entire contents of my mind and could somehow tell that I was passionate and serious about helping my fellow man through the darkness. It said that on special occasions, like the one at hand they could interject in the process to communicate and/or help us. It said that I possessed a unique perceptive that I was to share with my peers.  It explained that if I wanted to participate I would have to give my consent. It said that while they were allowed to make themselves known they could not truly interfere without my consent. It said that it had the power to make me believe anything was real, and that I did not have the ability to determine what was real and whats not. It asked if I wanted to continue.....  I declined, becoming very suspicious that was a malicious entity. ""Needs my permission?"" sounds like deal with the devil kinda shit. I got spooked, declined its offer and it dispensary right before me. I awoke suddenly to an empty room. No longer paralyzed. Reflecting on what just happened. I became sad. I thought to myself. ""Wow, that was your chance to learn something new, to participate in something beyond belief. I thought that was my one chance and I blew it because I was afraid. Lost in regrets I laid back down and tried to go back to sleep. Then BAM! It was back just like that, BAM! paralyzed again. ""Am I awake or dreaming God dammit!"" I was so confused.  The entity reminded me of how it just said that it could see my entire mind/soul/self like I could see pages of a book or view information off a DVD. It knew of my sadness and regret. It said it came back to make the offer one last time. This time I gladly accepted. It seemed very pleased and with that all went black.  I awoke suddenly......it was morning time. I got up, showered, got dressed, brushed my teeth and decided that I would take my mind off these events by offering to make pancakes for my family. As I was flipping the first round of flapjacks I felt the same presence that I felt in my episode. I laughed and blurted out ""I know your there"". Then I felt goofy because I realized my whole family was at the table behind my waiting on the pancakes. I turned around to see the entire breakfast scene was on pause. Straight up on pause. Like the steam from the food and everything. Freeze frame. And the entity was standing right there on the other side of the counter. It ""chuckled"" and said something patronizing like I was doing a good job and had a strong mind. That I was a ""tough nut to crack"" so to speak.  With that I was thrust into drama after drama. Normal real life basic dramas. Home,school,work,what have you......and every single time I was blindsided with a freeze frame and a little banter from this entity. I realized my mind was on a treadmill. A telepathic anesthetic technique. It kept on saying how much fun he was having actually having to try to keep my mind from seeing what was truly at hand. But it was not entirely successful and I did see what was really happening from time to time. You see during this whole ""treadmill"" of events I was getting blasted with short sporadic visceral images of my situation. I was in a large metal room, naked, strapped to a large metal table in T pose. The table rotated into a vertical position and I saw informant of me this entity along with other entities but they were smaller and acted like aids to the main entity. Like I said this ""scene"" was being violently peppered into the ""day dream treadmill"" instances. Aka the telepathic anesthetic was hiding me from seeing but I was still getting traumatic slivers of my situation.  In this metal room the entity approached me with a large metal looking object. The apparatus was 3ft long about 2in in diameter with a slight curve. I was completely and utterly frozen with terror. It held up the apparatus and inserted it all the way into my mouth. I could feel the apparatus melt into small tendrils like lighting or tree growth pattern. Each tendril tip then locked into each rung of each strand of my DNA and was preforming  read/write operations. I blacked out.  I awoke suddenly.....it was night time, the same night still. I felt relived to realize that it all must have been a nightmare. That is when I heard a knock at my door. It was my little sister. She said she heard me thrashing in bed and wanted to see if I was OK. I was telling her of everything that just ""happened"" she was looking at her phone the whole time seemingly not interested with kinda hurt my feelings. In that moment she asked if she could show my something. We were both sitting on my bed. She got up and stood in front of me and turned here phone screen to my face. The white light of the blank screen temporarily blinded me. In that moment in the faded dark image behind the light of the screen my sister's skin began ripping like a shirt on a body builder and out her came the 7ft figure that had been toying with me all night.  That was when it happened. I realized in then that he was right. During the ""day dream loops"" and ""abduction"" stuff I had an underlying notion of disbelief. But the instance with my sister, being awake and talking to her. I literally thought that that was real life, that I was back to real life. But really the entity was just giving one last final blow in the stability of my perception of reality. It then asked once more if I cared to continue. I admitted to it that it was correct. I did in fact think that was real and it succeeded in proving that it indeed had the power it claimed to have. I submitted and said I would like to continue. That is when it bent over. Our eyes now level, our gazes locked. I was slammed with a series of discrete images. All the images were from my perceptive doing various things but nothing about the images seemed to match my current situation in life. My bedroom, computer, set/setting. They were not memories........what were they? I awoke suddenly........it was the next day. All that crazy shit stuffed into a single night. I felt as I was gone from Earth for years, but is was just a single night. I got ready and left for my community collage. My first class of the day was drawing class. The teacher opened class with a basic exercise to get the class warmed up. She said ""Draw something interesting you saw in a dream"". I locked up with anxiety so bad I slammed my hands down to my desk frantically looking around expecting to get blindsided by the entity only to see the whole class staring back at me from the sound of me hitting my desk. Plus my expression must have been priceless! HaHa! It's been 13 years since that night.......or has it? I will literally never be able to tell the difference. But that was the gift I was given.  To make no choice matter. To have and yet lose yourself, until finally all reasons why are forgotten. To live through ones own shadow. Mute and blinded, is to really see. A lie to maintain equilibrium, to hold me in this dead realm - this last ever dream. I'm the thought that never crossed my mind - disguised in the evident.  I now no longer have a sense of real vs not real. It's all real. In fact the only thing that is truly impossible is to not exist. The proof of this fact that you already do exist. We will never cease to exist. The contents of our minds and the actions of our thoughts are just as valid as the ""material"" world. There is no prime mover but us. Having both fun and terrifying experiences, escaping repetition and boredom for the sake of not loosing grasp of ourselves during our eternal existence.  Here is the kicker. Over the last 13 years sometimes I will have deja vu. But instead of the normal deja vu sensation of knowing this happened already but having no memory of it happening. I would instead have a deja vu that linked back to a memory of where I saw that image in the first place. It's always one of the images that I was slammed with by the entity at the end of my episode. And they always occur when I am making a important decision in life or was looking for guidance on what to read/study next.. I have been making decisions based on these ""memories"" and it has led me on a life path so filled with synchronicity that I'm ""tripping"" sober each and every day.  I found DMT when I was 24 y.o and got the confirmation I was looking for. I have deja vu a lot while researching/studying physics and they have led me to a ton of new ideas. After 13 years of following this bread crumb trail of deja vu I now have a great life situation that I am thankful for and oddly enough plans for a new physics apparatus that might be the answer to interstellar and/or inter-dimensional and/or time travel. TOTALLY INSANE......I know.  I turn 31 this year. And I have not for a single second been able to remove what I saw from my minds eye. That night is BURNED into me. This year I finished the plans for my machine and plan on starting the build later this year.  https://www.patreon.com/WarpDrive?fan_landing=true  Some good follow up reading: Shadows of the Mind by Roger Penrose Cycles of Time by Roger Penrose Consciousness in the Universe: A review of the 'Orch OR' theory by Stuart Hameroff & Roger Penrose Wholeness and the Implicate Order by David Bohm The Undivided Universe by David Bohm & B.J Hiley Zen and the Brain by James H.

I was on the 13th floor / penthouse and had stepped onto the terrace to appreciate the moon and sky. Not long after, I saw a couple of comets or meteors fall to the North - one appeared to be quite large (I later learned that the Geminid showers were happening during this time).  I can't recall if I had stepped back inside first or if I was outside the entire time. But, not long after the comets, from the North (Greenpoint, Brooklyn or Long Island City, Queens), I saw something in the sky heading South towards where I was. At first, I thought it may be a cluster of rogue helium balloons or a flock of birds. But, ironically, I also saw a flock of birds fly by in a v-shaped formation and this was not what I was witnessing.  I waited for 5, 10 minutes as this object or group of objects moved closer until I noticed that it was a large amorphous, seemingly organic shape moving slowly in the sky upwards. It was somewhat translucent with a tinge of orange. It would change shape as it moved. I described it to my friend that it looked like a ghost-like amoeba, undulating a bit while moving upwards. I distinctly remember I had closed and opened my eyes 3 times to make sure I was not hallucinating.  My camera was three flights below, and I did not know how long this object would be visible, so I continued to watch and wait for it to get closer to the moon so I could see it even better.  I then remembered that we had a telescope on the other side of the living room, which I retrieved. The moon was so bright that it hurt to try to locate the object, so I gave up and just watched with the naked eye as it continued past to the right of the moon from my vantage point until it was just a small bright glowing speck that finally disappeared.  One of my housemates returned home soon after, and he suggested it was probably a weather balloon. But after googling - it was clear that it was not a balloon of sorts that I saw.    The next day I googled to see if anyone else had mentioned the sighting of an amoeba like object, but nothing. It would have been easily seen by many but key words did not yield any posts. Additionally, nothing came up online of anyone ever having seen such an object before. I essentially got teased by friends who asked what I'd been smoking!  Subsequent to that sighting, I did actually witness a deflated weather balloon descend one afternoon, and it was completely different from what I'd seen. What I saw almost seemed to be swimming or moving upwards in a systemic fashion, and it did not appear solid. ",2021-05-20T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

I was outside with two friends having a cigarette outside our building.  The two guys were talking, standing up nearby, and I was sitting on the ground leaning against the brick building and admiring the sky (I had just moved from Rhode Island the preceding Monday, so the fact that I could see the Milky Way was just unreal to me at the time). As I sat there, there appeared an incredibly bright “star” overhead.  I interrupted my friends to have them look at it, and we stood there in a circle looking straight up at it, completely dumbfounded.  It was just hanging in the air directly overhead, this incredibly bright white light.  We were marveling, wondering if it could possibly be a star that just looked super close. At that moment, the thing shot straight up into the sky, so fast that it disappeared into a point of light the way that objects get smaller and “disappear” when they move away from you.  I have never seen anything move so fast in my life. We all looked at each other in complete shock.  It was then that I noticed that my friend has a single tear running down his cheek, his eyes wide open in complete shock; he was a mirror to us other two.

I was on a lake looking up at the sky when I saw what looked like an amber or copper colored object moving across the sky straight above. At the time, my friends on the boat said that it was a satellite but I now realize that that is not possible based on how clear I could see it and how large it was. It was perhaps the size of a large plane flying at 30,000 ft but was going much faster. It went from east to west across the sky, almost as if it was in orbit. It took roughly 10 seconds to cross the entire sky and therefore I believe it was going very fast.

July 3, 2013 myself and my boyfriend were bbq’n when i noticed an bright orb came slowly over the trees. Allow me to explain the lay out, i lived so close to the airport that when planes landing gear came out i could hear it, the shadows of the plane covers my house. All planes flew in on a certain path, i had never seen a plane come from this direction before. The 1st thing, strange but weird, the 1st thing thought that popped in my mind was UFO, but just as quickly the thought of “ firework”  over took that initial opinion. i stood there watching it slowly creep over the house in a straight line, until it stopped about two houses down from me. when it stopped i noticed there was no beacon light, I knew FAA required all aircraft to have beacon lights. I also noticed no noise. After a few minutes of staring at this orb….    it split into 2 orbs. So the original orb stayed in place and an exact same new orb split from it and zoomed off with insane unimaginable speed towards the atlanta airport. i was amazed to say the least. after maybe a minute the 2nd orb returned back to the original mother orb…. and when i say returned.  It came in fast like they were going to collide! But stopped just far enough…. now the orbs are side by side. And here is the strangest part of this experience…. the one that just flew back, the one that came back from the airport, that orb started shooting red lazers back and forth!! in my mind , i know we can send information without red visual lazors…. so i assumed this was POWER! Because after the exchange of what looked like tracer rounds…. it again sped off towards the airport!! i was like “ ummm…. why is there no fighter jets coming to blow this out the sky?” then i realized the orbs were low enough to not get picked up on radar!! And the 2nd orb was going way to fast to be picked up by any device!!! BEST SHOW AND REVELATION OF MY LIFE, I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT DAY!",2021-05-20T00:00:00,,

But then I see this glow out of my close peripheral vision come into view from under my trucks roof. Now I got a clear line of site but my comedian ass is still joking with her so I'm not looking at this thing directly yet.  But during this whole bit, I'm thinking OK, even through peripheral vision I'm understanding thi! s is something I haven't seen before.  Finally I  look as it's fading off...what I would assume is 50 miles away. My wife stared directly at it from start to end. Finally I quit joking with her and said, ""ok, real talk though, you seen that too??    That was weird right?"" I imagine this detail might be significant to other obnoxious husbands...for me to abandon a dumb bit I'm playing to annoy my wife....I can only imagine it WOULD take a ufo. I've been out doing ranch work since the sun came up, same thing yesterday, and so on. My only entertainment is toying with the mental state of my wife...and I go all in. But heh, sure enough, look at that. Now, from the instant I noticed a glow reflecting on my mirror to seeing this disappear...maybe only 5-6 seconds passed. Visually I would describe by asking you to imagine a high power spotlight shining up into a clean layer of fog setting at 1000ft. Or roughly where you would see low level clouds. The glow of the light hitting the fog would create an aura in that spot in the fog. Almost as if it was a glowing segment in the fog if you ignored the spotlights existence. Tonight though, in NE Oklahoma, specifics specifically at 2020 time. 8:20pm There is still no cloud cover at all, much less fog. Rationally I can't explain how this, without some form of translucent matter surrounding it, would glow since there's nothing in its vicinity to reflect a light. And there is no physical object that i can see, just a high speed glow. So..Clear skies, highspeed glow travelling at a speed I WOULD closely compare to meteorites when you see them fly from one horizon to the other in seconds. Being a (just gonna call it glow blob but use discretion as that is slight humor the rest is simply strange enough to find myself reporting it, to a site I had to look up ""google, how would I go bout reporting a ufo?"" lol) Ufos and aliens are topics that are unfortunately ridiculous now. Its IS truly unfortunate and most of society would hate what I attribute the majority of that fault to. My point though is any story requires credibility now for it to even be entertained. Take this for what it's worth. I'm US Army Vet. From 82nd Airborne 2nd brigade 2nd battalion. 2Fury.  Jumped and sometimes just fell from a LOT of C130s and C17's traveling faster than you ever would believe people are ok with jumping out at. Jumped day, night, hollywood(no ruck), and full combat loads. Took part in Operation Jade Helm and Operation Trident Juncture and couple others. I began in an 18x contract going straight into Special Forces. Completed all preliminary courses and finally after months of the most difficult and gruelling punishment the US government could legally bestow upon us..I had a major fracture in my right ankle during Selection phase of the course. I mean, my foot turned black, blue, yadayada, but it also had a giant green streak from my shin to my little toe. I don't know..but it was bad. 1st of many injuries. Spent the rest of my career in the earlier stated unit! . Listen, I know drones and everything else. All that crazy stuff most of y'all go nuts over, they are constantly training and running drills over Ft. Bragg with. At any moment you can search and find a drone. Which reminds me, this ufo made no sound whatsoever. No afterburner or late detect due to range, nothin. I cant evaluate size or elevation since a glow blob provides zero reference but it was surely at least above 800ft. Likely much higher but I'm only confident giving the low range limit. Lastly, for knowledge sake, I have theorized how aliens and ufos could exist that make logical sense to me. But this didn't even exist on THOSE extreme variables. Something else.

What made it remarkable was it was the furthest that I have ever flown the drone up till the current point in time. As I was watching this fairly uneventful footage my eye catches something race past the screen at in insane rate of speed, which at fists glance would appear to be a bug which flew past the drones camera very closely. After close examination of the footage it appears that I caught the elusive “fast-walker” on footage. The video shows that this object appears from the extreme horizon which I estimated to be at distance of about 6 miles. The object headed almost dire! ctly towards the drone (Northbound) in a banking motion, as if it is investigating the only other craft in its immediate airspace, then the object disappears from frame almost directly underneath my drone.

She was talking to me in my office on the second floor of our home. She had a puzzled look on her face to which I asked “What is it?“ and she replied “I am trying to figure out what the heck is in the sky.”  I got up and looked out the window to see what I can only describe as a shapeless or shapeshifting flying object. It was low in the sky, silent, and only a few hundred feet but less than 1000 feet above the ground. It was moving in a west to northwesterly direction. I estimate the distance away at 1-2 miles. The color was silver but was shifting in terms of brightness. It appeared to be reflective at times and transparent the next. The silvery/reflective color and shape changes were bizarre and difficult to explain. It appeared to have hard edges one second and rounded edges the next then back and forth without any pattern of shape change. After watching the object for about 30 seconds I grabbed my phone to record but it had moved out of view behind some houses. We have a rooftop deck and we both went outside to the roof for a better look. The object was still visible but seemed to have sped away from when we had lost sight of it only seconds before. It appeared to have chan! ged course to a more north-northwesterly direction. It continued to move in total silence, flying farther away and slowly gaining altitude. The air was calm, not a cloud in the sky.  As it moved away, I filmed the object. I was easier to see with the naked eye. The digital video does not show as much detail but in both the video and with our eyes we could see what appeared like fast-flickering lights. At times this flickering made it look like 2 objects. It was brighter than I would have expected from a reflection. The object was also quite large. Larger than the small planes and helicopters that are commonly seen from my rooftop deck. We watched and filmed the object as it flew away from us and eventually out of view, past more than 10 miles or so. The whole sighting was approximately 5 minutes. The location was the northwest suburbs of Las Vegas, close the mountains.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

Surprisingly, not only are the shapes of the these mysterious flying objects photographed off Tokyo and Florida very similar, but the ratio of the major axis to the minor axis is 1.80 to 1.00, which is exactly the same ratio.  The fact that they are in the same capsule shape and have the same ratio of major axis to minor axis is likely to be the same type of similar object.

In fact my first thought was that it was a missile and an “Oh shit!” came out of my mouth. When it got closer it suddenly turned up and to the right and flew away from us in a diagonal direction. It happened so fast my brain processed it as a near miss with another plane.  But there were never any reports about it.   And how could another plane turn away and miss us that fast?  I’ve thought about it over the years as something that didn’t make a lot of sense.  Until I recently saw a story about a “missile looking” UFO with a shiny silver tip sighting   Then it clicked.  That’s what I saw that day.  I was never a believer in UFO’s.  However I know what I saw.  And I do believe now  it may have been an actual UFO sighting.,2021-07-31T00:00:00,,

I was seeing ) now this isn’t my first time with crafts appearing around me and close so I remembered to get my phone out and start snapping pictures as fast as I could.

I finally asked my husband if he saw what I was seeing. He said yes and that he noticed it as far back as the Chesapeake House and it hadn’t moved since.  The closer we got to the object the more perplexed we were. This thing was a dark matte black with red marker lights on the corners and hovered about a 1000 feet off the ground. It seemed to be positioned just off shore of Aberdeen Proving Ground. The enormity of the object seemingly floating so low and effortlessly in the sky left us speechless. I am not exaggerating when I say this was roughly the size of a football field. It was a shaped like positioned flat and matte black in color with what looked like red marker lights in the corners. I tried to take a photos/video but nothing would appear in my view finder.  We decided to get off the nearest exit to get closer but we still couldn’t come up with a rational explanation for what we were seeing.  Once the sun had set it seemed to blend into the night sky. Shortly after we found ourselves at the gates to Aberdeen Proving Ground.  Aberdeen PG is known for research and had recently flown 2 observation balloons anchored by ropes for 2 to 3 months over the Dundalk just south of the APG near Essex. This was nothing like that. It never moved and hovered for easily 45 minutes with no signs of anything anchoring this to the ground to make it stay in place.  I searched the web for years to see if anyone else witnessed the object in the sky that night but haven’t seen a thing. It was so extraordinary it needs to be documented because if it wasn’t a UFO I’d love to know what it could’ve been. I hope that our experience helps trigger someone’s memory to remember theirs. I haven’t seen anything like it to this day. For something so large to make no sound and just float in the sky was incredible to say the least.,2021-05-20T00:00:00,,

I have observed many strange lights/objects in the sky since I moved into this area in 1996. Tonopah is about 40 miles west of downtown Phoenix. My children grew up here in Tonopah and have also witnessed many strange occurrences in our night skies.  I am not writing today to report a recent event. I was not aware there was such an entity as the UFO Center for reporting until I watched the documentary by Dr. Lynne Kitei called ‘Phoenix lights’.  I do not recall seeing this UFO, nor did my children report seeing this specific event, dated March 13, 1997.  What I am reporting today is the continual sightings around the Palo Verde area in general. From my observations the visits continue to be in the March and October timeline of the year, however, that’s not to say previous observations were not made during other months of the year.  Fact: Palo Verde down-powers one of the three power generating units to refuel and complete required maintenance every March/April and October/November on a permanent basis. Observation: Nuclear power would most likely be of great interest to other life forms outside our world.  If others worlds are observing earth, powering down and then powering up nuclear generators could attract their interest or attention.  I have never tracked or reported any of the 10+ sightings I have observed, at any time, in the past 25 years. I simply acknowledged that there are extraterrestrials and go about my life.  The last sighting for me was in March, 2020.  I have a direct view of Palo Verde from my backyard.  There is nothing but flat desert from my backyard to the corner where Palo Verde is situated about ten miles away.  At night, it looks like a city, all lit up and naturally, we look at it nightly.  One night, while sitting at the table with my husband, both of us looking out towards Palo Verde, three lights appear suddenly in our field of vision. They are directly above Palo Verde, high up in the sky.  I ask my husband if he see’s the lights – Yes. We both see the lights. There are three round lights in a triangle formation, each light equally distanced from the other.  We watch, we watch, perhaps watching for at least 5 minutes, when suddenly one of the lights just fade away.  So now there are only two lights, still equally distanced. We continue watching. We both have our phones, and with the camera’s, we take a couple pictures.  However, there is nothing on the picture that is identifiable. The lights are too far away to be captured on an I-phone camera, it’s just a speck in the background.  I grab the binoculars. Now I can clearly identify the lights in the sky. I observe halos of colors (amber, green, blue)  that surround each of the circles of light. The lights aren't moving. Not at all. They are stable and steady.  I give the binoculars to my husband, and he watches the lights.  There are still only two lights at this time.  Again, I look through the binoculars and as I am watching the lights, the third light slowly comes back and now I see three equally glowing lights again.  We continue to observe the lights until they disappeared suddenly from the sky. One minute they are there, the next gone, just disappeared.  However, we continue watching.  A minute or two later, the lights re-appear, but they have moved to a different position in the sky. They were directly in front of us last time, and this time they are to our right.  We continued to observe three round lights in a triangle formation, each light equally distanced from the other.  The whole observation was at least 10-15 minutes long.  Again, I saw what I saw, acknowledged that there is extraterrestrials and we both went about life, never reporting anything to anyone.  But one never fully forgets what we have observed in the Tonopah sky at night.  I have many of these stories, my kids have stories, I’m sure others here in Tonopah have seen ‘something’ as well.  What I can say today is that the very next time this type of phenomenon is observed in the Tonopah sky, I will be sure to report it on your web-site asap! If someone were interested in setting up a good camera in hopes of getting some video, I certainly have the place to do it!",2021-05-20T00:00:00,33.5778,-113.0234

It was extremely odd. I've never seen these kind of rockets on tv or heard reports of rockets launching from Mountain View, Santa Clara before. I think that one rocket may have split the earth into three dimensions by launching them and that's maybe what I witnessed.

There was a white sphere hovering over the ocean. Object could be seen from the beach in Isla Vista and from the hills in Santa Barbara. Was neither The Moon nor Venus.  Object was not a plane landing at Santa Barbara Airport either.  Object seemed to hover for about 40-45 minutes and then proceeded to enter the ocean quickly and abruptly.  There was a plane flying around over Isla Vista doing several loops for about 20 minutes when this object was in the air.  That pilot might have been aware of the object and extremely likely the pilot witnessed the bright white sphere hovering out over the ocean.  We could not judge distance or size of the object due to the black night sky other than we can say it was over the ocean.  There is video footage of the object taken from the hills of Santa Barbara.  Unfortunately the person filming did not take good footage and the clip is short and at times out of focus.  Very curious if an! ybody else saw this object.  I have yet to find any info or reports on the object.  I am versed in astronomy, physics, and have flown planes.  When first observation of the object, we suspected a helicopter or plane, yet the characteristic of the high degree of intensity of the white light and silence factored a more curious examination.  Watching the object fly into The Ocean convinced me it was indeed a UFO of some sort.  I have combed the Internet for any reports of the object.  The only thing found was a youtube video that left much to be desired.  So I am logging this report into the database.",2020-02-07T00:00:00,34.5021,-120.1287

We actually, after much debate on what it could be and all things being illogical, decided to hop in the car and see if we could get closer. (Yes, we literally became the people in the movies that you scream at “why would you do that???”) We were able to find the light on a backroad. It was weird because the light was so so bright and we were theoretically “closer” to it, but we really weren’t. The only way it wouldn’t be closer is if it moved (but I wasn’t thinking about it at the time) I have to admit, I got a little nervous. I honestly felt like the light has a “presence” to it. And it was a very unexpected feeling since up until that moment I stil! l felt like it could be a bright fog light or something. We then drove in another direction to try to see if we could get closer. And finally went home and the light was completely gone from view - when it literally lit up our whole room in the beginning.

I was admiring how clear of a night it was and looked Northeast towards Cassiopeia, and saw a bright light moving across the constellation. I first thought it was a plane, but planes don’t typically look like a bright star, and planes usually move in one straight line. This light moved fast, but there was a slight wiggle to the line it moved in. It moved in this wiggly line for about 15 seconds, before looking like it was absorbed or swallowed by the sky. Another thing that doesn’t usually happen to planes. My dog had a case of the ""zoomies"" (hyperactivity) when I was watching the object. Which is odd for my super mellow older small dog. Growing up in the country, I’m no stranger to stargazing and have never seen anything like it in my life. I immediately walked into the house and told my fiancé what had happened I was so shocked.

I was laying on the ground in my backyard looking at the stars when I saw a large boxed plus sign appear in the sky directly above me and begin moving very slowly until it disappeared about 5 seconds later. 	The object was about 8 times the size of a full moon. It looked metallically reflective but it was also see through because I could see the black night sky through it. Either that or the object was black, making it seem like I was looking through it to the night sky. Because it was either see through or black, the only reason I was able to see it was because the edges looked like they were reflecting light, possibly from the half moon which was nearby, on its right. It was not bright - the only reason it caught my attention was because it was huge and it was moving. Since it had no color and only reflective properties, it looked more like a distortion of the night sky rather than an object. The two rectangles that made up the plus sign shape were not the same size; one was longer, so more like a cross but the intersection was in the middle unlike the traditional Christian cross. It was perfectly symmetrical and made up of right angles. It looked very far up in the atmosphere which is what bothers me the most because something that was high in the atmosphere looking as large as it did would have to be absolutely enormous.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,29.87903129973475,-81.36659177718833

On Tuesday, August 10, 2021, at approximately 10:30 PM, my wife and I were taking a walk along North Myrtle Beach.  We were walking from the 500 block of South Ocean Blvd towards the 100 block.  While routinely looking into the sky, I spotted two objects that resembled birds drawn by every amateur artist on the planet.  My wife asked what I was looking at and I told her they were birds as they appeared to be hovering and gliding.  Shew said “There’s no way those are birds.  Birds wouldn’t be anywhere near that high”.  Initially the objects were in the sky to my left, over the land. They hovered overhead for 10-15 seconds and then slowly moved southwest over the beach and ocean.  At some point, I didn’t actually see it happen, because I didn’t think too much of the event at this point, they transitioned to a more vertical position, like a traditional airplane on takeoff.  However, the incline was much steeper, an approximate 70 degree angle.  The objects steadily, but quickly, rose to a very high altitude and then disappeared.  Not in the way an object will disappear from sight.  They just disappeared.  About a minute later, my wife and I witnessed lights in the shape of a gigantic obtuse triangle, with an area of approximately 6-8 full moons. The object was so large we, initially, thought they were three separate objects at first.  The lights blinked one after another in a left-to-right rotation.  After observing this a few times, we concluded it was one solid object as opposed to three separate entities, despite the fact that we could see nothing inside the massive area.  It was black as the night sky.  The object, which appeared to be relatively low in the sky, also appeared to move very down the beach in the same direction we were walking.  Although it was so large it may not have been moving at all.  After about a minute, there were a handful of very quick flashing (5-6 flashes in a second or two) small white lights at the side of the triangular object, closest to the100 block (Sorry I’m terrible with directions).  That was followed by 3-5 orange orbs, about the quarte! r size of a full moon.  My wife said “That’s what I saw earlier!” (when she was sitting on the balcony before our walk).  The orbs glowed for a few seconds each and then disappeared, as did the triangular shaped trio of blinking lights.  I was extremely excited and kept asking my wife, “What are we seeing right now?!”  I calmed down, however, when I saw a man and young teen boy approaching from the rear.  When they reached us, the man asked, “What was that?!”  I am a 49 year old man who has been a high school Social Studies teacher for 27 years. While I have believed in the possibility of extraterrestrial crafts visiting Earth, I have never seen anything before this event.  While not questioning what I saw, I do realize there are other explanations such as military tests, etc.",2021-10-19T00:00:00,33.83166,-78.65013

I was looking through my dad's photo album, circa early 1940's. On one page it had pictures of his dog, 4 different pictures. I just happened to look at the picture of his dog taken from the back patio area when I noticed this ""disc"" above the roof. All the pics in this photo book are in blk and white. This object was taken by some relative of the pet dog and I guess they never noticed this object just to the right of the chimney. Needless to say, all these years nobody has noticed this apperation or entity. It sure got some interest from friends and family. As far as I know my dad's mom and dad lived in a residential area of either Palto Alto or Redwood City, California when growing up. Other pictures of him show a uniform on him during World War II so I am thinking the time frame is between 1940 and 1942. When I first noticed this UFO I asked my wife to look at the picture and I  asked her ""What is wrong with this picture?"" She started looking at the picture and I told her to look on the roof and she noticed the UFO right away. After we both talked about it, I called my twin brother and my older brother and sent a picture to them via phone camera. They, my brothers, didn't really get all that excited when I told them, but when they got the actual picture it was a different story. I look many times at the picture daily and the best description I can give is that it reminds me of a Hershey's Kisses or a Frisbee without the rounded edges. At the very top, the area is darker than the rest of the object, like it is either a shadow or ??. It looks very much to me and other people to look like a typical UFO... Using the chimney and the roof make the object look small, but I am thinking that it might be bigger and further away. As I mentioned before, this is a residential area so other roofs maybe are the same size as my grandmothers house.  P.S. All the pictures in this old photo book are laminated and has helped keep a lot of the pictures safe from dirt and scratches.  I hope the above description will help in some way to figure out if this is real or something else.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,47.14574063670412,-122.2924202247191

Sunday nite I went to the store. I came back from hwy60 driving south on my road. When I got past our neighborhood entryway and almost to the first street, I started seeing bright red lights flying across the sky, ahead of me, flying east to west. It looked like red lights on planes. I saw several going by in a group. I thought it was probably a bunch of helicopters. Not flying high up like jets but above the tree line, maybe lower than planes, like helicopters. I have seen the sheriff flying 5 or 6 helicopters all together coming back from the south coming back to tampa a few times before. Like some kind of training trips. But the lights were bright red, and not blinking and no other lights anywhere else, just bright red ball of light. Not like a helicopter or plane has. But as I kept coming south, I saw more and more. At least 15 to 20. I knew it couldnt be planes or helicopters. And they werent in any pattern,  just bunches of red lights flying across the sky. Pretty fast. Not like a helicopter, and was going upwards not like a plane would be flying straight. They were pretty close to me, maybe within a mile. It was about 8:06pm  There was a man walking on the sidewalk with a little dog and he was just stopped, standing there looking at them. There was a truck behind me that kept going slower and finally stopped. I kept driving to my street and turned in east, toward my house. I was watching them continue to go by in a big spread out pattern. I got to my house and I had a fair view toward the south. I stopped and I found my phone and got to the camera and took a couple pictures. Then I tried to go to video but couldnt find the right button in the dark. So I just took a couple more pictures until they had all gone by.  The last ones went by. they were spread out. In my pics you can see 4 of them far away, high up in a straight pattern. Those would have been as far away as tampa or the bay by that distance.  My pictures were from  8:07 to 8:08pm when they had all gone by. My pictures show white lights but they were all bright red lights. One of my security cameras is pointed toward the 2 story house but it doesnt go up very high. And there is trees in front of it. But at 8:06 and 30 sec, there is a flash, like lightning, behind the trees. But there wasnt any clouds or lightning around. I think it may have been the large group of them maybe that caused the flash.  I called the tv stations, mcdill, tia. Only answers were, we havent heard any other reports. And channel 13 said it could be drones. Drones wouldnt be that big and have that bright of a light. Mcdill is a major AFB and has radar and look out all the time. These objects were headed straight toward mcdill, probably 12 or so miles from my location. Mcdill said there wasnt any military aircraft in the area, and then said you should contact ufo reporting center web site. They didnt confirm or deny they saw anything.",2021-10-19T00:00:00,27.911743440233238,-82.30077871720117

My dad is a petroleum engineer and I am a mechanical engineer. My grandfather and dad’s father was an electric engineer and did work on the Apollo Project in a contractor capacity.  There was a lull in the conversation about a range of subjects which did sometimes include space and UFO type mutual interests.

It remained visible for approximately 2 seconds and completely disappeared. We both said, “DID you see THAT!?” because it was such a clear and exciting thing to witness.

It was already at a quick speed by the time I initially viewed it. Traveling West to East, it was far brighter and faster than a satellite, and the same would hold true for an airplane.  It struck me as an odd time to launch a rocket, given how many people were blowing off fireworks that night, however, after watching filmed rocket launches several times this year while researching Spacex’s Starlink launches, Blue Origin, and Rocketlab launches, I felt like I was probably watching a night time rocket launch.  The only two or three peculiar things were that it was completely silent, although I could easily have been watching something that was 400 miles away, because of how light travels, and I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference; and it didn’t leave an exhaust plume.  However it was nighttime, and its absolutely possible that the exhaust plume wasn’t visible in the night sky, nor at a relative height to be able to reflect light off of the sun. Hell, if I could do the math, that probably wouldn’t even be an option.  Regardless, I watch the light zoom all the way across the horizon in about 90 seconds, saying to myself’ “What a treat, this is amazing!” The horizontal line of the t shape had become significantly stretched out, while the vertical line, from my position, stayed equal length to what it originally was.  It’s about to go behind the tree line, so I sprint from the back deck, through the house, and out the front door to hide behind the car and watch this weird light continue on its path across the horizon.  I’m scratching my head, when the light just stops moving abruptly. I watch it become enveloped by clouds, but it has an immensely striking lightness shining through the cloud. There were 3 or 4 visible stars in the initially cloudless, and now nearly entirely cloud-covered night sky.  Western Washington has very fast changing weather and variability in in vapor pressure, but what really struck me was how bright the still light was behind the clouds. Far brighter than the moon. So significantly brighter than the stars I really had to wonder about it.  I observe the abruptly still white light dim completely away, and then like how a lighthouse light becomes visible in the mist as it spins around back into view, the light went back to full luminosity in exactly the same still position, although this time with a red ring around it. Both of which eventually diminish into blank, dark nighttime sky.  At the bar a few days later, while discussing the bizarreness of the experience with the bartender, a young man of about 30-35 entered the conversation and told me he worked for a subsidiary of Raytheon, shooting 1-30 mHz waves into the clouds in order to gather data on encrypted messaging information, and told me his work schedule had been delayed by a series or prototypical rocket launches being carried out under Amazon’s Project Kuiper, from the Seattle area.  He believed I witness first stage booster separation, ignition of the second stage engine, and simultaneous  reignition of the first stage booster as it was landed back in the greater Seattle Area, giving greater possibility to why I watched the light stop midair, disappear, and then reappear with a red halo, then decrescendo into darkness.  Now, whether or not that is the answer, which I feel is on pretty slim evidence, given that launch schedules are planned out years in advance, and I couldn’t find any corroborating evidence to say that Project Kuiper has already done prototype launches, I still am holding out strong feelings for a government-related, man-made object to be the explation for this.  I’ve spent a significant amount of time researching orbital reentry as well, and although it doesn’t exhibit the typical characteristics of boosters or rockets breaking up on reentry, I did find info on possible entry times of a Chinese-based Long March rocket, CZ-2F that was predicted to re-enter above Washington state within 4 days of of my t-shaped light observation, with a plus or minus of 26 hours. However there were no reported sightings of the re-entry, so its possible it may have been slightly miscalculated.  I’ve also considered the possibility of it being a Navy-related government drone, given that I live within 5 miles of a nationally used Navy Base, although that would be one hell of a light they threw on that sucker.  I’ve sort of ruled out a really long lasting firework, given that I used to make the stars (the expanding or fast moving colored lights) that go inside or mortar fireworks. There are compounds like titanium or magnesium that can give that long lasting exhaust flare, but there is always a smoke trail to accompany it. And I’ve also never seen a firework trail last longer than about thirty seconds at the very max.  Your guess is as good as mine.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,47.92466490727532,-122.21939985734664

They were located just outside of the campground on soldier creek, facing due E-NE.

I was deep-sea fishing on a commercial boat off the coast of Virginia Beach in 2019. Things are - granted - fuzzy, as I was on some decently strong psychotropic medication at the time. Luckily, I had the foresight to snap a picture, which jogged my memory wholly in the recent days - being swept up by the UAP information being released. The incident stuck out in my mind due to recent news revealing that there's been a significant amount of sightings over the ocean.  When I say was fuzzy I do mean it. I was out on the boat for maybe anywhere from one to two hours, and I had downloaded some podcasts to listen to while out fishing. It felt as though in one moment there was nothing - and the next moment I looked up, there was an oddly vertical craft almost hovering above the water. The craft didn't seem to move strongly in any direction, almost hanging perfectly still directly in the center of my vision. As I mentioned before, I had the foresight to snap a photo. Just about everything around the photo is useful - except for the damn image itself. What was incredibly apparent was that the object was very large and decently far away. It was a clear as clear could be on that day, however, so there was absolutely zero mistaking it. The craft appears very blurry in the image, however, there's relevant detail that was automatically stored when I had taken the image due to the Google Photos app's data storage.  https://ibb.co/VWnNw16 --- Here is a link to the image, you can check it on whatever site you'd want, ibb is a site I use personally.  The shape of the object was hard to pin down. I've tried doing some googling for similar images in the recent weeks and there's only one I seem to keep coming back to for the most accurate comparison of what I saw in the sky.  https://ibb.co/dQPp7sw  Imagine if that craft was rotated ~45 degrees or so on its z axis. That's the closest thing I could describe it to. A pointy, vertically-oriented black craft hovering in the sky. Even in my haze, I had mentally ruled out the possibilities of it being a singular bird (too big) or a helicopter (no visible rotors or obvious means of propulsion). Do with this info what you will - as a rule of thumb I'm not particularly interested in any sort of publicity, even though you may do with the info what you see fit to. I was not particularly interested in showing it to anyone at the time out of fear of stigmatization and am still not very interested in having my name attached to it. The fact of the matter is, however, that this incident has stuck with me for years - and it should be seen by someone given the recent breakthroughs and some amateur research done by me that has pinned Virginia Beach as a ""ufo hotspot"" in recent years.",2021-07-31T00:00:00,36.837301342710994,-76.06194814578005

So I drive towards the light without GPS only following the Light. I drove for about 45 minutes. It turns out that the light was strawberry greenhouses. It was 3 AM I just arrived to this destination 302 Rue Water, Danville, QC J0A 1A0 only to take a brake. 1 minute before I arrived & stopped the car, I saw from my left side something bright appear in the sky making zigzag movements, so I started filming.

I started the car to try looking from another angle, and it was gone, or at least not bright anymore.

Observers: Myself (36yrs old) and my son (16yrs old)  Background of Observers: Both of us have no history of UFO sightings nor were we UFO/Alien believers prior to this occurrence. We have both been very hesitant to report as our experience didn't feel friendly, in fact, the best way to describe the feeling from this 'thing' would be ""purposefully intimidating"" and ""watchful"".  Sidenote: We have had another encounter with this 'thing' post our first experience and we have also had, what I can only describe as, ""energy encounters"" as well that all won't be listed in this sighting description.  *Sighting started January 1, 2020, just before midnight and went into January 2, 2020, after midnight.  Full Sighting Description: It was just before midnight on January 1, 2020, when my son and I came home. We parked in our reserved parking space at our condo which is located on the top floor (open to the sky) of a six-story building. We were sitting in our car talking for a while (I was actually giving him a lecture for something that happened earlier that evening) when he pointed out this star in the sky. We recognized it as Sirius as it was larger than most stars, brighter, and flashed rainbow colors. He noticed that it was moving to the left and then disappearing only to reappear in the exact same location a few minutes later. When it reappeared the last time (I'm guestimating we had been observing it for about 30 min or so) it started moving again, except, this time it was slightly moving up and down, right and left, etc. I know this sounds weird, but we both said to each other that it felt like it knew we were watching it and it was watching us back. That's when it star! ted moving to the left again, in the same pattern as before, but this time it didn't disappear, it just kept moving. This was when we started to feel very uneasy. At one point, as it was moving to the left, it passed right under an airplane/aircraft (not sure how close they were in reality, but from our perspective, they looked fairly close). The plane was an obvious aircraft because it had the typical blinking lights on the wingtips, etc. Well, as soon as this 'star thing' moved under the plane, it immediately mimicked the airplane - the blinking wingtip lights, red flashing lights and all. It was at this moment when we both kind of freaked, like, this star just turned into an airplane - that's impossible, right? We both jumped out of our car in order to look up and follow its path. As soon as it passed the plane, it turned into 3 orbs (I hate using that term but it's the best way to describe it), then went to 2 orbs and then back to one solid light orb and it was moving t! hrough the air almost as if it was swimming. It's very hard to! describ e but almost as if it was doing the butterfly stroke - it moved very smoothly, like gliding, but with smooth wave-like patterns. Also to note, at this point, it was not far up in the sky. I'd compare it to the height of a private plane or helicopter, maybe. Eventually, it moved almost completely parallel to the rooftop (which was at a higher point than us as there are stairs from the parking rooftop that go up to the tennis courts and outdoor lounge area). So, to not lose track of it, we both darted across the parking deck and ran up the stairs to the tennis court. We still had it in our sight when it took a complete 90-degree turn in our direction. We weren't even talking to each other, it was absolutely freezing cold outside and terribly windy and we were just fixated on it. It was both scary and fascinating. It was like you couldn't take your eyes off of it. We're watching it go over us when it suddenly stops in place (above us, yet, in front of us) and a bright light com! es on and shines right at us and it's just hovering - no sound at all. The light was incredibly bright. Almost like a police spotlight that they shine in your back window if you get pulled over at night, but larger. It was completely blinding. I felt like it was trying to intimidate us. I completely freaked out and grabbed my son's jacket to get him to run away, but he didn't move at first. Then I literally yelled at him to ""f****** run"" (sorry for the language) and he snapped out of it and ran with me back down the stairs and into the car. We immediately took off down the parking deck while both yelling ""What the hell was that!"" We were both freaking out the whole way down while trying to confirm with each other what we both had just witnessed. We didn't even know where we were driving to but we knew we wanted to get far away from that location. At the time, I had been checking on a friend's dog while they were on vacation, so I decided that we would he! ad over to their house and just stay there for the evening. Th! e house was approximately 3 miles away. As soon as we took a right turn to the road their house is off of, a low flying aircraft was hovering tree-top level. It was the shape of a triangle with no base, but lights underneath. What's interesting is that I heard no noise, but my son says he heard a helicopter-like sound. I have no clue how we both were there and heard two different things. It felt like it was anticipating us turning onto that street as if it was waiting for us. That's when I completely lost it and started crying out of fear. We sped under it and kept driving and there was this overwhelming bad feeling/energy that was so thick in the air (it's so hard to explain). I felt like something bad was going to happen to us but I didn't know what. It felt like we were being stalked, watched, not wanted, and threatened. We kept driving (never stopping at my friend's house) and we had no clue where we were driving, just getting away. We drove to the main road and I recalled a hot! el that I figured we could park at as it's open 24 hours therefore it felt safer. This hotel was about another 2+ miles down the road. As soon as we made a right turn into the hotel parking lot, we both saw it at the same time and I stopped my car in place. There was a figure in the hallway window on the 5th floor of the hotel, just standing still with its arms in its pockets, facing us - completely unmoving. Please take note, that this is a hotel that's solely stayed at by business persons. It's an extremely quiet neighborhood, the hotel had maybe 1/3 occupancy as there were very few cars in the parking lot. The window that this thing was standing at faced absolutely nothing but this semi-empty parking lot. There is no site to see outside that hallway window, nor would I guess anyone could see much of the dark outside parking lot through the window with all the bright lights on in the hallways of this hotel. My son did snap a photo of this thing in the window from his iPho! ne that I will forward via email. We were probably stopped the! re for a bout 30 seconds just staring and the most awful feeling of dread came over the both of us. I literally felt the blood draining from my face. I have never been so scared in my life. We zoomed out of the parking lot and got to the left turn light at the intersection we turned around to see if it was still in the window and it turned facing its left (which we went back to that hotel days later to see what would have been on the thing's left side and it's just a wall). We take that left onto the main road again, now driving toward the nearest gas station when that same aircraft passes over us again. We pulled into the gas station and I immediately called my sister (who didn't pick up the phone) then I called my parents (who were both well into their sleep at this time) and told them everything that had just happened because we really thought something was going to happen to us that night and we wanted someone to know. My dad suggested going to a 24-hour diner (since we did not w! ant to go back to our house nor would we have been able to sleep) so I looked one up that was closest to us and we headed straight there – never been to this diner before, it’s called Landmark Diner in Buckhead. After we arrived, we were handed menus and at the top of the menu, they have a big tagline that says, “Where The Stars Meet At Night” – Could this be a coincidence? Sure, but what are the odds? Then when my son went to use the restroom he came out and asked me to come into the men’s bathroom to see the light. There were several recessed light fixtures in the ceiling and they were all white except one that was flashing every color of the rainbow. I went and asked the manager why they had one light in the bathroom that flashes different colors and he asked me to show him. I did, and he said he never noticed that before and that maybe it needed to be replaced and was about to die (I have iPhone video footage of this light in the bathroom as well that I will forward ove! r via email). I was talking to my son at the diner and I was t! elling h im how weird this was as I had just seen this triangle-shaped craft in the clouds earlier that day when I was walking the dog. He asked me to describe it, I did and told him it was on the side grass entrance to the Whole Foods parking lot in Chamblee. He thought it was weird and crazy but we kept talking about everything else that had just taken place that night so it stayed more of a random coincidence-style 'side note' part of the conversation. The evening ended with us sleeping in our car in a 24-hour McDonald's parking lot for the following 2 nights because we didn’t want to go back to where we first witnessed this thing. That's how very real this was.  Now jump forward around 6 months after this event took place... We seldom talk about it, not because it's not interesting but because there's nothing much to ever get out of the conversation - we're always left with unanswered questions so it becomes redundant to mull it over again and again. But this evening, we were both home and talking about something entirely different in the living room, when suddenly he relates something to the triangle thing I had mentioned back on Jan 2, that I had seen while walking the dog. I go to explain to him how weird it was and the details (it was huge and literally in the clouds but very visible) when he asked me, ""Nobody else saw it?"" I was thinking for a moment, and I was like, ""No, I guess not. Maybe? I wasn't really looking around though."" Then he asked me what dog I was walking over by the Whole Foods area. That was when we both kind of blankly stared at each other and we realized it at the same time. I don't know w! hy I would be walking ANY dog over by the Whole Foods location. That's a mile and a half down the road from us. I also don't remember what dog I was walking. I can't remember the exact time it took place or the most obvious part - why anyone wouldn't have seen this humongous flying triangle object in the clouds hovering over the parking lot. It couldn't have taken place. Period. And why did we not realize how ridiculous that was when I told him that same story that evening at the diner? Why did it take us 6 months to realize this is an impossibility? I can't even recall that entire day up until the point I picked up my son and we drove home and saw this thing. Now that I know my memory couldn't have happened, I don't know what to make of what I actually did do that day. We were both sitting there just kind of stunned and confused by the whole thing when our dog (an 80lb Rhodesian/Mastiff mix starts physically shaking and pacing back and forth whining. We got that overwhelmi! ng fearful feeling again just as we did the night of Jan 2nd, ! literall y goosebumps all over both of us. We're trying to tell my dog ""It's ok"" and figure out what's wrong when he gets on top of the couch literally balances himself on the very top, where you rest your head, and is shaking uncontrollably and refuses to get down. We've since had many blinking light issues, no just in our home, but many friends and family homes, in the car, etc. The light thing seems to be a semi-regular occurrence. The weird wave of energy that we will get at the exact same time that is absolutely identical to the energy that thing in the sky gave has happened about a handful of times over the last year and a half. There's a couple of other short instances when this has taken place that I won't go into more detail about at this time as this is already a very long description. I would be very interested to speak with someone who knows about these things. We both would be 100% willing to take lie detector tests, etc.",2021-07-31T00:00:00,,

On May 20, 2021, I was going home with my friend and my grandkids. Through the windshield, I noticed what I thought was a falling star. It was very bright, moving diagonally downward at a fast speed, and had a long sparking trail. It was so awesome, I brought it to the attention of the others in the car. I even started to tell my granddaughter to make a wish, but instead practically yelled, “look at that! Are y’all seeing this?”, because it was growing so bright. I thought sure it was about to burn out, and told my friend to stop the car so we wouldn’t lose view of it. Within a split second of them acknowledging they saw it, the object stopped moving; which we all noted was not something a meteorite/falling star does. It, basically, hovered in the air. At that point, it began to increase in size and brightness. It grew in size and brightness, for at least 15-30 seconds before blanking out. But, as we slowly proceeded on, we saw something moving back from the! point of vanish toward the direction the bright object had come from. This object looked like tilted plane wings, of sorts. There was 2 faint lights...one yellowish just below and to the left of a red one, on an oblong silhouette. There was no true outline of anything, such as an airplane, but the span between the lights was far too wide for a drone. I’d say, at least 30 feet. Going by the height of the adult trees in the area, it was well over 150 feet up. I don’t know if it made any sound, because we never shut off our car. It appeared to stop again, in the distance, but the others in the car refused to stay so that I could watch longer.",2021-07-31T00:00:00,37.0952,-88.0722

I took 2 videos-VIDEO 1 was a minute long and VIDEO 2 was a 2 second video that I must have taken by accident. I adjusted brightness contrast on the 1 minute video to get a better idea as to how much the light orb had moved in relation to the background and what I saw definitely seemed odd. I sent the 1 minute video to my boyfriend who was a few miles away picking up his son from daycare. He responded with a video of his own (VIDEO 3) saying he just saw the same thing 30 minutes after I saw it. In his video, he shined a flashlight at it. In response, the light quickly rose in the sky until it was almost directly over his head. At that point, he got back in his car and left. The orb must have been closer to him than me because we compared sizes and what he saw was about 5 times lar! ger than what I saw.

Doubtful it was a bug since it was almost the end of November in the northeast. Also, I didn’t see this until I watched the video - The appearance of a second orb above the first ** the light orb had some similarities to the star Sirius but it couldn’t have been Sirius because it moved from one location to another and because Sirius didn’t rise above the horizon until after 10pm (5 hours after the video was taken). I confirmed that through an interactive sky chart on skyandtelescope.org. In fact, there were no planets and no other significant stars in my viewing area at that time.

One stopped directly above us and I got a very good look at it. Its outside moved like a bubble would if it was too big. They were somewhat clear. Almost opaque and they had a cylindrical light in the middle of them. All three were illuminated red like a cars break lights from the inside of them. Id say their size was like a large bean bag chair or that they could fit inside a car if all the seats were removed. We thought they were drones as they approached but it became clear, even for my newly 5 year old daughter that they won't. The light inside of one of them quickly dimmed out and it shot up in the air while still keeping pace with the other two. I'd estimate they were 300 ft. and closing at that time. The sheer odd movement and the fact that they were coming right for us triggered my daughter to become hysterical. I picked her up and we both looked up just as one of the two stopped directly above us. I never lost track of the one that dimmed out and went up. We live in downtown Suffolk, VA and everything was well lit by the street lights and it didn't travel so far up to not be seen. Id say, that as my daughter started crying, it was as if they noticed us all of a sudden. I was like they immediately reacted to us reacting to them. The one that went high came back down a lot faster then it went up, which was crazy fast to begin with. And as it made it to the one that stopped ! above us it never did. only slowing a bit then they both flew and caught up with the third one that only slowed down during the whole encounter. The wind was fairly strong that day and constant for the most part. these things were moving at 90 degrees or more to the wind. My daughter was restless from being inside all day and due to the lock down we didn't go out all that much. I figured we could take a walk to go to our mail box on the other side of the building to burn some energy. It fits my luck in life that I'd end up leaving my cell phone in the apartment. I'm fairly sure we didn't lose time or anything like that. It just seemed like they were curious. And IDK? Maybe there's a alien photograph on another planet of me and my daughter looking up that night. Always makes me think. Also. I think someone else saw it. after they flew off I continued walking around the corner of our building and saw a lady that was stopped in the intersection returning to her car from the direction they went, looking at her phone like she took a picture as she got in. I remember her passing us as it was stopped overhead and we were right close to the street. They too were probably 70 to 100 feet up, so I figure that whoever that was also had to see everything.",2021-05-20T00:00:00,36.76886476190476,-76.5462461904762

Not to mention it was too early to start seeing any of those stars. The object was as bright as Venus would be at that time of day, but it was moving in a south westerly direction. The movements of the object were slightly erratic and it appeared to speed up and slow down. After watching this object for a couple minutes, I concluded it was not a plant, star, or satellite, so I hastily set up my Celestron telescope and was able to view the object for about 10 seconds before it disappeared. The object had an orange hue, was roughly cigar shaped and one end darker than the other. The interesting part is that there was another, much smaller object moving with the main object. The smaller object was circular in shape and had the same orange hue. Here is the interesting part... The objects were connected. I could see w! hat appeared to be a rigid rod connecting the two objects, the smaller object was definitely tethered to the larger object. The rod shaped object had the same orange hue. How they moved together is what blew my mind. The larger object controlled the smaller object in a manner much like a person would do if they were walking and playing with a yo-yo at the same time. Specifically, the smaller object appeared to swing forward and alongside the larger object, in an arc, until it was in front. As soon as the smaller object reached the front, it would start swinging backward, following the same arc until it was behind the larger object. As soon as it reached the back, it would swing back forward. Another way to illustrate  this motion is that it was like how pendulum swings relative to the clock face on a grandfather clock, but with an arc of 180 degrees instead of 20 or 30 degrees. I watched this cycle for several iterations before it disappeared. I wish I had a camera connecte! d to my telescope because this would have been amazing footage! .

On the night of October 15th, 2020, my dad and I witnessed a UAP near Kennedy Meadows Campground in Pearsonville, California. We were car camping and had setup for a brief overnight stay in Kennedy Meadows Campground. The campground was empty except for us and one other camper that went to bed early. At approximately 10:00pm, I was looking north-east towards the nearest mountain (approximately 0.3-0.8 miles away) when I saw a solid ball of white light rise seemingly through (or behind) the trees on top of the ridge. I called my dad over to watch it with me. Initially, I suspected it was a hiker flying some kind of drone, or maybe some sort of governmental drone doing nighttime surveying. However, we proceeded to watch the object maneuver over the ridge for approximately 2.5 hours. I do not know of any drones capable of hovering and maneuvering for at least 2.5 hours. For the duration we observed, the object appeared as a steady white light, never once blinki! ng or changing color. It would hover, then move in what looked like semi-random directions, only to hover once more. At one point while observing, the object continued to rise up in altitude at least 500-1000 feet over the ridge, then it slowly descended to 100+ feet over the ridge.  Around 12:30am, we were so tired we decided to stop watching, especially since we'd run out of ideas for things it could be. Thoroughly fascinated and simultaneously unsettled, we went to bed. I am unsure at what point the object left. No matter the case, there was no trace of it over the ridge in the morning.  Due to the remoteness of the area we were camping paired with the lateness of the hour, proximity to our campsite (we would have heard a plane or helicopter), flight duration, and flight capabilities, I have been unable to draw any conclusions as to what the UAP might have been. I considered a balloon with a light, but it's ability to hover consistently and move in random directions did not remind me of how I have ever seen a balloon move in the sky.

I was talking to another Security Guard from a different company about the astronomical objects in the sky. I work Property Security, he works Event Security.  I am an Amatuer Astronomer since the 1990's. We were talking about the night sky and his phone app when I noticed something moving in the sky. I could not tell what it was, in fact I could not see what it was... BUT it was moving. It was the exact color of the night sky.  The light pollution was such that I could not discern stars around the object. The object was gliding at a very smooth, slow, straight, and silent pace.  There were no lights on it at all. It was obvious, this craft did not want to be seen at all.  It was definitely stealth... and most likely cloaked. I pointed up to alert the other Security Guard...  ""Can you see that?"" I asked enthusiastically. He noticed it also. We could see something that could not be seen.  What could be seen was a thin chevron shaped cloud illuminated by moonlight along the leading edge of the craft.  The other guard thought looked like a line (180 degrees), whereas I thought it had a slight bend to it similar to a boomerang (Perhaps 170 degrees).  I saw the object for almost 40 seconds before it disappeared into the skyglow of the city south of us, Greensboro. He probably saw it for about 25 seconds. The other Guard stated it best... ""It had no mass.""  We saw it, though it couldn't be seen. I think technically, what we actually saw was the environment being impacted by the objects' presence.

T + 00:11:44, after launch) numerous UAP’s were entering and exiting the video frame. The Crew Capsule at this time was travelling at 27,343 KM/HR at an altitude of 206 KM, as noted on the video. At this speed, the distance between the Crew Capsule and the 2nd stage booster rocket was increasing at an approximate rate of 7.59 KM/Sec (or 4.72 Miles/Sec). This rate of Distance/Time is more than adequate to allow for the immediate appearance of the UAP’s within a split second after stage 2 separation occurred. Tonight, I began to scrub the video footage to better view the streaks of light and see if they could further be identified. Within the one second interval of T + 00:12:29, after launch, I was able to capture a single frame which clearly and distinctly shows the streak of light to be a discernable craft. It is worth noting, Space X announced they would be showing the view from the nose cone of the Crew Capsule, called the Dragon Cupola (observation dome) providing “incredible views of space” a “360 view”. Minutes later, after this visible flurry of UAP’s, the Space X reporters told the audience at T + 00:20:11, after launch, that technical difficulties were preventing them from showing us that “live view”. Shortly thereafter, they then ended the broadcast.",2021-10-19T00:00:00,,

The formation was by no means sloppy but I did notice it was somewhat fluid, as the objects did not remain perfectly equidistant among themselves in the “V” flight pattern, as say a precision team of fighter pilots at an air show would, nor did they maintain perfect symmetry in the two individual leading lines of the “v” formation, as a few individual members of the formation drifted ever so slightly ahead of their flanks. This fluidity made it obvious that what we witnessed was not one large “V” shaped craft with 20 to 25 lights, but indeed a formation composed of 20 to 25 individual members. Their appearance and passing was completely and utterly silent. The event occurred approximately 2 hours after a fairly low tide and the night was still, ! so there was no crashing surf nor wind, and therefore no ambient natural sounds to drown out the sounds of jet engines or sonic booms - - this event, and these objects, were completely silent.  The objects flew along the coastline north to south. From our vantage point on the cliff I’d estimate their path approximately 45 to 50 degrees above the horizon. They appeared as bright points of light, brighter than any star in the sky at their closest proximity to our position. They came as dim points of light from the north, grew amazingly bright on near approach, and dimmed fairly quickly after passing, maintaining a steady high altitude throughout...they dimmed to nothingness at altitude, not disappearing behind tree line nor mountaintop...therefore I’m thinking they surely must have been traversing at least in the upper atmosphere, perhaps at near-earth satellite altitude. The event took place in 20 seconds, no more than 30. Their speed? Impressive, is all I can say.  My first thought was that what we witnessed was a SpaceX satellite array. But after some Googling I’m not sure:  Satellite arrays appear to travel in single file...it appears I’m going to need a little more research!

They were about a minute apart, maybe a minute and a half. I wondered what the military was up to at midnight, but I didn't know there would be so many, so I didn't go and get my phone camera, darn!  Some had 6 white lights, front, two on the sides, and three in back making a perfect triangle.  They barely made a sound. After they left, I saw an airplane going more east to west.  It was a red blinking dot in the sky.  (MUFON CMS)",2021-03-02T00:00:00,39.9583,-85.9988

It immured a white light from the entire object all what would be considered its 6 sides (top, bottom, left side, right side, front and back) it also made no noise what so ever and was heading north. The city of surprise sits about a thousand feet higher in elevation to the entire phoenix valley and surrounding suburbs so you can see the entire valley and sky for over 100 miles. I’m located near a air force base and see Air Force jets daily and nightly flying around the area and towards the valley and because you can see the entire valley and the skies above it you can also see the commercial airliners who get in line! for landing and after take off that takes place to the east of me approximately 15-20 miles and living out here the last 17 years it’s very easy to identify both the commercial planes along with the air force jets. The craft I saw looked nothing like any of the commercial or Air Force planes I’ve ever seen as this object omitted a glow around the entire object and spinning so you could see the long side of it and the smaller side as it rotated and again omitted a glow from all 4 sides of it. It was in the shape of a tictac or cigar shape where it was long on the sides and half the length on the other two sides and appeared to be completely rounded on all the corners. It also made no noise what so ever and living here for 17 years you know when the planes are out because you hear them before you see them always. It was traveling North and that made no sense as NO aircraft that I have ever witnessed has traveled North from where this object was sighted, you will see the jets! fly east and then turn north for a brief moment to start head! ing west towards the base again but this object was way to far west and way to high up to be a jet and again it looked nothing like them what so ever. The object continued north for approximately one minute and twenty seconds I recorded it and have the film of the object at which point I lost sight of it due to the roof of the house so I immediately went out front to see continue to recorded the object as it headed North however it was gone and had completely disappeared after that, I stayed out front and looked for the object for over 15 min with no sign of it. This object caught my attention because of its glow and the way it was spinning, when both commercial planes and air force jets are in the air they are dark and often look black against the blue sky and especially against a white/light grey sky like it was that day and this object was the complete opposite. I’m a avid sky watcher and this is the first time I’ve ever seen a UAP or an object that I couldn’t say was either the ! Air Force jets or a commercial airliner or even a small personal aircraft this object looked nothing like anything I’ve ever seen before.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,33.63271552511416,-112.37252283105023

Object spotted above our property - south of the town of Westcliffe Colorado,  around Jan 2nd, 2021 (guess could've been 3rd).  I was using binoculars staring straight up at somewhere near the milky way, probably midnight or later.  A blue circular object enlarged toward me (apparently) and slowly rotated with two whitish outwardly opposed arms in a short spiral shape.  It had to be quite high since I was focused towards the milky way, and it was perhaps only visible with binoculars.  I could only think, wow, an angel.  But my technical mind thought more like it was a satellite maneuver captured from below?  But the intensity of the blue circular color seemed to be too bright to be a thruster of some kind.  I was for a time looking into the possibility that it was a high altitude test of water release into the upper atmosphere, but it was too clean of a circle.  Then I considered Electric Hall Sensor thrusters, which look blue and circular when 'burning'. But I was wrong again, since the size would have been way too large for that kind of thruster.  (when considering the distance this thing was viewed at).  I have yet to find any clue if it was man made, or some kind of supernova?  It was only visible for a short time (less than minute?), then appeared to almost rotate out of view - to me it may have been a cone shape, only by the way it disappeared through the binoculars - but that's a guess.  (As in looking into a cone's large end and then rotating the cone to the side - virtually disappearing from view). But this was bright and blue with what looked like a round core object centered inside.  There were lines projecting outward from this core.  I could only draw an image of it.

I am a 23 year old Father of 1 and stepfather of 1 with my lovely GF. My employment history is spotty, so in my free time I study greatly on medical uses of drugs, ufology and the registered close encounters, crimes/detective work and so forth. At the time of this incident I was returning from a friends house located 15-20minutes from where I live. At the time of this incident I was alone and seen no other drivers on the road. It gets dark very fast here in the winter but you could make out every single star and constellation with ease this night. No cloud. No tree lines as my hometown is surrounded by cornfields. I’m very familiar with planes, what they look like at night, and sound like due to living only a 20minute drive (max) from Grissom Air Force Base all my life. This was no plane or anything of human made origin.  The singular object was very bright orange (with a hint of blue-ish white in the middle) ball of light that sat in the sky. I first noticed it after going from a 4-way stop.  Half way through my drive home. I paid no attention at first, thinking it was someone flying a drone nearby or was just a bright star. I continued my drive and realized the object was keeping pace in front of me but was at a great distance away, easily 500-600ft away and had an elevation of around 8-10,000ft. I then slowed my speed 55mph to 30mph (no other cars around on the road) so I could get a better look at what I was seeing. The object then seemed to rotate, which I then seen the blue-ish white color in the middle. This is about 5-6minutes into seeing the object, time seemed like it was at standstill. I felt like I was being watched. I continue driving but keeping my eye on the object. After I got back up to 55mph and only a few minutes away from home, I seen the ball of light jolt itself to the r! ight of about 35ft. Stop. Jolt upwards of I’d say 50-100ft. The blue-ish white in the middle became slightly bright, then the object launched itself upwards and disappear, faster than I ever seen anything go in my life. No sound. No booms from the fast speeds. I finished my journey home and instantly told my Girlfriend about it. I grabbed our binoculars to try and see if I could locate the object and seen nothing but stars.  To this day I am for certain I did not see a plane or human made craft, but something truly otherworldly.",2021-05-20T00:00:00,40.7631,-86.0918

We saw at least 15 lights in a linear formation travelling North and then they disappeared. The man said the lights appeared just before 10 the first time where he counted about 18 lights. About an hour and a half later the lights appeared again when we were present. The man said there must of been about 50 lights but he lost count because they were going by so fast.

No sound and slow moving. On March 25th 2021 at 9:50 pm I was sitting in my car at the Olalla Beach in Washinton State on the phone with a friend.  Suddenly above my car appeared a large UFO.  It was black with lights all over it with no markings, there was no sound and it just hovered over the front of my car for about 15 seconds about 30 feet in the air.    I can only describe it like a peice of black tourmaline, abstract and mostly recangular but resembled a crystal rock shape and not like anything I have ever encountered before.  I would say it was aproximately the size of a semi truck.  I opened my car door and got out to take a photo.  I was in awe, I had to just observe it for a few more seconds.  It began to move very very slowly towards the Saratoga Passage then up and over the Olalla bridge.  Still no sound and slow movement with lights flashing all over the object.  I tried to take photos while it was above me however my cell wouldn't work at the moment.

It dispersed into orange round lights and continued to fly off to the left with no sound at a snails pace.  After going to the site today I took a panorama of the area and realised that it flew right through the power lines hanging above the Olalla Bridge.

I was on a family trip and my young child was riding in the rear of my car.  We had stayed the previous night in a hotel in the town of Hawthorne Nevada.  My child awoke early so we were on the highway earlier than normal.  As we entered the outskirts of Luning Nevada heading south I could see a large amount of red and blue lights coming northbound heading in my direction. It appeared to me that law enforcement was quickly approaching and due to having my child with me I looked for a safe area to park off the highway.  At the intersection of Hwy 95 and State Route 361 (it heads north east to Gabbs Nevada) I saw a wide dirt/gravel shoulder and safe pullout onto 361. I safely parked my vehicle at this location.  I then turned to my child in the rear seat and said to watch as all the police will be passing us by.  It was at this time that the first of approx. 8 to 10 marked blue in color Nevada State Troopers patrol vehicles pulled directly next to my drivers side door of my car.  I rolled down my window and in a polite yet stern tone the trooper stated ""You need to move your vehicle right now.  You need to make a u-turn and park on the other side of the road. Thats where they are going"".  At first I was completely surprised.  I apologized to him and told him with my child in my car I was only looking for a safe place to park out of the way.  He stated ""That's fine but move your car and make a u-turn right now"".  I did as he stated and made a u-turn to the opposite shoulder of Route 361 and my car was now parked facing more west and looking at Hwy 95.  At this time I realized the Nevads State Troopers had closed all north and south bound traffic on Hwy 95 at the junction of 95 and 361. Also at this time 2 different Nevada State Troopers parked their vehicles almost mirror to mirror to the drivers side of my vehicle effectively blocking my exit from my vehicle.  I was again surprised by the amount of law enforcement and their clear and coordinated efforts to shut down the hwys  and I must admit I was intimidated.  At this time I then viewed what appeared to be a light green military type truck with what I can only describe as ""camo"" wearing armed military personnel coming north off Hwy 95 and then taking Route 361 north east.  My child then said ""hey dad army guys!"".  We could see the vehicle passing through the windows of the Nevada State Trooper patrol vehicles next to us.  I then observed a large white diesel truck with no markings other then some numbers in black across the bottom below the doors.  The man driving appeared to be wearing a tan shirt but I did not see a uniform on him. He was slowly negotiating a wide turn from Hwy 95 onto Route 361 and he was pulling a flat bed trailer.  It was at this time that the shock of my life took place.  On the flat bed trailer, under tight black tarping, strapped with trucker bed straps was only what I can call a ""UFO"".  As I was processing what I was witnessing my child stated ""Look Dad a UFO!  I can fit in that!"".  I was in total shock, my heart was beating so fast all I could say back was ""thats a UFO!! Thats what people see!! Thats a UFO!!"".  It was clear and obvious it was some type of aerial craft.  At this time I briefly considered grabbing my cell phone to get a photo but I was intimidated by the 2 Nevada State Troopers parked so close to my vehicle I could not even get out.  And both had all eyes on me and my actions. With my child in the vehicle I decided not to risk being detained by them.  The white diesel truck and flatbed rounded the corner and went north east on Route 361 towards Gabbs Nevada.  My whole viewing of the craft lasted maybe 90 seconds to 2 minutes as they were driving very1 slow and making the turn from one hwy to the next took some coordination.  My best description of the craft is as follows:  Domed/Saucer shaped in the middle, triangle wings but each of the 3 triangle wings are blunted or flat on the ends.  This was clear as the black tarps were not loose on the craft but tightly wrapped making the form surprising visible.  I would guess the craft height from bottom on the flat bed trailer to the top of the middle dome/saucer to be between 4 and 5 feet in height.  The wing span from tip to tip I guess between 25 to 30 feet.  The edges of it were hanging off the sides of the flatbed trailer considerably.  The convoy of Nevada State Troopers continued in front of and behind the military transport of this craft.  As they proceeded north east on Route 361 the last of the troopers reopened Hwy 95.  A final officer was kind enough to pull along the side of our vehicle, smile at my son, wave and give a thumbs up.  Almost a way of acknowledging what we had witnessed.  I remained speechless, heart racing and in total shock.  I considered if it had been a military drone but if it was it was the largest I had ever seen.  And why such a law enforcement and military presence with this craft if it was only a drone?  I then drove onto Hwy 95 southbound and went just a mile or so up to the rest stop in Luning.  There I met half a dozen other travelers who had been stopped on Hwy 95 by the troopers as I had been on Route 361. They to were also in shock and asked if we to had seen the ""UFO"". All agreed we were in the right place at the right time but no one knew who we could report it to.  While using the restrooms at the rest stop and still in shock a older Hispanic Male in a truck stopped.  I noticed he had Nevada license plates.  He asked if we had seen the ""UFO"". I stated we had.  He said that was what people report as a UFO but that the military had them (the craft) and test flies them out of the Tonopah Test Range (south and east of our location). He then stated ""the scuttle butt from the contractors is they are moving them (the craft) to a new underground base outside Gabbs"". I asked how he knew this and he stated he lived outside Tonopah and knew ""contractors"" who worked at the test range.  That is essentially my story. My child and 6 to 8 other motorists were also witness to this event.  This last part is MY OPINION.  I would like to end my report by stating that after reflecting the last few weeks on this incident I fully feel what we witnessed was not a craft made by aliens. But a craft designed or copied from such technology and built by the United States Military. Its small interior size means it is either unmanned or manned by one small person laying flat or possibly sitting inside. Unfortunately due to the tarps I could not see any of the color or possible materials it was made or composed of.  I now know for fact the United States Military has craft ""unknown"" to us and if witnessed (especially at night) by the public all would report this craft and others like it as a ""UFO"".  Strangely I also now have a renewed faith and respect for the United States Military after this incident. Clearly they are way more advanced in their aircraft technology then they will ever admit. The deserts of  middle Nevada clearly still have the answers.",2021-05-20T00:00:00,,

It looked exactly as it did the day 3 weeks before, with the the sun reflecting brightly on its top side. The material looked like a brushed nickel finish .

They both just stood there, silent, hovering.  I watched as a couple of airplanes flew by in the distance above and below these objects. I pulled out my camera and the circle object disappeared.  I put my camera down and the circle object reappeared to the right of the cigar. I managed to film a little bit of it on my cellphone.  The round object would disappear, then the cigar shaped object disappeared. I put my camera down and they reappeared. It lasted for about a half hour before both disappeared.  I did a search on the internet to see if anyone else saw what I saw and found an old report almost exactly a year ago in the same city of a sighting in Concordville with a round  and a cigar shaped object.  I am a paralegal and this is the third sighting that I've reported to Nuforc.  I do not know what it is, but I am curious and fascinated and just want to know what it is!

The object was tiny and I couldn't discern it's shape other than triangle looking with a red light on it. It came from due west and curved toward north. There were some high clouds at the time and the object was above them flying extremely rapidly, leaving a contrail. We both felt kind of nervous because of the issues with Iran and wondered if we had seen a missile launch. We live in a flyway for different military aircraft, police, traffic enforcement radar, first responders, fire fighting craft, news helicopters, commercial flights, private aircraft, and so on, in a north-south pattern mostly.  We've seen a number of rocket launches come from Vandenberg AFB, where you can see the fan like spray of the rocket's contrail and watch it move across the sky.  They move from north-west to south. This was also very ! different than other aircraft or rockets we've seen, not only because of the direction it traveled, but due to the speed in which it was moving. I can watch a jet, up at cruising speed and likely around 36,000 feet, move across the sky from horizon to horizon in about 3 minutes. This craft went across our field of vision, and just before it reached the eastern horizon, it traveled up and out of sight, taking less than a minute.

As I was sitting on the porch step, I saw what seemed to be a reflection in my eye up and to the left of the top of one of our tallest cedars. This tree is directly in front of the driveway when you look toward the road. I could make out a tiny object slowing moving to the right. I could see sunlight glinting off of it.  While watching it, I noticed another flash and looking in the sky on the other side of the tree, a little higher up, I saw another shiny object in the sky, not moving. Several minutes passed and then I saw that the first object had now moved in the sky to the right of the tree and was below and to the left of the other. At this point neither object was moving. I could see the sun reflecting off both of them. In appearance they reminded me of stars in the night sky, except they weren’t twinkling. I really couldn’t make out a shape. After several minutes they still had not moved, so I asked my husband to take a look. He spotted them quickly and agreed that they were not moving.  We watched them for around 20 minutes more and he agreed they looked metallic because of the sunlight reflecting. The object on the left was brighter. I don’t know of any commercial craft that fly that high; or, at least, when I have seen aircraft at an extreme altitude I can identify them.  We were unable to identify what they were. After awhile I had to go into the house and was distracted by a phone call. At some point my husband continued with his yard work. When I came back out around 45 minutes later, both objects were gone. I have since gone outside about the same time on sunny days, but have never seen them again. My husband snapped three pictures; at first it looked like nothing was there, but when the pictures are enlarged and you know where to look, you can see them. Of course, they are not as clear and bright as they were to our eyes, but something is definitely there. They are distorted, but  look almost squarish. If you would like the pictures I will send them, but I am not sure if they would help. We have a friend who is an amateur astronomer. He did come over and look from the spot where we were standing and also saw the pictures. He doesn’t have a clue. I don’t know have a clue as to research what they might have been. We are certain, however, that they were definitely metallic, and were not moving. phone compass says 149  degrees SE 47 27'16"" N, 122 33'1"" W",2021-08-16T00:00:00,,

While looking at the positions of the stars my gaze was drawn like a magnet to a perfect V formation that was traveling across the sky from South to North. After staring at stagnant field of stars the speed of this formation of lights was hyper speed. Hard to study this craft when it went from horizon to horizon in 4 seconds. Seemed like 4 separate lights that moved like a solid shape…very hard to tell at that speed.,2021-07-31T00:00:00,38.7031,-94.4737

A FAR part 121 airline flight from KTPA to KLAS. While in level cruise flight I happen to see an object out my left window south of our position slightly ahead of our 90* abeam point moving from left to right at what I believed to be supersonic speeds. The object appeared as a dim yellow/amber single point of dim light approximately 15* above the horizon and diverging slightly from our tract traveling in a westerly direction.  The light increased gradually in intensity slightly dimmed then increased again before fading out of view. I estimate I tracked the light visually for 1 to 2 seconds and approximately 10* of arc horizontally. I could not estimate it’s altitude however it appeared to be in straight level flight and diverging slightly from our track in a westerly direction. As the light faded away I observed what I would describe as visible atmospheric disturbances similar in appearance to the trail of a shooting star but emanating from the front of the object as though it was moving so fast that it heated the air ahead distorting the atmosphere like a bow wave but did not leave a tail. The light intensity I observed was much less in intensity then any shooting star that I’ve ever seen . The object/light did not streak across the sky at high velocities in the way that I’ve seen shooting stars behave, it was slower but obviously much faster then our Airbus 319. The object traveled at a steady rate in high speed level flight leading me to believe that it wasn’t a shooting star or another airliner.  I observed this object sometime after we past Albuquerque NM in route to Las Vegas NV at 36,000 feet on a moonless clear night approximately 1 to 1 1/2 hours prior to landing.  To my knowledge I was the only observer.  I recently became aware that there is a way to report such sightings and this sighting is the only truly unusual thing I’ve observed in my 20+ year career in aviation.

My sister is a pharmacist, and I'm a student nurse. She joined me on April 05 at my home and stayed until midnight. She was ready to go home, and so I walked her out as usual. We stood outside for a few minutes having a conversation about swimming. As she was speaking to me, my attention got lost in the clear night sky. I saw a single object in the sky, and it had a cylindrical shape and seemed to be stealthy in appearance. I wanted to believe that it was an airplane in the sky, but the more I analyze it became extremely unfamiliar. The object had three circular glowing orange reddish orbs illuminating from it. The speed of this object was unlike an airplane, drone, or Chinese lantern. It was literally moving like a snail in the sky. As I stood there gazing at it, my sister turned around and looked up and saw exactly what I was seeing. She was in disbelief, thought that it might be some type of aircraft. But I remember telling her, ""No it cant be! Look ! at the orbs, and the movement. It's practically standing still."" As we both stood there staring, the object disappeared right in front of us. I couldn't believe it. It's not like it went behind any clouds. I mean this night was very clear, and there wasn't any clouds in the sky. It simply vanished out of thin air.  My sister got in her car and went home. I was so shocked by what I saw, I called my roommate out to describe what my sister and I had just seen. He quickly came out and wanted to see if the object had returned or not. He used a snapchat filter to see if the object was hiding in the sky. We both looked at his phone and did not see anything from the filter. Literally, five minutes after my sister left, my roommate and I were standing outside looking around. What happened next was even more shocking! My roommate spotted an aircraft South of us a good distance away. I have lived here for four years, and I have never seen any aircraft pull the maneuver that this ! one did. The aircraft literally made a sharp turn and headed o! ur way. I could even see the bright lights from the front of this aircraft as it sharply turned north. My roommate was quick thinking and pulled out his phone to use the snapchat filter on this aircraft. Like I said, the path that this aircraft took had never been seen before in the four years of living here. As it traveled through the buildings in between us high above, we could see what turned out to be the fine definition of a military fighter helicopter heading in the direct location of where I saw the object. On the filter we could zoom in to see the rotor, the wings, the tail rotor, and the rocket launchers on both side. Since then, this night has been unforgettable. Certainly not the first time I have seen UFO's. But it's the most recent encounter I've had, and it was similar to an experience out of a movie.",2021-07-31T00:00:00,26.0629,-80.2331

Date of sighting: April 5, 2021 Location: Middle of Big Bend Ranch State Park, TX Coordinates: 29° 24’ 44” N, 103° 59’ 60” W Time: ~21:37 local time Weather: Clear  My wife and I were camping at a remote campsite in the middle of Big Bend Ranch State Park in SW Texas, a very remote park. This was our second night at this location. The sky was dark—the moon had not yet risen—on a clear night. And it was very quiet… no wind, little insect noise.  We were sitting outside, enjoying the night sky, chatting. As it happens, I had just commented that we had not seen another human being, or even one aircraft, since setting up at this location.  Then we both returned our gaze back up to the sky and saw it: a bright light moving west to east, just a bit north of our location. I.e., not directly overhead but nearly. My wife described the light as “yellow” and “triangular, with a point."" To me, it appeared more orange, and more spherical. The speed of the object might suggest a commercial airliner at altitude, but it was much brighter, and we would both say ""bigger,"" than that. The light was not blinking, and there was no noise.  We watched it move across the sky for 10 seconds or so… long enough for us both to say, “What is that?!” The brightness was constant across this initial period. It then faded, still moving east, diminishing gradually from the bright light to a disappearing dot of light over the following ten to fifteen seconds.  The object maintained the same course, and the same apparent speed, as it disappeared. We both found this aspect of the trajectory very striking. If the object was at a constant altitude, one wouldn't expect the light to diminish so quickly. It didn't traverse an especially large arc of sky. It was nearly directly overhead over the entire length of the observation. Likewise, if the light was disappearing because it was gaining altitude, one wouldn’t expect the heading and speed of the object to appear constant.  This event happened during the middle of a two-month camping trip through the American West. We’re now back home and able to file the report. These notes were made contemporaneously with the event.",2021-05-20T00:00:00,29.6484,-104.2017

On April 10, 2021, between 9:30 and 10:00 pm I went outside to make my dog come in.  To the south west of me, I could see these bright yellow fireballs, about the size of tennis balls, launching up from the horizon to just west of me.  Four launched and made a square pattern. I ran in the house and got my sister and grabbed my cell phone and started the video.  There were 3 fireballs making a triangle, and then one would fade and go out and another one would join them.  It happened several times that one would fade out and others would join.  There were approximately 12 fireballs that launched. When I went inside and looked at the video on my phone, I could see that there was something down below the yellow lights.  I couldn’t make it out so I uploaded to my desktop and big monitor, and I was shocked to see the cylinder shaped object down below the lights.  It was not visible with the naked eye. It was really dark that night, but I had no idea that cylinder was up there. I am a 62 year old female real estate broker.

Afterwards, it gave me a pretty creepy feeling to know this one was so close.  Is it another country spying on us?  I did go to the space.com website to see if anything launched on that day and time, and I could find nothing. I sent it to KFOR, one of our local TV stations, and the only reply that I got was that they had a lot of people calling in, but he attributed it to the Starlink Satellites that launched the Thursday before.  I am familiar with those, and this was nothing like it.  At least that did tell me other people were calling in.  I really don’t think he even looked at my video. I did send it to MUFON and an investigator called me and is checking into it.  If our government does not know about these things, then I think they should be made aware.  This just happened right before they were showing the Navy film of the UFOs on the news.

On the night of April 16, 2021, at approximately 9:48pm, I was in my backyard waiting for my German Shepherd to do her business. I was looking at my phone and I noticed she had walked up next to me. As I looked over to her, I saw she was looking up to the sky behind me and she had her head cocked in a manner to say “What’s that?”  I turned around and looked in the direction she was looking, which was almost true North, and I saw a very ultra white, very bright round light. Although I can’t say for sure, my initial thoughts were that it was maybe a mile or mile and a half away (using Magnolia Av. to my north as a possible point of reference), traveling slowly in a westerly direction. I quickly brought up my cell phone camera, switching it from photo to video, and hit the record button, as something was strange about this light. My first thought was that it was a drone, however there were no red/green direction lights on it that I could see, and there were no sounds coming from it’s direction that you associate with a drone’s propellers, and the size seemed way too big for a drone that distance away.  The object’s direction of flight took it behind a large tree in the parkway behind and next to my house. I was able to watch it continue westward through breaks in the tree’s foliage. I could see the moon to the west, also behind the tree. It was in the waxing crescent phase. The object continued and visually appeared to pass to the left and under the moon, where I lost it behind the heavy tree foliage. I tried to position myself to see if it would appear below the tree’s foliage but I couldn’t see it anymore. I could only guesstimate the distance it traveled as maybe to Main St., approximately a mile and a half west of me, however it may have continued much farther.  I posted my video on a local social media site, wondering if anyone else had seen it. One female posted she saw it and thought it was a drone. Another female posted saying she saw it from her windows and jumped out of bed. A third female posted the event was “filmed in (the city of) Murrieta too” (a city 30 miles south). A male posted he also saw it, saying it disappeared fast when he went to take a video. He said he and 2 others reported it to the UFO Reporting Center.

During the time I saw it, I noticed that my dog became very still and began barking at the sky.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,45.6393,-94.2237

We have had 4 incidents. It changes shape and colors as well as comes all hours. October 31- November first week 2020  Ok so I have to post, bc this situation has become a little more scary.  *2 weeks ago we had an incident at our new farm. Around 9pm I went to shine (flash light) the pasture bc we have had alot of deer in the area. We feed them and its cool to show my little girl all the deer at night in our pasture. I spotted no deer but a bright light that was in the tree tops but it kept hiding behind the trees literally every time I tried to get a better look. (Almost as if it didn't want to be seen) pretty crazy I'm thinking during the time, as I try to rationalize what I'm seeing. I call out to my husband to confirm that I'm not crazy but to see if he sees what I see.  Which he does. But it spooks him so he goes back inside. I guess that I should have listened to him bc after all I have been keeping up with Paulides. But the curiosity took my better judgment. I then witnessed what my brain rationalized as a shooting star, but it didn't have the path like a normal falling star, it went midway from the air, and then straight over kinda like a arch towards the light, 7 mins later another one did the same thing but this time it traveled vertical then horizontal to the light. After keeping my eyes on the falling star looking lights the big light was gone.  Now 2 weeks later Last night we were shining the pasture (this time with a new bigger spot light,  it was around 9pm. I scanned the pasture with the light left to right, right to left. Then left to right. Immediately a very orange sphere light turned on in the back left corner tree tops and it was very low, I'd say a foot shy from the top of the trees in the very back of our pasture and it started coming towards me (backdoor) I screamed for my husband and he came to the back door and saw it too and immediately yelled at me to close and lock the door, do not go outside. And to put away the spot light. 3 secs after he and I saw it it disappeared. 3am: I woke up, lit a cigarette at the back door,  and grabbed the light to shine the pasture (I know stupid me,) I shined for deer again left to right right to left left to right (no deer) which was odd in itself.  They are their every nite! Then like a light switch, the bright orange light appeared again,  this time it was further than before and over the middle of the pasture and appeared higher in the sky. It turned on then it faded off (only took a few secs) it did this 3 times! I went go my husband out of bed but it never came back on afterwards,  he scolded me about opening the back door and shining the spot light,  but it has us both kinda quiet and just in shock this morning.  Kinda worried whats going to happen next?        Nov 26 2020 Update with proof and recordings and pics!  I was @ 455-515am walking to my deer stand in my back pasture, not paying attention to the sky behind me until a saw a flash of a shooting star in front of me. I got the feeling that gut feeling i was being watched, so I turned around and there was the bright orange light from several weeks ago I posted on here about. I immediately froze still with fear! I saw the light climb higher in the sky and then proceed to turn a darker orange and get bigger! I had my deer rifle and my cellphone and I started calling my husband over and over and over again but he was sound asleep and wouldn't answer my phone call. I was so terrified that I was not going to teach my back door step in time. I ran into the house screaming at my husband that the orb was back and that it was directly over me after coming over the house into our pasture. I ran inside and started asap recording.  *what you will see is shocking! *I recorded for over an hour 45min! *I even talked to it, and it seemed to be intelligent enough to respond to my questions and requests! *You will see that everything i asked it to change color or shape it did! *maybe yall can figure out what shapes it showed me. *also when I would turn off the recorder to take pics I was in shock to see a bright solid yellow round orb at the end of my driveway as well as at my feet! The orb was a solid yellow (you will see), I also saw and caught several other colors like red, green, white, orange in the low of the woods across my driveway and even in the ditches! (You could not see them with the naked eye nor the video camera,  *only the camera option on my phone!  2 nights ago my friend who I posted on here back I. April the recordings of the crafts and lights as well as orbs coming out of the grown and the chanting noises, called us bc I reached out to him bc of what I had experienced here. He told us that as we were on the phone he was experiencing as well as bid neighbors along of crafts and that his phone and his parents were doing all kinds of crazy stuff. The screens were very fastly going thru or scanning thru his contacts, texts, settings and the alarms in the house were going off. His neighbor caught some wild and scary things on their cameras and it was so scary his friend went home and refuses to go out side at night or at dark anymore! I should mention that his neighborhood is only 2 miles behind our house thru the pine thicket woods behind out house which is where we first noticed the light and the horrible musty, wet dog, saturated urine smell when my deer disappeared for a week! He too mentioned that there was a very mu! sty smell during the incidents he was having! He worked in the military and years ago went into a megalithic structure where it was an ancient structure 16,000 yes old! He said that he had some pottery he got from there and since then this activity has magnified at his home! He has been in the hospital but was released 2 days ago and when it got dark that nite the lights and orbs showed back up with a vengeance! Though this time they are messing with his and his parents phones, computers, and now all of the pottery he had from the ancient structure is now disappeared!  He also says he gets messages telepathically but that he is no longer scared but feels as if they are asking and guiding him for help. (I can't speak to much about him bc I'm not there) but his neighborhood has a golf course built on an ancient mounds!  The videos are long but you will need to watch them in full to see what I experienced!  Please feel free to give me any advice you can.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,31.5686,-92.3568

As I focused on it, it stopped blinking and stayed lit.  I was seeing it through a narrow gap in trees so I moved to my front yard to get a better line of sight and it followed me up there.  I flashed my phone light at it several times and then it zipped from spot to spot, up down, right left. It got extremely close to me, right above my neighborhood at the height local helicopters fly.  I have numerous videos of this craft and when you zoom in and slow it down, as it’s flying up and down, it appears to be a burning ball of bright white and green gas, rapidly spinning while expanding and contracting.  I am convinced it was interacting with me, not only because it followed me and was putting on a show but because thats the feeling I got, its hard to explain.  Also, when zoomed in, ! it appears to be a classic “flying saucer” with some sort of force field around it.  Ive reported it to MUFON and multiple investigators said it is what is seen all over the world.  The experience lasted from 2:30am to 2:58am before it suddenly shot into the sky.  I recently submitted a Freedom of Information Act for the sky radar with the FAA but we’ll see if they end up sending that to me.

Trying to remember after it was gone that the thing was more cylindrical and nothing like wings on it. There did appear to be a disturbance around it that when first seen could have mistaken for whirring wings.

I was at work, like I said it was about 5:00 in the afternoon, I hesitate to use my job name so I won't, let's just say I was in the parking garage and I looked in the sky and I saw what I thought was an airplane. but I guess something made me look again it went behind the corner pillar of the garage so when I got to the other side I looked again, and what I saw look like the fuselage of a plane with no tail or wings. and it was now in the vertical position, when I first saw it it was in a horizontal position which is why I thought it was a plane the second time I looked it was in the vertical position, and it was slowly floating across the sky. just a little lower than a low flying plane, slightly lower. a gentleman was coming up the steps of the parking garage, I asked him sir what the heck is that he didn't seem too concerned he looked he saw it he said maybe it's a balloon. I said I don't think it's a balloon he said well I guess it could be anything and he looked with m! e for a few seconds and went on. when he turned to go on about his business that's when I told him now it stopped dead in the sky, in one position didn't move for about close to 10 seconds and I just stood there looking at it. it seemed to be made out of metal, some kind of craft, it had different things here and there, from top to bottom, like what look like maybe vents, and things nothing projecting off of it to the left or right or top or bottom Just a cylinder hanging in the air in the vertical position, and after a few seconds that's when it seemed to begin to flip around in random ways, for a minute I thought I saw would look like that typical triangle, but what I noticed it was doing to me it look like it's simply fell up out of the sky, as it went on a 45° angle, up once it started flipping and tumbling it appeared like if I had a rock and I got to the top of the empire State building and let it go, and a rock would fall down to the ground. this thing fell up out of! the blue sky all the way up and out and it was gone. thank you",2021-08-16T00:00:00,39.99063505273804,-75.14580121369744

As a few minutes passed, I began to hear even more sirens and police cars gathering close by. I walked outside to the end of my driveway to investigate all of the sirens I was hearing. Across the street from me, there was a small home that appeared to have smoke pouring out of it. Obviously I presumed something was on fire inside the home. I watched roughly eight fire trucks arrive on the scene followed by numerous police cars and three ambulances. My home resides behind my landlord who i'm friends with so i sent her a text message to let her know what was going on. She came outside and greeted me and stood beside me while we watched the events of the fire unfold. We stood at the end of the driveway while we watched the fire fighters try to make an entry into the house. Roughly fifteen minutes after watching them, I noticed what seemed to be a solid green colored star slowly descend from the sky.The closer it became, the less it seemed like a star and more like a green orb. The green orb descended until it stopped right above the scene of the fire. At the time I asked my landlord if she could see the same green orb I did to which she agreed.  When it stopped, we could tell that the object had a round figure to it, also it had some mass to it. You could tell that it was large, and it sat just under the clouds right above the home. The object sat there in mid air not moving for a few moments. Suddenly it started moving side to side very slowly. 	We continued to watch the object shocked and wondering what it was. We kept asking each other what it could be and we couldn't come up with an answer. The green orb would move slowly in one direction, then in the blink of an eye, shoot straight up into the sky. It was almost impossible to keep up with. The object stayed a solid green color and continued to stay directly above the scene of the house fire. It would come down slowly and hover, then move to the side, then gain altitude and ascend into the sky. All of the movements were irregular and hard to keep up with because of how erratic it was. There were times we could see it right under the clouds almost getting close enough to hover right over the treeline that was behind the house, then it would ascend so quickly into the sky it would look like a distant star all over again. Even when it gained altitude, it would stop in mid air and slowly move side to side, then drop down close. Whatever movement it made it seemed t! o have an interest in the lights or the scene of the house fire. As my landlord and I both watched it, we felt nervous and a little shaken up because of the movements this green orb was making. This was no drone because of the speed and altitude it could achieve in mere milliseconds. This was not a meteor or any kind of man piloted aircraft. It did not have any kind of propelling force that moved the object. There was no fire or smoke behind the aircraft. This object moved across the sky back and forth so quickly and slowly that you could tell it did not abide by the natural law of physics. After watching this green orb for about fifteen minutes it would disappear, then reappear on the other side of the sky. My landlord and I struggled to point out to each other where it was disappearing and reappearing. Eventually after it made its erratic movements and kept moving across the sky, the object just simply disappeared. We watched it do this a few times until eventually it never reappeared in the sky.

The movement appeared to be a dropping motion toward the ground.  As I continued to observe, the lights appeared to dim and move a little closer to one another.  This led me to believe the object, instead of moving downward, was probably moving away at a very high rate of speed.  They maintained their vertical alignment while moving and were gone from sight in less than 30 seconds. My video unfortunately was too dark to make out any of the lights.",2020-02-07T00:00:00,30.0929,-94.7425

The light looked a lot like Venus in that it was a brilliant white, steady light. But it was in the wrong location for Venus at that time of day, which made me look closer. Upon closer examination I quickly noticed that the light was moving from West to East and in front of the bright white light was another dimmer light which was also a steady white light.  I witnessed the two lights (dim in front, bright white in back) move at a fairly rapid speed (faster than I've observed airplanes overhead at my house) head East. The strange thing is the two lights were not blinking at all and moved at the exact same speed, equidistant and parallel to each other at a seemingly steady rate, in a seemingly straight course West to East.  At this point I yelled for my husband to come and see. He witnessed it as well and  told me to stop talking. When I did, we noticed there was no sound at all associated with the object's movement. The lights passed over our house and I grabbed my binoculars and headed outside to the driveway which faces East. There I witnessed the lights continue their Eastbound journey. Because it was dark it was difficult to see an outline of the object. I got the impression the object was long and black or reflective. I could not discern a third light which might make the object look more triangle-shaped. Extending my hand in front of me at approximately a 125 degree angle from my body, I was able to measure the ""distance"" between the two lights as slightly wider than the width of my hand at the base of my fingers, which is 4.5 inches. The distance between the two light never changed and the light never flickered. The front light was about the same brilliance as a normal star bu! t the light in the back was far brighter than any other light in the sky.  I watched the two lights for a total of approximately 90 seconds. Never did I hear a sound of a plane or any other noise that could be remotely associated with the lights. As the lights continued their journey to the East, I just walked back inside. My husband was already back inside at this point. This seems odd because now looking back, I was really enthralled by the sighting, why would I leave before the object left my view or vanished? I don't remember why I went inside before the object left my view. I just remember being preoccupied with where the lens covers for the binoculars fell. Once I found those on the ground, I went inside without looking back. Another odd thing was my dog did not try to go outside during the event. Which is strange because he usually tries to go outside with me every time I open the door. Adding to this, it was his normal morning walk time.  I came out approximately 10 minutes later (0640) to walk my dog and the lights were no longer visible. The sun was starting to come up and I could see the sky was overcast towards the West but the sky above me and to the East was clear.",2020-02-07T00:00:00,43.165699999999994,-89.085

Two of us saw in the west approximately 15 miles out from out position three lights slowly moving away from us possibly over and around Sterling Pa. heading towards Scranton Pa. probably following interstate 84. We had high powered binoculars. To the naked eye it was three yellowish-pinkish lights in a row. They reminded me of mercury vapor lights. Definitely not natural. Size-wise, they were about the size of a pencil eraser. The lights were horizontal.  When we looked through the binoculars we began to suspect we may be looking at the back of a craft that must have been large. It moved very slowly covering maybe the length of a finger in 5 minutes till we lost it behind the treeline. Too slow to be a plane by a lot!  But huge.  But here was what was especially odd. Through the binocs, you could see under the three yellow lights that t! here were three tiny tiny red lights. One in the middle slightly off to one side of the center yellow/pink light and two slightly offset and in from the two outside yellow/pink lights. And the red lights blinked but randomly and not sequentially. They also didnt blink fast. One would blink once and then a second later another would blink once sort of leisurely.

I noticed something strange in the sky, so I grabbed my binoculars for a closer look. Binoculars are Galileo Model G-1250 so I can see 12 times farther than the naked eye. In the field of view through the lenses, the object was about 1/2 inch wide and 1/3rd of that in height. Rectangular shaped and red. It was the color of a cherry. The object spun horizontally, which doesn't make any sense. It really looked like a car, and that doesn't make any sense. It even looked like there was a wheel too, a small one - with a rim, the same as a car wheel would. I could not make sense of this thing. I even wondered of it was that Tesla that Elon Musk released into space, but it wasn't falling fast like it should have with the gravitational pull. The object was too strange to be a plane or an air balloon. It wasn't a helium balloon. It was too big to be a drone. I do not think a remote controlled device can fly that high, but I do not know. It was just a spec in my eye w! ithout the binoculars. I grabbed the binoculars because of the flash the sun made on it when it spun. The spin speed was about as fast as a beacon light for aircraft to see. The metallic sheen flashed brightly when the sun reflected upon it, when the object made a horizontal rotation. I put down the binoculars to try and focus my eyes on it and try to get a photo, but when I looked up again it was gone. I only took my eyes off of the object for a 2/10ths of a second. I regretted putting my binoculars down. I was facing south, and the object would be about south west if the face of the compass were facing me. There were no lights. I can hear sound through my windows, but only a small amount. I heard no sound coming from the object, and there were no streaks. The sky at the time, as I looked through my window, was cloudy, but blue sky was also visible, and the sun was able to flash off of the object. This sighting happened around 4:52pm on June the 18th.

I saw one maybe 200 ft up headed same direction a few minutes later and pointed it out to my roommate. She was snapping the double rainbow the clouds were giving and caught the tail end of the last one. I thought I was the only one to see it with her but my g! aming buddy said his girlfriend and neighbor just witnesses one in proctor which is like top of the hill before you enter duluth.

We observed first a ball of light approximately the size of a basketball held at arms length, it was 50 yards away from where my family was enjoying a meal prepared outdoors.  At first everything was calm,then our dogs began to bark in the direction behind the house.  My stepfather was telling them to be quiet.  I was wondering what they saw to disturbed them, as there were many deer on the apple orchard where we lived.  I believe I was first to see a single orb of light, as I had described, it came from the same direction as our dogs had been barking,  very illuminated, & close.  As we watched in awe another ball of light the same size came from behind the 1st.  Then a very intense beam of light, like a search light came from between the first two,& began sweeping up & down the isles between the rows of apple trees, as if searching for something. All of a sudden it seemed to notice US! And shown said beam on to all standing there agape. This is where a time slip accord. I remember seeing us all caught in the light that lit our backyard up stronger than daylight. All we could do was stand rooted in place for I don't know how long, but the ""search-light"" seemed to such up into the place where it originally came from, the 2nd ball of light did the same thing in reverse (that is too say: it went behind the 1st again) and it flew away at an incredible speed! Then all was if it was to start with. All my mother, sister & myself could do was talk about what we had just experienced. My stepfather and brother-in-law wanted too do was get themselves & the kids indoors as fast as possible. The rest of us stood there in disbelief, & shortly decided to investigate the area in which the silent thing had come from. I can remember my stepfather calling us crazy &! to get inside. He said:""it was just a plane"" but my! mother, sister, & myself knew better.  ""If it was only a plane, what are you so frightened of?"" Said I. Just get in here you three nut-jobs he relied! I think about it often, but afraid of ridicule I've never reported it until now. I figure that if anyone can believe it must be you folks. It wasn't till much later that the X-files episode aired, & by that time I was an adult living back in Ohio. Very interesting that of all places for a UFO to be buried on the show being Warfordsburg!

As soon as we got outside I looked up and saw a long line of bright white lights crossing the sky. The line of lights went as far north as I could see, (about half the night sky before the horizon was blocked by an apartment building) and as they moved over head they would just disappear one at a time in the same exact spot. The lights were moving relatively slow and were in a perfectly straight uniformed line, all the same distance from one another. I tried to film it with my IPhone 8, but nothing showed up so I ran inside, told my girlfriend to come out and grabbed her iPhone 11. I went back outside and tried to film with her phone, but it still didn’t show up so  I went back inside and Convinced my girlfriend to come out and she also saw the line of lights. About 10 or 15 seconds after she came out another much much larger bright light appeared and started to move across the sky at the same ! slow speed in a different direction. After about a minute and a half from when she came out the seemingly endless line of lights came to an end as we saw the last one pass over head and disappear. At that point my girlfriend went inside, but I stayed and watched the larger bright light until it went out of view over the horizon. It was literally just that, a large bright circular  light, nothing was blinking or had any color at all, and I didn’t even think to film it because I had already given up on filming before it appeared. In total I watched the lights for about 5 to 7 minutes and they were already in full swing when I first saw them. Also while I was filming the first time I watched a small farm plane fly right by the line of lights.

Shortly after midnight in Clay, NY (just south of Phoenix, NY), only a few minutes after the start of Sunday May 16, 2021, and about 5-10 minutes before the crescent moon set, I looked out an upstairs window to the north into a cloudless night sky to see the stars.  I saw the usual stars and planets and also an unusual light moving to the south.  The light was cigar shaped (rectangular) similar to a dull fluorescent bulb with a light blue tint. Its length was about the same as the diameter of a full moon, in the east-west direction, and its brightness was about ¼ of that of the moon.  After about a minute, I proceeded to wake my wife to show her the object.  Although difficult for me to determine, the elevation of the object appeared to be where most airplanes fly going to the Syracuse, NY airport (say 4,000 ft. +/-) and at a distance of several miles to the north over Oswego County. The light was moving to the south-southeast at what appeared to be the typical speed of an airplane.  After 3 or 4 minutes heading south, it started moving to the east for about a minute, with the light remaining in the same east-west orientation while fading from view, possibly because it moved far enough east to no longer reflect the moonlight back to us. We didn’t see any spotlights or blinking lights on the object like what would be seen on an airplane or one of the military drones that often fly out of the Syracuse airport.  We didn’t hear any noise from the object through the closed window nor after we opened the window as the object faded from view.

Recently in Sequim, Washington State, I saw the most amazing thing ever and feel compelled to share this with all interested.  I now know the truth on this particular subject.  Sunday night 5/17/2021, at 22:40 I decided to hit the sack earlier than normal.  Partly because my 150lb Lab/Rot mix was pestering me, as he was ready to zonk out.  I left my Man-Cave and headed for the house.  As I reached my back door, I noticed something shimmering in the night sky.  It was a clear night, only a sudden weather change brought in some low clouds.  From here on I will relate my first impressions.  This shimmering object was quite a distance from me, to my left and at about a 65-degree angle up towards the NW.  It was in the atmosphere and may have been over The Strait of Juan de Fuca?   It looked long and lay horizontal in the sky.   At first, I thought it might be lights reflecting off an odd shaped cloud.  That's until I realized it was moving to the East.  Heck, that was no cloud!  The shimmering seemed hypnotic and perhaps caused by the atmosphere?  This object was going to pass right through my Northern view.  I estimate it was moving just a bit slower than a commercial Jetliner when they pass over.  At that point I knew this was something unusual.  So, I ran for my vehicle to retrieve a pair of binoculars and by the time I fished them out, the object was straight across from me.  I was facing North and when I peered through the optics at this object, my world changed!  I could not believe what I was clearly seeing, yet knew exactly what I was seeing... a craft, a real UFO!  Only this thing was HUGE!  I'll get right to the point... it looked like the Freaking Empire State building floating in the sky on its side, only bigger and perhaps more like the World Trade Center!!!  This clearly was a craft with 70 to 100+ windows patterened on its side.  Just like a skyscraper at night with about 30% of the windows dark/off.  The windows on were lit from within and surely what caused the shimmering.  These were not navigation l! ights.  Nor were they flashing.  The structure of this craft was clear.  It was like watching a Science Fiction Movie, when the big Mother Ship arrives to earth!  Only this thing was real and no way ours!  I was observing a side view, which seemed about 4 stories tall.  I did not see a top or bottom view or different angle of the craft.  Again, just picture the side view of a flying modern skyscraper.  Through my binoculars I saw structure.  No doubt in my mind this was a craft.  Stunned I watched as it moved to my right.  A much closer to me cloud bank would soon obstruct my view. When about one third of its front end was hidden by the clouds, it suddenly stopped.  Then its trailing end started rotating to the horizontal upward position and stopped at about 65 degrees.  At that point it descended.  I watched until fully hidden by clouds.  This craft was so big that I kind of expected to hear a crash!  None came and this entire event was silent.  If this craft was over water, it may have plunged in?  I know what I clearly saw- a huge UFO, now etched into my mind forever!  Certainly, someone else may have seen it and hope they come forward.  Hey US Military... there is NO Way you don't know about this object on this night!  Tell us the truth!  For me seeing is believing and I can now say for certain, UFOs, crafts not of this world are REAL!  I've shared this sighting with others who know me.  Yet few seemed surprised/excited, even care.  Oh well.  Seeing this craft filled me with a sense off... Now I Know!",2021-07-31T00:00:00,48.0656,-123.0613

It appeared almost vertical (not quite vertical – slanted) above the horizon but then while I was looking for a camera it was almost directly in front of me moving slowly from west to east.  I tried to take pictures (should have went for my binoculars) but the flash went off and I couldn’t get the camera to focus.  At 2238 (confirmed on my phone), I phone-called a colleague who lives close by (a retired fighter pilot) to look and confirm that it was not the “string-of-pearls” Starlink we’d both seen before.  He saw it as well and agreed it was not the Starlink we’d previously seen and also did not know what it was.  To me, from my vantage point, it was a series of white lights – steady, not flashing– as if a bus or subway car with windows and lights shining through.  I could not tell if it was a solid object, but from the lights it appeared to be the classic “cigar” shaped UFO, though it could have had more depth.  But again, from my vantage point, I could not determine if and how much depth it may have had.  I thought it was low in the sky, maybe 5K feet high at most, and I lost it in the trees as it traveled west towards the Montana border.  It did not make a sound",2021-07-31T00:00:00,48.7581,-116.511

None of the dogs in the neighborhood barked. There was no MADAR alert at this time, and the field readings didn't show anything anomalous. Newburgh's node 142 has a threshold shield of 27 and the field readings never exceeded 7.5 milligaus, which explains why 142 didn't ""trigger"". The accelerometer readings were normal but the compass heading numbers from col. 3 varied more than 3 degrees. In fact almost 5 degrees. At 4:08 the data shows a 221.14 degree reading. Three or four minutes before her sighting, something was di! sturbing the geomagnetic field. It is my opinion that had the UFO gone vertical, MADAR would have shown a spike in the field 2-3 times normal but still probably wouldn't have triggered the device. Also, if 142 HAD gone into alert, the data rate would have jumped to once per second, but the status rate is one line per minute ""under trigger"".

On several occasions I witnessed various types of Unidentified Areal Phenomenon but never had a camera with me to document such sights. Often, I see these things after 9pm and later. On December 4, 2017 I saw a white sphere moving silently & slowly a couple hundred feet above me in a Southern Direction and as it moved higher into the atmosphere disappeared. I was awestruck because it was so close. On Wednesday evening, April 14, 2021, I stepped out onto my back porch so the dog could go out and was looking up at the stars in a Southern Direction from my home and saw some type of craft drop 3-4 orange spheres (one at a time) and as each one dropped it flew off & disappeared. I had never seen anything like that before and did not believe them to be flares as they vanished almost immediately. On Tuesday & Wednesday night, May 18 & 19, 2021, I was outside at various times both nights witnessing small white orbs dancing about in a playful manner, swirling around & racing each other back and forth through the clouds. Just when you would look at one, a slight flash of light would occur in another location flying about in the same manner. It did not matter which direction I looked toward East, West, South or North - there were I estimate hundreds (not clustered) of orbs at various heights and distances all over the sky. That Wednesday night (05/19/2021) around 9:30 I was standing in front of my house and saw a plane flying from North to South along the normal flight path over my home and saw another “craft” with just one solid light under it. It almost looked like a helicopter with a search beacon of some sort. The plane was much higher above this other craft with the very bright light headed just over my head and as they passed I couldn’t quite make out the type of a! irplane but thought it appears similar to the Stealth Bomber a triangular dark color but it went so fast I wasn’t clear what I was seeing. I saw my neighbor sitting in his car and rushed over to bang on his window to see what I was viewing. The airplane continued on its normal route and the craft with the light appeared to be speeding faster in an effort to catch up or pace the other plane when suddenly it veered on at an abnormal angle and disappeared. My neighbor thought both were airplanes, but I have never seen a plane fly at an angle such as this one did. To my amazement during the day on Thursday May 20, 2021 I saw the same orbs darting in & out of the clouds. It was shocking and somewhat difficult to see them with daylight present, but they were there. We had brief blue sky, some thunder/hail clouds, and some rain. I was able to document (as best I could) these orbs at various heights and directions around my home location. I did contact the National UFO Hotline and ! spoke briefly to Director Peter Davenport about what I thought! could b e ball lightning or some highly strange unidentified flying orbs.

Each event taking place since my first report - I am seeing more orbs, ships and now beings which would be classified as unidentified areal phenomena.  These experiences have been taking place since May 18th, 2021. I have had previous experiences before both here in my current location of Salem, Oregon as well as Denver, Colorado.  I have witnessed what I would describe as orbs, spherical in shape exhibiting occasional flashing of light and flying about in every direction (N/W/E/S) individually or in pairs/groups. I have witnessed some type of invisible ship dropping 3 to 4 orange orbs (one at a time) and watching them fly off and disappear. I have only once seen an orange orb since then and multiple smaller white orbs were also present and appeared to acknowledge my sighting and attempts to capture on film/video.  On Saturday, May 29th, 2021 I was packing my vehicle for a trip to Garibaldi, Oregon located on the Pacific Coast near Tillamook, OR. While packing a being of some type (cloaked/somewhat visible) shimmering with sparkles of light within showed up – very close to me. It scared me and all I could think of was to say Wish me a Good/Safe Trip and waved it away (which seems very silly). The shocking part is that when I arrived in Garibaldi, I witnessed the same things there. I have NO IDEA if they followed me or were already present at that location very near the Pacific Ocean. I do understand that these orbs have been sighted off the coast of California near Catalina Island. I do not have knowledge if the sightings I had there may also be submergible.  While in Garibaldi, Oregon and witnessing small white orbs flying in every direction (N/S/W/E) I would see a very brief flashing of something black. Some of the white orbs flying around appeared along the mountain ridge just at the back of Garibaldi (Northern direction) and all other areas of the sky. Some of the beings (cloaked/somewhat visible) shimmering with sparkles of light would attempt to communicate almost the same as a blimp advertising numbers, wording and images to me. It seemed to change from numbers to images of human faces and other faces (possibly what I would describe as grey aliens). It was hard enough to believe these experiences were happening to me at separate locations day, or night, in all directions but now attempts to communicate.  The beings (cloaked/somewhat visible) were presenting themselves multiple times very, very close to me. It was frightening, nearly unbelievable and confusing. When I would attempt to film/video my experience that specific area would only appear as a blurry section within the sky. On Sunday May 30, 2021 I was standing on the street in Garibaldi speaking to my relative’s neighbor and happened to glance up in the N/E direction and see something black suddenly appear from nowhere in the sky at a low altitude and I screamed “What is That??” repeatedly running north to get a better view. I watched this black thing turn into what I would describe as a giant dragon fly or scorpion with no wings but having a long tail of some type. It almost appeared to resemble a helicopter, but they do not have tails that hang beneath them – and they make sound. This object seemed to fly down to the ground because I could no longer see it above the houses in that neighborhood. I was not alone this ! time. My relative’s neighbor, Virgil, was present but he could not see that well because of recent eye surgery. He thought it was a helicopter, but – it WAS NOT.  Sunday evening, my relative acknowledged that she too could see some flashing in the sky here/there but could not see these beings that sparkle. I packed my vehicle to leave Garibaldi, Oregon around 6am in route home in Salem, Oregon. As I approached the vehicle one of the beings was again directly above my vehicle. I was very frightened at night to stand there as I was imagining to be abducted. It was still dark and yelled for my relative to be present until I was in the vehicle and gone. I hoped/prayed I would not see anything during my 2-hour drive or have my vehicle suddenly stop working. The whole idea of what had been happening to me as a credible, truthful woman with no mental illness other than depression.  Every report I have made I have tried to be as descriptive as possible and use spell check and paragraphs but each time previously the site would change to a blob of writing (lengthy for you to read) according to your description. I hope this report will work correctly. I thank you for your time and consideration of having an investigator speak to me about these experiences.",2021-07-31T00:00:00,,

I watched slowly moving in the sky without a clear path for several minutes as I drove. When sitting at the red light, an airplane began quickly approaching the object from the east. As the airplane neared the object, the fireball appeared to divert its path and began to move away heading southwest for roughly 10 seconds.  When the airplane neared the fireball again, the fireball stopped glowing appearing to turn its lights off and it disappeared. I watched the object visibly disappear in the sky as there were no other objects that could possibly be obstructing my view of it.  This is the second time I’ve seen what appears to be this object. The first time around the same time (roughly 8:15pm on Dec 10, 2020), I noticed the red glowing object above the tree line as I was getting out of my car close to area where today’s sighting occurred. Since it was so odd, I stopped and waited to watch it noticing that it was silent. The red glowing fireball was hovering above the tree line for several minutes. Again, another seemingly unrelated plane was flying towards the object.  When the plane neared, the object drifted away horizontally from the plane and then appeared to fly downwards towards the tree line.  I thought at first that I saw the object stop glowing, but after some thought I rationalized that it must have just disappeared behind the trees. After today’s sighting and watching the fireball stop glowing in plain sight, it lends credibility to the object dimming in my first sighting.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,28.006814358108112,-82.47646101351351

When approaching we could see yellow orange colored light NOT flashing. When they turned the lights disappeared and we saw a perfectly circular totally black object. It was dusk so there still was some background lighting but this did not resemble a helicopter or plane I've seen. There was no noise from them we could hear. At about 8:35 an airliner was coming in low for approach to PDX to the west. The second object like the first continued NE in a straight line and appeared to fly underneath crossing the plane. I first wondered if this was a balloon but it moved too fast and precisely and considered maybe an ultralight but too fast and they're very noisy but the totally black circular shape was something I have never seen and I follow aviation. My wif! e did capture a still image of one of the objects approaching from the West which is not an approach pattern for planes flying to Portland international airport. That still image shows the lighted object. There's also a video taken after the 2nd object made a turn Northeast though it was easy to see with the naked eye the video may be difficult to see the black circular objects without enhancing because of parking lot lights obscuring the image at dusk. Still pick and video can be submitted if requested. I will note there is a municipal airport in Troutdale Oregon which was in the general direction these objects were moving by the time we lost sight of them moving past the shopping center. The proximity of the second object apparently flying underneath the approaching airliner at low altitude was particularly concerning and they appeared quite close to the point where the FAA should take notice.

On Tuesday(1/7/2020) at 6:15PM CT, I was driving with my Daughter to Target (45mph),traveling North bound on Harlem Road (between Plantation Drive and Toll Road 99)It was dusk, so the sun had set, but still plenty of light to the west, but dark to the east of us.  As I looked ahead, I noticed a long, greyish, cylindrical object traveling from due west to east.  It appeared to be far way (maybe 10-15 miles or more), but the length seemed way to long for the distance away from us.  The object was smoothly traveling the sky at a rapid pace with no lights at all.  I quickly asked my daughter (9 years old) if she saw it...Yes, she said and then we marveled that there were no lights and was so big. We continued watching it as we turned east on West Airport Road, but it quickly vanished as it passed to the east, as it was already dark.  I first saw the object at my 10 o'clock and lost sight of it about my 2 o'clock. (If the front of my car was 12 o'clock)  The entire event ! was only around 30 seconds and I was not able to take any pictures.  Just shocking 1/2 minute. When we arrived to Target, we sat in the parking lot and watched several planes in the night sky, both Commercial Airliners and Private planes… All had blinking lights and all were traveling at a snail's pace in comparison to what we just witnessed.  When we got into the store, my daughter asked me if we were dreaming possibly.  It certainly felt quite strange, as both of our brains could not process what we just saw.  Since the event just happened last night, it is still very fresh. All details regarding time and place are100% accurate... What we saw and the description above is as good as I can do for the rapid nature of the event.Hopefully I can get feedback on what we may have seen...

Person in our party, with 40+ year career in military/corporate aviation, spotted 3 glowing lights in upper sky (below contrail height, but well over 2000 ft. height) coming from horizon line approaching us from the north with southward path in a horizontal formation. When the lights were closer to us, yet still north of edge of gorge and waterfalll, we saw the three glowing objects form a vertical line, then a horizontal line, then a triangular formation; objects were spaced out in position, not immediately (such as 5 object spaces) next to each other and seemed to be holding/stationary in the sky. Object on the right hand side of triangular formation shot out to the east/right, than snapped back into its position on the right of the triangle. At this point, all we saw were brilliant! ly glowing spots in sky until all 3 objects rotated in same positions in sky from left to right (west to east). At this point, only one side of the craft was revealed to be triangular, silver, and multi-dimensional shape (not a flat side) with the brilliant glowing orb/light still to the left side of the craft. The silver-colored side reflected in the sun brilliantly and clearly showing its dimensionality and seemed to hold that position for a few seconds, It rotated back, so that we could only see it as a glowing light again, which disguised its shape.  After this aerial display, the craft resumed their journey to the south, flying directly over us in a triangular formation; directly overhead, looking up, they appeared to be triangular shapes. Another car with 2 passengers stopped next to us to watch the first part of the display, then left the scene. As the objects were flying overhead, another set of 3 glowing lights/orbs was spotted on the horizon, again, headed southward toward us. At this point, we decided to leave the area. We discussed attempting to take photos of the objects, but decided our phone cameras could not capture the objects very well, and we were riveted by the aerial display. There was no sound in the gorge area at the time, and no sound emitted at any time by the objects in the sky.  I live approx 6.6 miles directly south of runways of one of the largest commercial airports in the country. In my opinion, from observing commercial jet airplanes constantly departing/taking off, the craft observed turning in the sun was the size of a commercial plane on its sides. I am also very familiar with the sounds of large commercial aircraft as they land or take off or cross over my residence, and these objects did not emit a sound as they passed over us. As they passed over us, they were significantly higher in the sky than a commercial airliner flying over my residence on takeoff from my local airport, but lower than airplanes seen in our area only passing over VOR points.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,,

On June 23rd, 2021 at approximately 3:15pm, in Solon, Ohio, I had an unusual and unexplained sighting directly overhead. It was a very clear and sunny afternoon with a lot of smaller low altitude clouds like stratus or cumulus(looked like cotton balls). I was five to ten miles from the nearest airport, and there were small private planes in the area at the time of the sighting. I was standing in a parking lot when I heard what sounded like a low flying plane that was revving up. It sounded bigger than a Cessna 150 due to the high volume level, but I couldn't see it, probably because of the large building I was next to. That got me to looking around to see if I could spot it. I looked all around, then straight up. Directly above me was one of those smaller clouds I mentioned. I'm estimating it's altitude at between 6 and 10 thousand feet. Approaching the cloud, not moving very fast, was an object that at first glance I thought was a helicopter. I say that because I could see no wings and it had the general shape of a copter, but more rectangular with kind of a military look. It also had a thinner trailing section that resembled a helicopter's boom. It moved in a straight line. The odd thing is, I could not see any rotors. I was right under it and should have been able to see the main rotor spinning. At about the same time, the loud propeller sound I had been hearing started to fade, and I was listening for the signature whooping sound that helicopters make. I never heard  that sound. I continued to watch as the object actually flew over the small cloud and I continued to watch because I wanted to see it after it passed over the cloud. I must mention here that it was fairly calm and the clouds were moving slowly. I continued to watch as I anticipated the object coming into view again. It was taking so long that I wondered if it was a helicopter that was hovering above the cloud. It shouldn't have taken more than about 15 seconds or so for the object to pass the cloud, given the observed speed of it going over.  I never saw it again, and I don't think I ever heard it. As I continued to watch, the cloud began breaking up and dissipating rapidly. From my perspective, it was as if the object just disappeared . I have a lifelong interest in ufology, and was long ago convinced that they represent a real nuts and bolts phenomenon. However, I'm not convinced of their origin one way or another. I'm skeptical of a lot of stories I've heard and seen and I try to remain objective. I also have a lifelong interest in anything that flies, especially jets and rockets. I consider myself to be a decent observer when it comes to identifying aircraft, at least in general terms. I would like to know if anyone else has seen an object of the same description.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,41.3865,-81.4401

There were no clouds it was a clear night and stars were out.the craft had yellow to white lights on it. But no green or red blinking indicator lights as required by the FAA. I did notice two Aircraft keeping quite a distance from the craft. However they flew in a scattered formation while maintaining a massive distance from the craft. The two planes were very high in altitude and I could hear their! engines when they turned back around to echo the flight pattern of the UAP. I have never seen a triangular shaped craft. Seconds after the UAP skated out of my line of sight. I witnessed a second UAP. The second one appeared as a ball of light. It faded into existence well lit with an orange to yellow/white glow. It was extremely high altitude. Potentially outside of earths atmosphere. It skated across the sky for a few seconds. The distance was enormous. It then abruptly stopped in place. With a wiggling effect changed its direction continued on for a second and faded away as if it had disappeared.

I have never seen a triangular shaped UAP. It didn’t make any noise and was not very high up. I believe it could have been a military vehicle. As most of the UAP’s I have witnessed over the years seem to give off a vibration or energy of unnatural. Or not of this earth. This triangular shaped craft.

While driving home on HWY 27 heading toward Stanley, NC away from the town limits of Mt. Holly with 2 siblings and sister-in-law we noticed a very bright light. Light was yellow and bright enough to be seen in every direction. It looked as if the entire town was lit by this light.  The light seemed to follow our old green station wagon.  I was around 13 or 14 at that time and my brother six years older was driving.  The light followed and as it got closest it was just over the hood of the vehicle. It hovered a while as to observe us.  We were all frightened that it may collide. We then pulled over to the left side of the hwy at an old fish restaurant at the time.  The restaurant was closed and I am not positive of the time yet it was dark.  We sat in the parking lot while the light hovered. In that time period nothing we knew could move this way. Nothing would just hover as it did. The light remained a little while then suddenly took off accross the highway at a high speed and seemed to blow up in a field maybe 250 feet away.  We only saw a small explosion and with the size I think it should have been larger. A police officer from Mt. Holly,  I assume, drove up while we were still standing outside the vehicle and asked us if we saw anything.  To be totally honest, we took him for some kind of authority figure and I am not exactly sure what kind. He said that he had many reports of a bright light over the town.  I have spoken to my sister and sister in law about this and both remember pretty much the exact same thing.  It was many years ago and I am now retired and never got this out of my mind. My sister did mention a fact I had not remembered that the light seemed to have left behind a mist on the car. I would love to know what happened that evening but unfortunately probably never will. I do not know if allot of time could have been lost that night but it does seems that my mom asked what took so long that night as she was cooking dinner. She was at the time arguing about cooking fresh biscuits so I definitely remembered the dispute over leftover biscuits. I actually opened the back door and remembered my mom throwing old biscuits past my head. So you see my memory for crazy things is in tact. It was allot to take in for a teenager and I think at the time I would have sounded crazy if I had spoken about it. In those days you just couldn't.

Post event I signed the official secrets act of the Commonwealth of Australia which forbids me to reveal details of my employment with the Australian Security Inteligence organisation when I was recruited in 1980 which unfortunatly covers this event. I have lived with this event since then, told friends and family but NEVER gone public due to the legal ramifications. I now live in New Zealand and given the years that have passed have come to the decision that this event should be of a public record. Flying in tango whisky xray a shrike aero commander we flew from Port Hedland in Western Australia at an altitude of 500 feet, our operational altitude, heading for the town of Derby. It was clear skies a hot day and on board was myself, Steve Sinclair and company pilot Colin Marks and a female observer who's name I unfortunatly can not remember (I am now 65yo). The aircraft was owned by Transwest Airlines of Western Australia. Our route took us past Cape Leveque and on to the Buccaneer Archipelago tracking coastal. I can not remember the time of day but I can tell you it was November 1978 when our aircraft was bathed in brilliant white light. It was as if someone had taken a flash photo of us, in BROAD DAYLIGHT?. We all knew this light came from BELOW us so Colin banked the aircraft so we could see behind us and that's when we saw it. It could have been some kind of super secret submarine but it was HUGE. It was submerged in one of the many fjords but not far from the surface that we couldn't see it. I remember it like it was yesterday. Huge? About 1.5 kilometers long and 200 metres wide. Where the flash came from was a row of amazing mirror like surfaces that caught the sun and were in the process of folding up. We had several cameras on board including a aircraft mounted hasselblad so took many photos whilst doing a ""sursight"" back to Canberra then this thing moved. I say moved in that accelerated underwater to the extent that at 260 knots, the shrike couldn't keep up due to exhaust gas temperature flying in 40 plus degrees and Colin chose to fly on to Derby. That's when the ""fun"" began. We were met on the apron by the W.A. Police who said we cant leave the aircraft. No other explanation, had to pee in bottles as we were there over 3 hours making us quite angry. I remember the girl o! bserver had to use the toilet and they searched her before letting her go to some grass and urinate. We were detained  until a gulfstream jet arrived then marshaled into a hanger. Suited guys sat in chairs and each of us were searched and ""debriefed"" as in you saw nothing. A guy in jeans seemed the odd one out and I think he was in charge. The police remained outside. Doing coastal surveillance we return the next day after all film was removed including film from my own camera which at the time I never thought to use. The flight back was met with a military Iroquois helicopter who told us to change direction immediately. We could not follow the same flight path back but we could see lots of dust in the distance where LOTS of vehicle movement was taking place. The helicopter that intercepted us was not the only aircraft there at that time. This was taking place in the area we encountered the craft. None of us mentioned our experiences and to date nothing has appeared in the public arena. Proof? I have none other than saying I think I am a credible witness given my work history with the Australian Federal Government.",2021-01-19T00:00:00,,

I am not the witness, I spoke to the witness and was given this information after writing it down. I have small  than illustration can upload later.  -The peculiar aspect to the craft was how it made the witness feel, she could not decide to either get out and try and touch the craft or drive off with her small girls in the car.  -It most definitely was not Venus, a weather balloon, an experimental aircraft, reflections of any type of swamp gas, etc. It was a real, physical, metallic object that behaved unlike any craft the witness had ever observed.  -Witness was a military brat, and father was in Army.  -When the craft took off to the South, it pushed/pulled the water below the craft, signalling it had not only interacted with our atmosphere, but the water in the river. So in short, the craft was hovering ten feet above the top of the bridge, and 50 feet which is the height of the bridge. So a 60 foot distance interaction took place between the craft and the surface of the water when it took off.  -The year/date are not exact, the time of day is 3-4 P.M./15:00-16:00.  -Witness contacted NASA, and Patrick Air Force Base, both told her no craft were in the vicinity.  -Witness contacted multiple news stations, but those stations ignored her, claiming that no sightings were reported by anybody else, so it was grounds for them to ignore it.

My family’s UFO sighting  Hi Peter Davenport,  I’ve just listened with interest to Edition 506 of Howard Hughes’ unexplained podcast which featured you, and I thought what a good show it was. It brought back a memory of something that my family and I saw around 8 years ago.  I have just emailed Howard about what I saw and he suggested I contact you.  I was travelling north back to Bristol, UK (where I live) from the direction of Weston Super Mare. My wife, daughter (who was about 8) and my two-year-old son where in the car with me.  It was around 5pm and a clear blue sky. Kerry, my wife remarked about something in the sky. We tracked it as we approached Bristol. The thing we saw was jet black and remained in the same place, but it was not stationary. I stopped the car near Ashton Court (where the Bristol International Balloon Festival is held) and we all got out of the car.  The thing looked like a rotating black bin liner. I just spoke to my daughter about it and she reminded me that at times it was shaped like a pyramid and as it, rotated it morphed into different shapes.  I had my mobile phone with me, which had a camera which wasn’t great. I tried to record it, but it was too small for the camera on my phone and nothing showed up when I replayed it. The zoom on the camera was not very good. We must have watched it for 10 to 15 minutes before deciding to get back in the car.  The fact that it stayed in the same place made my daughter think that it reminded her of a kite, but with no string. My wife has also reminded me that it remained in exactly the same place throughout the whole time we watched it.  We drove on towards the city centre and kept it in our line of sight for another 5 minutes or so, until the tall buildings of Bristol made it hard to see. Eventually we lost it.  It was hard to tell how big it was. It was either small and low, or big and very far away.  We heard no reports from anyone else and nothing was mentioned in the newspapers. To this day we don’t know what we saw. But it certainly wasn’t an airplane, helicopter, kite or a balloon.  I thought you might like to know about this.  Best wishes and happy new year, A.S.

It was somewhere around 10 PM near the corner of Cheshire Rd. and Rt 23 between Delaware, Ohio, and Lewis Center, Ohio. We were driving down Route 23 heading south towards Lewis Center when J** saw a bright light very distant in the sky; we both joked saying “It’s probably a UFO.”.   So we keep driving and we eventually lose sight and forget about the distant object in the sky but then as we are coming over the precipice of the hill on Route 23 just beyond where the golf course is now, (where the telescope once stood) there was an enormous glowing football-shaped or (Cigar) shaped UFO hanging at nearly 90 degrees right above our heads steadily moving overtop of Route 23 heading towards Lewis Center. It was the most frightening, and awe-inspiring thing I have ever witnessed. It looked like it had fire, and flame red and orange and yellow churning within it, like it was an explosion encased in an invisible Football/Cigar-shaped shield that was just slowly floating just above our heads. We stopped on the side of the highway and got out of the car. It was the largest thing I have ever seen, I felt like an Ant beneath a giant glowing Boot. It was godlike in its scale.   I tried to take a video with my Motorola Razor but the phone just would not work at all even though it had just been working fine. We followed it back to Lewis Center where my friends and I watched it eventually begin to gain altitude then in a dizzying display of lights and flashes it blasted away in the blink of an eye leaving behind a wispy blue/teal vapor trail. I found out later on that the Big Ear Radio Telescope was where they had received the WOW! Signal.   This object took up a large portion of the visible sky as we came upon it. I’m an Airmen, a trained observer. I would estimate the object to be the size of an NFL Football Stadium, just floating above the tree line/highway and houses and buildings. The object was witnessed by at least 5 people other than myself.  To go into a bit more detail as it was gaining altitude glowing blueish/purplish orbs started cascading out of the main Football(Cigar) shaped object one after the other. Each time one appeared the momentum of which they revolved around the main object intensified until all I could see was a spinning blue glow around the main Football object and then in the blink of an eye it shot off into a flash of light in front of it, honestly, it was just like the Enterprise going to warp speed leaving only a bluish trailing haze behind it.   That is all.",2021-01-19T00:00:00,40.1832,-82.9954

It was around 1:00 in the morning.I woke up thirsty for a drink so I went into the kitchen to get some water when I noticed a strange white light through the blinds of my window facing the backyard. I set my drink down on the table while I opened the back door leading to the backyard. While I was walking down the concrete path that lead to the end of my back yard to take a closer look at what was going on I heard a foot step in the immediate vicinity. Obviously shooken up I made a b line towards the door which I exited only to be hit by this paralyzing beam of white light. Next thing I know I'm back in my kitchen sitting upright in my chair. All seemed normal until I looked at the clock on the kitchen stove and saw the time was 5:00 am. Not wanting to bring any unwanted attention to myself I decided to keep it quite for the rest of the school day until what happend next. Being a accomplished track runner for my high school I normally find it easy to not get ! fatigued or have anything unusual happen after I'm exhausted Today was unique in that after I felt absolutely sick to my stomich.I told my coach I wasn't feeling well and he let me go use the bathroom.As soon as I made it I threw up in the toilet but this was no normal looking vomit. It had a solid blue like texture and before I knew it this unusual bug like thing was sitting right there on the bottom of the toilet bowl before crawling down the pipe. I believe there was some type of experiment used on me maybe even containing the creature also known formally as the face hugger. Being the dumb guy I am i still considered to keep this to myself since anybody else would not belief me and think I'm crazy.I tried to get photographic evidence but the creature that came out of my mouth moved to fast. As of typing this I have never experienced such a crazy event in my life and still have trouble believing what happend to me. I can't explain why but I did not feel any fatigue at all! while running and was questioned by everyone why I didn't see! m exuast ed like the rest of the group. Whatever that was that came out of me must have left some type of effect that delays the exhaustion period after physical excersion.It is not my intent to spread false information and would never try to trick the person reading this into something thats simply not true. I just want to encourage anybody else that has experienced the same type of events that happend to me to not be afraid to pubically admit it before it is to late. The only power these creatures have over us is the ability to make us doubt our own memory. I hope everyone who is reading this does not have to go through the same events as I did and never have to come in contact with these horryfying beings.,2021-05-20T00:00:00,33.54170373692077,-101.90381898355756

I am from Delray Beach Florida. At around 5:35 PM I had just arrived home from work and was taking my dog out to the backyard. It was still light out and the sky was getting darker but still pretty light out with the sun lighting the western sky up pink and orange. I looked out the east and the full moon was illuminated hanging in the pale blue sky. Like many evenings just before stars begin to come out I’d like to take my binoculars and try to find stars. But tonight a full moon hanging in the background I couldn’t resist grabbing my binoculars. As I lifted my binoculars towards the moon it just so happened that a passenger jet was flying northbound and I began to follow it. After I became disinterested I started to move my binoculars back towards the east and when doing so I noticed a oval than circular then flat shaped black object in the sky. At first I thought to myself, maybe there is a spiderweb in my binoculars vision as I was pairing from underneath our mango tree sitting down. But simply just by moving my binoculars around and standing up trying not to lose the object in my sites shaking wildly, I managed to keep my binoculars field of vision trained on the object. I sat back down Indian style and secured my elbows to my knees to keep from moving too much and stabilize myself. I thought to myself maybe this object is just a drone, or maybe some sort of balloon, as it shape continue to slowly change over time. But as I continue to watch for the 20 minutes I was trained on the object, I soon realized that it was more like a flat disc in the sky, and definitely really far away and much larger than I first thought it appeared to be. If I were to drop the binoculars down you could not see the object whatsoever because it was so far away and so high up in the sky. At one point it is actually tilted in such a way ! as to catch the sunlight. Being that it was the setting sun light it was more of an orange colored light and it reflected off the object for a moment making it appear more silver than black at this time. As I continue to watch it I began to think to myself is this thing ever going to do any maneuvers other than just seeming to rise higher and higher towards the very very high clouds that you get at the very top of the atmosphere. As a “rise so high that it was getting even harder to see what the binoculars it was at that moment that it literally just sped off out of you from left to right so fast it’s strict in my vision. I looked everywhere I could in the sky from the lowest horizon above the trees all the way back up and straight above me and all around the moon again but could not find the object it had just disappeared as to which I honestly think it just took off faster than anything I’ve ever seen before. I hate to use this description but it really did look like that object that the United States Air Force had released of that object that they followed that seem to do maneuvers that they never saw before. The video where the guy was saying look at that dude look at th! at dude! I hope that my description is taken seriously and it was very interesting to see and I feel privileged to have witnessed it. Thank you for your time if you have any questions you may contact me if there’s a place to put My contact info. Sincerely,  James Ford",2020-12-23T00:00:00,26.455547430830038,-80.11589308300395

I responded at first by saying Jupiter is visible from earth right now and maybe that’s it. She says no it’s moving! I believed her but asked her to take a video so she could send it to me.

Still not able to make them out I hang up the phone to go outside and record. The video I sent is from the street my back door is on. 	These things continued to fly/float over my apartment towards I-95n and the mall. Thirty seconds into recording, one of the glowing orbs starts to dim like a controlled light switch in your house. The other object does the same about 2 seconds after. They both dimmed to the point they became invisible in the dark night sky. I then went down the street to the closest patch of grass to throw some in the air to check wind direction. The wind was blowing southwest and these UFO’s were headed northeast. This made me think it can’t be balloons of some sort. The way it was moving seemed like it was propelled by something. Both crafts moved at the same exact speed and in synchrony.

Over San Marcos, CA area. Moving in a westerly direction northwest of where I was located. My girlfriend and I were out on our balcony just enjoying the night air and looking at the stars and planets like we do from time to time. I noticed one that appeared to be brighter than usual. I mistook it for the star Arcturus if I remember correctly and tried to “prove it” to my girlfriend using the Star Chart app on my phone. She interrupted and told me it was moving. I also noticed it moving. There were no flashing lights and it was moving way to slow to be a plane. There was no noise that we could hear like with the planes that come into our area. I snapped a quick pic and we ran outside into the street to try and get a better look as the UFO was moving behind our neighboring building. By the time we got down to the street we could not see it anymore. After looking at the pic there wasn’t much to see until I zoomed in on the point! of light and it revealed more than I’d seen before in  any other pictures of the night sky I have taken. Ive since taken pictures of planes in the area with landing lights on and they look nothing like this picture.",2021-10-19T00:00:00,33.13531750972763,-117.1663392996109

I witnessed 3 bright but silent objects hovering approximately for 30-40 seconds and then a bright flash almost like the light was scanning from front to back but the light was intense almost as bright as a spot light on a helicopter. Then I was able to see something/someone lowered out of one of the crafts into the field across the street then quickly go back up into the craft. Shortly after the 3 bright lights flashed and disappeared but could see the light trails behind them and still with out making any noise. I possibly have this on my home security system.,2021-10-19T00:00:00,41.4286,-73.1424

I looked up and spotted a large, irregularly-shaped diamond-like object travelling at a high rate of speed overhead. By my estimations, the object was flying at an altitude of 8,000-10,000 feet, and was between roughly 100 and 120 feet in length, though this was hard to determine as it was dark outside and I could only vaguely discern the sides of the object. There were 3 solid yellow lights on its points, and a blinking white light in its center. It was completely silent as it passed. It was heading northeast over Interstate 83, and disappeared from my field of vision after about 1 minute.",2021-10-19T00:00:00,39.96327543160691,-76.71886879150067
