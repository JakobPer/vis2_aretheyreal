PD)) SIGHTING # 27 – August 16, 2013 – 4th SIGHTING OF A SILVER-GOLD, GLOWING ELONGATED/FOOTBALL SHAPED UFO POSSIBLY EMERGING FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO, AND FIRST SIGHTING OF AN APPARENT PORTAL OR LARGE FIREBALL.  I arrived at my regular skywatch location at 9:20 p.m. on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, USA, just north of the rock jetty at Blind Pass.  The weather was totally overcast for the first half hour after I arrived, and then cleared to partly cloudy, with clouds over the horizon of the Gulf.  I was scanning the horizon, 50 percent of the time with binoculars, and 50 percent of the time without binocs, for a whole hour and 10 minutes without seeing anything, when at 10:30, while looking through my binoculars, I briefly saw the same kind of “double-craft” UFOs I had seen on previous nights, in precisely the same location as before, one above the other, apparently having just emerged from the Gulf.  I say apparently emerging from the water because, like before, the craft on the bottom was right on the horizon or just a little tad below it, and smaller for a moment before it became the size of the one above before disappearing.  I watched it for a good 5 seconds before the lights went out.  I got VERY lucky with this sighting because it could only have been see through binoculars, and when you think about catching something for only a few seconds out of 70 minutes of observation, it’s almost like finding a needle in a haystack.  If others are emerging and then turning out the lights this quickly – and I did see this before – who knows how many of the things could be out there.  I estimate that it was about 7 miles away from me.  That was all I saw in that northern area until I left at 11 p.m.  At 10:50 an orange “fireball” appeared due west of me over the Gulf, about 40 degrees above the horizon, and no more than 5 miles away.  It spooked me a bit when it rapidly expanded from the size of a small pea at arms length, to the size of a baseball or large orange, and began glowing and pulsating mostly red, but with some bluish and white in it too.  After the 10 seconds it took to expand, the edges started “shimmering” with different colors, and my heart seemed to skip a few beats.  I pointed it out to a couple of people who were walking down the beach and told them it was a UFO and they were fascinated too.  By the time I remembered to look at it through my binoculars, it started shrinking down and then disappeared after about 20 to 25 seconds.  It stayed in one place during this time.  This object looked uncannily like one of those “star gates” like you see on TV It really gave me a start because I was almost expecting for the sky to start opening up!  I continued sky watching through out for another 10 minutes or so before the sand flies drove me back home at 11 p.m.  The idea that it might have been some kind of a portal or “star gate” didn't strike me until the next morning.  I will next report on my conclusions of the past 27 sightings I and others in the immediate area have had over 39 nights of observation, during 8 weeks since I had my first sighting here on June 24, 2013.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

ID headl ights on cars very distinct blue hue in perfect circles id say each circle was maybe 6-10 feet around very large, i take into consideration what it were flashlights i say ok then why i see no beam going up ward and how can they blink and spin so perfect in sync youd have to have more then one person controlling all the flashlights by hand at once perfectly and again why would any one do this for 5 mins then stop, it makes no sence to me ither way i googled blue lights in california sky in google news and seen alot of simular stories, i also found this web sight, you can take my experience as you will, i also was not high or drunk i am of perfect mental capacity i know i was not hallucinating i was in a normal state of mind, you can say this guy made it up or you can belive what i say its not going to change what i seen, i also could not here any sounds of motor noise or engine it was silent",2013-08-30T00:00:00,37.5949,-120.95769999999999

It was traveling in what appeared to be a southerly direction along the coastal region. Thinking that I should get some kind of point of reference regarding size and such,  I held out my hand at arm's length. The UFO was gliding along very slowly, in a straight path, taking about 2 minutes to travel what measured at arm's length to be between 10 and 12 inches.  The size of the craft, using my thumbnail at arm's length, was about 1/2 an inch. And it was a medium to medium dark RASPBERRY RED...not the tone of red like on emergency vehicle lights, or on traditional aviation lights...and it pulsated slowly. The lighting of the craft seemed to come from within the object, and not from an external! light source.  It continued along its flight path at what appeared to be the same altitude and direction for the entire 2 minutes that I was able to see it.  When it was no longer visible, I came inside, marked this event on my calendar, told my husband that I just saw a UFO and that I had to report it to NUFORC.

The colors of these lights slowly alternated between red and white when seen through binoculars, but the object looked mostly white (pulsating) without binoculars.  At around the same time I started watching with binoculars, the object began to move across the sky in a straight path towards us (the two witnesses). At one point during this flight, an actual plane flew under it (I think there was a lot of distance between the two, but I’m not sure).  The plane and unidentified object were very different from each other.  The plane was closer to the ground than the other object.  The plane was much smaller, went out of view much faster, and the blinking lights on the plane were much clearer.

To be more exact, it started slightly south of I 80/I 90 (Ohio Turnpike).  I am not certain whether it was moving, due to my rate of speed (60 mph), but if it were moving, it was headed south.  It appeared, though, to be stationary.  The formation appeared to be somewhat close to the ground (much lower than a plane would be on approach to the Toledo Express Airport-4 miles away).  I would estimate the fo! rmation as having been 1/4 mile west of I 475. I counted 12 lights at first, but then a 13th light appeared faintly, almost flickering, towards the end (northern tail) of the formation.  It brightened and its luminosity matched the other lights.  The formation changed slightly twice (as if a few of the lights were swapping places), but wholly in part, kept its original shape.  The lights never changed elevation so they were not floating or falling, and the color remained constant.  When I first noticed the formation, my first thought was, “Wow, that is the brightest, closest constellation that I’ve ever seen.”  It’s then that my eyes noticed far more than the initial cluster of 4 or 5 lights and took in the entire formation.  The formation was at least 1.5 mile long and could have been as long as 2 miles.  Simply put, it was a line of 13 lights (with some derivation from a conceptual straight line) ascending at approximately 30 degrees. I was unable to take a picture due to traffic conditions (too dangerous to pull over) and the fact that I was driving.  Once I reached my exit, I turned left and headed west about 1 mile and parked in a Boston Market fast food drive-thru.  I was looking south over a tree line and I would say that my car was almost perfectly lined with the tail of the formation.  At that point (2 minutes after exiting), I could still see 2 lights and they quickly disappeared (literally went out).  It was approximately 10:38 pm.  There was a male employee sitting on the curb of the parking lot waiting for a ride.  I rolled down my window and asked him if he had seen what I had seen.  He replied, “No,” which wasn’t surprising (he was nose-first in his cell phone). From there I traveled west 1 mile to my apartment.  I called media outlets, Lucas County Sheriff Dept, Lucas County Port Authority, Toledo Express Airport, Ohio State Highway Patrol, and the 180th Fighter Wing of the Air National Guard.  The media was uninterested and the law was annoyed.  The LCPA, Toledo Express, and The 180th assured me that flight traffic was at a minimum for the evening and that there was no radar evidence of a craft (or crafts) at that time/location.  The LCPA confirmed that the 180th was not running drills or maneuvers.  I also found a night kite flying group (online) based in Perrysburg.  I called their president this morning and he assured me that their flying grounds, so to speak, are located at least 10 miles to the south east of my sighting, and sometimes, weather permitting, 15 miles to the south. I called the news outlets once again this morning and at least got WTVG Ch. 13 to take my name and number.  For research and record keeping purposes, I am a 32 year old white unmarried, but dating, man.  I have a B.S. degree in education and have worked in sales and marketing for the past 7 years.

Lots of stars and sure enough I saw a large light moving across the sky at rapid speed, almost straight overhead. it appeared to be at very high altittude perhaps outside our atmosphere and then I noticed a smaller similar object trailing its trajectory at the exact same speed and flight path but a considerable distance behind the first object which was much larger. I watched them both move acros the entire overhead sky and when they got to about 45 deg from my position they started to fade and simply dissapeared?  The first object was much bigger than anything in the sky and the second was about the size and appearance of a small star but both were moving at incredible speed because they covered the entire sky in just a short time ?  So it had to be in excess of 25k mph .   What has stuck with me as well is that prior to this I had been having thoughts that I was going to see a UFO ! and that night I just had a powerful thought and went outside solely because of that premonition and looked up and immedediately saw the large object moving very fast across the sky ? I have no idea what I saw , but I have known nearly my entire life that something is out there because I saw a UFO when I was a small child at Lake Havasu on the Arizona side . Lots of people saw it and were quite afraid and disturbed . It looked like a ball of fire hovering about 5 miles away between two mountains on the other side of the river and it just stayed there for a longtime before it started moving around and then just dissappeared ? So I grew up understanding that such things exist but not fully understanding exactly what they are . I have been told I was highly telepathic and spiritual because others have felt my thoughts ? Pretty strange , but I have had all manner of odd and very different experiences in my life that are completely unexplainable . For me the important part of th! is was the fact that I seriously knew about 2 weeks prior that! soemthi ng like this was gonna happen and it did . I am relatively certain it is not over and more to come ? I can just feel it but don't know why ? Just a feeling and what I saw was definitely real . As real as the sun or the moon . I have pondered the UFO phenom considerably over many years and I am convinced that there is a stong connection between UFOs/so called aliens and what we all percieve as God ? It is all connected for sure and I think I know how and why ? Tomorrow nite I am going out to a remote spot and view the Mega Moon and take some photpgraphs and I halfway expect to see more ? Maybe not but tomorrow ,but I have a strongfeeling I will and soon . I honestly don't have any idea where this came from exactly it is just a feeling ? And I have learned to pay attention to my intuition or feelings ! I pray and meditate a lot and am very much in touch with my own powers and inner self . I am 65 years old and very fit and healthy and strong . For me this was a sign of some so! rt and I am still pondering it and completely open to additional information . The only reason I responded is to see if others reported the same phenom at the same time or ? We are being sent messages of some sort or warnings or something ? not sure yet but I am working on it in my own way !",2013-07-03T00:00:00,45.8504,-119.213

There were few clouds in the sky and I was observing the color gradations of the sky when I noticed a strange bright object in the SSW sky.  It appeared to be like a comet with a tail, only it was hanging in the sky.  Color was like a yellowish and I couldn't tell if it might be a strangely symetrical cloud catching the sunset light.  The ""tail"" or point of the cone was pointing up and right (/). While still driving I scanned the horizon and noticed two more of these ""comet"" or cone objects, as well as a what appeared to be a LARGE bright star or planet- that is it was a bright cirle or sphere.  It was too big though, and the sky was in that last light where it is still too early for the first star to show.  All these objects were relatively low on the horizon, and the two other cones were oriented differently - one with the til pointing straight up, and the other pointing to the left (\),(opposite the one on the other side of the sky). I exited I-91 and entered the Lowes parking lot, which both lowered my perspective (being lower than the highway), and partially blocked my view because the building was high.  I maintained visual on the cone and sphere in the more westerly part of the sky.  I was able to ascertain that the cone was in motion bcause I parked with it visible between branches on a tree.  It was actually moving quite fast (down and left toward the horizon), and within a minute or so was out of view. I then fixed my vision on the bright sphere and watched it for a minute or two.  Suddenly it seemed to be getting smaller, and then disappeared completely from the clear sky.  It was a matter of 5-10 seconds from when it was static size to when it became invisible. I went into the store for 5 minutes, and returned to the highway heading southbound once again.  This raised my perspective once again, and I was able to see the object on the right once again.  It had changed shape, gotten slightly larger (closer, atmospheric distortion??), and was lower on the horizon.  It now had a rather flat ""top"", and a curved ""belly"", still with a diagonal orientation (/).  I was only able to see it for another coupe minutes because I drove into the city and view was blocked by buildings.  I was on the phone with my girlfriend throughout the duration of the experience describing to her in real time what was happening.  I don't know if you'd call that a witness.

The sky was slightly overcast and the full moon had not risen yet, so it was quite dark.  Since my last sighting late August, I had not been sky watching much since then because of health problems, but nonetheless have been out for short periods of time at least a dozen times since then, and saw nothing of consequence.  I was thinking that all of the concentrated action of the past summer was pretty much over until last night.  At 7:15 p.m. one of the :fireballs” came on briefly, due west of me, about 40 degrees up in the sky, and in front of clouds on the horizon.  It came on as they usually do, like on a dimmer switch.  From when it first showed up until when in went out was about 5 seconds.  A few minutes later, another fireball came on in the same fashion, just a bit to the left (south) of the first one.  It also went out after about 5 seconds.  These lights were a little bit larger than Venus – about the size of a pea at arms length.  Then, about 4 or 5 minutes later, I saw for the first time, a very small orange-red light “freefalling” about ¼ the speed of a falling meteor.  I first spotted it at about 60 degrees above the horizon, and it fell to about 35 degrees, and then just stopped and hovered.  Then it got very bright, as bright as Venus.  It seemed like it was not much more than a mile or so away from me, like the previous.  Then it too went out for a few seconds and then came back on.  It stayed on and another one came on just to the right of it, about a finger-width away and to the right.  Then the second one went out while the first stayed on, and a third one came on just to the right to where the second one went out.  After that, the one on the far left and the one on the far right went out for a short second, then came back on, followed by three more lights of the same color and intensity, in a very straight and vertical line, equidistant apart by a pinky finger width, directly below the light! on the right.  Then all the lights on the right went out briefly, and then came back on starting at the top, 1,2,3,4 – in a staged way.  With the light in the upper left staying on during this time, and the middle top one coming back on briefly, it liked something like a HUGE kind of box structure.  This entire event took about 3 minutes, and then all of the lights went out!  I would venture an educated guess that the “structure” was perhaps 1 but no more than 2 miles away from me, and around 1,000 to 1,500 feed above the Gulf of Mexico.  The whole experience gave me quite a fright both because of it’s size, closeness, and the fact that it was the first UFO activity I seen in my area in over 2 months.  I’m excited that they might be coming back!",2013-12-02T00:00:00,,

They stayed pretty even and straight, so our minds went to the thought of it being a plane just flying really low.   We went to the store, and went on with our night.

To whom it may concern,  This is my account of what my daughter and I saw on the night of November 19th, 2013.  My daughter has filed her own report, per instructions of Mr. Davenport. Approximately 5:55pm, my daughter and I decided to go the store, and as we turned onto the next block to leave, heading north, we spotted two solid blue lights, evenly spaced about 200ft apart, right in front of our view, but about a mile away.  There was a red flashing light next to one of the blue solid lights.   The craft was moving very slowly to the north/northeast.  We figured it may be a normal aircraft, although we have never seen a craft, other than a helicopter, move that slow, so we ignored it and continued to the store.  On our way home from the store, approximately 6:48pm, I was looking out the car window, when I saw three green lights, triangular in shape, suspended about 300-350ft off the ground, staying in the same spot, again with one red flashing light next to one of the green lights.  It was just outside the window on the west side of the road.   I told my daughter to take the next road to the right, which has no lights, and when she asked why, I pointed to the lights.  She pulled over and I rolled the window down to take a video with my phone.    My daughter gave me her iphone, and I started to record.  Shortly after starting the recording, the object started to move away at a very slow speed, heading north/northeast. It started to move a little faster, but never just took off at a high rate of speed.  I recorded it until I couldn't see it on her phone any longer, at which time, we left and went home.   I have been completely dumbfounded since seeing it, and must say that I am still not sure what I saw, but I've never seen anything of this shape, with the ability to stay in one place, with absolutely no sound coming from it.   We have sent the video I took to Mr. Davenport, with ufo video by barnard as the subject, using the director@ufocenter.com address.

It was 6:20 pm.  We had arrived back at my home in the country where my friend's van was parked.  It was past dusk and a fairly clear night.  Normally when I come home and the lights from the car hit the chicken coop the chicken are out wanting to get fed, along with the cats and dogs.   The 1st thing I notice the only ones out where a couple cats. .   My friend got out and said what that is and pointed up.  I look up above the trees (a good estimate is 250 to 500 ft. off the top of the oaks) was a huge triangle shape object.  It was big the; tip of say the forward edge of the left side was by the pool and the leading edge of the right was over the trees in to the back yard.  I would say bigger than a C5A Galaxy even bigger that that big Russian heavy-lift plane I seen In Bosnia.   I could almost make out what appeared to be seams in the material but it was not shiny, duller and like carbon fiber.  The leading edge was rounded and there was no tail to say, (in today’s aircraft everything has a vertical stabilizer with a stabilizer or ailerons.  Sort of like a big T or a little t.  The anti-collision lights go on top, bottom, left and right.)  This had none of those.   The object appeared to be a very big triangle, no sound what so ever came from it.  Moving at 60 knots or less I would think; me and my friend differ on this he said it took a few minutes to get over the house I think more like 5 before it was out over the field.   I walked under it trying to make out markings but it was just blending in with the sky so good the only way to tell the outline was it was blocking out the stars and what few clouds there where.  Every now and again I could almost make out what appeared to be a seam but it seems almost fluid as it would simply blend in again.   The ends had a reddish/pinkish glow but not strobes or rotating beacons.  I could not make out a cockpit.  It turned to the south east towards Moody air force base as if it was in a pattern but way too low.  As it did this I could see the back of it.  This is why I say it look like the big wing.   The light on the back were from left to right and white not strobes but pulsing.  My friend said that a tight formation then as it banked he said john that 1 single object I said yea I know but I don’t know what it is.   As it leveled out it appeared that a small object (this could have been a chase plane just appeared off to the left and it had the standard red and white strobes (T) shape but next to this object it look like a fly smaller that a T38 , or A10, but still no noise at all.   It appeared to go about 6 to 8 miles and turn right (south) and keep going; my friend followed it in his van for a while but lost it.   Funny thing the next day his C Crain Radio that he records news on for work, well he turn it on at work and all his file where erased.  Not just a few but all.  And at lunch he went to update it and all the file just came back.

I said out loud to myself “what the hell was that?” I took my glasses off and looked back to the area where the orange light was hovering. I still saw the light.  I put my glasses back on.  I decided to video record the orange light.   I ran back into my house and retrieved my phone from my purse. I then went to my back door and started recording.

My roommate and I watched some kind of UFO fly over our house. It flew slowly, and there are almost no clouds in the sky, so we could see it pretty clearly. It took 10-20 seconds to go behind the tree next to the house, then another 30-60 to disappear into the cloud-haze on the horizon on the other side (moving NE to SW, toward the city). It wasn’t blinking like the normal aircraft we get flying over (we’re in a military flight training path), and it made no noise.  It also flew in a really erratic way, always tending to the SW but zig-zagging a little. We both commented that it looked “wobbly.”  It was just a steady, round, bright white light with what appeared to be some kind of mist or haze around it. We could see the stars around it clearly, but this light looked foggy, even though it was large and not behind any clouds. Less than 2 minutes later, two helicopters flew over. One came from the NE, almost along the path the UFO took, and the other came from somewhere to the west.  It was just over the horizon, behind the hill, and I couldn’t see it for more than a couple of seconds at a time.  Both were flying really low, really fast, and they appeared to converge on the area where we’d last seen the light.  Although the UFO had disappeared into the clouds, we were able to see the blinking lights from the helicopters until they flew behind tree cover.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,35.05733591160221,-92.46246298342541

It looked abnormal to me so as soon as I pulled into my driveway I got out of my car and walked to the road where I could see the lights.   Upon observation I saw that the lights were traveling slowly in my direction.  I watched as it approached and it seemed to be maybe 2500 or 3000 feet in the air.  It was dark outside but the lights were very bright.  It appeared to be a black triangle with a white light on each of the three corners with one red light in the very middle of the craft. The white lights were blinking but I don't recall if the red one was or not. As it passed I noticed it was totally silent and on the back end of the craft I could almost make out a line of dimmer lights that were in between the rear corner lights. It may have been a reflection off the craft or dimmer lights, it was hard to tell. Th! e craft traveled in a straight line and was starting to go behind the treeline. No leaves on the trees yet. There were two jets higher in the sky that seemed to be following it. One of the jets was a lot higher than the craft and the second, even higher than that. I could hear the jets and was slightly annoyed because of the fact that since the triangular craft was so low I knew the sound was not coming from that. If it were a plane or jet that low it would have been much louder than the sound of the jets I heard. This thing seemed to silently glide across the sky. The craft was traveling in a north-easterly direction and the whole sighting took place within a four minute period. This also took place on a full moon, which was really big, by the way.

So I immediately ran into our ((deleted--area))  and summoned as many interested witnesses as I could by asking everyone if they wanted to witness some UFO’s.  First thing; I had our ((deleted)) attendant accompany me as he along with many of his neighbors had personally witnessed over thirty of these same objects traveling through a couple weeks before I had over 4 months ago.  When we and the some 10 to 12 guests arrived on the scene, we were all amazed and perplexed at the show the near dozen of these firey orange objects were putting on as they floated around drifting upward and slowly gliding around from north to south with their distinctive luminous orange glow.   Because I was trying to acquire as many witnesses as possible, I was unable to closely examine the movements and activity of the objects for very long.  However, from what I did witness, they appeared and acted exactly the same as those I had witnessed some months back. After about 7 minutes had passed, and I was scrambling to get more witnesses to observe the phenomena and get it recorded, suddenly all but a few ((deleted)) came back in side and said they all just vanished.   I then worked my way back out and there remained one mother and her daughter who showed me the one orange ufo remaining.  They told me that after all the ufos vanished and everyone left, this one object suddenly lit up and remained as it was hovering with its’ distinct orange glow.   We watched on for a few minutes as this object stayed hovering only to lose its luminosity and vanish in thin air like the others…   The mother then showed me the multiple pictures she took with her smart phone and I gave her my email address and she got my name and insisted that her and her daughter would email me the pictures as well as a detailed account of what they witnessed. As I write this report, I am still waiting and hoping she delivers on her words. This was an extraordinary event witnessed by over 10 people who were all mesmerized by the show these objects put on.  In fact a couple ((deleted)) came to me afterwards and thanked me very much for alerting them so they could witness the extraordinary phenomena.   In hindsight, however it was very disconcerting to me that 2 of the teenagers who caught the whole incident on video went right back into the ((deleted)) showed just a few people and then went right back to watching a football game like nothing even happened.

While driving south through downtown Spokane- passing Spokane Club on the right.  I looked out of the drivers window while stopped at traffic light.  I noticed a steady orange light between the tree branches to my left.  The light was some distance above the trees, at about a 60 degree angle relative to my car.   I pointed out the object to my wife and opened the moon roof of the car so she could see.  My son in the back seat just behind me also saw the object.   At that time I noticed two other bright orange objects but lower and seemed to be following the first object spotted yet the tree were in a line from west to east.  The traffic light had changed so I needed to move and briefly thought they might have been military aircraft.  These lights did not make a sound I could hear, were not common aircraft light colors, and did not strobe so I dismissed that idea.  The lights were moving east-to-west against the prevailing winds which would exclude luminaria.  I thought the lights were very odd.   We proceeded south to the freeway onramp since we were headed home to the east in Spokane Valley.  I told my wife and son the keep an eye out for the objects we had just seen since I had to drive.  The highway is elevated above the city so we had a better view above the buildings.  I glanced several times over my shoulder to the left toward the objects.  I was able to get a good estimate of the altitude.  There were three objects I could clearly make out, but possibly four or five, since I was driving I was only able to focus on the first three objects.  Object furthest to the west (which I believe was the first object) was at about 1250 feet, the second two were at about 450 feet (above ground level).  They were about evenly spaced about 500 feet apart horizontally.  From I-90 the first object was roughly over Masonic Temple with the last object being over River Park Square.  I could clearly triangulate from the first sighting, the freeway sightings, and using size of the buildings in downtown Spokane for a reference.   After getting home I dropped off my wife, son and car at the house, this was about 2110.  I got in my truck and headed back downtown to investigate the objects, while driving to roof of parking garage at Sacred Heart Medical Center there was a brief flash of light in the pickup,  I think this was a mercury vapor streetlamp flashing or a surge to the truck cab lamp so not concerned.  Only stopped briefly to observe on the top level of west parking garage at SHMC.  No objects visible over Spokane at this time.   Returned home at 2130.",2013-10-14T00:00:00,47.68357629392971,-117.38633105431309

So she and I started back towards my car to grab it.  We were about 100 feet from the observing sight when the rest of the group started calling & shouting out for us to look up!!  There it was, at about 9:20pm pacific time around 30 degrees up in the southwestern sky; a deep orange glowing/pulsating light.  At first I thought it was a meteor burning up but then it changed directions! We ran back to the observing sight all the while this object was zig-zagging in the sky.  I loosened the grips of the telescope and tried to view the object more closely.  I managed to see it in the finder scope.  I couldn’t tell the shape of the actual “ship” but there was a dark spot surrounded by a deep orange light and it was indeed moving around left, right, up & down.

It appeared to the northeast of our position in the Aptos hills of Santa Cruz County and we would estimate it was perhaps 3 to 7 miles away at approximately 30 degrees over the hill beyond our home.  It appeared to be positioned in the area over the San Andreas Fault.  When viewed through binoculars it was producing a changing multi-colored light array on what appeared to be the bottom of the object.  My wife could make out a dome or disc shape above the light array.  I thought I could also.  The array stayed essentially horizontal most of the time. At one point my wife said a ray of light come out of the object. The object appeared to rock slightly from side to side and at one time seemed to be completely sideways with the light array going into a vertical position.   The evening was dark except for the stars and some ambient light from San Jose, Watsonville and Monterey.  No moon was in evidence.  During the hour that we checked in on the object it remained in the same approximate position except for its slight wavering.   The stars continued their upward movement during that time.  In particular I noted the Pleiades rising about 20 degrees to the right of the object while it remained essentially in the same location.

My daughter and I saw 5-7 white lights in a shifting formation travel quickly across the Idaho night sky in a southwesterly direction.,Rexburg,ID,2013-10-05T21:15:00,formation,3 seconds,"Occurred : 10/5/2013 21:15  (Entered as : 10/05/13 21:15) Reported: 10/5/2013 11:05:13 PM 23:05 Posted: 10/14/2013 Location: Rexburg, ID Shape: Formation Duration:3 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102994.html,"My daughter and I saw 5-7 white lights in a shifting formation travel quickly across the Idaho night sky in a southwesterly direction. My 9-year-old daughter and I went for a quick evening stroll, leaving the home we own a little after 9:00 pm Mountain Time.  It was dark, except for artificial lights and stars—we never noticed the moon.  We walked due south, up a street that climbs a hill, and discussed balance in life.  We looked at the stars as we walked, pointing out the big and little dippers and the North Star.  We soon headed back down the hill. About one third of the way home, I noticed that the stars of the big dipper were brighter—there was not as much light pollution.  So, we stopped at around 9:15. I pointed out the dippers again.  The handle of the big dipper was visible through some power lines.  The stars of the little dipper were all visible now.  The north star was directly in front of us over the sidewalk we were on, since Harvard runs north to south.  We estimate that we were about 100 feet northeast from an 18-plex apartment complex. As we gazed into the sky towards the big dipper, my daughter suddenly asked, “What is that?”  I didn’t even have to look down at her to see where she was pointing, because something moving in the sky caught my eye.  It was higher in the sky than the dippers.  It was about 75 degrees above the horizon in a west-north-west direction from us.  I almost said, “It’s a satellite,” but before I could say that, I noticed there were many (5 to 7) of these objects clustered in what appeared to be a tight v-shaped formation that probably could have barely fit behind a quarter held at arm’s length, and they were moving much faster than a satellite.  Within, I think, about two to three seconds, maybe even less than two, they had moved quickly across the sky to a point about 40 degrees above the horizon and approximately west-south-west from where we were standing.  If I extend one arm completely and point to the approximate starting place, and extend my other arm and point to the approximate vanishing place, the tips of my pointing fingers are approximately 22-23 inches apart, and they are approximately 30 inches from my eyes.  I stand 5’8”.  The objects traveled much faster than an airplane in a southwest direction, parallel to the Milky Way, which we could dimly make out directly overhead, running from the southwest to the northwest.  The objects felt close and far away at the same time, but they made no noise, despite their incredible speed. The lights were all white, and they changed position relative to each other, but I could not describe exactly how.  They started in a v shape, but one light from the back of the formation flew towards the front of it, and they may have even straightened out into a straight line by the time they disappeared from view.  I cannot honestly remember what formation they had when I last saw them, but I know they started v-shaped, and they changed formation.  There was no other color but white.  There was no flashing; the six round objects were each a solid, if fuzzy, white light.  They were dim, not as brilliant as the stars in the sky, but they were much larger—probably ten times the size of the brightest star we could see (at about 80 degrees in the western sky). I am not sure how they vanished, but as quickly as I realized I was seeing them, they were gone again.  They may have disappeared into the light pollution coming from the apartment complex, because they were not very bright, they may have vanished behind the complex, they may have gone beyond the horizon, or they may have simply vanished.  We later identified several jet airplanes flying high in the sky, and these unidentified objects were much larger, much less brilliant, much whiter—with a very uniform whiteness—much faster, and, we felt, much closer than the jets. At about the same moment the objects were vanishing from view, I finally answered my daughter’s question. “I think that’s a UFO!” I said.  Just two nights earlier, I had been reading to my children about UFOs. We read the “Mysteries of the Sky” chapter from Mysteries and Fantasies, a children’s encyclopedia volume by World Book, published in 1986.  The balanced discussion of UFOs that we read convinced me that unidentified objects exist, but that most things people see are probably explainable—like meteors, ball lightning, weather balloons, airplanes, spotlights, etc.  I was amazed at the sheer number of people claiming to see unidentified things, and I marveled that these were intelligent, educated people.  Although I do not personally believe in monstrous aliens traveling between worlds to destroy us (if they are out there and intelligent enough to travel undetected, they are probably less violent than we are), I do believe in the spiritual and supernatural, and I wondered if ! I would ever get to see anything like the UFOs we read about.  However, as we stargazed tonight, I was not thinking about UFOs until after we saw what we saw.   I called the National UFO Reporting Center about 2 minutes after returning home, at about 9:24 PM. I teach accounting at a university.  I am an entrepreneur and a CPA with a Masters degree in taxation.  My 9-year-old daughter (in 4th grade) reads about two novels a week and loves to write.  She dictated her own version of the story to me (only because I can type faster). I did not have her read my version first.  Her version is completely independent of my version. My Daughter’s Version:  We were taking a late-night stroll.  We looked up into the sky and looked at all the constellations.  We saw the W-shape of Cassiopeia and the little dipper and the big dipper.  We were heading back home, and we were getting close when Dad said, “Oh, we have a more clear view of the big dipper right here; the lights aren’t as bright.” We were looking out at it, and then we started looking for the other constellations to see if they were brighter.  We saw the little dipper, and as we were looking at it, these big circle lights came on right in the middle of the Milky Way.  They were kind of in a v-formation, like wild geese fly in migration.  They were flying along in that v-shape, and then they shifted.  They kind of went into a circle, and then the circle straightened out into a two-inch long line.  They started flying out of our sight behind the corner of the 18-plex. When I first saw them, I thought they were just a really low plane.  It wasn’t really a sharp V.  The corner was sha! rp, but it was kind of close to a straight line; it wasn’t really acute, it was kind of oblique.  I thought it was just a wide-winged plane.  But then I remembered what planes look like in the sky; they just look light little flashing lights that are tiny, with green and red and white, like Christmas colors.  And, it’s like, what the heck?  That’s a weird plane.  And it went flying over and started shifting, and that was weird.  Like I said, it shifted into an O and then a straight line.  And they were kind of bright, but they weren’t as shining as the stars.  They were big, and the stars are small.  The stars have kind of a sharp circle in the middle and the rest of it is just a shine.  Well, these things were a lot bigger than the stars, and they kind of didn’t just break out into shine like stars do, they were kind of just made out of one shine; kind of they were more shiny in the middle than on the sides.  They kind of just appeared right out of the little dipper, and then they st! arted soaring across the sky southwest, and they just disappea! red near the corner of the 18-plex.  They looked near at first, like a really close plane.  But they also looked far; they weren’t as far away as a jet plane, and they weren’t as close as a streetlamp, and they weren’t that big, either.  They were kind of the size of the head of an average nail.  They didn’t make any noise at all.  They just soared across the sky and shifted shapes.  And they never twinkled or blinked like stars do.  They were big and constant, except that they were moving around, and they had just appeared in the sky, and they disappeared in the sky.  I couldn’t tell if they were near, or if they were far.  All I was hearing was the rustling of the leaves and some people talking in the distance.",2013-10-14T00:00:00,43.78304222222222,-111.76394222222223

It was 8:13pm, and due north between the big dipper and the north star my friend first spotted a ball of light that appeared in the sky.  The ball of light appeared to get brighter and fall rapidly, from where it first appeared, it descended in a straight line towards earth, than it made a loop de loop (one complete circle), than it went right and left in a roller coaster type of action, and it made a very sharp left turn going west.  As the light made a sharp left turn the brightness faded and it seemed to have slowed down after it made the left turn and the ball of light began to fade and than as fast as it appeared it was gone. My friend and I stayed there till 9:30pm, and the clouds began to move in.  We did not see anything more.  My friend who is very skeptical, truly could not explain this.

At first I thought it was a fleet of helicopters, there must have been at least a dozen lights. The lights were red to orange and they were steady, there was no pulsation.  They started out scattered but slowly made their way into a large almost rectangular shape.  It was easily the size of 4-5 football fields. It struck me as strange because the lights were very small and very low in the air.  The best way I could describe them would to be to compare them to floating ping pong balls.  They moved slowly and in formation.  Multiple people pulled to the side of the road and began taking videos and photos. It was much to large and too low to be an airplane, and it was too small and too quiet to be helicopters. There was no sound what so ever, just floating lights.  It was eerily beautiful. My parents house is very close to the highway so it takes me less than 2 mintues to from their house.  The reason that this is important is that I left when I did becuase the sound on our TV kept mysteriously and unexplainably kept shutting off and the picture would break up every now and again.

Looking to my right (south), I saw a bright white light, 5 to 10 times bigger than any star or planet that I ever saw. It was just off the horizon, over some trees.  It might have been stationary at first, but within a few seconds I noticed it moving to the north (towards me) at about the speed of an airplane. After a few more seconds, I saw that there were 2 more on these objects, following the first one in single file - all together, 3 round bright white lights, moving together in unison and precision, in uniform motion, as if they were connected by a rope. Then they changed into round red flaming balls. It looked EXACTLY like these orbs were engulfed in red fire. I did not see any fuselage/body of any type. Just 3 flaming balls. They kept moving north at a very uniform speed, rising steadily, until they were in front of me, about 45 degrees off the horizon. At no time did I hear any sounds emitted from them. They then changed direction and started heading towards the east(away from me) and quickly faded out, one by one. There was no noticeable wind blowing which could have caused them to turn 90 degrees. They turned with their own power. Just to be thorough, I'm not entirely certain that they actually turned. They might have just stopped and started rising and getting smaller as they faded away. As there were no clouds or anything else that might have been used as a reference, I am unable to make an accurate determination as to their size, speed or distance from me. If I had to guess, I would say they took the approximate path, and speed, of a small single engine airplane which was in the process of climbing to cruising altitude. If that's correct, then these objects would be about 10 to 20 feet in diameter. I've been looking up in the sky for 50 years and never, ever, ever, ever, saw anything like this. Straight out of X-Files. (Note - I had just made some very clear affirmations to myself about expanding my consciousness and awareness out in all directions into infinity, and for eternity - past present and future - and in all dimensions.  I had just finished this affirmation and was focusing on these thoughts when I looked to my right and noticed this phenomenon in the sky.)",2013-09-30T00:00:00,41.70382619047619,-72.66267857142857

That is: 2 orbs in front, one orb centered between the two in the middle, and two orbs in the rear that were even with the two in the front.  They were in a definite formation. My first thought was that they were military planes or helicopters, but they made no sound. They moved silently across the sky from South to North.  Then the middle orb moved out of line and advanced toward the orb positioned in the front left.  They appeared to make contact with each other and the center orb flickered out. Immediately after that the remaining orbs began to fade out one by one until the front left orb was the only one remaining.  That one floated on for a few seconds alone then it also faded out. The objects faded out with an appearance similar to when you blow out a candle.  The fiery orange glow faded to a single point of light and then went dark in the night sky.

After coming home from a late movie, I was in the backyard finishing up a phone conversation with my brother who was in Breckendridge, MN.  I looked up in the sky to see a weird formation of what I thought was stars in the sky.  The odd star formation wasn't a constellation I had ever seen before.  It was two oddly shaped triangles right on top of each other, 6x dots in the sky that I thought were stars.  Another odd observation, though the dots almost were identical to the rest of the stars in the sky, they had a slight flicker to them.  One triangle looked like a small crooked Orion's Belt with two dots in a row with the third being slighting out of the straight line.  The other was a triangle with an elongated left hand corner.  After about 10 minutes of looking at the formation, the 6x dots very slightly started moving.  It was so slight I thought my mind was playing tricks on me.  Then they started moving in a slow motion most comparable to electrons, bu! t the motion was more random like fireflies. I had been giving my brother a play by play of what I had been seeing and then I coerced him to go outside to try and see what I was seeing, even though he was in Breckenridge MN.  I said he saw something similar but he saw red and blue lights.  After about 10 minutes,  I went inside to try and wake my wife up so she could also witness what I had been seeing.

So this past Wednesday on Oct 30, 2013, around 2pm i was leaving close to downtown St.Paul it was a nice day clear skys everyone was out enjoying the weather the past few days has been pretty chilly so everyone was enjoying the afternoon sun.  Well i come to a stop light trying to beat the rush hour traffic and i look up and see two huge eagles gliding above, just going in a circle and flying to me kind of low,like they was about to swoop down on a prey.  My first thought was they was flying pretty low and i was concern maybe someone had a small pet out and that what they had there eyes on.  So i decided to take some photos, a friend of mine mention last week while we was talking on the phone i seen a eagle and he said that i always see eagles,  so i thought it be a good ideal to take a few photos to show him the next time i see him.  While i waiting for the light to change i took five photos trying to get the best angle caused the eagles are going in the same circle so i wanted to make sure i got a photo of them.  So i leave St. Paul head home and go to the library downloaded my work on my laptop of the properties i done for the day.  Once i completed downloading my photos i kind of went over the photos of the eagles i didn't think i got good photos.  I left the library went to the gym left the gym went to Caribou coffee so i took out my camera start deleting all the photos i took that day and when i got to the photos of the eagles i kept them and pulled them up to get a better view and i notice in one the photos with the eagles in it,there a object by the eagle a circle of lights my first raction was, what ((words deleted)) is that  i looked at it a few times and new it was something there so i remember i had the photos on my laptop and put in the back of my mind that when i had the time i was going to look at the photos again on my laptop that way i could enlarge the photos to see better what it was.On Thursday Oct 31,13 i moved into my new place get situated sitting down relaxing get my laptop out pulled up the photos and there it is but i got two good photos clear as day i got one photo of a object by itself and i got another photo with the eagles in it where one is flying high above close to these circle of lights and the other eagle is flying low and not quite sure what it is but next to the eagle flying low look like another ball of light but it so close to the eagle that can't distinquish if it part of the eagle or not.I get excited know i see something there and can't believe that i capture what ever it is on camera and the clarity of the photos it look like i was actually trying to capture this object when in truth with my naked eye the only thing i seen! was the eagles and that the only reason i took the photos to show my friend.I took my laptop down stairs i had to show someone,i showed my building manager i mention to him what i do for a living and explained to him why i took the photos he looked at them kind of startle another client walked in the office and he the manager mention to the client that i was trying to convince him that there are U.F.O. i said i'm not trying to convince you of anything i'm just showing you what my camera caught,i did'nt see anything,i showed the photos to the other guy and he said he see it too and once again i said i'm not saying its anything i'm just as curious to know what it is too.I come back upstairs call my friend the one that was the reason i took the photos in the first place he live about five minutes from me.told him he come over we go over the photos and shock at what he see this doesn't look like no sauser or nothing we seen on television.  We talked about it looked at every possibility what could it be maybe we thought it could be my camera and th e angle off the reflection of the window but when it enhance it clearly a object there in the sky and it very detailed.I start refecting on when i first took the photos at the stop light and thinking why was the eagles flying so low and why was they together to grown eagles.I'm not a expert on eagles and i'm kind of use to seeing them in the area i live in but i never seen to huge ones together and also i remember thinking how unsual was it to see two big eagles flying low in a urban area near downtown on a busy afternoon and didn't anybody else see this and why was the eagles going in the same circle,that what i remember thinking at that time and now when i look at the photos in my mind it kind of make sense why the eagles was behaving like that.I figured they sensed something in the area and when you see the photos they kind of show that because in one photo both the eagles are exactly where the lights are,well from the angle that what it appear to be.I showned the photos ! to several people and everyone reaction is the same some say its a ufo a couple of guys at first said it was my camera lense and the way i was angling the camera to be honest i don't know what it is and the only way to be sure is first to take the photos to a expert where they have the technology to validate them.And let me say i surely wouldn't be wasting my time or yours if i didn't believe that by accident my camera capture something and it clearly shows a object in two photos to midday rush hour.I do have photos but is reluctant to turn them over to just anybody thinking about going to a local t.v station or newspaper to show them or even the authorities i'm about 99% sure i capture a object and the more you look at it it very detail and i'm sure i got actual rare photos of a un made man object.

First thoughts: I looked for the tell-tale signs of airplane lights, but there were no wing lights, gear lights or any typical airplane lights whatsoever.  Being a trained pilot, I knew this was not a blimp or airplane.  I knew within seconds that this was something different, and ran outside my patio to take some pictures.

It was moving slowly from East to West, perhaps SE to NW, or thereabouts.   An airliner passed above it, coming from MCO... typically airliners at this point are probably 8000-10000 feet up, and seemed to cross its path, so it was lower than that, and would estimate it was around 3000-5000'.

There was a bright, gold, asterisk-looking light moving from west to east across the night sky.  This was last Monday June 17th between 10:00pm and 12:30am central time.   I pointed out the light to my husband and we stopped for a bit to “let it catch up to us” as we were walking in an easterly direction. It moved very fast across the sky; too high and irregular to have been a satellite or asteroid. I began talking to it; telling the beautiful light that “we're trying to be in peace; we know it looks bad with all the war and whatnot, but we really have peace in our hearts.”  Then it stopped and descended very fast and the glow was brighter, with the scatter pattern of light getting bigger and brighter.  I continued talking to this thing/entity/ship/etc.  It moved from east to west; every once in a while along its flight path it would wiggle from south to north a tiny bit, and then continue along a very definable straight course. It lasted about 3 minutes, and we have been looking up around that time periodically throughout the last week and they appear to be showing up between the hours of 11:30pm and 12:30 am CST in the southeastern Nebraska area. Unfortunately, our camera is not fancy enough to catch these things; anyone have stills or even a video? Please share. Coincidentally, we saw a youtube video tonight of a similar occurrence in Brazil:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmpj7MqBAAk&list=FL02hH42H4ErIA4OQ1twIdpQ&index=1  The one we saw did not come as close, but appears to be similar in presentation, technology and design.  Anyone else seeing these in the midwest over the past 2 weeks?   On that night we also saw 2 lights hover, and then the one nearest to the horizon shot out an orangish-reddish blinking light, or drone, or plane of some sort which then traveled in a southwesterly direction.  It appeared to be cloaking itself as an everyday plane, but we saw where it came out of: the light that at first appeared to be a very bright star.  Over the course of that night, we saw many star ships.  It was unlike anything else I've ever seen.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,40.80091454183267,-96.67416752988048

This is an experience that took place over a period of probably 2 weeks, and on three separate nights. Starting off with only myself as a witness, and on the last occasion, including my Fiance in the sighting. On the first night of this experience, I was alone outside my home enjoying a cigarette. Gazing at the night sky as I always do, partly because I love outer space, and partly because this is definitely not my first experience with UFO's.  Nothing was unusual when I ended my smoke, and went inside to the kitchen for a snack.  I got what I needed, and began to head downstairs to my living room to watch TV, or just relax.  The door to outside my home, is at the top of my staircase and I looked out the window as I was headed passed.. and saw a light in the sky, like a dominant star, that surely wasn't present when I was outside just moments before.  So I stopped for a harder look, and noticed it was moving slightly..  Then it stopped. I had a strange feeling wash over me, as if this thing could see me...  So I slung open the door, triggering my motion sensor porch light, and I stepped outside.  At this very moment, it picked up moving slowly again, than accelerated at an indescribable rate.  I took a ""U"" shaped, arched path,  Straight out of the Earths atmosphere, and it was gone!  I told my Fiance about this experience that very night, when I joined her in bed for slumber, and we went on with our lives.  About a week and half later, her and I were having a bit of a disagreement late at night.  So I decided to just go for a walk, and cool off. I sat at a park, on a swing set at a local nearby elementary school for, a good hour.  Smoking a few cigarettes, and reflecting on the situation at hand, and how to handle it upon returning home to my Fiance.  I was looking at the sky, and stars for this entire hour or so, seeing nothing unusual. I got up and started walking home, eventually turning the corner to the road I reside on. I glanced into the sky, in the same direction I first witnessed the ball of light, and much to my surprise, THERE IT WAS! It acted in the almost exact same manner as it did the first occasion, moving very slowly.  I took it upon myself to wave my arms in the air, because again, I had the feeling this thing could see me, for whatever reas! on.... And when I waved my arms... it again accelerated at an unearthly rate, and left the earths atmosphere!  I once again, returned home, and explained to my Fiance that I had damn near the same experience as I had a week or so prior.  This time it was a little bit deeper conversation, as I obviously was a bit more shaken up. I described it to her in high detail, from it just being a white orb of light, to its flight path out of the atmosphere, and out of sight... And we once again, simply returned to our everyday life.  The very next night, at about 11:00pm, we decided it was a nice night for a mutual walk. We went to the same park, at the same school, I visited the night before alone. We sat on the same exact swing set, and talked for a while. Then decided to head home. We together turned the corner to my house... and I looked again, where I had seen it the first two occasions for shits and giggles.. and I could not believe my eyes when it was actually there again.. I stopped dead in my chances and said, excuse my french.. ""Fucking Look""! My Fiance then looked into the sky, and seen the orb of light I had describe to her twice in the last week. This time was a bit different, though. It was again, slowly moving.. but this time it was steady, and coming straight for us. It was dimming slightly, and returning back to its usual brightness, as it was headed twords us... it wasn't changing in elevation at all, as it went right over our heads. Eventually passing us, and then it took its! same arched flight path, right out of the atmosphere, and out of sight!  This is something that happened to me alone, twice. I explained it to my Fiance both times, on the night of the occurrences.. Then on the last occasion, she was there to witness EXACTLY what I had described to her. Validating everything to her, and even completely to myself. It is 100% unexplainable, and the way it happened, leaves no question in our minds of that. I couldn't make that up twice, and have exactly what I had said, happen a third time.. with a second witness. We are both still absolutely amazed.  Thanks for your time.

At first as i seen it, it was a distorted light or like a light with no shape to it as in my terms a fluffy shape like a cloud but smaller than a cloud in my vision (which is very good vision) it looked to be the size of about 10 north stars put together but the edge around this single light was fluffy shape (like a cloud).  It made me think there was a hole in the sky and this light was shining through this hole. There were no clouds in the sky at all and I could see stars all over the sky, but I noticed a trail of what looked to resemble a cloud stretched out across the sky and it was linked to the light as in touching it.It was like a thin line of fluffy cloud going in a very near straight line to where the light was.  I believe it was not a cloud but more like smoke, gas, dust or steam which this light left behind it as it moved across the sky. It was moving but very very slowly in my eyes.It seemed to be very very close to land or ground as did the gas or smoke cloud.I could see the beginning of the cloud trail as I call it which just started straight outside my house basically in front of me, it just seemed to appear or start out of nowhere as I could see its tail end or beginning in front of me, there were no other trails anywhere just this one.  Going by the ground as measurement as it seemed very close to it, the distance it travelled was about one mile. The trail was already in the sky when I looked out and our dogs had stopped barking after about 5/10 mins.  As I watched this orange light it started getting bigger slowly and it eventually got to a size of about 2 or 3 full moons put together, like as if it were another planet and also took a circular shape like a full moon with no fluffy edges around it.  It was freaking me out a bit, but I am very interested in this stuff so I kept watching. It then split up into 3 or 4 sections in an odd way, but the sections stayed close together they didn't seem to take of in any direction.  Then they all started to shrink and fade at the same time slowly returning to a single light.It then was almost gone to a faded star size and then slowly start to get bigger and brighter again and eventually went to the same size and shape again about 2 or 3 full moons put together. It started splitting up again into 3 or 4 sections and back again to shrinking and fading and coming back to one small faded light.It seemed to be over the one area for some time whilst it was doing this and as it was splitting up it also looked like it was lowering itself to the ground slowly.  The top third or quarter section seemed to drop to the bottom, like it was falling through the other sections.  This happened at least 3 times. It may have changed its direction and went behind the hills making it look to me that it was lowering to the ground but I finally couldn't see it any longer as it went down lower behind the hills or somewhere.  I did try to look at it through binoculars and didn't notice anything else and it seemed to be easier and much better to watch with just the naked eye. I watched this for about 45 mins,it was silent all the time and when it disappeared I just had to Google what I saw.  As I was typing in Google I heard this boom sound.It was an unusual boom but hard to explain.I looked out once again and saw nothing.  I went back to Google and was hard to explain and I ended up coming back to this website of NATIONAL UFO REPORTING CENTRE which I have visited before because of similar strange things I have seen and read a few more reports.  This is the website where I have seen so many people explain their sightings as good as identical to my sightings.  But still it seems nobody has a clue of what these things are. I have watched the sky for years and also have had a wonderful site up very high to be able to see all around me counting numerous towns and on a clear day could see even further.  I have seen these YELLOW ORBS also which flair up really bright to the size of about 5 north stars if not bigger and then fade down getting smaller to about the size of a north star only a little bigger.  These things are out to be seen almost every night only it probably depends on your location. They sit over different towns without moving for a few mins could be any lenght of time 30 mins or longer or shorter I've seen these just sit there and then when they go small to size of just a bit bigger than north star they move across the sky to sit over another town and when they move they move fast.  Even faster than a helicopter it seems.  Also when they sit still they seem to be perfectly still not a move. I have seen hot air balloons, helicopters etc.This is not normal and for the amount of times I have seen these things which dont seem to be too high in the sky I really cannot understand how or why they have not been properly investigated by the right people as they are plain to be seen. This is REAL, and to come onto a website because you have seen these things and are sure your not seeing things and desperatly want to know what these things are and find that there are hundreds if not thousands of reports of the same sightings explained identical to mine and other peoples in most cases to me seems very weird that this has not been checked out. These yellow orbs as I also had called them myself before visiting this site are nothing like what I have seen recently with the big orange shape changing light, but I know the reports are realistic from the way there described.  I have seen these things hundreds of times already.  I am not being smart but only honest and I have to say with the amount of identical reports reported on this site I really really can't understand why there is nothing in the sky to check these things out.  Is all those reports from different locations even across the world not enough proof??   I dont think we are all in some weird group that has hundreds or thousands of people belonging to it from different countries who just wants to tell lies on this subject or website.what would we benefit from it??  All we get is a sore hand from typing and no action response just an ear that listens.  Maybe I am wrong that National report centre or other people are not doing something about this but it's going on a very long time.  With the technology these days why is this such a hard thing to research or find out about??  All I can say is watch the sky and believe us in this much anyway.  THIS IS NOT FICTION. I have excellent eyesight, I am very interested in the sky, I am not colour blind and do not take drugs or have any visions.  **PLEASE PLEASE TRY TO LOOK INTO THIS PROPERLY IT IS NOT A JOKE**.

It was probably a Saturday with no school the next day so we were allowed to stay up late.  I was 9 or 10 years old in 1962 or 1963 and at the store they were offering Mickey Mouse helium balloons.  I brought one home that evening and was showing it off to the neighborhood kids on Hunter AFB in the military housing were we lived.  It was probably about 9 or 10pm because the street lights had come on and the sky was dark.  We decided to play a game with the balloon like this:  We placed torn up pieces of paper between the ears of the Mickey Mouse balloon because the ears touched.  We then let the balloon rise above the street light out of sight and then with a firm jerk on the attached kite string dislodged the pieces of paper from between Mickey's ears, down they would float into view below the street light and whoever co! llected the most pieces of paper won.  On the second or third round something amazing happened.  The balloon was above the street light out of sight, I jerked the the string, and suddenly a luminous disk about the size of a car suddenly appeared and then zig-zagged half-a-dozen times above the street light first side to side then back and forth in a cross like pattern alternating aggressively, presumably it was checking out the balloon. Everyone stood there watching the object, while the pieces of paper floated down around us, and then as suddenly as it appeared it disappeared. We were excited and so we collected the papers in a frenzy, stuffed them between the ears, and sent the balloon back up, jerked the string and almost the exact same thing happened again. Except this time instead of disappearing after the zig-zag it took off in a straight line fast but still slow enough we could follow it into the distance. My brother ran to get my parents but by the time they came out to see it it was so distant they could not distinguish it from a star.  Of course, we tried to repeat the event but it only worked twice.  The disk was glowing silvery-amber, about the size of a car, no sound, complete silence, incredibly zippy, directly overhead so we could only see the underside during the zig-zag. When it traveled away the second time I did not note anything additional like lights or anything like that. Was too excited to make any additional observations.",,32.02970094086022,-81.13525336021505

I would often speak on the radio pretending to be a space captain traveling the universe searching for life forms to form a galactic community.  The night became quite dark and I eventually crawled in through my bedroom window and went to sleep.  I awoke later that night at 1:00 am and looked at my clock to see what time it was and quickly noticed a light growing brighter outside my window.  I could see a glowing orb of light outside the window before the foot of my bed, from the East.  At first I thought it might have been my grandfather; but, I knew my window was too high from the ground to be able to see that.   I cleared my eyes and was able to see beyond the windows that this light was moving closer to the window and noticed that the air (the space) within my room appeared to increasingly ripple in place as this orb passed through the wall and stopped before the foot of my bed.  Sitting up in my bed I could see the rippling space move closer to my body and enter, passing through me.  At that moment I felt very week, and I passed out.   The following morning I awoke to find myself paralyzed and was not until nearly an hour was I able to move and slowly crawl down the hallway to the living room and climbed up on the couch.  I was not sure what had happened, thinking I might be sick.  I was supposed to have a sleep over at a friend’s house that night and decided not to tell my mother what happened.  Later, as I was spending the night at my friend’s house I began to draw/color with crayons, pictures of what I thought the future would be like.  My friend was very into a particular science fiction film and had nearly all of the figurine toys of the movie characters and play sets.  I then began to draw pictur! es of the future films that were to come, explaining how certa! in characters would do things and new creatures we both had never seen. He disbelieved me of course; but, several years later I see the next two releases of this film and everything I drew came true.  Creative coincidence or did the incident the prior night have anything to do with it?  I have had many more experiences since that night over the past 30 years.  Something happened; but, not sure if it was an alien, time traveler, spiritual experience or just sleep paralysis as I have often been told.

My girlfriend and I were sitting on the balcony of her second-floor garden apartment in Cranbury, NJ, which overlooked a large open field, at the far edge of which was a wooded area, perhaps 150 yards or so away.  It was late in the evening; perhaps around midnight or shortly thereafter.  We were just hanging out, doing some stargazing. Then, I noticed something “funny” – something odd going on in my peripheral vision that drew me to look over to the left portion of my field of vision.  Some of the “stars” were moving. Perhaps 25-30 degrees above the horizon, above the wooded area at the far left end of the field, was a loose cluster of perhaps 6 to 8 lights that were meandering about in the sky, randomly, aimlessly, independently of each other – moving in something approximating “Brownian motion.”  They were a tad larger than the stars – around the size of planets, and like the planets, they didn’t twinkle; they shone with a bright, even, constant white light.  But unlike planets, they were moving about – meandering about, actually.  I pointed this out to my girlfriend, and we both sat there watching this phenomenon for maybe 2 minutes, dumbfounded.  Then, something even more curious happened.  All of a sudden, the lights stopped meandering around, and collectively began migrating toward a central point.  They settled into a perfectly circular formation, and remained motionless in this configuration for perhaps a minute.  I counted 8 lights, and they were located at the 8 points of a compass in this motionless circular formation.  Again, the circular formation of lights was around 25 – 30 degrees above the horizon, at the left side of the wooded area at the far end of the field.  My girlfriend and I just sat there, awestruck at what we were looking at. Then, something stunning happened.  Suddenly, in an instant, all 8 of these lights suddenly took off radially, away from the center, away from each other, like spokes of a wheel, and shot over the entire distance from the original formation to the distant horizons in probably one second or less, and disappeared from view.  They didn’t accelerate – they went from 0 to probably thousands of miles per hour instantaneously.  This terrified both my girlfriend and me.  We jumped up, said something like “Oh, shit!” or “Oh, my God!” and ran into the apartment and locked the patio door.  For maybe a half an hour, all we could do was jump around and yell, “Oh my God, what the hell was that??!!!”   That is when I knew – absolutely – that we are not alone.

At first I thought it might just be a very bright light on a radio tower but as I got closer I could see it was not attached to anything and was 3 or 4 times higher than the towers around it.  I parked the car and watched to see if it was moving. It was moving very slowly straight across the sky and then would stop and move the other way.  It flashed on and off just like the lights on top of the towers.  I watched it for 5 minutes and then decided to get closer underneath it, so I drove to the train yard it was up above. It stopped flashing and was just a dim orangish, red color, and I could barely see it against all the street lights when I got close to it a couple minutes later.  I drove back to the spot I parked at and couldn't see it anymore.  A white light had appeared in that direction and looked like a plane coming in for a landing just to the north of Front St. and right off the highway.

I don't know if it landed or not because it disappeared behind some warehouse building.  I told my ex about it on the phone but by the time he showed up it was all over.  I know others had to have seen it because the highway is right there, and I could see it coming down 35 and 435 from Liberty.

We were looking to the western sky.   The crafts were an orangish red color and circular.  There were no light tails, just the colored balls.  8 of them were grouped together, 4 on top and 4 on bottom flying south (left).  They were not in perfect formation.  The 9th craft was flying the opposite direction to the north (right). About a minute after observing 4 of the crafts flying south faded out quickly like they had started flying further west out of sight or just disappeared.  Similarly the one flying north had disappeared as well.   The remaining 4 flew slower still south a few more minutes.  The one going north that had gone away reappeared and changed course to go south.  The 4 others faded out like the first 4 had withing 10 seconds.

After seeing strange, odd crafts flying during sunset I stayed and continued filming after it got dark.   I first seen around 4 bright orange/red orbs, perfectly spherical and, not flickering or flashing like lanterns.  They were flying from north east to west.  I watched as one of them made a slow right turn away from others and all vanished soon after.   I did not have my cell on during the first set, the cell battery was dying and I had to use cigarette lighter to charge.  But then two more came in from same direction, flying next to each other.   One of them made the same slow right turn away from me before disappearing.  The other stayed straight, then also disappeared.  Moments later I watched one fly in by itself.  Then another by itself, but this one was much closer than the others.  It came in just as fast as others, but slowed down while in flight.  There were a few more that came by, whole event lasted around 7-8minutes.   This was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen, I'm glad I had my new cellphone to share this experience.  I am not happy how it came out, the video is great with amazing close-up.  But the camera while filming at night has a hard time focusing on light sources.  It looks like they are flickering or flashing but they were not.  They were steadily lit, they changed in Color slightly from red to orange to yellow.  But they were NOT flashing.  In my video I use another video to show examples of light sources at night while filming with cell, and you can see how street lights and other lights look through camera.   I have had many experiences since June of this year 2013, all of these experiences have taken place in close proximity to some very very large power lines that run across the Ohio river and through city.   This is just my theory, but I believe it has something to do with these power lines.  Maybe they steal or somehow harne! ss energy from lines.   I will be following up on this and have! found a PowerStation in close distance to where these orange orbs originated from.  But the weird part about this whole thing is minutes after filming these orange orbs, a large Blackhawk type helicopter was seen flying lower and faster than I have ever seen.   I am 32years old and have lived here my entire life, I have seen black helicopters before, but never this low and never this fast.

There was WAY too much movement for it to be anything that was part of our Solar System.  Around 7:00 pm it began to flash & move. Intermittent flashes as it would dim out and then get brighter while it was doing so.

Nothing to help me brush it off and say, ""Oh, it's just that there, nothing to worry about,"" but there is nothing there on the maps.

Again I was at my home but in my back yard being curious from the last time I spotted the 2 UFO's I now have a habit of looking into the sky during the day time to see if there are anymore. At 5:35 pm I spotted an oval metallic object floating very high and very still in the North-West direction in the sky I would say in the direction of El Sereno area.  I couldn't believe how perfectly still this object was. This object was different from the last sighting this object was metallic in nature. I ran and grabbed my camera hoping it would still be there and snapped a few shots as best I could.   Then I seen a 2nd object fly slowly just below and past the 1st object heading North-East.  This object was round and appeared to be like one glowing red light.  It was traveling East very slowly I tried to keep an eye on both objects looking back at the metallic oval object which was still hovering in the same position.  I snapped a few photos of the glowing red light object then watched it fly slowly and then lost sighting of it after 10 minutes.  When I looked back to look for the metallic oval object it was gone.  A few minutes later a jet flew by from the south direction going north I would say it was almost as high as the two unidentified objects.  I snapped a photo of the jet so I can make comparisons of how high the jet was to the unidentified objects.  The metallic oval object stood hovering for 15 minutes and the glowing red light object slowly for about 10 minutes.,2013-10-14T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

The first was on Sunday, October 6, 2013, at 7:45 P.M. then again on Monday, October 07, 2013, in the same part of the sky.  The first one I saw was oval shaped and nearly blended in with the sky behind it.  The sky at that time was a deep blue color and not completely night.  The object that I observed was slightly lighter than the sky.  It was a blue, grayish color.  It did not have wings or lights of any kind. It moved from North to South.  The object caught my eye after I looked up at an airplane moving from East to West.  The object crossed paths with the airplane at least a football field below it.  The object I observed did not make any sound.  I could not hear the airplane either.  I lost sight of the oval shaped object as it flew further away. Monday, October 07, 2013 I observed a second UFO.  It was around the same time of day as the first sighting.  I had just stepped out to walk the dogs, when I looked in the same general direction as the previous object and saw a light flash on and then off.  It did not occur to me that it was a light in the sky flashing on and off until I saw it flash on and off again.  I thought it was a star at first because of the white color.  It sat in the sky right below a star for about 10 seconds.  Then the object moved from East to West at a fast pace.  It was faster than an airplane moves across the sky. It would slowly flash on and off as it moved.  It looked as if it were pulsing on and off slowly.  I lost sight of it as it flew further away. I didn’t see anything other than that. I guess it could have been a plane on both occasions, but it didn’t look like any aircraft I have seen in person or on TV. There was no sound and the second one was stationary in the sky for about 10 seconds.  I do believe there could be Aliens out there, and I know the Air Force has some pretty cool Top Secret stuff as well.  I just wish I could have flown myself up there and looked at whatever it was close up.  Both objects were the size of your thumbnail if you held it out towards the sky.  As far a size goes, I don’t know any other way to explain it other than the first object looked about the size of a pellet if you held it out to the sky with an extended hand.  The second object just looked like a light.  I could not see shape to it.",2013-10-14T00:00:00,29.775480377035134,-95.78561259640104

I had just rounded a corner into a straight-away near Buffalo Park Trail Road (there is a small dirt parking lot there that was empty) when I noticed two white lights straight ahead in the distance that I initially thought were Venus and another dimmer star to the lower left.  All of a sudden the lower white light began to descend and disappeared behind a stand of tall pine trees.  It had an erratic path of descent and seemed to wave back and forth rather than just fall straight down.  Just as the smaller white light disappeared, I saw the larger light that I thought was Venus begin to grow as it approached rather quickly.  At this point I told my daughter to look up and she immediately saw the object as it sped towards us.  The growing round white light developed a red border that transitioned in to a solid red red light.  As the object approached, I noticed that there was also a blinking light behind it but am not sure if this blinking light was white or red.  A very short bright green line had also appeared just below and to the immediate left of the solid red light.  The object then slowed and swerved to the right (north) towards our truck.  When the object was positioned just to the left in front of us, it dropped in elevation and began to slowly pass overhead. As the object slowly moved above us, we could see that the short green line was actually a long flat bright rectangular strip. From the new overhead perspective, this strip extended just a bit in front of the solid red light and stretched quite a bit behind it.  My daughter and I both remarked about how crisp and clear the green box angles were and how there was no glow given how bright the green light was.  I have previously worked with low powered lasers (&lt;100mW), and would say the green color was exactly at 532nm.  There seemed to be some glow from the red light and flashing light in the rear, but we were unable to see any reflections on a craft body or wing/propeller parts--all we could see were the lights.  Not sure if there was a sound.  Initially I was unsure of the object's size.  As the object was flying towards us, I thought it might be something small like a drone or RC airplane/helicopter because it arrived so fast and its flight path had such quick but smooth directional changes.  However, once it was above us, the object slowed considerably--almost to a hover, and we were able to see it clearly before passing underneath.  I was traveling between 70-65 mph, so anything small should have zipped right over us.  Once the object passed out of view above our windshield, we were unable to see it again out the back window or rearview mirrors.  My daughter did not want to stop and get a better look. I would love to know what your group might think this was, because I have never seen a solid object emit such a bright green light",2013-10-14T00:00:00,40.59851098901099,-106.90830989010989

Close to full moon was up in the East, about 2/3s of the way to Zenith.  Winds calm (reported as 3.7 mph WNW at Tubac), some scattered clouds in the sky, good visibility.  My viewpoint was 3 miles due E of the Tumacacori Mission in Southern Arizona.  Immediately saw a bright, wide amber light in the sky at about 20 degrees South of true West from where I stood.  It appeared to be right above the Tumacacori Mountains/Highlands in the Coronado National Forest about 6 miles away.  It hung just over a broad flattish area in between two small crests, at about 5500 feet altitude, although I cannot rule out that it was further to the WSW.  The object wasn't Venus because its size was too large and also too wide, too bright, and the wrong color.  I have observed inexplicable big and bright amber lights and displays a few times here beginning exactly three years ago this September. As I watched, the bright amber light suddenly faded away, revealing two small dim white lights at the horizontal tips of the wide area, and a small red light somewhere in the center.  About 10 seconds later, the bright amber light gradually started to return, and, as it returned, it looked like there were 3 spokes of amber light radiating out at 120 degrees from another from a common center, close to where that red light had been.  This made the object resemble a triangle before it got so bright that I could not see any particular shape except one that was very bright but wider than tall.  I estimate the object was at least 100 feet wide, based on the size of other features on the Tumacacoris  (including a ""dry"" stone waterfall drop) with which I am very familiar.   It remained brightly lit for about one minute, then faded out quickly again (saw the small white lights at the horizontal tips again before it disappeared).  It then reappeared one more time just as! it had before, and repeated the sequence above.  When it faded away once again, I could see two small red lights on it that then faded away quickly.  I waited a minute or two to see if it would reappear, but it did not.    Checked the time;  it was 8:02 pm or 20:02 Arizona Time, so I viewed the object for about 5 or 6 minutes. I did not hear any unusual noise,  just a little truck rumble from I-19 that runs past the Tumacacori Mission.  I can readily hear airplanes or helicopters traveling in that area, as noise echoes in the Santa Cruz Valley between mountain ranges.   Sometimes helicopters ""hang"" in place over the Highlands at night (due to smuggling route), but their lights flash, and they are up higher in the sky and nowhere near as big.  I visually scanned the North 2/3s of the sky, and did not see any other lights or unusual phenomenon (couldn't see the extreme South of the sky from where I conventional aircraft.

Then, the sound got louder and louder, like the “plane” was about to crash in my front yard.  The noise was very similar to the engine of a plane, but not the whistling sound planes make when they are in air.  I walked outside to see where the craft was and saw what definitely was not an airplane.  All I could see of the craft were two neon green circles on each side of whatever the body was.  I could not see the body because the green nights were too bright.  It appeared that the lights were spinning like propellers, but the lights made hollow rings, not full circles.  They were also spinning vertically, like wheels on a wheel chair.  What was also interesting is that even though it looked like the craft was moved by the propellers, they did not make the pulsing noise that helicopter propellers make, it was a very consistent, loud engine sound.  The craft also had a small blinking white and red light on the body, but it was flying way too low to have been anything legitimate.  The craft flew out of my sight probably in about 15 seconds, by the time I had my phone out to take a picture, it was gone.  I had never seen anything like it before, so I posted on facebook to see if anyone else had seen it, one person said that they had heard it and another said that they saw it too.",2013-11-11T00:00:00,37.64624405286344,-77.29160440528634

The sky was evenly overcast with haze and reflected the city lights, and buildings blocked the lower northeast sky.  I gave up on the comet, and  noticed I could spot only four or five stars even with my sports binoculars.  I turned them toward the flight path  to our airport.  I saw a jetliners following the usual pattern, above the trees and apartment complexes east of my second floor balcony.     Maybe five minutes later I focused on another set of similar lights in the same direction and elevation, and because a white light was blinking and there seemed to be an orange light at the back and a bluish white light on the front, I assumed it was another plane.  I have a table and a chair on he balcony, and tipped the table  up on end and sat in my chair steadying my binoculars.  I realized that the object did not move relative to the roofs of neighboring  complexes.   That would mean! the plane was far, far away, and enormous, but repeated observation over about seven minutes convinced me that the object in the sky was not a jetliner and was not moving toward the airport at all. Daylight was coming soon, and I doubted that I could locate my digital camera and get it set up in time to photograph the unrecognized object, but I hoped that it could be done, and by steadying the camera and going to full 15x optical zoom.  I could get some 10 megapixel color videos to study at my leisure.  The binoculars are about 10x, but the images were fleeting and begged to be studied carefully. I took the camera off its tripod and rushed to the balcony. I hoped the batteries would last.  The warning screen on the back of the camera showed some red lines across the battery icon, and I know my time was short. I sat on my sturdy chair,  leaned the lightweight folding table against my knees, and did my best to locate the strange object using the view screen on the back of the camera.  It was a challenge, and the camera was unsteady.  The image on the screen was basically a black grey haze, and the craft was invisible.  With the naked eye I could see the craft and using a left of the table and a tree branch visible on the view screen, I aimed and shot several videos.  I finally stopped and rushed to get fresh batteries.  I changed from the view screen to the “through the lens” viewfiner.  At last I could see the UFO, and hoped that despite the shaking of the camera, I might capture at least a few images of the elusive UFO. Soon the sky was too bright for viewing the UFO, and I left the balcony.  It was about 6:30 AM and I had a lot of chores to do to prepare for a visit from a relative.  I finally got enough work done to allow me to slip the SD card into my desktop computer and chec! k my videos.  I was delighted to see that in the several videos I shot, a few second of “UFO” images appeared.  The shaky camera made it look like the UFO was zooming all over, but it was not.  With the naked eye, it appeared to be motionless in the sky.  I don’t know if my UFO was actually a set of lights on a tall tower atop a distant hill, or an actual craft in the sky.  Because I have never noticed anything like this UFO in the 29 months I’ve been in this city, even though I have been an avid airplane watcher for seventy years.  I was a Civil Air Patrol Cadet, studying at Randolph, Lackland and Barksdale AFBs in the 1950s and an aviation enthusiast the rest of my life. Upon examining the videos, it seems that the UFO was actually three or four lights, perhaps all attached to one hovering object.  On the right was a round, seemingly “shattered” white or light-greenish orb.  If the craft had been headed for a landing at the airport, the light on the right would be at the  “front.” Additionally there was a red dot of fairly bright light below and on the middle of the bottom, and a dimly lit thin horizontal line of yellowish white light at the “rear” where the vertical stabilizer would be on a jetliner.  When I first spotted the craft, there was a blinking white light where the red light appears in the videos, and I thought it was a regular aircraft strobe light.  Upon examination, I have not seen it. When I say “front” or “rear,” I am assuming the craft was aligned with the landing approach jetliners follow from north of the city to the airport on the south east. I’m sorry that the videos are tedious to look at, but I don’t know a thing about editing them to eliminate all the “dead” time.

The trail was not such that it remained visible the whole traveled distance (such that you could follow the whole path the object had taken).

The silver disk was stationary, no movement at all at any time while I was watching it, which was about twenty seconds, I'd guess.  It was clearly visible the whole time. It was high up in the sky, like about as high as the commercial airlines fly, but could have been higher.  It looked smaller than the moon, in comparison to that.  I at first kind of thought it looked like a very, very small moon, but it was shiny, which looked odd to me, so I kept looking at it.

I was outside in my backyard briefly letting the dog out, and looked up at the night sky, as I frequently do on a clear night.  Within my peripheral vision, I caught a rather bright flash (approximate astronomical magnitude -5) of white light of less than 1 second duration.  I would estimate the size of the light to be slightly larger than the planet Venus, and was noted at the straight overhead position, 90 degrees above the horizon.  This white blinking light reoccured several times, at an interval of ~10-15 seconds, and for a total duration of less than 1 minute.  It then abruptly stopped.  The blinking light remained in the exact same position throughout that time.  My impression is that it had an altitude of at least 20,000 feet, but possibly greater.  No associated object/fuselage could be observed.  I would say that it had a very similar appearance to a bright, blinking white beacon light that one would observe atop a radio transmitter tower.  It was definitely not an aircraft navigational light. I am an experienced observer of the night sky.  I am familiar with the commercial aircraft on their approach pattern to SFO (that path is due south of my location), and all the visible planets and 1st magnitude stars.

Artesia Road is about 12 to 13 miles due south from Safford, Graham, Arizona.  My daughter was with me and it was about 9:30 p.m  (2130) to 9:45 p.m. (2145). I always look around when I drive.

In the county, where Artesia Road is and where we live, most people have what is called a safety light on telephone and or electrical poles since there is no other source of lighting to light their property. A light caught my eye and at first I thought it was a safety light coming on, although coming on late since it was very dark.  I saw the light through the pine trees.  I thought it was shorted out or something.  As I passed the pine trees and was able to see the sky without any obstructions, I noticed another light that appeared, like someone flipped a switch.  I said “I don't believe it”.  My daughter said “Not again” referring to the UFO light I saw last year.  I said “Yes, there are the same UFO lights I saw last year” (also in the exact same area and also in the east sky.  The one light I saw last year was south east.)  Both lights were orange/red, more on the red side.  They were side by side.  They appeared for only about 20 seconds.  I stopped the car to watch.

I am reporting this several years after the fact.  Mostly because I just recently had the experience of seeing an object in the sky that I logically could not explain, and being a person who requires ""empirical evidence"" to label something properly in my inner database.   The only other event in my life (I'm 42, retired Air Force officer) that comes close is the one I am about to recount.   I was in the passenger seat of my fiance's car as we drove North on I-87 (the Northway) in the fall of 1994 and we were just approaching the Burnt Hill's exit (I believe Exit 11?) at dusk.  We were talking about our college classes from that day and I was looking straight ahead as we approached the overhead highway sign indicating the upcoming exit.  Traffic was relatively heavy (three lanes, full but moving) and as I looked straight ahead through the space under the highway sign, I initially thought I saw a sky full of stars.  This struck me as strange because the sky was not even fully dark yet; some light was still visible on the horizon.  As this thought began to strike me as odd, I quickly realized that the lights were slowly moving, up and to the left.   I stopped in mid-sentence and said to my fiance: ""Do you see that?  The sky ahead of us is moving!"" and we both watched as a giant rectangular shape (what I have always though of as resembling an upside-down aircraft carrier) was moving across the sky... very low (maybe 200-300 ft) and completely silent.  Not even a vibration from an object of that size, which he and I were both familiar with as aircrew members with many flight hours and time spent on the flightline.  We both watched as we continued to move in traffic and I asked him to please pull over into the median (we were in the far left lane) and he did try but we were at a point where the grassy median had very steep sides and he was worried that we would get stuck.  As he continued to drive and watch the road,! I climbed over into the back seat to get a better view from t! he back left side of the car.  I watched as this giant object with hundreds of small lights (randomly placed, like looking at a city) continued to move off over an area that was mostly farm fields (at that time, at least).  Remember, this was a time before the internet was a ""thing"" and people didn't carry cell phones with cameras.  We were just left to ponder this and check the news to see if anything came up to verify what we (and probably a hundred other commuters) had seen that night.  I haven't shared this info openly while I was still in the military due to my top secret clearance, and my now ex-fiance is still in the military and similarly concerned about talking.  But I am absolutely positive that I saw this massive, amazing object and cannot begin to explain its existence in any way that could fit with conventional knowledge of today's aircraft capabilities.",2013-10-23T00:00:00,42.9214,-73.9096

I was having dinner with two friends in Brookline Massachusetts and in the midst of dinner we were discussing vacations and places we had gone to for vacations as children.  I told them how my family would travel from Vermont to Owl's Head, Maine, for several weeks in the summer.  I mentioned that a cousin of mine had a restaurant in Southwest Harbor and how my parents would take us there for occasionally while we were staying in Owl's Head.   Anyway, the mention of Southwest harbor seemed to change the tone of both of my hosts.  They exchanged anxious looks and became quiet.  I noticed they continue to look at each other but not say much, and one of them, asked the other if he wanted to tell me.  They agreed they did, and here is what they told me:  In late August of 1982 my friends rented a small house on Goose Cove in Southwest Harbor, Maine.  I should say first that both of these men are serious and sober not given to storytelling or having a fascination with the occult or paranormal. They described the place being on the north-northeast side of Goose Cove and described a daytime view out to the ocean straight ahead of their house.  They could, at night, see lights in houses on the east side of the cover and the west side but said it was very woody and not densely settled.  They had a rental for a couple weeks.  Towards the end of their stay on what was a Thursday night, they had gone to bed early.  The house was a story and a half with two small bedrooms on the second floor.  A stairway separated the two bedrooms and at the bottom of the stairs was the front door leading to the porch which faced Goose Harbor.  At one point they both woke up hearing a humming sound and bright lights coming up the center stair from the windows in the front door. The light moved up and down and side to side a bit and the humming sound had some variation in pitch. They described the light looking like it might be coming from a helicopter search light but without the sound of helicopter engines. The time was shortly after 1:00 am making it now early Friday morning.  After more than ten minutes they got up the nerve to go downstairs to see what they could see. About 400 feet in front of the house there was a large metal object, a low cylinder, in a proportion like a tuna fish can but dark gray with yellow-white lights on it. It was flying about 45 feet above the surface of the water. The lights were redirected to the surface of the water and the volume and pitch of the hum dropped. Next they could hear and see a column of water beneath the object. Both were unsure whether water was being sucked up from ! the ocean or being dumped into it. This continued for over half an hour. A bit after 1:45 am they heard a higher pitch, and within a few minutes the cove became brighter like early dawn. Soon they could see lights coming from above and saw a second object like the first. It came down level with the first one and hovered southwest of the first object with a distance of about 50 feet. Its lights redirected to the water surface and the pitch and volume of sound lowered and then it too began to drop or suck up water in a cylinder form. They watched this from their window on the first floor of the house for about 35 or 40 minutes. Then the fist object moved about 1000 feet into the cove away from the house. Soon the second object aligned itself above the first and together they began to rise up at the same speed and then hovered together about 400 to 500 fet above the water. Then the hum returned to a high pitch and they lifted upward very fast and disappeared.  They checked to see if there were lights on in any of the other houses and saw none. They went upstairs and packed. At about 5:00 am there was decent light to carry luggage to the truck and they packed up and headed home to Massachusetts. They did not call or visit the police station. They drove to Cape Cod where they spent the rest of the weekend with the parents of one of the men. These parents had seen a UFO together in the late 1950s on Cape Cod. The following morning deer looked into the kitchen windows at them.",2013-10-23T00:00:00,44.2735,-68.3373

Date: September, 2011. Time: 2230 Hours GMT. Location: Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, England, UK.  I had just finished work which is located on St. Albans Road, A5183, near the roundabout of Redbourn and Hemel Hempstead, I was riding my motorcycle west towards where I lived, the road was currently under repairs on the B487 route, which must of started after I left for work earlier that day, I was re-directed a new route to get home, I proceeded east back on the B487 road towards the A5183 and south towards the A4147, heading east again, down that road ""about"" half way, something caught my left eye, it was silvery, large, disc shaped, red and white lights on top, on the side and on the bottom of it, with a green light flying around the object, it is a country road, and therefore has bushes and tress all around on the left and right side for miles in both directions, however, there was a car in front of me and also one car behind me, all 3 of our vehicles, at the same time, slowed down and came to a full stop, the space between our vehicles was roughly the size of! 5 average car lengths, as soon as I stopped I got off my motorcycle, removed my helmet, jumped through the bush onto the field, due to major curiosity, I remember thinking instantly that this is a UFO, from the time I got off my motorcycle which took about 3 seconds as I left the bike on I just put it on it's stand, to jumping the bush, the Very visible object had instantly vanished as quickly as I got off my motorcycle. I made my way back to my vehicle, none of the other drivers said anything to each other including myself, we were all just ""gob smacked"" we were all silent, I remember we all looked towards each other back and forth as if to say ""What the **** was that?"" after about 30 seconds the driver in front of me got back into his vehicle and continued on his journey, the vehicle behind me continued on his journey also after about another 30 seconds, I couldn't just ride away, I stayed there, lit up a cigarette, got my mobile phone out with the camera at the ready just in case I saw something again, entered the field once more, and stayed there as long as it took to smoke my cigarette, which was roughly 3-5 minuets, I heard nothing, I saw nothing, I myself then continued on my journey back home. After telling my mate the next day, he believed me and said he has had his own sighting of UFO's (literally being unidentified flying objects), we spoke about it for a while and then left it alone as we knew without any hard evidence, it would be near impossible to make it seem legit... and that was the end of that. With all of the hoax's in the world, extremists, and genuine legit sightings, nobody can be sure who is telling the truth, I would of said ""apparent genuine legit sightings"" but there's no need because I know what I saw, and I can only imagine those other 2 drivers that night knew it too, there ARE real sightings, use your own judgement and experience, if any.. I could probably drive back and find the exact spot I saw it as well but really..what's the point. ((e-address deleted))",2013-10-23T00:00:00,,

I was sitting outside at night with 3 other people in my backyard. It was around 10:40PM or so, nearing 11PM. From my backyard I am able to see a view of the El Paso mountains in the distance, and am able to see Transmountain Road, which is a long road that is a shortcut to get from the northeast side of town to the west side by cutting through rather than going around the mountain.  From our view you can see the headlights driving by from the cars in a certain area that drive by, but they are high up in elevation on the lower half of the mountain from the view we have. Two of us (myself and another) were sitting in the backyard facing away from the mountain, while the other two were sitting able to view the mountains and transmountain road, and one of them noticed this faint light above the mountains, she pointed and asked what it was, it was probably a hundred feet above or so, not sure but it was high up enough to look like a star, because that's what we thought it was. Thankfully, she didn't believe it was a star - and kept staring at it and suddenly told us it was moving, so we all turned to focus on it, it was so faint we didn't think anything of it for a couple of minutes except it was this hazy purple, it was the exact coloring if you stare at a black light, you can't really focus on it and it had this purple tone to it.  We thought there might be a cloud in front, but it was a clear night, the object was hazy. So trying to focus on it in the sky, we can begin to see this faint purple/blue light begins to slowly move, side to side, diagonally, in very unusual patterns at different speeds, and then it began to slowly fly behind the mountain, and as we watched it, for about 5 to 10 seconds it went out of sight.  We thought that was all there was to it, but we stayed looking, we all kind of wished it would come back, and we got our wish... It suddenly came back up and began to float down the mountain but it moves down in different ways, at first it went straight down and then diagonally, just erratic movements and it suddenly gets closer to the cars that are driving on transmountain, so we see this faint purple light get closer and closer to the cars and two of us are really scared that it will crash down, but the other two people with me tried to get out a really bad telescope of mine that didn't work properly - but hoping to be able to use it to see what this object is!  Then it suddenly pauses in front of one of the cars, almost like the object hit the brakes and it lights up so brightly I squinted, and we all just gasped in awe and fear. Then immediately it shot down below the road into the base of the mountain near an area that has no residential homes, it shot down from the right, then to the left and then out of sight. Being so scared we were expecting to see it come back up into the sky, maybe even fly over us but thankfully nothing.  We called into the non emergency phone line in El Paso to ask if anyone had seen strange lights, and they told us no. After that, a day later we went up to Transmountain to see if we could see anything below in the desert, and of course we found nothing unusual looking. I've seen in the mid 90's strange objects in the sky over Ft. Bliss (military base) area which is east of where I lived, objects that would blink and shine light onto the roof of the house in front of ours (without any sound, like a helicopter light should have), but never have I seen this black light colored object, erratically flying around near where a lot of cars drive back and forth 24/7, and if it was anything government made, we wondered why it would be so close to cars, seemed dangerous.  I just wonder if the drivers on Transmountain saw the object, because when it lit up so bright it seemed everyone would have been able to see it!  But it seems nobody noticed it but us that night, and we stayed out for many nights after that hoping to see it again but we haven't yet.",2013-10-23T00:00:00,31.7923281835206,-106.3748488764045

Traveling by car and while returning to Sacramento,CA from Reno, NV, in the early hours of New Years day, the 4 of us all witnessed a craft over a period exceeding 30 minutes. Craft was first spotted as a white light high in the mountain (approximately 40 miles away) and above the National Forest witnessed by the driver while observing the light through drivers rear view mirror for about 20-30 minutes. As the light became brighter, and closer, driver could clearly see the outline of the craft and further that what had appeared to be one single light was actually 3 lights located on the underside of the craft. Craft then hovered next to driver's passenger side of the vehicle (about 1/4 mile to 1/2 mile distance) next to Highway 80 for about 15 minutes, approximately 100 foot above the ground and in clear view of driver and all three passengers, as passengers discussed the features of this observance among each other.  All 4 of us were frightened.  Craft proceeded to travel at the same speed as our car (95-105 miles per hour) as driver's response was a futile attempt to ""outrun"" the craft (this lasted about 5-10 minutes).  It should be noted that other witnesses were present as another automobile actually passed our automobile at approximately 110 or more, miles per hour. Driver became exhausted and recognizing that he could not outrun the craft, and fearing an accident at this speed, driver decided to slow down and finally stopped the automobile on the side of Highway 80, hoping that the craft would continue in it's trajectory, and simply pass.  Driver got out of the car and watched as the craft continued and finally passed.   Note: The craft traveled approximately 100 feet off the ground over the terrain which increased and decreased in height according to the height of the terrain as if perfectly measuring a gravitational effect of the earths pull on the craft.  There was no sound effect from the craft, and in fact, from any other source. It was totally quiet. Upon arrival at our destination, this matter was called into the USAF dispatch and a complete report was made by all 4 witnesses.  There was never any followup by the USAF.  I still remember this event as if it was just yesterday.  The only detail that still troubles me is the fact that it took us 6 hours to make the trip that even at 65 miles per hour should not have exceeded 4 1/2 hours.  This means that driver estimates that we were missing about 1 1/2 hours of time as measured from Reno to Pleasanton, CA., as the trip took us over 6 hours total.  Saucer was approximately 130 feet wide by 35 feet high.",2013-11-20T00:00:00,,

On around 10/02/2013 at about 3AM I went outside to go smoke after suddenly waking up with a strange feeling/disturbance to my sleep.  I'm not sure if the noise was in my dream or if I was half asleep and imagined it  But I woke up startled to a noise like medal on medal rubbing. It sounded like it was coming from either outside my window, but over my head, or up in my attic or over my roof.  I Immediately called my friend Madison and as I'm going outside & on the phone with her I saw a star in the sky oddly brighter than the rest, As I observed it for awhile I realized it couldn’t be a star,  Maybe an airplane?  It had 2 flashing colors which are why I originally thought it to be a plane and it was moving.  But the more I watched it the more I realized it was NOT a plane and it was NOT the only one there.  The first one I saw I call “the bright one” it was on the left hand side of the sky.  It kind of sat there for about 10 minutes just hovering then I notice 2 other ones on the right hand complete opposite side of the sky they were brighter than stars but not as bright as the first “bright one.”  They were far away so it was hard to tell of their shape, But they appeared to be an oval shape as I could see after all this, because “The bright one” all of a sudden SPEEDED across the sky at a speed Impossible by aircraft to man. It freaked me out really bad because then the “bright one” went across the sky and then straight up to above the two on the right I seen before. The 3 of them formed a triangle shape, with the bright one being in lead. Once they were all aligned PERFECTLY, They went DEAD STRAIGHT up into the sky and disappeared after awhile of ascending! As they went upwards I also saw what appeared to be several more of them trailing behind the first 3 (what I’ve been referring to as LEADERS) But weren’t as distinct for whatever reason as the first 3. They ALL however did ascend straight up and away.  I called several people explaining what I had seen in a panic. It really scared me I went inside, locked the doors. THEN last night a similar thing happened, only this time I had an eye witness. My sister was staying for the weekend THANK GOD. Same scenario. We went outside to go smoke, The exact time we came back inside from watching the “ufo’s” this time was at 9:56 PM and the date was 10/06/2013. I live near Days Creek Oregon in Canyonville, Right next to the Canyonville YMCA. This time I saw the same “bright one” it was AGAIN on the left hand side of the sky and there were AGAIN other ones This time more spread out. This time however they all sat rather still for about 20 minutes. I wish I had timed it but I hadn’t so the duration is a guess. They all (as last time) were flashing 2 different colors. A couple of them at first zigzagged across the sky in FAST speeds like the last time after sitting still for quite awhile. I pointed the “stars” out to my sister getting extr! emely excited. “LOOK! THIS IS WHAT I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT, THEIR THERE AGAIN!” My sister DID see them too and was pretty scared & nervous. She kept saying it was really weird and she didn’t know what they were. Appearing to her as planes as well at first, she also considered maybe there was just a large amount of satellites. Until they began moving at rapid speeds then ASCENDING, MOST OF THEM, Straight up into the sky.  Both times I was sitting on my porch there are a bunch of trees behind my house, But I could see them all clearly UP above them in CLEAR sky just a street past my house is what i believe to be a logging company? there is a big empty lot right there, sometimes semi trucks but none that I seemed to notice on those nights, Tho I wasn't paying attention to anything but these UFOS",2013-10-14T00:00:00,42.9273,-123.28119999999998

At 6:30 am on Sunday October 6th, 2013, my Girlfriend and I had just returned home in Snohomish from visiting friends in Seattle, WA.  It was a beautiful and perfectly clear night sky just before sunrise and I took notice of the familiar constellations above me.   Within seconds, I noticed that a few of the lights were extra bright looking and even looked a bit orange in color.  I focused on the brightest one directly above me and I could see that it was moving very slowly and steadily across the sky.  I got my Girlfriend's attention and she started watching with me.  At this point I thought it could be a an airplane at high altitude or a satellite but I continued to follow it with my eyes.  Not a second later, it accelerated to at least ten times it's speed and shot across the sky.  Without slowing down, it then took a seemingly impossible right angle turn.  The glowing orange object then slowed down and returned back in the direction it came from and then took off! at vertical angle directly out into outer space.  We followed it for twenty seconds or so until its light faded completely.  	We then scanned the sky for other bright star-like lights and found that there were at least three more visible that were behaving in the same way.  They were moving about the sky in ways that were not possible by regular known aircraft and were moving at incredible speeds.  They were also accelerating and changing direction in ways that I have never seen. It was quite clear that they were guided by intelligence.  This went on for about twenty minutes until the Sun started rising and the lights faded into the blue morning sky.  All four of the observed UFOs were at seemingly high altitudes and were witnessed very clearly by both myself and my Girlfriend.",2013-10-14T00:00:00,47.91181404255319,-122.03520680851064

It was four times as bright as Venus (at the planet's brightest) to the naked eye.  I observed it from the Spring Valley area of Clearlake Oaks, CA. I went inside and got a pair of binoculars and could see the object was diamond shape, bright white, and seemed to be rapidly spinning.

As large as it appeared in my binoculars, I should have been able to discern structure but all I could see was very bright light. It remained stationary for 15 minutes and then slowly moved off to the NW.  It was then obscured by hills and I could no longer see it.  I could not detect any noise.

My son is a 15 year old Caucasian male and I am a 42 year Caucasian female.  We were driving home from his volleyball league at night, heading north on route 675 close to mile marker 4 or 5 around Centerville, Ohio.  We saw something that looked like car headlights in the sky about the height of a cell phone tower.  It was up ahead on our left.   As we got closer we noticed it was too large to be a cell tower and we did not see any structure underneath it.  It was definitely stationary - not moving.  As we got up almost even with it, we noticed how large it was and how we couldn't see a structure underneath.  We couldn't see the actual craft, but could now see lights underneath as well - forming a large triangle.  All of a sudden it took off!  We pulled the van off the road, and my son took out his cell phone and tried to get a video as it went parallel to us for a second or two, then veered off perpendicular to our left - ! quickly.  We were stunned.  We wanted to report it right away in case more people saw it.  I think it's important to note that we have lived in the area for more than 13 years.  There is an Air Force base near us.  That being said, we know how planes, helicopters, fighters, bombers, etc. move in the sky - we see them very often.  I have never seen anything move like this object moved.  So unless it is part of some new, experimental military thing, I don't know what it was!  Another note, before this happened I was in the grocery store near where my son was practicing, and things just felt weird.  There was a policeman outside of the grocery as I came in ... not sure why, this is an extremely safe area of town.  Also the people in the store were acting strange - just kind of overly friendly.

It was a bright light moving from Northwest to Southeast just as fast as the space station did but then it started to slow down, stop, change from a bright white to a red and green light, back to dim white, slowly move east, then slowly move north again.  I thought this to be extremely odd and that’s when I called my wife over to witness it with me.  We stood at the end of our driveway looking north and watched it change color and patterns a couple of times.  I asked my wife to film it with her Samsung Galaxy S III phone but because of the distance and with the light coming from my house (to inform trick-or-treater’s that we are handing out candy) the strange light in the sky didn’t show up on her phone.  At approximately 20:20 is when my next door neighbor came out from her house to see if there were any more kids going to stop by.  I asked her to come out to the end of her driveway with us to see if she knew what it was.  She thought it was odd as well but didn’t want to think too much about it.  We stood at the end of her driveway for about a minute and that’s when the strange light moved slowly north and behind some thin clouds moving in.  Soon after that, the strange light moved past the horizon of our home and out of view. My wife and I had hoped that it would have been seen by other parents out with their kids during this night and perhaps it would have been reported to a local media station, but after thinking about it, who really wants to report anything like this on Halloween? My thought process was to report it on this website in hopes it would produce some intelligent feedback. Kinda odd, but don’t want to think about it too much.

I also noticed on three separate occasions that the cluster of lights would dance around and flash in a recognizable pattern, followed almost immediately on one occasion of a wave of even tinier lights seeming to fall from nothing visible in the sky upon the cluster of egg shaped lights.   My sister and I both observed these lights from two ! separate rooms in which we had extinguished all the indoor lights.  We watched these lights, looking for explanation for well over an hour.   At first we hoped they were the reflecting eyes of several small mammals, such as rabbits of possums, searching for garbage.  Yet they did not move as animals normally do, stayed too consistently within the sphere of gathered lights and also did not alert the dog in the same manner.  They remain clustered upon the ground where we first noticed them even as I write this report.   Other people saw these unexplained lights as well.  Both a separate sister, my mother and my 13 year old niece saw the lights as well and observed their strange movements.   Our dog noticed the lights as well, barked for a very short period of time and investigated the separated lights.  He stayed well away from the cluster of tiny pulsating lights however.   My sister and niece at one time stated that the light seemed red on two separate occasions and blue once.

It has been windy and overcast for the last two hours and the rain from earlier had stopped.  We were both facing to the north to keep the chilling winds at our backs.  Suddenly a loud noise came from the sky to the east-northeast.Along With the noise was steady flashes of bright white lights reflecting off the low, fast moving clouds. It was a loud noise and sounded like two distinct but simutainious notes. The lights and sound did not move...  The noise sounded like two simultaneous steady tones... If I had to guess what the tones sounded like, I would say a pair of jet turbines but very clean... meaning no low rumble of exhaust sounds, as a jet makes when flying.  Again, the lights and sound stayed in one area only.  The noise and lights stopped after about 10 seconds.  The event stopped as fast and as loud as it started the only difference is! that the tones dropped quickly in pitch. This was completely strange because that kind of noise with lights did not belong in the sky.  In fact, I've never heard anything like it before.  After the event, my wife and I just looked at each other. I ask her, ""DID YOU JUST HEAR THAT?""  She said, ""Yeah..""  I then asked her if she saw the flashes of light too.

Over the course of this multi day event I saw in excess of 40 UFOs and I was only doing serious night time photography on Sunday evening.  During the previous evening we saw over 35 UFOs but I was otherwise occupied with a new romantic interest to care much about grabbing my camera.  Although, on Sunday evening after she had departed I was shooting with a Sony A-65 with a standard 18-55 mm lens using a tripod doing 10 second exposures with 24 mega-pixel resolution in ""night mode.""  I had just captured a photo of our crew singing around an open field when we saw a UFO suddenly appear in the sky.  I was easily able to swivel my camera about 90 degrees, elevate the camera and snap a photo of the UFO.  The UFO began traveling towards us over the field and did what's referred as a ""power up"" wherein the brightness increases of the UFO.  It's hard to tell the altitude of the UFO but I would estimate that it was at least a mile overhead. The UFO then phased out and vanished.  This is similar behavior that the majority of the other UFOs exhibited over that weekend.  Many times the UFOs changed direction, sped up and slowed down, zig-zaged and phased in and out of visibility.  Most where white in color and round in shape. Often there would be a couple of UFO appearing at the same time but most where single occurrences.  I did not see any metal or hear any sounds associated with the UFO craft. The moon was almost full that night and was behind us. We had already seen the international space station fly overhead which was really bright and travelled linearly across the entire sky. I had also seen a few conventional aircraft fly overhead with their bright strobe lights clearly visible. I took a few photos of those aircraft as a reference. There were about ten other persons present in my immediate vicinity who all saw the same object and who all believed it to be a UFO. I will also clearly state that this gathering was alcohol and drug free. I am a professional videographer and I also have a fair amount of experience with digital still cameras. I have never filmed or photographed a UFO before but I've always had a big interest in airplanes and aviation history.  I have worked for Boeing for a number of years and have seen and discussed many types of conventional aircraft.  I was not able to associate these UFOs with any other craft that I have studied before.

I would guess the light was anywhere from 3-5 miles out to sea.   I initially thought it was a distress flair from a ship, but I noticed after a few seconds that the light had remained totally still. It did not flicker or waver or move at all.   After several seconds, a second light appeared to the left of the first light.  It was identical to this first light.  These two lights would then alternate with one being on and one being off for a few seconds, then a third and fourth light appeared, again to the left of the original two lights.  The pattern of alternating with one being on then off continued for a few more seconds before the lights all went off but for one.  This one lingered for a few more seconds before! finally just disappearing altogether.   The whole time there were no sounds heard.

It was so vivid and apparent, I automatically assumed it was some kind of man-made event.   I was alone in my car, but there were lots of vehicles traveling, all those folks had to see them also.  I thought it was a carnival, perhaps lights on a Ferris wheel.  The closer I got, it became painfully evident these were not Ferris wheel lights, cell tower lights, aircraft or even the Big Dipper itself.   I noticed the bottom two lights would turn off and on, they also switched positions.  The rest of the lights were totally stationary.  They did sort of resemble flare lights, but couldn't have been because of the formation, stationary position and those bottom two lights moving left to right.   This was an astounding site, I was literal! ly in shock as I drove by them.  I didn't stop, I was on an expressway, but I did wonder why people weren't stopping to take photo's and video's.

I was driving home from work in Gilbert, AZ, approximately 7:40 PM, turned left onto Alma School Road (heading south) from Guadalupe Road. After driving for about 10-15 seconds, a light in the sky to my left caught my eye.  It was travelling in the same direction as my truck, but much faster.  It immediately appeared to be something unusual as it was an orange flickering orb, flying at about the speed of a small plane, and probably a little lower. I was trying to get a better look, while not causing an accident, and finally had to pull into a small parking lot as I was now sure that this was not a plane or helicopter. After stopping, I got out of my truck and noticed there was another one behind the first.  I watched them going by for a few seconds before getting out my cell phone and taking a video.  Just as I started the video, the second one turned 90 degrees and headed east (it can be seen in the video doing this).  There was no sound whatsoever emanating from them. Only road noise is heard in the video. Looking to my left (North), I suddenly noticed that there was another one, then immediately after, three more behind the first three, in a straight line formation, all heading south except the one that broke off to the East.  The line appeared to stretch almost to the horizon.  As the line progressed south, another one headed east from the same spot that the first did.  I am not sure, but I think it was the 4th in line.  Seeing how far the line went, I kept wondering how many more would show up. Because I was trying to watch and describe what I was seeing on the video at the same time, I lost count.  The total was 6 or 7. Also, it was impossible to see any real shape to them because I couldn't see any defined edges.  It was almost as though it was ""approximately round"", with the edges constantly fluxuating. Because they were orange, and flickering, I thought that they could be Chinese Lanterns, however they were travelling at a fairly high rate of speed, and when I got home I immediately checked the current wind speed on the Internet, which happened to be zero.  I took a screen shot of this, however it doesn’t show the date. I still have the video which is 2:42 and 291 MB, MP4 format.",2013-10-23T00:00:00,33.29885793871866,-111.86506392757661

The object was covering almost all of the above sky view, it was like what they call the '""Mother ship"".  It looked round underneath the object, it had heaps of bright lights underneath the craft.  The lights were turning around in different directions according to the rows, and was like turning more then one direction, it was like, looking into  a night view of another city with all the lights on.  Colour of the object was dark grey and metal or steel like, but a rough surface, object looked high in height and did not look completely round on the top level, rather kind of some corners around the top edges it was unbelievably silent, no sound or wind coming from the huge object, and did not see any aliens in sight.  It was almost like the spaceship that you see in some movies these days, but sound turn off.  It was like observing the area for at least 5-7 mins or more.    Then suddenly started to move in high speed directly up and up for a few minutes, then slightly angled towards the sea with a higher speed until it was about the size of the  moon and paused for awhile,  During this period the lights turned off and only looked like a grey saucer, and within seconds shot up into the sky slightly direction of the sea  but disappeared up into the sky's atmosphere.   Soon after arriving at a friends house I phone the TV news channel to report it, from what I remember it was channel 7.  I reported all the information above, and was told that they would investigate, and call me back, which few hours later they did.  But only to tell me that, so many other people have also reported it and after their investigation there was no sighting in the radars.  I was told it was in possible for it to be a spaceship, other wise they would have detected it, and it could be a air-balloon add.  No matter how much I tried to describe it to her, she was not interested or did not believe it to investigate it further. for a huge sighting that I reported at the time there was hardly any UFO sightings these day is nothing like the one I have witnessed.   To this day I have not heard or seen it in any reports anywhere, and always wondered why, for all the small types of sightings are reported documented and announced, and I am always trying to research of the other witnesses whom were there, or seen it that day, or anyone else that would have had the similar experience.   Those days there was no mobile phones to take photos for proof etc.  For this is very true and described the best of my memory today, and it was nothing like from our planet that's for sure.

As I walked, about two miles further, I came upon some very large animal cat tracks, which were approximately 10 inches in diameter.  This was very strange, because, there are no such animals in this part of the country, with the size of paws which would make tracks that big, period. As I examined the tracks, I could see that they had jumped from somewhere and landed to the left of the trail I was walking on, and as the tracks first connected with the ground, they made an impression with the three front claws on each paw, digging into the dried mud which I assume was moist when the prints were left.  The animal then began to walk with its paws flat, with all five claws digging into the mud and leaving track of a walking animal. I followed these big cat tracks up a cutline which is a service path between the highway and the hydro line, to where the cat tracks stopped at the top of the hill.  Then things got strange, as the front paws of the big cat moved to the left, one after the other, then to the right, also one after the other, then forward one step with both paws.  The next thing I saw was two sets of size nine, mans hiking boots following the cat tracks, which followed the same pattern.  The men’s hiking boots moved to the left, one after the other, then to the right, also one after the other, and then forward one step with both feet, then proceeded to walk down the other side of the hill towards the highway and right up to the pavement, where they disappeared. I followed the tracks from the highway, all the way back to the top of the hill, where I was looking for the continuation of the cat tracks, but I could not find any continuation.  I walked down to where I first encountered the tracks which jumped out of nowhere, and looked in a semi circle, up to at least thirty feet from where the tracks had landed on three claws, but I was unable to find the beginning of the cat track. After studying the track for some time, I was under the impression that there was something quite unusual going on here, but what?  I talked with different people over the years, and some thought it may have been a hoax, others thought it was a shape shifter, still others thought it was the devil, and so on. The area was to far from Thompson for anyone to stumble onto the tracks, which were left their since the last rain, maybe three days before.  So what could have, jumped from out of nowhere, walked in soft mud to leave tracks, and changed into a human, gone to the highway and disappeared, possibly into the City of Thompson?  Who or what is moving among us, and where do they come from? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2013-11-20T00:00:00,55.7435,-97.8558

It was multi colored and continuously blinking red blue and white lights.   There were lots of black clouds coming in off the ocean.  So, before the object moved behind these clouds I quickly ran and got my camera.  I snapped four pics.  But the 2 here were the only ones that came out before it disappeared.   The 2 that came out I just blew it up so you can see the lights more clearly.  The first set of lights were 2 red lights.  The 2nd pic, I caught the red and blue as the blue light was blinking.   I reported this to MUFON who subsequently did a phone interview with me.  They said it was unidentifiable.  I'll let ! you be the judge.  This isn't the 1st time I saw a UFO around my area.",2013-10-14T00:00:00,33.85845244956772,-118.3777363112392

Relatively few cars were on the winding mountain road and the sky was very overcast.  While driving on a fairly straight portion of the road, a glowing white light caught my eye.  The spherical object was approximately the size of a cantaloupe or basketball and was hovering stationary near the top of a large tree.  The object seemed to shimmer white light yet did not blink lights and did not change light color.  It was a glowing ball of white transparent light. I quickly braked and grabbed my iphone (which was in camera mode as I had been stopping periodically to take pictures of the autumn leaves) and snapped a picture of the glowing orb.  Mere seconds later, the orb appeared on the opposite side of the 2-lane road at approximately the same height off the ground, yet I did not witness the orb move from one location to the other. It was simply as if it ""disappeared"" as it moved between locations within seconds. I quickly snapped a second picture before the object simply was no longer visible.  No longer seeing the object, I proceeding in driving toward my destination. Once in SLC, I stopped to look at the two pictures of the object I had taken.  I was surprised to see that the object (which had appeared bright white to my eyes at the time I observed and photographed the object) appeared glowing GREEN, not white, in the two photographs!

The sky was perfectly clear and very light, as the sun was just setting. We turned west onto 38th Street, a six-lane-wide street with a clear view of the sky nearly down to the horizon. As soon as we were on 38th Street, we saw four lights in the western sky in front of us. Each light was round, orange, and approximately four to five times the size of Venus, which was also visible in the western sky.  Their position in the sky appeared to be approximately 15 to 20 degrees to the right of Venus.  The lights were arranged in a straight vertical line, like a column.  The lights were the same distance from each other, and as we continued to watch them, the two bottom lights moved laterally to the left away from the two upper lights while still holding their position relative to each other, one on top of the other.  Then the two bottom lights moved back beneath the top lights, still keeping the same distance between each other.  Then the bottom lights seemed to sink toward the horizon while the top lights seemed to move upwards in the opposite direction.   We continued to drive west on 38th Street while my son and I took photos with our phone cameras.  Suddenly, all four lights seemed to flatten out, changing in an instant from round, star-like orbs to flat, horizontal streaks.  This happened so quickly that there was no discernible process of change--the forms just appeared different, though the new shapes were the same orangish color and retained their positions relative to each other.   We drove off 38th Street into the 100 Acre Arts Park of the Indianapolis Museum of Art and stopped the car in an effort to see better, but by then the sky had darkened and the flat, horizontal streaks faded rapidly. As we scanned the sky for the shapes, we then saw two streaks of white moving rapidly across the sky in the same path as the shapes.  As the white streaks continued moving, we saw that they were contrails from airplanes.  We could see the dark forms and the blinking red and white lights of the planes as they flew overhead. I Googled ""UFO reporting"" on my phone and found the number for the National UFO Reporting Center.  I called and reported what we had seen and am submitting our separate reports of the sighting as instructed. My husband, son and I all witnessed this sight together, and we agreed that it was unlike anything any of us had ever seen before. Submitted by L. On Tuesday October 8, 2013, my wife, stepson, and I were traveling west on 38th street in Indianapolis, Indiana.  When we approached 38th and Fall Creek, I looked in the clear Western Sky. It was approximately 7:30 p.m. and that's when I noticed four lights in the sky. They were in a vertical formation, with what I would guess from the ground looked like they had about 100 to 200 yards between them.  We began following these lights.  Two of these lights smoothly and suddenly began to float in a horizontal pattern and headed southwest.  As the sun set, the lights became more difficult to see, almost as if they were cloaked by the sunlight. We followed the lights to the 100 Acre grounds of the Indianapolis Museum of Art.  It was there that my wife called the National UFO Center, and we were told that a similar phone call had been made only moments before from Pennsylvania, and the caller had reported seeing these lights in the Western sky. Submitted by K. It all started as my mom, stepdad, and I were driving home from my grandmother’s house. We were all having a jolly old time in the car, discussing various subjects like school, politics, and dreams.  As we were heading close to the road that leads to my stepdad’s house, my mom suddenly jumped up and shouted “LOOK, UP IN THE SKY!” I thought she was crazy until I put my glasses on and saw four orange-ish lights floating in unison.  After I saw them, my stepdad finally noticed them as well.  Right after we acknowledged their existence, two of the bottom-most lights began to fly left horizontally.  It was then that we realized that these HAD to have been UFOs. We started following the lights but to no avail.  The closer we drove to the lights, the darker the sky became, and eventually the two remaining lights disappeared on the horizon.  We stopped near the Indianapolis Museum of Art to look up, but still nothing could be seen.  It was then that my mom called in the UFO hotline and reported our findings.  What intrigued me the most is how the operator mentioned someone in Pennsylvania reporting the exact same sighting as us mere minutes before we called in.

We were probably at least 25,000 feet up.  I had a window seat on the starboard side and was enjoying watching electrical storms dance across the northern sky.  The Big Dipper was hanging low in the northern sky and was visible most of the time with the lightning activity below.  Intermittent patches of clouds sometimes obscured my view of the stars, but most of the time I had a spectacular view of the sky above a long line of storms to the north which stretched approximately from the mid-western states to western New Mexico. It was after a short period of cloud obstruction when the strange lights appeared. If you were to mark a spot midway between a line joining the two stars at the end of the handle of the Big Dipper and draw a line perpendicular to and up from that line, the lights appeared on that line at a point about a third longer than the line joining the two stars.  They were slightly brighter than those two stars and appeared white.  At arm's length they were about a pinky finger's width apart. I'm familiar with that area of the sky and knew immediately that they couldn't have been stars, planets, or any other celestial body.  My first thought was that they were satellites, so I watched them for any movement.  They remained perfectly motionless like stars for about a full minute.  Then briefly for several seconds, my eyes were drawn to a few flashes of lighting below.  Then when I looked back up, the two lights had disappeared.  I continued watching that area of the sky for at least 15 minutes afterwards but they never reappeared.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,,

Then there's an object which had 1 red light in front, 1 large red light in back which blinked on & off.  It immediately struck us as odd but unfortunately missed it w/ the cell cam  as it flew over us.  What can I say?  It looked like a disc.   It was small, low flying & made 0 sound.  I'm not a believer, but this was weird. As we walk in the grocery I'm looking at the first large light tht was sitting in the middle of the sky for now the last 20 min.  When we came out it as gone.

I momentarily turned around facing the street when out of my peripheral vision something above caught my attention.  I looked up for a second and saw a rather large bright white light, hovering.  Thinking it was a helicopter at first,  I was about to look away when it occurred to me that there was no noise. At that very instant the light went souring across the sky as if it were a shooting star.  There was no gradual acceleration, it was instantaneous. I was a little freaked out. It was almost like it was watching me and when it noticed that I saw it, took off.  I've heard of people seeing weird things like this, but this is the first time it's ever happened to me.  It appeared to be egg shaped as it traveled, but could’ve just been due to the speed at which it took off that made it appear to be oblong.  I don’t know. But there was second, small red light attached to the large white light when it was moving. Anyway, that’s what I saw. It all lasted maybe 3-4 seconds at the most. No noise. Complete silence.

This morning while driving south down NY route 302 I rounded a bend on that hilly and wooded road, and saw in the sky above the trees three widely-spaced white lights with a flashing red light underneath.  My first thought at seeing the flashing light was ""OK, FAA regulation lights"" and didn't immediately pull over to really have a look (plus I was doing 60mph).  But when I rounded the next bend about 5 seconds later and had a view of the same patch of sky, the object was gone.   So I started to really analyze what I saw for those 5 seconds before.  If that was a man-made craft of some sort, it would've had a very long wingspan based on the positioning of the lights.  Plus, the sky was just lightening for dawn, yet I could see no discernible fuselage, certainly not a full-size jet with a large wingspan, nor could I hear any aircraft propulsion.    Furthermore, those lights were far below normal commercial airspace, more at about private and small aircraft altitude. If it was a large transport flying into Stewart Air Base 20 miles to the east (Newburgh, NY), why did it have lights already on and why was it flying north and not east?  Also, those lights were not nearly as bright as commercial landing lights.  If it was a small private plane or ultra-light from Orange County (NY) Airport to the south, why would it be flying in the dark at 5:30am, with such a long wingspan, and traveling fast enough to disappear in 5 seconds?  I am an art director at a leading aviation and aerospace magazine, and am well-informed in latest aircraft and UAV technologies.  There was just something too odd about the lights I saw this morning.  Plus, with Pine Bush's long history of sightings (the town itself has even adopted a ""gray"" alien character as the official mascot!), anything is possible.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,41.6182,-74.3361

The object was behind a tree during the stop.  Light turns green and when the object became visible from behind the tree it did not seem to have the same shape that it had earlier.  Maybe 1 and a half minutes prior. I started thinking to myself maybe it was a witch commonly known as Brujas in Mexico, and right as i thought that the passenger mentioned that it looks like a human flying, and i agreed.  The object seem to have looked different from different points of view as if it were shifting in some way.  We ended up parking in a parking lot to take time to ! look at it and it seemed to have become stationary and rotating slowly heading in a perfect horizontal direction north towards Nashville.

This is my honest report on what i saw and will not reveal any personal info about myself.  On the 21st of june 2013 in el cajon, CA i was talking on the phone to someone outside smoking a cigarette and then i saw a bright white light over the hill come up abruptly then i noticed it was coming straight towards me in a residential district when it was flying low so i walked closer and interrupted the conversation to let the other person on the line know what i was seeing.  The light got closer and closer and was completely silent and had 1 main light in the middle and when it was coming towards me i saw lights shift from port(left) to starboard(right) and back and forth.  The lights changed colors and moved from both sides, port and starboard of the craft.  I've been in the navy as a logistics specialist (LS) and am a trained lookout for surface and aerial contacts on a ship and have seen many lights at a distance of nautical miles in open sea and in other countries and have nev! er seen an aircraft anything like this.  The person on the line was totally freaked out by what i was describing and i was totally interested in what was going on.   I would have been a lot more concerned if it stopped right over me, but instead it kept moving circling the city changing lights as if it appeared to be a plane at a distance but it was about 500 yards above me.  I'm used to giving locations of contacts off the port bow, so i would say that if when i was looking at it, it came up at 00 degrees or my centerline and moved in a circle at my centerline then zig zagged slowly moving to my port side up and over slightly to the left of me moving 2, then 2.5, then 3, then 4 points off the port bow (as if i was locating it on the ship with MSC-Military Sealift Command type navigation as my ship was crewed as part navy and part MSC)(wont give name or country) and kept moving eventually out of sight.  Then a low flying plane flew right over me about 5 mins after the event and ! i could clearly see the difference. Not to mention my phone so! unded like it was staticy like i was being listened to.  I wouldn't be surprised because it was a non-secure line.  The thing is we never see anything flying low at 2200 at night in a residential area as i go out a lot to smoke a cigarette.   I know that this is not that detailed, but it was very detailed on the phone.  My phone couldn't zoom in to take pics, but for whatever its worth i wanted to let people know i'm a credible veteran who was honorably discharged 2 months ago to go to college and i saw this right outside the house and didn't know what else to do but write it down. I just googled how to report ufo and here i am. A drone would have made noise, even if it were a static noise.

Partly cloudy skies but the moon was very bright. They were only one color (orange) and very easy to notice,  although they were a dull orange so to speak, they were very easy to see and follow.  Cannot tell how big they were or how high they were flying but I’m assuming they were below the cloud line at least for a little while. They were not in any particular pattern that I could see from my vantage point but seemed grouped pretty tightly but I was driving and lost them behind trees every once in a while.   Some were grouped closer together and some seemed to be lagging behind and strung out at the tail end.  All of them seemed to be flying in the same direction following the exact same trajectory and not spread out  to wide. I heard no noise, I would think from a fleet of airplanes or jets flying that close that engine noise from the group would be loud. Regardless, the lighting as a whole emanating from the objects, appeared to imply that the objects were fairly large, even if they were flying low, I can’t say that I could liken these to aircraft lighting as I’ve seen plenty of aircraft lights and are in comparison much smaller even at low altitudes. There were no other lights coming from the objects, certainly none of the colors you would see on conventional aircraft, only an overall orange glow.  They didn’t seem to be moving real fast but it was dark and I couldn’t really compare their speed to anything in the area, although it took me about 5 to 7 min to drive around the block by the time I got to the original area where I saw them, they were gone… all of them! They could have disappeared into the clouds.  I thought they might be candles or something but they just seemed too bright, too big, too round and were obviously moving faster than they appeared to be moving originally.  Maybe I’ll find out what they were eventually and it will turn out to be something not so extraordinary! But as of right now I can’t identify them as much as I’d like to.  Somehow my gut tells me that it’s something completely explainable although I’m not sure where that feeling is coming from.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,42.1058,-87.87709999999998

It continued on towards my left and curved upward.  It appeared to slow down and ""drop"" what looked like small black packages.   It then sped up a little and kept on its path until it disappeared.   I was a little freaked out, and went in the garage to get a cigarette and came right back outside and sat down in the same place.

I have noticed a large stationary light hovering in and around St. Louis County.  I first observed the object driving south on interstate 170 towards interstate 64/40.  The Object appeared over the municipality of Brentwood.  It was not an aircraft and it was a solid large white light.  It was not a satellite and was too low in the sky to be a planet. It was however bright like a planet.  I checked astronomical charts and there does not appear to be a planet in this location.  If you are driving due south it would be at the 11:oo O'clock position.  I observed this object for a number of days in this general vicinity.  Sometimes the object is in the same relative spot and at other times it is nearby but in a very different location. On a number of occasions I observed the object moving very slowly to the west.  Again it appeared bright, it had no flashing lights.  At times the object seemed to blink out and then reappear.  This was not due to clouds as I observed it on clear evenings. On one occasion during this same week I observed the object moving to the west as I proceeded west on I-64 heading towards chesterfield, MO.  I noticed the object hovering over Chesterfield Mall and moving very slowly west.  I was able to keep a visual on the object until I reached my home in Chesterfield.  I tried to observe the object with binoculars.  That really did not help clarify what it was. It stayed more or less stationary over chesterfield for a couple of hours. It eventually disappeared.  Once again I thought maybe it was a bright planet but it did not seem to set. If I had to hazard a guess, I heard about NSA spy drones or stationary objects that are collecting data and it is possible it could be one of those.  It did not dart off or make any erratic movements. I have noticed it in early evening for several weeks.  It does move to the naked eye so that is why I am discounting that it might be a planet.  When I tried to look at it with binoculars I also had my wife and kids look at it as well.  They had no idea what it was.  I am a native St. Louisian and have lived in this region my whole life.

Austin, TX Oct. 12, 2013 3:08:40 A.M. My window faces to the South.  There are no lights out that way, so it is very dark since we are tucked into a dense ranch.  Being that my window is on the top floor of a 3rd story apartment, I can see above the tree lines. In the wee hours the morning of the 12th, I peeked out the window to check my van and weather before I went to sleep.  I was startled by a bright amber light about 1/2 a block away - maybe closer.  I opened the window to get a better view. The light was still and silent.  I even waved at it, and then I went to get my cell phone to video it.  When I returned, it was still there, and that shocked me.  I had half expected it to have left. I fumbled to see how to operate my new device, and eventually took a short video, but I was not sure if it was working.  I forgot about the light and the video till today. Had I seen what the video showed, I would have camped out to see ""them"" leave!  In the video, it shows several amber lights with white tinier ones behind the main one.  Off to the left - there were more, and I cannot help but think I was so concerned as to whether the cell was taking video, I did not see the entire picture of the outside sky.  I recall turning the camera right to left to pan, as my window is rather narrow, but it lasted only 17 seconds.  Now that I can see it, it appeared to be above and beyond my building hovering!  It sure looks like there is a hazy bright gold figure (full of light) just left of center of the ""main amber light"" in gold. (I would like to upload it if I can figure how to do that too.  I took a second video tonight for a perspective as to how dark it is out there!)",2013-10-23T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

This would not have been anything strange, except for the fact that they were slowly moving away from me at a very low altitude (maybe 1500-2000 feet), and that they moved in perfect unison together which lead me to believe these two blinking red lights were connected to ONE craft!  It was very slowly traveling away from me.  Slower than conventional aircraft fly.   Judging by the distance between the two red lights, this thing must have been massive!!  I also get the feeling it maybe have been triangle shaped and I was seeing the rear part of the craft.  But there was no visible propulsion systems and no noise.   It traveled in a northwest course towards the Puget Sound.   I work in aerospace building modern day commercial planes.  I have never seen anything that large, that flies like what I saw tonight.

This report is being submitted for a relative.  My adult relative was concerned and distressed about a strange noise she heard on the night of Thursday, November 21, 201,3 at 11:35 p.m.  She was in bed sleeping soundly when she unexpectedly awoke to a loud sound that was right outside her window.  It perplexed her and she seemed a little disturbed by the event.  She said the noise was like that of machine, or a metallic noise, that was very loud, close to her window.  She said the noise took on a certain high and low pitch and it started humming for a duration of 5 minutes.   I asked if she got up or too look outside and said she did not.  I gathered from her statement that she might have been too scared to do so, so no craft or lights were witnessed if there were any.  We live in a small quiet neighborhood where six houses share a beautiful courtyard that is about 100 feet long by 30 feet wide.  The front of our house and bedroom windows face the courtyard.   My relative said the humming noise pulsated loud and said it sounded like it might have been hovering in the courtyard near our bedroom windows because she felt the pulsating vibrations through her window.  We live south of Paine Field and are used to (and recognize) all the airport and flight noise and activities, but she said it was nothing of the sort and this humming sound was unusual and too close.  She asked if I heard it and told her that I had not.   I went to bed at 10:30 p.m. that night and woke up around midnight, but did not hear anything.  My relative said that after 5 minutes of the noise, the sound abruptly stopped and everything was silent.   I did confess to her that as of the last few years, especially during the summer months, when I have my window open, that I have awoken to strange computer-like ""beeping noises"" in the early pre-dawn hours that I could never understand what or where they come from.  Perhaps, these incidents are related, but not sure.   My relative is confident that something was causing or giving off this sound and that it may have been from an unidentified craft hovering in the courtyard.   Since then, we both have been monitoring all nighttime activity for any strange incidents. We would like to remain anonymous.

Last night at around 8:40 PM my wife and I went out back to get some fresh air and look at the stars.  We live in an area of Florida that has little light pollution compared with some of the larger cities in the state.  As we looked up we began to discuss the object we’d seen a couple of nights before when to our surprise we began to see something similar coming toward us.  This object was similar to the first in that it was as bright as the brightest stars we could see and it had no flashing lights at all. I grabbed a pair of small Bushnell binoculars that I keep outside for spotting aircraft and quickly picked up the moving object.  This time it was heading in a trajectory that would take it directly overhead so my wife and I watched in amazement as this silent speeding object glided far overhead.  I’m a bad judge of altitude however I got the sense that it wasn’t something that was in orbit rather it was flying perhaps at several thousand feet??  As I mentioned before it was completely silent and kept a steady path.  It took it perhaps twenty to thirty seconds to traverse the sky and maintained the same level of brightness the entire time we observed it. This time it did not fade out as it did the night we saw it last. We watched it until it was beyond our field of view.  It came directly over us whereas the night before we’d seen it at an angle.  I was not able to make out anything other than the bright white light it gave off.  No other visible details were picked up by myself or my wife. I’ll be outside again tonight hoping to see it again and this time I will have my video camera. Thanks for what you do!",2013-05-15T00:00:00,27.87365806451613,-81.51855806451613

The bright element’s apparent motion or change in relative sky position made it appear to be descending as the intensity of the brightness increased.  The color of light being emitted was initially brilliant yellow and was shifting to a yellow-orange.  Angle of elevation declining to 60 degrees. Time: 16-25 seconds.  As the color continued to become full orange and shifting to reddish-orange, the very bright element was slowly traversing the sky in what appeared to be a southerly direction.  Angle of elevation declined to 45 degrees. Time: 26-30 seconds. I took a few steps back along the patio, knocked of the glass door and motioned to my housemate to join me out back, and gestured toward the sky.  The element’s color was shifting to bright red by this time.  Angel of elevation declining to 35 degrees  Time: 31-40 seconds. The bright element maintained a bright red, retained a vertical angular elevation of approximately 30 degrees. Time: 41-50 seconds. The two of us then watch the bright element hang in the sky, potentially moving further away south from us, as the color shifted from bright red to brilliant but darker cherry red, though it was fading in intensity. Time: 51-60 seconds.  The two of us watched to element fade to nothing as the apparent sky location/direct progressed further south. All the movements of the element appeared to be slow, never jerking inconsistent or rapidly changing. There were no audio abnormalities or sounds that would be consistent with an airplane, helicopter or other known aerial object. Several mornings previously, before dawn, I had observed a meteor or fireball traverse the sky to my southeast, in a west to east direction, with a total duration of 2-3 seconds. The element that is the subject of this report, had no commonalities with a meteor or fireball.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,42.46357701863354,-123.37069254658387

I went out immediately, and noticed a light, bigger than the Palm Springs tram light in the sky above the mountain ridge. It was positioned a little to the right and up above the tram light (about an inch to the left and 2 inches up above in a visual sense). The light was big and pulsating all different kinds of colors (red, orange, yellow, blue, green, purple, and which) – simply beautiful. I quickly went inside to get the camera, but realized that the batteries were dead. I went out the back with my daughter and also told my wife to come and look at it outside. She’s not that surprised in UFO’s, but casually walked outside and looked up to see the same thing.  This multi-color flashing object was there for about 10 minutes in the sky before slowing descending down below the mountain ridge. It did not reappear. My daughter and I have seen things like this here in the night sky before. I have always believed in UFO’s and have seen a few instances in the past.  I am always looking for them, but for some reason, never really ever see any, at least out here.  I have also talked to others around the area out here that have seen other similar events, but never reported them or talked about them to anybody else. I didn’t know about this site before, and have been very apprehensive about doing a report.  I just usually don’t do reports like these since I consider these events normal, and read others reports all the time.  However, I do feel better about posting this sighting.

It happened on Friday the 13th of 2013 in Left Hand Canyon the night after the 500 year flood began.  I was stranded up in the Canyon for 7 days, and saw activity each night.  The activity on the night of Friday the 13th shook my belief system to the core. Stranded up the canyon with a good friend we laid on her rooftop and watched the sky. Immediately the moon began to flicker and strange clouds poured out over the canyon.  Crafts were instantly everywhere, the entire sky full of different ships, moving at different speeds and different altitudes, all were silent.  Many familiar looking ships common to UFO sightings I had previously viewed online.  Many crafts unlike anything I have ever heard of or seen.  Foreign colors and movement that didn’t have a reasonable pathology to them as far as my human brain could tell.  They appeared to be in constant flux, shifting shape and color and teleporting short distances through the sky. When I pointed the first one out, my friend told me to stay calm and that they will land.  She had seen them almost every night for over a year now, and hadn’t confided in me fearing I would think she was crazy.  Moments later they landed, not the crafts but it appeared they were being flashed down.  The sky would light up like heat lighting, even though the clouds had now vanished, and glowing orbs were on the ground 20-30 feet away.  You could feel them and hear them “whistle”.  They were playful and would whistle back and forth with us.  They also seemed to have a telepathic ability.  I couldn’t hear it the first night but my friend had to go inside, as the sounds were too much and gave her a headache.  She described it as a mechanical bird chirp that never stopped.  I heard this sound the next night. This went on for hours.  Crafts in the sky would respond to my whistle and humming. Some would stay focused on us for 30 minutes or so before moving on.  The entire time, crafts flew in and out of what I can only explain as a void, much higher in the sky.  The ships up high would not react with us and seemed to all be coming and going through what I have to believe is some kind of wormhole.  I watched them on the ground and in the sky for 4+ hours until exhausted I fell asleep. The next day I awoke with a headache, that didn’t last more than an hour.  I spent the next couple days and nights scouting the forest for prints, which I found, however not in the area of the glowing orbs.  I believe many extraterrestrials from many different galaxies were present in this canyon. I have since been back and every time show more people, and spot 10-20 crafts over several hours.  This is a UFO hot spot. Some of my peers have had very negative encounters and won’t return to see them again, fearing a hostile presence.  He described the same mechanical whistle sound but said it had a harpooning effect on him, and he saw 3 physical beings, not like the glowing playful orbs, but dark and in the shadows. The lights at my house flicker for days when I return to the city. I have dreams often, but haven’t noticed anything else strange.  I continue to look for information and want to contact them very badly, it’s become and obsession.",2013-11-20T00:00:00,40.024403601895735,-105.26873952606635

It was mostly dark outside so the only thing I could really see in the window was the reflection of back inside our house living room and couple orange street lights from outside way up on a hill that is kind of far about a block/block and half  that blended in faintly with the inside of our room.  As I was watching tv somthing out the corner of my eye caught my attention and neglected to look than i finally did look and it was the street light in the distance looked almost like there were maybe some leafs or branches blowing in the wind so it was obstructing the path from my eyes to the light.  As I stared at It for a few minutes I realized that It was slowly moving and indeed not somthing blowing in front of it. 	I grabbed my cell phone and I went to the sliding door to the deck in backyard which is to the right of our tv and the backyard faces west.  What I thought was the street light was a small circle of light almost like a satellite looking object but way too low to be was coming straight my direction than without any type of warning or speed change in the object it just went south.  I have never seen somthing like that before.  The steady constant flow and direction change of an object was just unbelievable. 	Now this object is heading toward another Large circle of light that is to the south in one spot, whiteish in color , kind of flickering a orange or redish color, about ten times in size , and same height as the one coming towards it.  As this circle of light is moving towards the big steady one, the light is slowly fading the closer it gets.  It gets real close to the still non moving one and just stops and stays . 	Once that one had stopped next to the big one, out of nowhere to the left of both them and next to the bright one, another even bigger light appears and lights up really bright  for seconds and slowly dims but remains lit and non moving.  After a few seconds where it is no longer dimming and just staying lit, It now starts moving east across the sky and than after some distance goes south to where I could no longer see it. 	It was the most craziest thing I have seen or been able to record. I had told my friend a few days later and showed him the video and once he got home he had told me someone that night at the same time had also recorded somthing very very similar at a Minnesota twins baseball game right above the outdoor stadium and he had showed me the link to that on youtube. 	The other two had stayed stopped and remained in that spot for awhile than slowly went south west and under/behind the tree line!!   I have alot of videos and pictures!!

It was a hazy rainy early afternoon and we were cruising through Qutang Gorge towards Chongqing. I was aiming my compact Lumix Panasonic camera on the red structure perched on the mountain side and decided to take some shots. Unknowingly, I captured an UFO by accident.  I was not aware of it until when I sort out my digital shots much later after returning home. On close examination, I believed that it is an UFO of an enormous size as compared to the red structure and the two peaks in terms of scale. It cannot be a sun flare or lens reflection as the background  mountains were misty and the shot was taken on an open ship deck. It cannot be a speck of dirt too as the circular craft looks lighted in yellow and huge in size.  There were no people present on the ship deck as it was raining. What sort of object is it remains a mystery. I am looking for a plausible explanation . More details:  The shot was taken with a 24mm leica lens 3.8x zoom compact camera from the open ship deck. The area where the UFO appeared was a secluded  and an isolated region near the Qutang Gorge with no people found along the river bank. There is no possibility of other planes found in the area as it is a moutainous region and risky to manoeuvre at low attitude.  It was also a hazy rainy afternoon. The enormous object seem to be moving a very high speed as the next few photos  taken within second, were without the object.",2013-11-20T00:00:00,,

While we were unsuccessful in seeing meteors, we did spot a few satellites and were, therefore, tuned to objects orbiting the Earth.  I noticed what appeared to be a satellite traveling south to north.  There were no visible flashing lights on the object and it was slightly reddish-orange in color which may have been a reflection of the sun because the other satellites showed a similar hue.  I pointed it out to my family and then it started to travel in an odd manner.  It first took a turn east-northeast and started moving in a zig-zag pattern in relation to the stars.  It then turned south and traveled for some distance before turning once again toward the west.  It then stopped and turned back toward the east-northeast and kept traveling in that direction until we stopped looking at it.  The entire incident last! ed about three minutes.

Many people in this small rural community have expressed suspicion this summer regarding possible ""testing"" in the area, with regards to the water north of Dungeness, Jamestown, and Port Williams.  There are also many questions and no answers regarding a ""private"" project on Lost Mountain. Around 19:30, I arrived at my good friend's house located in between St. Luke's Episcopal Church and Walmart, on the west side of Sequim, and started a conversation in the driveway.   After 10 minutes passed, my friend mentioned that he had seen another (suspected) ""drone"" this afternoon.  We discussed, in layman's terms, the unusual characteristics of these ""drone"" craft in regards to their appearance.  My lifestyle is that of a hermit, and yet this was the third person in the past week who has commented to me regarding these ""drones"" they have been noticing. Around 19:45, my friend noticed a bright white light on the horizon.  It seemed to be moving very slightly but not enough to be certain.  I suggested that it could be a brightly lit residence on Lost Mountain, or bright headlights on Lost Mountain, based on the direction and the distance away.  My friend countered that the houses on Bell Hill, which would be comparable in light output and in visibility, were barely visible at all despite being much closer to us.  I commented that the light appeared to have a lamp post underneath it which was definitely black in color.  My friend did not see anything resembling a post beneath the light.  I consistently did, however, and after adjusting my vantage point, I observed that the ""lamp post"" seemed to fade from black to invisible at a distance beneath the light approximately 3x the height of the white spot in the sky.   I looked away for several seconds and consistently saw a sharply defined, straight, narrow, black vertical post or beam of some sort underneath the bright white spot, apparently attached to the base of the white spot.  The sky was partly cloudy with a mild northwestward breeze. We wandered elsewhere and the topic changed for a few minutes. When we returned to the driveway vantage point, a few minutes later, at the onset of dusk, my friend noticed that the bright light initially seemed to be gone, noticing a few seconds later that it seemed to have moved to a slightly lower elevation.   I also noticed that it was not as bright as it seemed to have been before, perhaps contrasting its surroundings the same amount as it had been previously (As compared to most lights which increasingly contrast their surroundings as the sky turns dark and the lights ""take effect"")  The brightness of the light seemed to be in relation to the sky around it, perhaps as a means of conserving onboard energy while maintaining consistent visibility during a test run.  This is purely my own hindsight speculation. My friend mentioned his need to visit the grocery store before it closes and reminded me of my own need to do the same, and for a minute or two we thought nothing of the white spot in the distance and focused elsewhere. As I turned and began walking toward my car, my friend shouted ""Look at that, up there!"" pointing at first straight above us and following an aircraft headed northeast.  If directly above us were referred to as ""12:00"" using the position of the hour hand on a clock as an indication of its position, I saw what he was pointing at when it was between 1:00 and 2:00 position.  The object was a bright yellowish white light at an altitude comparable to where one might see an ultralight or possibly a hang glider, and it moved more rapidly than any aircraft I recall seeing before.  There was no flashing light on board as you would see on other aircraft; just a bright, yellowish white light moving rapidly across the sky in an almost perfectly straight line, headed northeast (slightly east by northeast).  I noticed a very slight sway side to side as it sped away.  Our vantage point was unique as we can presume that it passed straight over us, from Lost Mountain area. The light was a different hue, though, than the one we had seen shortly before, and I do not think either of us initially realized that the two lights could be related, despite the fact that the craft went in a straight line away from the area we had been observing initially. After maybe 10 seconds of rapid flight straight away from us, we noticed that it seemed to suddenly slow down to an abrupt near-halt, as a red light onboard began to flash brightly, 500ms on, 500ms off, on off on off for about 2 minutes as it slowly got further away and seemed to be slowly descending, before disappearing as the lights seemed to shut off or be lost in the clouds.  It was extremely quiet, given its apparent altitude and velocity, although we both noticed a faint jet-like rumble briefly after it was already a few seconds away from us. The first few calls that I placed to the hotline were mysteriously disconnected within the first few seconds; this is not a problem I often have to deal with.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,48.0656,-123.0613

They were defiantly two different things, but flying very close to each other. It was like something I have never seen before, and my boyfriend too.  There was no white, green or red light like typical aircraft.    As it got faster and closer one flickered and just disappeared and the next orb followed suit within 3-4 seconds and that was it.  No more lights or no more remnants of such an object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Again tonite while outside with my 28 yr old son we were looking up at the sky, prompted by a bright white sphere that was traveling very slowly.  At first it was going so slow we had to decide if it was possibly a stationary object. Upon making that statement to my son the sphere stated to move again, it was moving much faster and as we followed it with our eyes it got smaller and smaller and then just flashed out. It accelerated so quickly it just looked like it was getting smaller until there was nothing to see. This object has been seen 3 times and this is my third time reporting it. There is no doubt about one fact, it was not a plane, nor was it a helicopter. We live very close to an Air Force base and can recognize most Airial objects for what they are. This was a totally silent sighting as were the other two sightings I reported to you with attached photos. Something is going on in the skies above Cape Cod.

There are always planes flying around that time of night and they are easily spotted, as they always have flashing or pulsating lights.   The Moon was in the East.   I had my Binoculars out that have a tinting on the lenses, this helps when looking at a very bright object such as the Moon, you can see far more detail.  It was around 21:10 we decided to pack up the camera, put the binoculars and tripod in the car - I usually look towards the South West to see if I can see Arcturus which I have taken a few photos of recently.   We looked up and from the West was this very strong light/orb shaped it was traveling at a steady pace but would every now and then slow down.   Having my binoculars with me I took a good look at the object, it was no plane, it was literally just a light - the light was heading in the direction! of the Moon to the East, I followed the light to see where it was heading.  As it reached closer to the area of sky the Moon was in the light faded and then just vanished.   My husband did take a photo of the light but you can't really get much from the photo other than it is a light in the sky.  Judging the distance it was pretty low and was in no way a Satellite (I believe ISS was supposed to be visible also that night) however it was not the right time or direction.  I estimate that it was the same height as a plane would be.  There was no sound to it.  The light stayed constant until dimming when it reached the area of sky the Moon was in.  I did also take the opportunity to view a plane that was going over in the same area of sky and could clearly see the shape of the plane.

As we watched closer, we noticed that unlike helium balloons, these objects were not gaining altitude.  They appeared to be hovering and slightly moving southward in the sky.  I would estimate that there were at least 50 small silver spherical objects. 	As we stared at them, they faded in and out as if the sun was reflecting off and on.  The sky was clear, so there was no obvious reason for this discrepancy in reflection.  As they faded in and out, they seemed to make new formations.  To me, the fading in and out was like a star that you can only see through peripheral vision, but not when looking straight at it.  This incident occurred for 10 or 15 minutes.

On the evening of Saturday, October 12 2013, I was coming out of IKEA in West Chester, Ohio, with my fiancé when we noticed something strange in the sky.  It was approximately 9 pm, the store was closing and we were walking to the car.  I noticed a yellowish light in the sky that was brighter and bigger then any star or plane lights that I have ever seen.  I pointed to it immediately and ask my fiancé if he saw it and if it was moving.  We stopped walking so we could be sure, and it was definitely moving. It was strangely shaped, kind of a longer shape, positioned vertically.  It was at about a 40-degree angle in the sky to the north, but it was rising slowly and moving around, kind of back and forth.  As we were watching it, it split into 4 different equally sized lights; it seemed to me that three of them were flying erratically around the fourth.  They didn’t move far away from each other.  It seemed like it lasted about 10-15 seconds before the lights all came back together as one and then blinked out. Seeing as how we had never seen anything like this before, we were in shock and didn’t take our eyes from the sky.  It’s a good thing we didn’t because what seemed like maybe 10 seconds later it reappeared again, a single light, just about in what seemed to be the same place and size as before.  As we watched it this time it split into 3 lights and they flew around each other again.  But this time it didn’t seem that there was one in the center that they all flew around, but again, they didn’t get far from each other.  It didn’t seem to last as long as the first time they split apart.  Like the first time, they merged back into one, hovered for a moment and then kind of blinked out. We watched for a few minutes, and then decided to drive away from the parking lot lights towards it to try and see it again, but no luck.  Also we tried to get video with my phones camera, but unfortunately the parking lot lights in IKEA were too bright, and you couldn’t even see it on my phone at all.",2013-10-23T00:00:00,39.33755163934426,-84.40442295081967

I turned to see what she was looking at and saw a large object that appeared to be on fire.  It was difficult to tell how high up it was, or how large it might have been, but it was about half the size of the moon at that point.   It moved very slowly and purposely, as if on some kind of course.  I couldn’t make out any vehicle, which would have been illuminated by the moon.   The fire appeared to be in the shape of a ball.  All we could see were orange and yellow flames, as if a large candle was flickering.  It couldn’t have been a hot air balloon or Chinese lantern, since the entire object was in flames.   It didn’t move along with any wind current, but instead moved in the pattern that a plane would move.  Then I thought maybe a plane was on fire, but we still couldn’t make out any specific shape under the flames.   It was totally silent – no sound of an engine of any kind.

Three objects moved across the eastern san diego sky right at the cloud line in very mild San Diego thunderstorm conditions.    At first the group of three moved in unison circling around in the clouds almost looking as if it was a very very low flying plane with one white light on the nose, and one on each wing.   I have seen large low flying planes circling exactly in the same manner at the Miramar air show and there is a considerable amount of noise when this happens.  These objects made no sound at all and after circling around several times within the clouds came out of the clouds and set still for a moment.   They then dramatically split/jumped into different directions in a manner impossible with airfoil lifted craft.  One headed north, the other went to the south. After 5 minutes they were gone, then we spotted them in unison again 3minutes later, now flying much closer to the horizon at a high rate of speed about the same as a fighter jet with the throttle pumping, along with the very loud noise that a fighter jet makes.  These objects again had no sound.  After another minute they were gone. I was trying to catch video of the three together but by accident only took a still shot and two of them are very clear in the picture.  It seemed that they were responsive to my actions because everytime I tried to get video they split up into singles or were out view which doesn't look nearly as compelling. 4 hours our area experienced a power outage affecting over 1200 homes in my area.

This light rose in the air about 200 yards in front of me and a friend while we were parked in my car facing NORTHWEST.  This was around 5:40 EST.  In a populated area with intersections, restaurants and bargain centers.  The sun had gone down but it wasn’t totally dark yet.  The object seemed to have structure but the light was all that could be seen. When it first caught our attention it was rising from at least 50ft from the ground.  As it rose slowly it seemed to come closer to us but mainly going straight up.  It elevated around 500-600 ft then it stops suddenly and at that point we both were puzzled because this wasn’t normal flight maneuvers for anything I’ve seen in the sky and this was so close.  There were no sounds coming from it.  Now that it’s closer it appeared to me there were actually two red lights instead of one but both were bright and bled into each other.  They were side by side but seemed to both be on one object.  I couldn’t make it out clearly, but it looked like above the lights there was structure. The object at that point seemed to slowly spin 180 degrees now showing white lights.  Then it moved to the left and right at different speeds stopping on a dime.  Very controlled and deliberate, as if showing off.  Not very fast, but too fast to start and stop, changing directions as it did.  Then, it shown red again and went away from us, we both got out of the car to get a better view and it lowered behind some trees maybe a quarter of a mile away.  I could see the red light looked to have landed in a clearing and out of view.  I kept looking and 45 seconds later it appeared again rising from the area it had lowered to.  It came back to the same area it was before in front of us.  It performed similar maneuvers again and moved very fast, up and down left and right.  Then it went away behind the trees again once more. I never saw it after that. The size is hard to estimate, maybe the size of a compact car.  The shape seemed saucer like but was not flat.

There just seemed to be something odd about them though.  There was no red and they weren’t blinking at all.  Just two bright white, almost blue lights.

As I got to where they were almost to my side up in the sky, I slowed the vehicle way down almost to a stop and looked for the tower itself.  Realizing it was way too dark to see a tower at night, I focused back up on the lights again. Now there were three lights, all the same, in a triangular pattern. I am now at a complete stop in the middle of the road intrigued by these lights.  I decide to pull up off the road and am trying to do so without taking my eyes of the lights but have to look away to pull over.

I continued to watch and about thirty seconds or so later, I observed another brief flash once again and whatever it was had moved slightly in a horizontal manner.   In all, there were four small irregular flashes from the star-like object over several minutes, and then no more. The event happened a short way below the Big Dipper, and the object appeared to be travelling northwest to southeast.   There was no noise.  The light seemed brighter than the ones on the planes that flew by in the same spot about five minutes later, and I could also clearly hear their engine noises.  I also observed three small meteors and a dim sattelite flying over later, so I had just about every familiar airborne object to compare it to.   Conditions were a warm Spring evening with slightly high level haze and virtually no wind after sunset.    Mercey Hot Springs is located approximately 34 miles from the nearest town so there is no artificial light to interfere with sky watching, and the moon didn't rise until about four hours later.

The first thing that came to mind was a plane, but it didn’t feel right because I didn’t see the red and green lights, no strobe at the time, and the “headlights” were an odd gold, orange, yellowish color, I pulled my phone out of my pocket to record what I believed to be an UFO sighting. In the video, (viewer discretion advised), I tried to explain what I was seeing but it was the most unexplainable thing I’ve ever seen.  When it came closer it moved in a direct straight path, maybe a mile or two over my head.  As it came across the sky it turns a white strobe light on and it seemed like it was trying to mimic a plane and it looked very similar to an F-86 Fighter Jet (Google).  It had curved wings and colorful, yet unexplainable lights that squared across the inside of the wing-span, the object was extremely loud and there were no other planes or helicopters around.  As it flew away it started to look more and more like a plane but the headlights were red. Later the same night after the incident I witnessed I looked up to the sky to see if I could see anything else, being in awe.  I had seen a white flickering light that appeared to be a star, until my uncle and I see it make some circular motions and seen red flickers (3-5) around the “star”.  Then I had seen another gold, orange, yellowish light without a strobe coming from the south heading north, the lights kind of shifted and it flew away heading east. What I had seen on 4-29-13 was unexplainable beyond belief, what my story tells may not be believable to some. Seeing is believing, I believe in what I saw.

That's twice now within 5 months! Observed~ One clearly red fiery orb was hovering mid-altitude for several minutes over Overland Park, KS... Once again.  ~Same location (I-35 & 435), and within an hour of the last sighting that I also posted on NUFORC (& they posted on MUFON) on 6/7/13 @ 21:30.  Last time was a cluster of ~10 red orbs, but this one on 11/9/13 was alone, smaller and hovering, not cruising.  It also dissipated after observing it...  And once again, I saw it while driving south on I-35 just past 435 and to the east (towards Olathe).  And once again, when I first saw it I kept it in sight to quickly/easily weed-out all the other green/red/white flashing lighted, winged, propped, petrol-powered noisemakers (not Element 115 propulsion system).  When this became abundantly obvious, I again pulled my car over on the shoulder of the highway with the window down for the duration... Fascinated, and thankful it happened again for me.  It once again had no other running lights (port/star! board/taillight)... It seemed to be pulsating (flame-like), too, before vanishing into thin air.  Any other known identified flying objects in our airspace would continue to be visible with their clearly seen lights... Illuminating for good reason.  We save our cloaking devices for when it's truly needed... Not crowded airspace.  ;-}  I almost didn't post this sighting... Merely because I didn't want anyone to think I was just seeing things repeatedly.  In fact, after the last sighting, one of my close credible friends suggested I carry a camera and watch the skies... Just in case.  I told him I've always watched the skies, but I'll never carry a camera just for that... Not obsessed with it, yet.  And, that I figured it was just a one-in-a-lifetime event.   He reminded me that they periodically frequent the same locations... I agreed.  That's two within the same year...  And it's only November.

The whole thing didn’t last more than 1 minute as a building on my way obstructed the sight.  I expected for the object to pass the building, as an aircraft should, but it just didn’t happen or it may have changed direction staying on a North bound course where this building didn’t let me see any more of it.  I came inside the house wondering and commented the sighting with family members. As I kept wondering, not over five minutes later I went outside again and started staring at the same point I saw this for the first time, the I turned myself slightly to my right and saw about four or five objects of similar characteristics as the one described above travelling in a sort of formation from SE to NW direction, 2 above and 2 to 3 others below.  Only this time the sighting took almost 4 to 5 minutes to reach the same building and again by the time they reached the building, they just didn’t pass it and the objects disappeared. I stayed at the same spot for over 30 minutes looking to see if any of these objects appeared, but they didn’t.  On the mean time I got to see two jet aircraft (both seemed an airbus 320 or boeing 737) flying on approach to Lima’s International airport, a low altitude flying police helicopter and a balloon that may have been lost by a kid.  This provided me the altitude, speed, and flying pattern perspective of this type of flying devices and what I saw differed totally. I’m 41 years old with an engineering background, have participated in sale and installation of  Navaids systems for civil aviation such as a complete Northrop Grumman ASR 12 primary and secondary radar system, ILS, VOR, DME’s, etc.  I have travelled abroad and attended airshows all over, had the opportunity to see acrobatic formations made by such prestigious teams as the Blue Angels, and familiarized with almost all of the civil aircraft currently in service from small Cessnas to A380 which I recently saw approach in Miami, and this is something that really differed from any other thing sawn before in my life.",2013-11-20T00:00:00,,

There were at least 50 people in our group of people (in the area we were at) who were witness to what we say. During the fireworks show people started talking and pointing.  My father told me where to look and I saw a round shaped flying saucer.  It was quite high in altitude.  The total time we watched it was probably about fifteen minutes. We know it was not a shooting star, plane, helicopter, etc., the object moved quickly across the sky and stopped instantly (super-fast speed to a full stop), it hovered for some time and then started moving again, it made a 90 degree turn in mid-flight without losing any speed and continued its flight.  Then it stopped again and after a short time it just “warped out” (?)  I don’t know how to explain it any better; it just instantly zipped off into outer space. The object was circular/round in shape, it was white/light blue (probably very light blue), it had no blinking lights (no lights like a plane might have, etc.), it was quite high, but I cannot estimate the height because I have no clue how large it was (it could have been a smaller ship closer to us or a massive ship further away). The speed and the instant stop, instant warping away and turning 90 degrees instantly in mid-flight really let everyone know it wasn’t anything our civilization was capable of doing (this was almost 40 years ago, and we still don’t have the ability to make a turn like that). The crowd of people was quite large, and a lot of people saw it, but I remember my father telling me to not talk about it after it happened.  He clearly told me to never forget it because I would likely never see anything like it again, but was told to not tell people we saw it (probably a fear of being ridiculed?). I am not sure if it was reported in the paper or if police reports might still be available from that far back, but I have no doubt we saw a ship that was not from our Earth.

I don't remember the exact date or even the year.  I know it was in the 90s and I was In Junior high school.   I was in my yard about to cross the street to go to a neighbors house when I saw a bright reddish sphere with an orange tint.  It was floating over my friends house and completely still.  It did not seem far away and did not make a sound.   I stopped dead in my tracks staring at it trying to figure out what it was.  I was in shock.  Before I had the chance to do anything else it took off to the left in a perfect line so fast and disappeared.   It was the weirdest thing I've seen in my life.  It wasn't a weather balloon or any other thing like that.  It was different.   I never told anyone because I did not want to be made fun of.  Recently I told my husband and he thinks I'm nuts.   But after reading other peoples descriptions of what they saw it sounds like I am not the only one. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I am unsure of the exact date but we took the trip around the time of my birthday (8-31-64) annually. We were lodging at the Anchorage Marina hotel.   One night we walked to an area between the hotel and the Coast Guard station and sat near the water.  There we saw several bright white lights in a curved line shape.  The lights looked to be very close to us.  Some of the lights ""faded"" out, and then re-appeared.  The lights remained in the same geometrical formation during the time that we looked at them.   We heard no sound although the wind blows heavily on the island.   The lights were stationary while we watched them.  They appeared to be connected although we were unable to make out an object.   There is very little light pollution on the island so the lights were very bright and clear.   At first we were intrigued by what we were looking at but we began to feel uncomfortable and walked back to the hotel after 3-4 minutes. Later that year we saw a TV show about the lights over Phoenix.  The video shown on the TV show looked identical to the lights that my wife and I saw that night on Ocracoke Island. I recently watched a TV show called “I Know What I Saw”. The program begins with the Phoenix lights.  This prompted me to report our sighting.   I thought it might be interesting to researchers that my wife and I saw the same lights while in Ocracoke, NC around the same time that people in the Phoenix area witnessed them. I doubt this makes any difference but I’ll provide my wife and my backgrounds.  We lived in Raleigh, NC at the time of our sighting.  I was and remain a building contractor although we have relocated.  My wife was a stay at home mother of two children. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

A friend, and myself were laying on a trampoline looking up at the stars.  It was a silent night with only the occasional sound of traffic coming from downtown roughly 2 miles away from our location.   As we were watching the stars we both noticed that theones to our left seemed to be dissapearing.  About a minute after we first noticed the object, it was almost directly overhead moving slowly in a North Eastern, to South Western direction.  It did not appear to emit any light, and no audible noise could be heard, although we did both feel almost like we were near speakers playing emiting a low, but constant frequency.  We could also feel that the springs surrounding the trampoline were vibrating.  It was impossible to measure the size of the object, because it was impossible to tell how far away it was, however by the way it blocked out the stars it was obviously a triangular shaped object.  It appeared to be extremely large maybe over a mile from point to point, bu! t could have been much smaller depending on how close it was. It passed at a steady pace from the moment we saw it until it was no longer in site.  I didn't think much of it until a few days later other people around the area were talking about something similar, but they had seen it during broad daylight.  According to one person who told me about it, things in his house were shaking as if there was a.  Small earthquake happening.  The other rumors were fairly consistent with what my friend and I had observed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",2013-07-14T00:00:00,42.92,-108.0467

My wife, child and I from viewed this from inside our vehicle with the lights positioned directly ahead above the treeline. There were no other colors besides the white lights.  All lights  blinked in unison with a rough spacing of about a second.  Lights appeared to be in perfect horizontal line and were equidistant from each other.  Altitude believed to be approximately 1000-2000’ but that was approximating if it were a plane with lights, which is extremely unlikely.  Radio in vehicle was on and did not hear any airplane/helicopter sounds.  No background shape seen (if one even existed) as the lights were too bright. Lights were bright similar to that of looking at a search beam.  An attempt at following was not successful mainly due to many trees though headed west for about 5-10 minutes hoping to get a glimpse of it. Contacted local sheriff’s department around 2100 EST and was told no other reports of the lights or planes known that were in distress.  Though this occurred seemingly above our neighborhood unfortunately, no one else seemed to see this event.  Posted to our community forum and another local forum and no one else saw anything.  No pictures taken unfortunately as I did not think quickly enough.  Checked online and there were a couple shots people have taken.  The light configuration is similar to this video http://www.ufocasebook.com/2011/videotassiesky.html but the lights that we saw blinked in unison and were very bright white.

While pursuing my hobby of astronomy, I was observing westward to see Venus and Saturn shortly after sunset. At this time of year, there is also a bright star in the vicinity called Arcturus.  As I turned my gaze to this star I was amazed to see what appeared to be another bright star sitting next to Arcturus, of approximately the same size and brightness. After several seconds, I realized this star was not a star at all as it suddenly started to move. It descended in a directly vertical direction and appeared to be thousands of feet above the ground.  My next thought was that it was a high altitude flare, which I have seen before, but the brightness of the object did not change or fade away like flares do.  This also does not explain why it was completely stationary in the sky before it began to ""fall"".  I also considered that it might be a meteor, but the object was moving too slowly, perpendicular to the horizon line, and did not change in brightness, or break apart like a meteor.  As the object continued to descend, I walked over to a pick-up truck and stood in the truck bed so that a nearby fence would not obscure my view.  I lost sight of the object behind the Oquirrh Mountain Range, where it almost certainly would have made contact with the ground a few seconds later (assuming it continued in its trajectory).  I am not saying it was any kind of extraterrestrial craft, but it was definitely strange and worthy of me reporting this event.

Brooklyn--8/21/13--Moving bright light vanishes.,New York,NY,2013-08-21T21:40:00,light,10-15 seconds,"Occurred : 8/21/2013 21:40  (Entered as : 08/21/13 21:40) Reported: 8/24/2013 8:13:26 PM 20:13 Posted: 8/30/2013 Location: New York City (Brooklyn), NY Shape: Light Duration:10-15 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101523.html,"Brooklyn--8/21/13--Moving bright light vanishes. On Wednesday 8/21/13, I saw a moving light in the sky over Windsor Terrace Brooklyn.  Details follow. At approximately 9:30pm, I decided to go for a walk and look at the large bright moon.  I ended up standing in the center of a large blacktop area; the playground just northwest of East 5th Street and Ocean Parkway/Fort Hamilton Parkway (which borders the Prospect Expressway, situated east of the playground and near the Fort Hamilton Parkway subway stop).  I chose this spot partly because the light pollution is a bit lower than in other parts of the neighborhood. From this vantage point, there is a 360 degree panoramic view of a large portion of sky/partially blocked by trees to the west and structures near the ground.  The sky was clear and winds were low, perhaps with some slight breeze.  For a few moments I observed the moon, which was southeast of my position.  I also turned to view other stars (the relative few that can be seen in Brooklyn), including Vega which appears to be visible at night (and was essentially directly overhead according to a sky map application I was using to assist me). Looking slightly northwest towards Greenwood Cemetery, and the house I live in, I noticed a white light (no beam) moving in a curved trajectory southeastward towards my direction.  If the estimated lateral distance from my position to the object (0.4 miles) is accurate, the light itself could have been between 2 – 4 feet in size. The incident took place for about 10 - 15 seconds sometime between 9:40 and 9:43pm.  This time includes the object’s approach (about 5 – 6 seconds) and several seconds of attempting to follow it with my eyes as it dimmed and disappeared (when near to my position). Its altitude seemed to vary slightly.  Though it is difficult to determine an exact average altitude, it was similar to or slightly below nearby commercial airline traffic (typically approaching JFK or LaGuardia Airports), approximately 1,500 – 2,000 feet.  This ruled out the possibility of a very large satellite (though on 8/24, at 9:49pm when revisiting I noticed a high plane or potential satellite, that appeared far, far higher and more dim, traveling northward east of the same position where I was standing).  Given the brightness and size of the light, it did not appear to be a small plane that was situated farther away than one may presume (lateral distance or altitude). This white light varied in brightness and was not accompanied by any blinking FAA or navigation lights.  There was no sound (unlike the helicopters and planes which could be heard in the area at different moments before and after the sighting).  The curved trajectory of the light changed my view from looking northwest to slightly southwest, then almost directly south.  When I attempted to view it through my camera phone, it did not seem to register, though lights from other planes or helicopters around the same time did register (so I attempted no pictures or video).  During the 8/24 revisit, I noticed that lights from planes, etc. do show up more readily on my digital camera.  As such, perhaps the 8/22 light in questions would have been visible had I had my camera (non-phone) with me. I expected to gain a view of FAA lighting or hear noise from an object, or at least see its shape as its path took it near or directly over Public School 130 (situated about 100 meters away from my vantage point, south of Ocean Parkway / Fort Hamilton Parkway and East 5th).  Instead the light increased in intensity, then simply faded out (with no visible clouds in the area to obscure it).  Again, because of the ambient light in the vicinity, the silhouetted shape and possibly some detail of any helicopter, quadcopter, drone, plane, blimp or other flying object would likely have become visible (as with other air traffic I observed around the same time and in nearby airspace from the same vantage point), even if its lights were turned off or away from my view.  However, to my astonishment, once the white light disappeared, no object could be seen in spite of my deliberate effort to follow it with my eyes.  The light appeared to be moving far too slowly, and for too long in a h! orizontal fashion, to be a meteorite.  Note that on the 8/24 revisit to the site, a meteorite / shooting star was observed at 9:46pm, traveling west on a trajectory that was slightly south of my vantage point (it seemed very different from what I saw on 8/22). Again, I estimate the visible length of distance travelled by the object to have been 0.4 miles (about 640 meters or 2,099 feet).  Therefore the speed over the 5 – 6 second approach is estimated at approximately 238 - 286mph. Based on the potential size of the light (2 – 4 feet) and potentially achievable altitude (1,500 – 2,000 feet), the most likely prosaic explanation I could determine was quadcopter.  However, I am not confident that the approximate speed of the observed light (238 – 286 mph), or estimated distance of flight (0.4 miles) are achievable for this type of product.  Note that I did not observe any object fall from the sky or crash, as might be expected if a quadcopter simply flew beyond its maximum lateral range.. Perhaps there is a prosaic explanation for this incident; however, I am not able to determine what it may be at this time.  Perhaps others can shed further insight. NOTE:  In an attempt to determine if others in the area may have witnessed similar phenomenon recently, I spoke with several individuals who live in or near the neighborhood.  One young man reported that on Wednesday 8/21 (same night as the sighting reported here), but at a later hour, he observed two lights in the same airspace (near the playground) move together and apart several times before departing in different/opposite directions!  Another young man reported recently seeing a beam of light near Caton Avenue in broad daylight.  While I cannot vouch for either of these accounts, I submit a summary of them to demonstrate that (a) it seems much easier than expected at this time to locate others nearby who feel they have seen something out of the ordinary and (b) there seems to be a number of incidents occurring over time (as I have observed lights /orbs in this neighborhood for years which cannot be easily explained).

According to my father, the ball had come from a southwesterly direction over a place where the mountain “dips,” for lack of a better word, and descended at an angle into the valley.  It stopped just as it reached the top of a utility pole that runs adjacent to the railroad lines that come from the coal mines and extend through our hollow.

There is a lane with houses on the other side of the tracks, and my mother stated that the ball was about the same size as the cars parked at the houses on the other side of the tracks.

In Toronto, Ontario Canada--On October 14th, at approximately 7:30pm, I was out walking my dogs.  Looking south towards Lake Ontario, I noticed approximately 8 very bright red orbs travelling in an upward motion.  I thought how weird. I have grown up around aircraft as my Cousin and my Uncle have been private pilots with their own planes.  Both of my cousins have worked for a huge airline for the past 18 and 35 years, respectively.  I knew planes don’t have red bright lights they have white lights, as I watch them all the time.  So as I walked south getting as much of a better view as possible, I tried to come up with a logical explanation.  I thought, could it be the Snowbird’s practicing at night with weird red lights?  The formation was so close together, with 2 stranglers coming up from the rear, I knew it was not average pilots.   Well, I know the Snowbird’s are out in Western Canada, so scratch that.  I then thought, maybe they are some type of Rescue Helicopters in training.   I am now running south, down the hill with my bulldog dragging me, I am going so fast all the while watching the Red Orb Formation.   I see a Gentleman out in front of a very exclusive Condo standing on the sidewalk staring at the Red Orbs.  I pull up beside the Man, and ask him if he thinks they are Rescue Helicopters.  The Man approximately 55 years old says, “So I am not crazy”?  I laughed and said no.  We watched together kind of dumb-founded.  All of a sudden a huge plane/jet with a white light (allowing us to see how big the jet was) flies so close and directly behind the Red Orbs, it completely blew us away.  I looked at the Gentleman, and we are clearly trying to process, so I say, “How insane was that Pilot”?  The Red lights remained on for a second or two more, and then in the snap of a finger ALL at the same time they were gone.  The Man starts yelling, ``Where are they?  Where did they go”?  We both discussed the fact that any aircraft is not allowed to turn there lights off, and even though it was dark out the lights from the City would have allowed us to see the outline of an aircraft.  There was NOTHING there.  In the blink of an eye they were gone.   I was then heartbroken as I did not video record it ! with my phone, and did not phone my son studying at home to look out t he window.  It was all too fast, too surreal, even though it probably lasted 15 to 20 minutes.   I ran home without even getting my neighbor`s name (we were not even thinking), with promises that we would run into each other soon. I called my cousin this morning, Oct. 15th, 2013.  It just so happened, that she was coming into Toronto International Airport heading up an Overseas Crew, at the same time I saw the red orbs.  She landed at approximately 7:30pm, on Oct. 14th, 2013.  There were Emergency Ground Crews all over the runways.  This is highly unusual.  She had not been notified that there was any landing emergency, nor an aircraft needing assistance on the ground.   She told me her flight would have been placed in a holding pattern or at the very least they would have been notified that there was a possible emergency.  She was not.  She has not noticed this in all her years of flying.   As soon as she can, she will be speaking to a pilot about this, and will be looking for the pilots she worked with after hearing my story.",2013-10-23T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

About a hour and a half ago we saw a triangler craft, gliding, floating (not really going anywhere) first it was orangey red, and had a dim flashing light (which to me indicated man made) although as it was going past the next ridge (approximantely 2 miles) it didnt have the orangish glow, it was more blueish, and very faint and not really all too noticable.  The craft seemed small, almost super advice fighter like, although it had the typical 3 angle lights, and was a triangle and was definitely in Zero gravity, and gliding very slow, the person who first saw it, said it was going up and down in a floating ( almost on sea ) look. although i myself didnt witness that. 	This is the second  ""ufo"" seen in our local sky in a week, about 5 days ago 10/9/2013 me and another person saw a Very bright organgish glow. it was amazing, it was low and threw the trees, and it seems miles away although there was no way to tell how far it really was... didnt see a craft or anything like that, but it was easily bigger then full moon and had the same type of brightness (even threw the tree), as a perspective of how low it was, the trees were about 100-150 feet away, and were only at tops 20-30 feet tall. so it was very low. 	I live in a very rural area, although were more isolated we very open minded out here, if any other people in town talk about the light or ufo sighting ill try to get them to report it here seperately, because I know how multiple reports matter, and i understand in a rural area like this its very hard to fact check.",2013-10-23T00:00:00,38.9194,-123.58139999999999

The thing I find puzzling about this object, is that there is so many lights in where I observe this object that it's the only visible thing in the sky besides the moon.  Also I have no equipment to get a good picture of it, yet the one time I use the google star map app and pointed the smart device I was using directly at it, the device said that there should be nothing there.  Only one time have I noticed something ""leaving"" and seem to disappear rather quickly after detaching from the object.

I knew it was not a star as the clear color rotation, of blue pink & white, were sequenced, not random. First thought, hm.. maybe the ISS,  which I have seen before, does not have pink lights.  I immediately went inside to obtain a pair of binoculars, and began to view this object.  This ‘object’ remained motionless – not moving – for at least 20 minutes. The colors rotated pink, blue, white (repeated) constantly every second.  Again not random sparkle, but mechanical repetitive.  I view aircraft in the sky often, being so close to Newark Int’l air.  The craft colors were definitely not standard. This ‘object’ was about 40,000 miles high and did not move.  It was in the Northern Sky.  Below, and nearby, is Newark Int’l airport.  I counted at least 3 planes taking off , ascending and heading in a Southwest direction.  This ‘star’ was above it and easy to hedge a height as the plane passed underneath.  I also thought, if I can see on the ground, the pilots would be able to see also as it was in their view during ascension. Through the binoculars, I watched for a good ten minutes.  While hard to see, the lights detailed a triangle craft.  Again the three color lights pulsated (one full cycle per second) were at each point.  It never moved.  By 22:50 I decided to return in side and compose this report.  My thoughts – no question a ‘vessel’, not a star.  Man/alien made, due to lights, not a star.  Not the ISS, as have seen before.   Did not move, no average craft can sustain position at great height.  Large.  Wondered what it was waiting for?

No illicit or prescription drugs.  No alcohol.  Non-smoker.  Married, 23 years.  One child. Excellent health. Wears contact lenses. Description of environment:  Flat, level farmland with orchards. Mostly stonefruit and nuts. Trees typically about 30 feet in height.  Few structures.  No streetlights, or other ambient lighting.  No buildings taller than the occasional two storey house.  No other vehicles on the road. Weather:  Clear, dry, no wind  Landmarks:  Historic Collegeville Cemetery dating to 1871  Airports:  Stockton Municipal Airport approximately 6 miles west of location of sighting  Military Installations:  Sharpe Depot, approximately 8 miles southwest of location of sighting   Traveling west on Mariposa Road between Escalon and Stockton, California I encounted three orange lights in the roadway east of Collegeville. I had just passed Van Allen Road, and from about 3/4 of a mile from Collegeville, I first saw the lights. I thought the lights were an illuminated road work sign warning of construction ahead, however as I approached,  I could see the lights were in the center of the road and not off to the side of the road.  Since the area is a rural, farming area,  I thought perhaps it was marker lights on farm equipment or a semi truck parked across the roadway. I began to slow down as I approached.  The posted speed limit is 55 MPH, and I had slowed to about 30 MPH trying to discern what was in the roadway. The lights were round and an intense orange color.  They were in a horizontal line, and equally spaced.  The center light appeared to be directly in the center of the roadway, while the outer two appeared to be at the edges of the roadway.  The very odd thing is that while the lights were very bright, they didn't seem to cast much illumination.  I didn't see any light being reflected off the roadway, the trees on the side of the road were little more than shadows darker than the night sky.  One would think with such intense light, some shadow or reflected light on surrounding objects would be visible. By this time, I had slowed to about 10 MPH and was maybe 300 feet from whatever it was I was seeing.  It's very difficult to gauge exactly where you are when it is that dark, surrounded by trees, and there aren't any real landmarks. The lights suddenly became muted. I don't know how to exactly describe it.  Maybe like a piece of frosted glass was placed in front of each light and the lights began to rise into the air. The lights cleared the tops of the trees, and appeared to start traveling southwest. I accelerated attempting to get close enough to see what it was.  All I could see was the lights. As I approached the cemetery, the lights began traveling north, crossed the road, and began to gain altitude.  As the lights gained altitude, they remained perfectly level. Then they just winked out.  Like someone turned off a switch. I can't say anything about sound due to the engine noise of the vehicle I was driving. That's all I can report.  It was very weird.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,,

As I looked at it, I saw another bright light shining through the trees, south of the first light and at a lower altitude.  At one point, the first light shot a small white fireball towards the second light (which I caught on video). After a few more minutes, I saw what appeared to be a plane approach the first light.  It looked like a strobing red light.  It passed over the first light, then turned in the opposite direction, began to blink a white light, then sunk below the first light out of my line of vision.   During this time, the first light was pretty consistent, just ! hovering and moving around ever so slightly. I noticed at least one more white light (COULD have been the second light I saw through the trees but I don't really think so) hovering around the area, clearly moving, but not much.  At certain points, it seemed like the white lights in the sky had one other smaller and fainter light blinking next to it, within close proximity. In addition to all of this, between 10:30-11pm a very low flying aircraft flew over my house about 7 times; on average about 1 every 3-5 minutes. Did not appear to be a commercial airliner, its wingtips were not lit up at all; just had 3 or 4 lights appearing down the belly of the craft in a vertical line.

Behind and to the port side of the larger craft was a very small black oval shaped craft, not much larger than the vertical stabilizer of the larger craft, that was keeping pace with it.  After the craft both had crossed the body of water, the larger craft increased in altitude and continued directly toward Mount Rainier.  The smaller craft suddenly changed direction and began heading East.  When the smaller craft changed heading, its profile never changed, it never exhibited any sound, or had any visible change of speed, only a visible change in direction.  The reason why the larger military-looking aircraft was suspicious as well is not only due to the fact that it was accompanied by the smaller unidentified craft, but that nobody in our group could identify what the larger craft actually was even though two of us currently work in aerospace.  We did agree that it looked similar to a military-converted 747 for long range radar (although it was lacking the usual top-mounted radar equipment), but that the lack of visible propulsion, the extra length and width to the fuselage, its low altitude and low airspeed and its shortened wingspan was an anomaly in itself.

Looking through the binoculars showed me the object was spherical, with bright gold lights encompassing the entire object and the lights appeared to be moving clockwise, which I suppose suggests the object was rotating, revolving as it hovered.  We would periodically check on the light every 30 minutes or so and still no change.  At around 8pm the object (while viewed from the astronomy binoculars) appeared to turn towards the south and fly off.  The light became dimmer and smaller until it completely disappeared.  Thinking that was strange and still not knowing what it could be, I dismissed it as nothing, perhaps the military or the coming storm was responsible.  But, I have now seen this object in the sky every night around the same time.  I am really curious as to what this could be.  The behavior is always the same, always in the same spot and staying there for 2-3 hours.",2013-11-20T00:00:00,,

What I can't explain truthfully was why it had a strange eerie glow emanating from it.  The green white colors and comet like tail was the most profound thing I have ever seen on this planet.  It couldn't have been a missile test.  Rockets don't make strange colors like that and it appeared so beautiful like I had died and seen an angel.   Before I talk more I'd like to explain to the reader who I am.  I am 28 now this occurred 2 years ago.  I have been diagnosed by a medical doctor with no phychological problems except a mild form of ptsd from the past.    What I saw was witnessed by another older man in his 40s.  We were both on the same road driving on highway 1 from santa monica to oxnard , right around mugu rock all of a sudden my vehicle shut down completely , no lights no engine slowly stalled to a stop on the pullout.  The man in his dodge charger in front of me stopped too about 30 yds ahead.  These were the only vehicles on the road that night me and him.   Okay so when I got out to investigate the disturbance I got the weird feeling and looking over the ocean and the other man looking to saw the object, it was so amazing I could not believe what I was seeing all my years in college I could not explain in physics how the object moved with no noise at all.  I thought I was seeing something paranormal but I don't believe in ghosts so scratch that thought.   The object moved so slow and it went back towards the horizon but at first it was close then as it disappeared the cars miraculously started up.  I never believed in ufos before now I'm definitely a believer.  I thought I was witnessing a miracle but nothing really happened it appeared and that was it.  I'm sorry I did not have a cam phone to record it at the time all I can say are words. I was coming from lax airport at the time.

At first, I thought it was just a plane, or a few of them, since there's a lot of small planes that fly near my home.  But I noticed that these were not moving.  They were almost floating there and they wouldn't budge.  I tried to think of any possible explanation but there wasn't any.  There are no cell towers or lights of any kind in that direction, it's all farmland and a few houses.   I stood watching them for a good five minutes, and then slowly I saw them almost fidget. That's the best way I can describe it.  I had been so distracted that I hadn't bothered trying to get a photo until the last mi! nute.  I looked down at my phone to turn on the camera and when I looked up, they were gone. It was as if they just disappeared.  I literally looked down for a split second.  There was no way that could've been any type of plane because I would've seen the lights fade away.   They just completely disappeared. I had never experienced anything like this ever before.

Craft On Sunday April 29, 2012, I was visiting my mother at her apartment complex in Kingwood, Texas that is just outside of Houston.   During this part of the year, Texas was experiencing a drought, and on this night, we caught our first rain and thunderstorm in long while.  After the storm passed, I decided it would be the best time to leave as it was getting late.  I was walking alone in the open parking lot when I looked over to my east at two tall trees.  Above these trees, I noticed what I believed to be at the time a large plastic bag in the sky, white but more like a boomerang shaped.  I then realized that the object was far too large to be any plastic bag and moved at greater speed.   My mind then confirmed it to me an elaborate kite.  I thought to myself that has to be one of the best kites I have ever seen, not to mention the biggest.  However the object moved at a greater speed then any kite, as it began to approached me I realize it was not a kite but so! mething otherworldly. In my head I kept hearing, this is not supposed to be here, things like this just do not exist.  It was then that this object was directly over my head.  It was purely organic, meaning the being itself acted like its own craft.  The closest thing I can compare it too would be like a centipede slithering the sky like a snake in a side-to-side motion.  It was white but it not seem like it had a definite shape to it.   As far as its composition, it looked as if it could be made out of some kind of plasma strands meshed together.  It had these tentacle-like arms reaching out with blue orbs connected to the ends of these arms.   This being would be close to a half a football field in length.  It flew just above the cloud line, which would be significantly lower because of the stormed. Above this creature was a smaller craft that looks exactly like the tip of a number two pencil, charcoal black, and roughly the size of a 747 jet engine.  This smaller craft, I am guessing, could only staff one or two individuals at the most or possibly unmanned.  This smaller black craft was emitting a blue LED looking light onto the organic entity as if was releasing this being into our skies, or projecting it as hologram.  Both the organic being and the tip-pencil shape object traveled at a speed much slower than an airplane, as it seemed like both were gliding through the sky.   The only sound I heard can be described as waves at the beach.  This sound was faint and I cannot exactly confirm if this entity was producing this sound or if I was hearing it in my head. 	 I believe these too be extraterrestrial in nature verses governmental as I have never seen anything on this planet that can resemble what I saw, however one cannot rule out the idea of Project Blue beam.   The entire incident lasted between 9:20 pm -9:22 pm.  I do not know exactly how long I was viewing both E.T.s but I defiantly know that the incident ended at 9:22 pm.  As I believe that this being was extraterrestrial, I can say I felt that it knew I was watching it.  I do not know if it was somehow feeding off the thunderstorm as it seemed to be going in the same direction, or if this was merely observing humans.  Since this encounter, I have had nightmares at least once a week involving this entity.",2013-07-14T00:00:00,30.0336,-95.261

If memory serves it was April 2013. Toward the west I saw 2 white lights coming over ridge or small mountain about 2 miles away.  One light was to the left (south) and the other to the right (north) I thought they were airplanes that were too close to each other at first, and said to my friend that the FAA shouldn’t allow planes to fly that closely together.    Then the light to the left got even closer to the light on the right and I gasped thinking there would be a midair collision of the 2 planes.  As the lights got closer to our location we both realized that it wasn’t 2 airplanes but 1 extremely large craft that was very slowly rotating so it simply appeared that the lights were getting closer together. As it got closer other smaller red colored lights could be seen between in the white lights on the sides of the craft.  The craft made no noise at all.  It was difficult to make out the shape because it was dark, but it was relatively flat and was either triangular or circular.  Looked approximately 500-1000’ from side to side.  Shockingly large.  WAY bigger than an airplane or even 2 airplanes.  It took about 60 seconds to travel the 2 miles. The craft traveled from over the ridge and was descending as it traveled to the northeast.  Estimate it was approximately 2000 ft up and to the north of us.  We lost sight of it as it descended below the treeline.   I started to wonder if it might land on Merrymeeting Lake or Ossipee Lake. A lot of people around here have experienced UFO sightings, but being New Englanders, nobody bothers to report them.   However if you consult with people who live in Ossipee, NH, UFO sightings are extremely common and have been for over 75 years. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

We were in bed and talking about our weekend plans when all of a sudden there was this incredibly bright yellow light that appeared out of no where.  It was our window bright as can be disregarding the fact that there were blinds and open curtains.  Sure our curtains were open but  this light was just an unexplainable bright yellow color, it filled me with much fear.   Unfortunately my husband was given his back to window but he also noticed how bright our room appeared and of course noticed my petrified expression.  Out of fear, I closed my eyes and hugged my husband as hard as I could of course, this did not allow him to go see out the window  When I opened my e! yes again the light was gone.  My husband and I were in disbelief to what had just occurred.  I asked him if he saw the light and his comment was ""how can you even miss it.""  Now we went over ideas maybe it was the moon but we know that is not the case we had cloudy skies last night and our moon was definitely not in its full state.  We thought maybe a car?  But that was debunked given that we are in the second floor and heard no cars also as soon as the lights went away my husband checked outside the window and there was nothing!

The second pair was to the left, and lower in the sky than the first pair, but they were all in the same vicinity.  The brighter pair started to fade and eventually disappeared into the night sky.  The second pair grew brighter when the first pair first started to fade.  They were interacting in the same manner as the first pair -- almost like a well rehearsed dance between partners.

I was at the student union (SUB) earlier and then I had an urge to go outside and look towards the east (Sandia Mountains).  It was approximately 1900 and the sun was setting.  The sky conditions were clear with no cloud cover in any direction northeast to southeast.  There was a flock of common house finches in the tree with a flurry of chirping at this time.  I had an urge to look towards the east and saw an extremely noticeable bright object in the sky.  The object was approximately 13-15 degrees in the sky and was bright white.  It was also in the form of a cylinder about so, I first though it was Comet ISON.  Of course that was ruled out as it is scheduled to pass in Nov, and then I ruled out aircraft types, and balloons.  The object remained in the same spot on the sky for the ent! ire duration of 15 min.  The object was as bright as a sewing pin head held at arm’s length for the duration.  It seemed to be above the traffic departure pattern at the airport, estimated at 15000’.  Aircraft traffic taking off towards the east did not seem to be near it vertically or horizontally; however, I can bet radar would have picked the object up. The object also seemed to be friendly and there were times during the duration I saw other smaller white objects around it for less than a second. When I asked if they could change colour they did at the time period of 12-15 min. The object became more circular and changed from bright white to red orange to red then faded out to look like a very dim white star. I did not observe the object after 15 min. I normally do not make reports unless the object is a bit more significant in scale/size/colour/duration; although I see objects usually once a week or more.

I keep seeing something big, and bright hovering in the sky, and it's been driving me crazy not knowing what it is! Can you or someone please give me and I'm sure there's more people too, but get us an explanation or answers?  I don't know about other people, but I really would like to know what it is!  I have been seeing this object now for about 2 months now. I've noticed that it's usually there about the same time of the day.  I'm thinking that it's usually there about when the sun is setting or more around 8pm and is up there between 30 minutes to an hour. One night I had got my digital camera out to try to take picture's of it, but then right as I was about to take a picture my camera had died on me. I have took some other pictures, but for some reason I couldn't seem to get the flashing colored lights and it just looks like some bright light in the sky.  I was hoping that maybe I could see it a lot better and get some picture's. Then if it turned out to be something that I needed to report, like an alien space craft then I would. Or if it just happened to be something explainable like some type of air craft that was from here on earth, then I would just let it go and not really say anything.  Well right before my camera had died on me, I had saw some red, white, and blue, flashing lights on the object. The flashing lights looked like they were going back and fourth from side to side. I think that was the only color's that I have seen on it flashing.  The part that sucks though is that I didn't get a chance to see anything else. I had only got to see those flashing lights when my camera was zoomed in, but not from the naked eye. When you look at it normally all you can see is a bright light or lights.  I think that if you just kinda glance at it, it only looks like it's one big bright white light, but if you look at it a little longer or try harder to look at it, it looks more like several bright white lights. It's not until you use something else to try to look at it closer that you can tell it has other flashing colored lights.  Every time I see the object that is hovering in the sky it kinda looks like it is the same shape as a flying disk, but then again I can get a chance to see it very close to confirm it. I really hope that someone from this company will try to investigate these sitings that I've been seeing, and get us some answers!

This strange light in the sky was coming toward my house.  It got right over the top of a particular tree in my front yard.  The first photo taken was of the craft directly over the large tree, above my garden plot.  The sky was black and no craft could be seen, only the energy from it.  It was a circle of flaming fiery red that had a thin layer of emanating heat, bellowing around it that looked like delicate lace on the sides of the red fiery ball or flaming circle.  Another photo taken showed the fiery red circle with an almost white central section with 4 white lights.  It moved silently, looked to be about 4 feet in diameter and flat, then flew across the street, staying just above the trees.  You could feel the energy from it hitting your face and hands.  The after effects of this caused the hands to itch with the fingers turning reddish.  Then the craft appeared to detected our presence and started to fly off.  The craft accelerated quickly and left a trail of bright glowing blue.  Much like the color of the blue gas flame on your stove, but a little darker and almost florescent.  You could see the front of the blue image bending the air back, similar to photo's of projectiles like bullets going through the air.  Then it accelerated at a phenomenal speed, darting out of sight.  We've never seen anything move that fast before.

Four little arms stretched out similar in shape to the priest's skull cap with spherical lights at the ends.  On top was an attached rectangle box.  The spherical lights, light up and he said could feel his body get real warm.

As we drove past the lights, from the passenger side of the car, I watched as the closer light disapeared into the low cloud cover, and then the second light did as well.  I still wondered what they were, and was looking back toward where they had been a few seconds ago when one or both shot downward out of the clouds to the ground.  They did not fall to the ground but rocketed to the ground.  The only thing I have witnessed that was faster than the speed, is lightening.  The light/s created a broad zigzaggy trail visible for only a second.",2013-11-11T00:00:00,42.2209,-70.9398

From there I can view the Intracoastal Waterway, the Atlantic Ocean and the rear of a line of homes in a town called Golden Beach.  In order of my view I see the the intracoastal first, then the homes and then the ocean.   From the rear of the homes I saw, rising from ground level a series of 6 large circular lights that were reddish orange in color.  The lights rose in time intervals of a few minutes between each, except for 1 instance in which 2 lights rose simultaneously.   At first the lights rose straight up and then they angled upward at about a 45 degree angle.  They rose extremely high, appearing to me to be the height of the many Jets I see nightly, as I live near the Fort Lauderdale airport, and eventually they became the size of stars and then faded from view.   I contacted the Golden Beach police to inquire if they had any reports of Chinese Lanterns and they said they did not have any reports. ((ADDENDA FROM WITNESS)) 1.  Peter, I did some online research on Chinese Lanterns and after reflection I do not think the rate of speed with which the objects rose was commensurate with a balloon type object. The objects I saw rose rather quickly like a plane gaining altitude, but of course the objects I saw were definitely not planes. Peter In the light of day I can see clearly where the lights originated from .  The intracoastal waterway which is in front of the homes In Golden Beach from my viewpoint.

The color was changing different hues of red and orange and would change brightness.  It then started moving very slow toward the south for about a minute and then turned and went east at a much faster speed directly away from me.  It then went out of view blocked by roof tops of the residential area. I could tell it was not very high, maybe a 1000' feet because it went out of view quickly when it went easterly.  I waited about 3-4 minutes and it just reappeared again in the original location where I first saw it.  It could have been a different one because the first one was pretty far away to return this quick but I only saw one at a time.  I then ran back to the house which was about four houses away to get my 11 year-old daughter and my video camera.  We came back and it was g! one and waited about five minutes and the ball suddenly appeared again in the same easterly location where I first saw it.  I believe it was there but was just not lit. I attempted to video tape it but my dog was pulling on me and my camera does not have a view finder so you have to look at the monitor which was difficult to do.  I got a poor quality video of it thought. The ball then moved easterly again and the lights appeared to dim and then went out.  We waited about 5 minutes and did not see it again and went home. I went inside my house up to the second story and looked easterly for about 10 minutes and did not see anything.  I figured whatever it was it was gone.  I left and came back about a minute later just out of curiosity and it was back directly across from my house at about a 60 degree angle and was very bright.  At the time, my daughter was on the telephone telling her friend who lives a short distance away, what we just saw and she told her it was back to go outside and look in the sky.  I ran outside with my kids and wife and started video taping.  The ball starting moving south and continued glowing and changing red and orange colors as if it was on fire.  It continued moving south at a slow pace stopping occasionally and dimmed and went black a few time for a few seconds and then the red came back.  It then moved quickly in a south easterly direction and then either the lights went completely out or sped away but I did not see it speed away, it was just gone or the lights went o! ut.  This viewing lasted about three minutes. During the viewing, there was no noise and it was definitely not a plane because it would stop in its path and did not have flashing lights typical of an aircraft.  The whole sphere glowed and changed colors of red and orange.  I live over the flight path for the San Francisco Bay area and planes fly over at about 10,000' but this sphere was at a much lower altitude.  I thought it may have been a balloon with some kind of light inside but it did not track a steady wind path and changed direction.  I have several videos of it and my daughter took a picture with her tablet. The next day I called the Contra Costa Sheriff's Office to ask if anyone reported seeing lights in the sky and they had no reports.  I am also a police officer so what I'm saying is what I saw.  Not saying it's extraterrestrial but it was very strange. I Googled red lights over Discovery Bay and found two other incidents this year with similar sightings of a reddish orange hovering sphere.",2013-11-11T00:00:00,37.9085,-121.6002

I was driving in the town of New Lisbon, NJ, heading towards Browns Mills, NJ.  I was about to turn right onto Junction RD, when I saw several good sized lights to straight ahead of me. I knew instantly from the size and number of them (6-8 or so)that they were not something you see every day.  I decided not to make the right onto Junction Rd, and quickly went straight ahead out to the next Rd (Pemberton- Browns Mills RD) to see if I could get a better view of them.  I sped and got to the next road over in about 20 seconds. When I came to the stop sign, I parked and got out.  I could see them objects still, but they were going behind the tree line and out of my view.  I got my cell phone out as fast as I could, and started to film.  I was a bit nervous, and it took me a few seconds to get the camera video going.  By this time, most had gone behind the tree line.  One was still very much in the open, and I decided to film that one.  For anybody that is Familiar with this area, it was over the Pemberton Twp Police Department building along the woods line, but was further back not close to Pemberton Browns Mills Rd. I could not judge the distance, but guessed it was out near Pointsville RD on Fort Dix somewhere near Emmons Dairy, a well known Farm in my area. It took me a few seconds to find the object with my phone. They were lights, I didn’t see any shape of the object itself.  They seemed to flicker a bit almost to a light blue color.  There was no sound at all while I recorded, other than the sound of passing cars in front of me.  I recorded for about 30 seconds, until I became aware, I was standing in the middle of a road, and then looked around to make sure no cars were coming behind me.  The object also got behind the tree line. All along, these objects were in some sort of formation or pattern, not just randomly in the sky.  Upon playing back my video, I saw it came out shaky, but I did catch the object, although it appeared smaller on the video than it did with my own eye.  I don’t know how to zoom with my camera on my phone, or perhaps the video would be better.  Other objects in the video include a street light and cars passing by horizontally in front of me. The object itself, seems to move quickly back and forth within a small area.  I don’t think this was due to my shaking hand, but I don’t know for sure. Again, the best spot I estimate the objects to have been flying directly over would be in the area of Pointsville Rd between Pemberton & Fort Dix Military Base.  Living in the area of Fort Dix & McGuire AFB my whol life, I am used to seeing and hearing planes & helicopters.  These were no planes as they floated way too slowly.  They may have been stealth choppers possibly, but that's the only thing I could imagine them being.  They floated with a purpose, and in a formation of some sort, all moving together in one direction towards Fort Dix and McGuire AFB.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,39.9576,-74.6645

I am retired US Air Force and I am an amateur astronomer.  I am quite familiar with the night sky in Missouri.  I have been observing Saturn all summer, and have lately been observing Nova Delphinus 2013. I set up my telescope at the same location every night.  (I can be contacted privately for the exact latitude/longitude/altitude of the location.)  I align it using the stars Arcturus, Altair, and Polaris.  Once the scope is aligned, I focus on the area of the sky I plan to observe.  While I wait for my eyes to become accustomed to the dark, I look for the ISS, which passes overhead quite regularly. This evening the ISS passed over around 2135 (approximately).  After it had passed overhead, I turned toward the east, facing the constellations Cygnus, Saggita, and Delphinus.  Before I looked through the telescope, I planned to use binoculars to see if I could spot the nova that way first.  As I turned to pick up the binocs, I saw a moving object. The object was slightly larger than Venus currently appears from Earth in the evening, and its relative brightness was equal or slightly brighter than that of Venus.  It came from the North-West and crossed the visible sky going South-East.  It was moving quickly, but I was able to sight it with binoculars.  Through binocs it appeared brighter.  I then hand-tracked it with the telescope for the space of perhaps 10 heartbeats.  It was completely silent, and the lights were steady, not flashing as they would be, for example, with a B-52 or other large aircraft.  It did not change in colour, brightness, size, shape, speed, or trajectory throughout the time I observed it. When the object was directly overhead, the telescope failed.  Also at that point, all traffic noise from Missouri 13 stopped, although this may have been coincidental.  All insect and animal noises including summer cicada chirping stopped. I thought the telescope had simply come unplugged from the 12-volt outlet in my Ford Ranger, or alternatively that the battery in my truck had somehow died.  I got into the truck and tried to start the engine but was unsuccessful.  There was no click from the starter, and the engine failed to start.  I unplugged the telescope and attempted to push-start the truck (it has a standard transmission) but it failed to start. My nose began to bleed heavily at this point.  I got out of the truck to load the telescope into it.  I noticed the object still moving South-east, toward a cell tower located near Lakeland High School.  The red hazard lights on the cell tower died away.  Both the flashing top tower lights and the constant mid-tower lights faded as the object appeared to approach them.  The tower was completely dark for several seconds before the warning lights returned. I loaded the telescope into the truck.  I had left the key in the ignition and the ignition on when I got out to load my gear.  When I got back into the truck, I saw that the panel lights were now operative so I tried once again to start the engine. This time it did start, so I drove home immediately.  Once I arrived at home I found that the telescope’s hand computer had been completely reset.  All data had been cleared, including the boot data, and will have to be restored.  Since the telescope has battery backup, this cannot have been caused by a simple loss of power; the computer’s memory has been erased. By the time I arrived home (a five-minute drive), the nosebleed had stopped.  However, I did (and still do as of this writing) have a headache approaching migraine proportions.  This may be coincidental, or stress-related, and nothing to do with the object itself. As soon as I got in the house I telephoned to Whiteman Air Force Base, which is (relatively) near my location.  I spoke with Sergeant Fry, who advised me to telephone the National UFO Reporting Center.  She stated that there was no military activity in the area of Deepwater, MO, this evening, and that the information I gave her, including the report on my physical condition, should be reported to proper authorities at the Center. I have no idea of the object’s actual size, nor of its relative velocity.  I was so astonished and upset by the experience that I also do not have a solid trajectory for it.  The best I can do is to say that it moved from slightly North-West to slightly South-East and was visible for at least five minutes.  It passed east of the star Vega, and slightly west of the star Altair as it moved across the sky — in fact, very near the constellations Delphinus and Saggita, which is why I saw it to begin with. This was not a stellar object; it was moving too fast to be such a thing.  If it was simply a satellite, it is one with whose trajectory I am not familiar.  Given the fact that I observe this area of the sky nightly, that is unlikely.  To the best of my knowledge, the object was not a satellite; I can find no reports of satellite trajectory, IF events, or the like which match the time, date, area of the sky, or description of the object. I have never had an experience like this before, either during the time I spent on active duty, or as an amateur astronomer, and am unable to explain it.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,38.2175,-93.6992

I apologize for not counting exactly how many there were but i assure you it was 5 or 7 in the first group.  I was somewhat taken back by what i was witnessing.  They appeared at the south horizon just above a tree line.  They traveled at what seemed to be a slow rate of speed northeast toward an almost full moon.   They then began to dissapear individually about fifteen seconds after they appeared to me.   These objects did not move in an abrupt fashion or shift in any way but in a linear motion.

I'm an avid star gazer so naturally i was staring at the sky while my girlfriend went inside to grab her sons overnight bag for him. His grandfather was sitting in his truck in the driveway facing north bound. I  noticed the objects and stood up to get a better look at the event and in awe just pointed at the sky, speechless! As the group shaped in the v pattern began to dissapear Missy, my girlfriend walked out of the front door onto the patio. She noticed me pointing at the sky and cuaght sight of the two objects that followed. They then began to fade into the night sky. At first i thought that they had dissapeared behind cloud cover but after further investigation i realized the sky was very clear with no visible clouds. 	Im not sure what i witnessed but i can tell you that ive never seen anything like it before in my life. After discussing the event with Missy i decided to notify someone of the event. I tried to figure out a logical explanation for what i had seen but was unable to. I  wanted so badly to find out if others had seen the same thing so when i woke up the following morning after a restless night of sleeping i immeditely looked in the paper and browsed the internet for other sightings.

It was at an elevation of a low-flying helicopter, or an airplane that hasn't completed even the initial leg of its post-takeoff ascent.  Its bluish-green was similar in color neither to that of any falling star nor that of any comet I've ever seen. My knee-jerk reaction was to blurt out ""Whoa!"", but it had disappeared even before I had finished the exclamation.  By ""it had disappeared,"" I mean I saw it zip away in a short streak of its intense bluish-green light, at a speed exponentially faster than any aircraft (commercial, recreational, military, or otherwise) I've ever seen.  The laser light ball jetted from its stationary position like a Star Wars spaceship ""jumping to light speed"" or ""entering hyperspace;"" after an unbelievably quick (in time) and short (in distance) dart, it literally looked like it ""teleported"" into the blackness of the sky, but on a very straight trajectory.
