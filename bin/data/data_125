My co-workers who are also close friends of mine are witnesses as well. There are about 5 of us who have this conversation annually so I wanted to report this information.  Once a month in 2014, a family- who we are convinced are aliens disguised as humans -would enter our bank branch and cash small checks. Prior to my encounter, When my co-workers would tell me about a family that would come into our branch and looked like aliens, I would laugh it off.  However, I encountered them twice and I changed my mind.  When we tell people our story, it sounds crazy to outsiders.  The family would captivate your attention the second they would walk into the bank. There were 5 people in the ""family"".... a ""dad"", ""mom"", and ""three daughters"". All three daughters appeared to be teenagers and the same exact height. Both parents were the same exact height. They were ash/grayish in color, and their heads were shaped like inverted triangles and their heads formed cone-ish towards the back. This was more prominent on the dad as he was completely bald. The women had short, blond-ish hair. Their garments were always drab. The Parents were an estimated 5 foot 3 inches. the kids, 5 foot 1 inch.  What was interesting about them was they would walk into the bank in a single file line. Their legs would walk together military-like and in unison, and their energy captured all of the attention of everyone in the bank, including our bank customers. People had a hard time keeping their eyes off of them.  The dad came directly to my teller line and was a foot in front of me. His eyes matched the rest of the family- dark, large pupils, and I felt like he was staring into my mind. I can't explain it. The family stood directly behind him and stared at me the entire transaction as well, without saying a word. The father had a muffled English voice. Once the transaction was over, the family turned and walk in a single file line out of the branch.  This happened an additional time that I can recall, but the dad did not come to my teller line. However, the family had everyones attention throughout the entire transaction once again.  This happened a few times, and all of my friends can recall up to 4 separate times they entered the branch.  None of us can remember their names, their accounts, or anything. We never thought to take a picture. The only reason I can give as to why we didn't document it, was because of the attention they grabbed from us, and how shocked we were after each encounter. It was strange and indescribable.

The smaller light eventually continued at a faster pace towards the north/west until it disappeared. Then at a much higher position another cluster of lights (cluster B) appeared moving across the sky south to north. Both clusters eventually lined up one above the other but from my perspective they were probably on the same “plane.” At this point they both rose higher and went in opposite directions. I lost sight of cluster B as it headed more towards the west and was getting smaller until it blended in with the stars in the sky (size wise). Cluster A was much more easier to track as it headed towards the east and almost directly above me. Both clusters when I first saw them were much larger in scale almost blimp like or hot air balloon in size. Cluster A kept getting higher and also starting to blend in with the size of the ! night stars. Cluster A moved close to the Little Dipper and then headed back towards the west where the light pollution eventually made it almost impossible to keep track of. I actually laid down on the ground to monitor cluster A because my neck started to hurt. I tracked it for over 40 minutes. I also have very grainy iPhone footage that I hastily filmed for 3 minutes but is very hard to see because of the distance. But you can see both clusters as they lined up with each other shortly after I first saw them.,2019-12-01T00:00:00,33.96301605839416,-118.02813321167883

It was dark still, the sun was about 10 minutes from lighting up the sky.  But the sky was crystal clear deep blue/black and there wasn't much tree cover from the sides.  I noticed to my upper left field of view a sudden bright light and that it's moving fast. I thought it was a shooting star (my thought as it entered my peripheral vision) so I got excited and looked at it and IMMEDIATELY could tell that it wasn't a shooting star.  It had hard edges to it and there were giant red circular lights on the back of it, with some smaller? (really ambiguous) white light near the red.  It was a hexigonal cone shape, with a flattened bottom. It traveled around the speed of a shooting star, which is what made me think what I did at first. It went very quickly from my left field of view to my right and then made a VERY hard and sudden left turn and as soon as it completed the turn, it disappeared.  There was a very very VERY unnoticable white blink when it disappeared. Very subtle. So the best way I can describe its flight path was &#10003; (but flipped around, and it was more horizontal/parallel to the ground). There was no sound, no sonic booms, no loud engine sounds.  It was relatively low to the ground as well, no higher than a mid-alttitude plane.  If I had to guess, maybe 3,000-4,000 feet off the ground. All happened I'm about 3-4 seconds and I didn't take my eyes off of it until it vanished, and even still I kept looking up at the sky.  I was driving slowly along a relatively straight road so with no body around.  So my focus was on the sky for a good couple minutes after that.

I was tapping my brother on the shoulder and telling him, ""Look out the window there's a ufo!"" he thought I was joking so I stopped looking at it so I could get my brothers attention and when he finally looked out it was gone.

It was around 1977/78 I was 6/7 years old living in Teaneck, New Jersey.  (As I’m writing my keyboard and extra laptop just started turning on and off by itself and the levers are moving!) I was in the sunroom of our two story home, it had a big sliding glass door. Suddenly, out of nowhere I sensed something and looked up.  There in front of the sliding glass door, on the outside, was a huge orange flying spider/octopus looking creature that must have been at least 5 feet tall.  I was a little girl, but I do remember it covered the entire span of glass.  It was not touching the glass, however, it was hovering and looking at me.  I was terrified!  So I ran to call for my mother. When I got to the stairs (my mother was upstairs watching tv) I tried to go up and scream for her, but I couldn’t.  It was as if I was paralyzed.  My legs would not take me up the stairs.  No sound would come out.  I remember very clearly that I could hear the sound of the opening credits to General Hospital.  She was watching her soap opera so close by, but I couldn’t call for her.  My voice was stuck. But I suddenly had this overwhelming compulsion to go back to the orange spider.  It was as if it was talking to me in my head.  It didn’t use words, but I understood it was telling me not to be afraid, not to worry and to come back.  So I did.  And fear was gone and I felt completely calm and at ease.  Almost companionship and trust and even love? I don’t know how to explain it, but my fear was suddenly replaced with a deep trust and knowledge that this creature would not hurt me.  It was my friend. After I came back, they told me things in my head that I just don’t remember. I’ve tried to remember to no avail. It was speaking to me silently, but at the time I know I was listening, even though there was no sound.  Also, I can’t explain why I know this, but it was very clear that while it had one body, there were many inside.  Not actually physically inside, but rather many “beings” were talking to me.  Like all of them at once, with one voice in my head.  OMG, I know I sound crazy!  I promise you I am not. And then, just as suddenly as it appeared.  It flew up, above the trees in my backyard and disappeared. That night at dinner I told my parents and siblings what had happened.  And I asked my teacher if she had ever seen an “orange spider” that was bigger then she was. BTW, I’ve called it my orange spider since that day, but when a science teacher asked me to draw it when I moved to Florida at 10 years old, I realized with the tentacles on it’s arms, it actually looked more like a flying octopus. (my science teacher called a parent meeting with the principle lol) I think she was truly concerned for my mental well being!  I am 47 now and I still know what I saw that day.  I know I did not imagine it,  I did not make it up and I know it happened.  BTW, when I first looked up your site and started writing, as I mentioned above.  My laptop and music keyboard started turning on and off. I propped my phone on desk and pressed record.  It happened again 5 minutes later.  I can send you the video if you’d like.  And now it’s shut itself off completely.  My heart is pounding.  I can’t tell if I shouldn’t share my story or if it’s an encouragement!  Lol  I’ve never written my story, though I’ve shared with close friends and family all my life.  And while electrical things have always gone somewhat haywire, in that they might shut down…the on/off computer thing and moving levers is new. Anyway, I’m writing in the hopes that someone else may have seen my “orange spider” because I’ve never found anything online that suggests anyone has. I would welcome your thoughts and any information.  Thank you",2019-12-01T00:00:00,40.8889,-74.0119

Oval shaped dark metallic red object moving at mach speed.,Haifa (Israel),,1979-07-15T07:00:00,oval,2-3 minutes,"Occurred : 7/15/1979 07:00  (Entered as : 07/1979 07:00) Reported: 10/10/2019 12:43:01 AM 00:43 Posted: 12/1/2019 Location: Haifa (Israel),  Shape: Oval Duration:2-3 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/149/S149705.html,"Oval shaped dark metallic red object moving at mach speed. My UFO Sighting - This Truly Happened!   It is July 1979 at around 07:00 and I am trudging uphill our dead-end street that is located on one of the many hills in Haifa, in order to catch my work bus at 7:10-7:15. Suddenly, from the far hill above me appears an unusual object and it flies down towards the left side of my street.  It surprisingly stops and hovers there and I am just staring at it. It is hanging in the air over the field with a fence separating us and because of optical illusion, I can’t figure out its size, height or distance from me. I am alone and starting to be a bit apprehensive, but I try to observe it in order to embed it in my memory.  It has an ellipse shaped body and the color is metallic dark red.  There is a line in the middle and gothic shaped blackened windows all around, above and below the line.  There are no ‘caps’ on the top of it (as seen in movies) and no lower apparatus.  No lights are showing on the airship, as it is daylight. Also, no sound was coming from it; no whoosh or engine sounds - complete silence. Suddenly it flies off in the opposite direction from where it came, towards the Mediterranean Sea at mach speed.  It went from one end of the city to the other in a few seconds.  The airship must have been hovering near me for about one minute and the whole sighting lasted about two to three minutes. I said to myself that it must be a remote controlled toy, but that is impossible, as it is summer vacation and kids are not up so early.   Another idea I had was that it was an aeronautical experiment but this is not a testing area; it is only an urban city area. That day I reported this to a professor where I worked and was strongly advised not to say anything about it (remember it was 1979 and the subject was taboo). I’m wondering why it didn’t “beam” me up.  If it really was an UFO; I would have loved to learn more about it.  Then again, I should perhaps be thankful that it didn’t. Or - maybe I scared it off!",2019-12-01T00:00:00,,

It was 3/96, during the time that Comet Hyakutake was visible, so I was looking up trying to see the comet, from the parking lot of my apt complex.  It was around the time of the new moon, so stars were prevalent.  What caught my eye was what looked like stars “moving”.  It was in fact, the outline of a large rectangle, moving across the sky. It had lights around the rim, so what I was seeing, was the moving lights against the stars, rimming what looked like a perfect rectangle.  I followed it gliding in a straight line, not sure what direction it was, until trees blocked it, maybe 30 seconds to a minute.  It was not very high, in the sky, maybe the height of a 20-story building (I grew up in NYC). The next night, feeling freaked out by what I had seen, I had my roommate come outside with me, to “see the comet”, but I needed to face my fear.  It was about 11pm, about an hour or so later than the sighting of the night before.  Along the same stretch of sky, almost the same “path” as the rectangle, we saw 4 orbs, perfectly round, bright lights, descending slowly from pretty high up, maybe 20 to 30 stories up, higher than the rectangle from previous night.  As they descended, they were forming geometric shapes & rotating.  They’d form a circle, square & an elliptical, all while rotating slowly.  Against logic, I moved under them, watching them form the shapes & rotate.  They descended very low, maybe 15 stories, give or take; I grew up in a 17-story building, it looked like they descended lower than the height of the top floor of that building, directly above my head & still rotating & forming shapes.  Directly beneath them, I could see the space between them, they did no! t look attached at all, but definitely more like 4 entirely separate orbs. After, what I’ve since described as their “showboating”, because that’s really what it felt like, making geometric shapes, slowly, in the sky over my head, about 3 or 4 minutes, they started to move, almost exactly along the same path as the rectangle the night before, still forming shapes (mostly squares & circles at this point) & still revolving around eachother, but each together gliding along that same path, until out of site, by the same trees, moving a little slower than the rectangle the night before.  They were definitely not as high up as the rectangular object.  But both nights, there was absolutely no sound from either one, complete silence.  They were both low enough, that had they been an aircraft of some kind, we should definitely have heard something. At first my roommate corroborated my sighting completely, there were no other witnesses the first night.  However, we were both quite spooked by what we saw & although she described the same thing I saw, for several months, she eventually started to say it “never happened” or that it was “explainable”.  She never did give another explanation though, she just didn’t want to talk about it. We haven’t spoken in many years, I don’t know if she’d be willing to talk about it now.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,35.20580084001527,-80.82639156166476

The UFO sighted did not make any noise at all.  No apparent sounds were emanating from the craft. 2. Total time of the sighting was approximately 30 to 40 seconds. 3. Direction UFO traveled was from SW to NE by N. 4. Place of sighting was Westboro (also spelled Westborough), Massachusetts, USA. Route 9 (eastbound).  Subject viewing the UFO was outside of parked vehicle, standing. 5. Time of sighting was precisely 8:30 p.m., EST. Date was March 31, 2000. 6. Weather was clear night, no precipitation, no fog. 7. Size of craft to best of knowledge and estimation was 150 feet from tip to base. 8. It was a singular UFO, but its shape was three seemingly attached triangles, forming one triangle with the center absent. The best example of its appearance is to say it looked exactly like the Zelda symbol, only without the foot portion, only the triangle(s). 9. I can attest this is not a joke. This is an actual sighting.  Extended info: There was absolutely no sound coming from the craft. As an additional note, the UFO almost seemed to be distorted in a way that made it appear as though it were ""fading"" in and out of sight, but not completely out of sight...almost a ""blinking"", but not as timely and synchronized as blinking. There was absolutely no cloud cover, fog, or other means by which this may have been the cause. I have in fact seen a similar object a few weeks prior, but it is insignificant compared to this. But for comparison purposes, the craft seen before this sighting was only visible for approximately 10 seconds at very high altitudes, and appeared to look like an orange glowing bird-like craft, headed directly upward out of viewing range.

I feel a bit silly reporting this event now, as it happened sometime around the year 2003.  My daughter and I were in the car driving down a dirt road very early in the morning.  Our speed was around 20-25 mph.  It was a long straight road with clear fields on each side.  In the distance, a mile or so, there was a bank of tall poplar trees on one side.  The road ran north to south, the trees east to west. We were delivering flowers to a remote ranch and driving north towards the trees.   Suddenly I saw or sensed something to my left and turned to see an object, perhaps twice the size of my car just feet away from us, flying along with us.  The object was so close I feared I could swerve just slightly and hit it.  I tried to keep my eyes on the road but was a bit mezmorized by it and wanted to watch it.   There were no windows that we could see, it was a dark dirty gray, not shiny and the metal seemed a bit ruddy.  There were wide metal strips and there w! ere circles on the strips.  It looked heavy.  I continued to drive and felt a bit panicked because it was so close and I wanted to keep looking at it but also stay on the road.  It flew along side of us for a half mile, at least, maybe more. Suddenly it took off.  So fast, I cannot possibly calculate.  It was headed right for those trees and I thought for a second it was going to crash into the Poplars but instead it’s path curved up and over disappearing beyond the trees.  We never saw it again.  Once it had disappeared, my attention turned to my daughter sitting in the passenger seat.  My daughter had always been terrified of any mention of aliens from outer space   She had, for years been terrified of the movie, ET.  I slammed on the breaks and turned to her. I said, “are you okay?”  She answered, “I feel safe.”  I found this to be a curious and interesting response. We continued a few miles down the road and delivered the flowers , then drove home.  I called my brother and told him of the experience.  He suggested we go into separate rooms and draw what we had seen then compare our drawings.  We did this and the results were interesting.  We had indeed drawn the same image, but more than just the image we had both colored our UFO drawing the color orange.  The object was a dark gray and I cannot explain why I picked up the orange crayon. For reasons that need not be explained, I became separated from my daughter for 14 years.  We recently were re-united.  After spending a day together, I asked her if she remembered seeing the UFO and she did, she remembered it in great detail, the trees, and the way it gracefully curved up and over.  She told me the whole story as if it had happened yesterday.  In all these years since, I have never told anyone, except my brother, about the event.  Who would believe such a story?  But, it’s true and it was a comfort to hear my daughter recall it exactly as I had remembered that morning.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,38.9967,-105.1184

There were quite a few ice fishermen out on Lake Owasso but most people were in their ice houses. The sky was cloudy as is typical in winter, except that the horizons were clear just a little over the tree tops. I was facing west and my buddy west/northwest.  As we stood around talking, something caught my eye just above us and to the south. I looked up expecting to see a shooting star. Instead it was a green-ish/blue-ish egg shaped light streaking through the clouds. It lasted for about three seconds and then vanished.  I initially thought that it was a shooting star because of the speed that the light moved across the sky.  I immediately concluded that it was not a shooting star because the dense clouds overhead prohibited our view of any stars.  Winter clouds in Minnesota are low to the ground and shooting stars occur high in the atmosphere.  The light appeared to be the size of a large airplane (like a military cargo plane) but it was tough to gauge its size because it was hard to judge distance between the clouds and the ground.  After initially thinking that the light was a shooting star, my next conclusion was that it was a flare. However, the light was much bigger than a flare, and was traveling horizontally at a constant rate and altitude. Flares also don’t travel as fast as a shooting star. The light also did not look like any flare that I’ve ever seen and was not red or white.  The light was moving just inside of the clouds. I could see bits of cloud between myself and the light. This makes me think that it wasn’t a flash light, strobe, or other projection onto the clouds since that type of light would not penetrate the clouds. It would reflect off of the clouds and not appear to be inside of the clouds as this light happened to be. It also did not have any of the normal attributes of northern lights, and appeared in the sky just to the south of our position.  There was no noise created by the light, no trail of clouds or exhaust, and it disappeared just before reaching a clearing in the clouds. I suppose that it could have been some sort of bright gas ball, but I’ve never seen anything like that before. This light shot through the clouds and seemed to have defined edges (egg-shaped). The light never changed direction, speed, or altitude that I could tell. It just vanished at a certain point.  I can’t say that it was a craft of any sort because all that we saw was a fast moving light. Instantly though, we both knew that we had seen something odd. I don’t have an explanation for what we saw but can describe it quite well. My fishing buddy saw it for the last second or so and couldn’t come up with a good explanation for what we saw either.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,,

My friend and I used to hang out nearly every day and as young teenagers tend to do, we would stay up into the wee hours of the night. We were in my friends basement one night watching a movie and all of a sudden there was a rumbling. Not a rumbling akin to an earthquake but more like if you live near a subway or airport. About twenty seconds after the rumbling started we started hearing a whistling noise that sounded almost exactly like the old sound clips they would play when dropping a bomb or heavy object. Naturally we were on high alert as were the dogs he had, they were going absolutely nuts. About ten seconds after we started to hear the whistling noise we saw a craft no more than 40 feet off the ground, right above the tree line. We watched the craft slowly hover away at a speed that you could keep up on a bicycle. We both have this very, very strange feeling, all the hairs standing up, the kind of feeling when you know *something* is wrong but don’t! know what exactly.  At this point we are absolutely terrified and decide to pack up and move into my friend’s room (the next room over from where we were watching the movie) In the process of picking up or pillows and popcorn my friend was frozen, like a deer in headlights, staring out the window. He didn’t point, didn’t move, hardly reacted and quietly told me to look out the window. As I drew closer to the window I could see there clear as day what appeared to be a man staring back in at us. He looked like your average Joe except that you could see through him as if he was a ghost. I quickly pulled the shades and we both ran into his room and didn’t speak about the encounter ever again.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,42.1625,-89.2477

All discussing what might be happening in the woods. Some of which even loaded their firearms in preparation, as we were all under the assumption it was some type of large wild animals. As they were all talking, I looked up into the sky and immediately noticed what appeared to be two ""small circular balls"" of bright  flickering light, although the changing pattern they were moving in made their actual shape  indistinguishable. The color of light was 90% bright white similar to a star.  But there were also (somewhat difficult to see), multi colored specs flickering rapidly in it as well. The MOST alarming part of it was the way the two lights were moving. I can only describe it as the way a bumble bee hovers in place. stationary, yet continually moving up, down, left, right. Only much more quickly and rapidly.  The lights had almost no change in the 3 hours we watched, EXCEPT; Several times throughout, the two did move to a slightly different position in the sky, (left/right reposition not closer or further away). This happened Very quickly and in sync, It appeared Almost like they were orbiting around each other. Once, immediately after we witnessed a change in position, one of them began to drop smaller lights out, (approximately 5-10 smaller lights). The lights fell directly downward and each faded out, one after the next, only seconds after they  began to drop.   The next day we searched the surrounding woods in the light for prints of what it may have been. There did not seem to even be disturbed or crushed leaves anywhere. I do want to add that we found a few clusters of some small (penny sized) circular holes in some parts of the forest. Also some broken/bent  branches around shoulder/waist height. Not enough known facts to determine if they were related to the prior night's incident or not.  We never experienced the lights disappearing that night. After about 3 hours, We all decided to quit observing because it was so late, we called it a night and went back inside. Days later I found out others living miles away had also heard the same loud noises in their woods that night as well.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,33.7458,-81.0665

There were large golden clouds guarding the sun, and the craft bobbed towards them.  After about 40 seconds, it disappeared in the clouds.  The craft was pretty much the same color as the clouds, and I therefore lost it in them.  Time was about 7pm, the sun was low, but not setting.  I know for a fact it was the same craft.  Same size, shape and color.  Again it had the same small ring in the middle.  This means that same craft stayed there for two years.  After it moved to the west I haven’t seen it since.

The object continued towards us, over our heads and then towards the city lights on the horizon of San Antonio. There are two Air Force bases in San Antonio, one of which was near by our house we rented, but the craft was silent, moving way too slow to be an airplane and when it got close enough it just looked like a triangle that was pure black. I couldn’t tell the difference between the ni! ght sky and the craft besides the outline of the shape of a triangle and the 4 white lights that remained on and never dimmed, blinked or showed any kind of signal. For size comparison I would say if I held up a basketball right over my head it was the size of the ball but flying low, maybe 3,000-5,000 feet at best guess.

This is a normal procedure I find myself doing on my late shift nights, especially when it is dark. Having used my small flashlight and having identified no immediate danger I cautiously started walking towards my car when, out the corner of my eye and to the right, I picked up something that looked like bright lights or a fire towards the southwest area of town near Fort Carson and/or Cheyenne Mountain AFB.  Turning my head to get a better look I saw what appeared to be a bright string of amber colored flare like lights that at times appeared connected and at times with gaps between them.  At first I thought they may have been aerial flares or illumination rounds fired from the artillery ranges at Fort Carson.   However, I quickly determined that they were not acting like flares and too high to be ‘Illum’ rounds.  In fact, they appeared to flicker in and out by disappearing and reappearing for lack of a better explanation. As I looked harder, it appeared that these lights were above the flashing antenna lights on the very top of Cheyenne Mountain.  I could not quite put together in my head what I was actually seeing and could not fully determine if the object was actually one or many items and if it was moving or spinning (from possibly right to left) or if there was an illusion of movement due to its flickering nature. Suddenly after about a minute or less of this, the object or objects suddenly disappeared and did not come back.  I saw one of my coworkers getting into her car nearby and I yelled out if she just saw that to which she replied she did and made some half joking comment about a flying saucer.  My whole drive home, which was 12 miles in a southerly direction down Powers Blvd, I made sure to keepe an eye out on the sky, however, I never saw them again. At around 20:55 hours, from home, I called a local new station’s news desk, KKTV I believe, and spoke with someone named  Tony and asked him if anyone had called in reporting a string of amber colored lights in the sky. He immediately became excited at stated I was the first report from Colorado Springs and that he has been getting reports of such a thing for the past hour from Pueblo which is just south of Colorado Springs.  He even volunteered that he was going to call NORAD and ask them if anything was going on and that someone had even sent video which he intended to put on the station’s Facebook page. As of the following morning, there were no news reports or video.  I talked to my coworker and she stated that she saw the same thing I did and added that the incident seemed to cause the antenna lights on top of Cheyenne Mountain to flicker on and off, something I did not, myself, seem to pick up on. I am a veteran of the US Army and former law enforcement.  I have seen numerous aircraft and aerial flares over the years and can positively state I have never seen anything quite like this.  However, I am open to the possibility that this sighting could be due to military aircraft and/or flares. The lights were bright and amber colored, much larger than stars but smaller, although brighter, than the moon.   There was a slight wind where I was at but I do not know what the weather was like in the area where the lights were. Postscript: I have waited over a year to post this and was on the fence, so to speak, about doing it at all for reasons personal to me.  However, 3 recent Joe Rogan podcasts have changed my mind.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,38.861478298238076,-104.78039776536313

I asked him what else he wanted to look at, so he turned around and was looking toward the Superstition Mountain(facing east now), looking for a star to pick. While he was looking, he pointed to a spot above the point of the mountain and hollered ""mom a flash!"" I looked and waited and saw the flash, so turned his telescope on it.  There were 2 bright lights, that could only be seen through the telescope, and they were white. Then a third one appeared and they moved into a triangle formation, after chasing each other around in the sky just above the saddle of the mountain, when looking from Apache Junction.  Once they settled into the triangle formation, they began ""crashing"" into each other, for lack of better description, almost in turns. When this happened, they would glow bright and then dim back down, and would change color as they got hit, almost like it was showing damage. They went from white, to green, to red to an orange or amber color. Every now and then, one of the lights would shoot off and disappear, and another would come back to replace it in just a few minutes.  This went on for at least an hour, until 2 extremely bright lights flew in from the south, moving like helicopters, and chased the color changing lights behind the mountain, where they did not reappear from behind of. These lights were only visible through the telescope, but the flashes could be seen with the naked eye. My son was very freaked out, and I was texting multiple people a play-by-play as it was happening, eyes glued to the telescope. I was unable to get any photo documentation due to this fact.  Times and dates are estimated, but within reasonable range. The event occurred between the middle of april to end of may, and it had been dark already for a while.

The speed of the rotation and forward movement was very fast and I remember thinking that a human pilot would not be able to withstand the force.

I've always been fascinated about the UFO subject but was very skeptical throughout most of my life until August of 2012 when I experienced an aircraft that flew over my property... I reported it, and to this day, in my mind, I have still not been able to properly process my experience... For weeks I sat outside every night gazing and hoping to have another experience like this one, but I never did.  On November 30th, 2018, I underwent my 3rd shoulder surgery and during the next few months I participated in physical therapy to strengthen my shoulder just as I had done from previous surgeries and I was healing very well.  One morning at the end of February, after a good night's sleep, I woke up with horrible pain in my shoulder. As painful as before my surgery, but I knew that after 3 months of healing and strengthening through physical therapy, I could not have injured it while sleeping, yet the pain was almost unbearable.  I had not taken any pain medication since the third week of December, but this morning I took a prescribed pain reliever to try and overcome the problem... But, I was about to experience something that could not be explained, could not be treated, and could not be reported for fear of the outcome.  When I got out of bed, took a pain reliever and drank a cup of coffee, I headed to the shower.  When I stepped into the shower and started to wash my hair, my whole world seemed to stop for a few seconds.  From the edge of my hairline in the front above my forehead, all the way back to the crown of my head was a very wide and very high scab of dried blood about 3 inches long. This scab was as if I had a deep cut that was 3 or 4 weeks old or more that was never sewn up but left to heal on its own.  The scab of dried blood was hard, wide, and raised about a quarter of an inch.  It itched as if it were an injury that was well into the healing process.  My head was fine when I went to bed the night before, but the morning after I was dealing with something that I could not explain.  I picked at this scab for weeks before I finally got it all cleaned up.  I had no pain in or on my head and no fresh blood. Just this huge scab from a large cut on top of my head that was well into the healing process and now I once again had severe pain in my shoulder.  I called the V.A. Hospital and made an appointment to see the Orthopedic Surgeon who had performed the surgery on my shoulder.  When I attended my appointment he assumed that maybe I just had some inflamation and injected a steroid medication into my shoulder.  I never mentioned what happened to my head as I feared being diagnosed by the V.A. with some mental issue.  A few weeks later I returned with the continued pain, so the Doctor ordered another MRI to see what was wrong.  The MRI verified that the shoulder repair that was performed on November 30th was completely torn apart and in worse condition than before the surgery.  The doctor said the damage looked like I had been hanging by my arm which would have torn apart the tendons that were not completely healed yet...  I explained that I had not done anything that would have caused this and he just shrugged his shoulders... He made me an appointment with an outside surgeon for consideration of a complete shoulder replacement.  Since that time I have undergone my 4th shoulder repair surgery on September 11th.  No complete replacement was done, but a complete reconstructive surgery was performed using bovine collagen patches from a cow to help me grow new tissue... I am currently in physical therapy and hoping to heal up well.  I truly believe that I experienced an abduction that night.  No professional explanation can solidify how the large cut was made on my head and partially healed in the manner that it was, nor the reason that my shoulder repair was completely destroyed as it was.  And, that's not all...  The V.A. has also notified me to inform me that it appears that I may now have prostate cancer.  I am required by the V.A. to have a complete physical every six months and I have had zero symptoms, my PSA has always been normal and I have always had excellent Lab reports.  Until now......  I am scheduled to see a Prostate Cancer Specialist in St. Louis on the 29th of this month for further testing.  I cannot disclose this information regarding my thoughts of abduction to anyone, nor I cannot prove anything...  I just know what I know, and I know that whatever happened to me is not normal, nor is it explainable in a way that would be acceptable other than an abduction.  I just felt like sharing this with you.  Thank you for reading and please keep my identity anonymous.  Kindest regards, -Joe",2019-12-01T00:00:00,37.8378,-88.6279

After the fireworks we were walking back to our vehicles when we decided to stop at the Community Skate Park and hang out and talk etc.   We were lying on our backs in the skate bowl looking up at the sky.  The sky was patchy with clouds with the stars visible clearly between the clouds.  There was no moon and we were far away from strong sources of light pollution.   After a few minutes my date and I noticed a small speck of white light with what appeared to be a ""tail"" trailing behind moving against the background of the stars.  We both commented that it looked like a single sperm “swimming” among the background of the stars and going behind the clouds seemingly in a random, “searching” pattern; zig-zagging around seemingly aimless.  We observed the light for several minutes, not less than 5 and not more than 10 perhaps.  There were no flashing lights, and the “object” itself was very faint and difficult to make out and several times we lost it behind a passing cloud only to pick it back up when it emerged on the other side.  My date and I and at least one of her sisters witnessed the same phenomena we did but the light was very faint and I am unsure if everyone present was able to positively see the object.  Several times we saw definite and easily identifiable airplanes and we were certain that it wasn’t one of them, it appeared to be much “higher” and had no flashing or blinking lights and made no sound that we could make out.  At first I took it to possibly be a satellite but I am unaware of any that changed direction like this object did.  At some point it went behind a particularly large cloud and we were unable to see it afterward.  We were all 100% sober and ranged in age between 16-35.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,45.0051,-122.7832

I laid on the couch and decided to watch the video.  What I captured was unbelievable. I recorded a landing of extraterrestrial nature, mind you I did not see this happening while I was recording.  It only showed up in the video. I was stunned at what my camera picked up and began to zoom in and take screenshots of the activity.

I became obsessed and couldn’t stop going deeper. The next day I became very ill and could barely function. I stayed sick for about a week before I started feeling normal again. A couple weeks down the road I felt strange and I had skipped my period. I had not been intimate with anyone for months but felt the need to get a pregnancy test. So I did and it was positive. I started to freak out because there was no way possible and I had no one to confide in. A few days later I ended up having a miscarriage and was devastated as well as relieved.

The sun was just about to set so it was still a light blue and no clouds at all in the sky. We have a nice view of the water and a pretty open view of the sky. We are sitting there when we see this huge glowing light with a blue hue zoom past us at an incredible speed. We were both speechless then I ran inside to tell my parents and they brushed it off like a shooting star. I’ve seen plenty of shooting stars it was way to low and to big and trailed for way to long (until it was out of out sites) to be a shooting star. Even talking about it later we both had the hairs on our neck stand up and both anticipated the sound of a crash but nothing ever happened. My mom has a local business and has a lady she sees regularly that takes phone calls at the police station. A lot of other people saw the same thing. So crazy. I never really thought we were alone but now I’m convinced. I’m glad t! here’s a place people like me can write their stories.,2019-12-01T00:00:00,,

This happened on July 20th, 2019 in West Jordan, UT. I was in my backyard about 7:10 pm, reclining in a lounge chair. I was staring up in the sky thinking of my deceased mom.  I suddenly became aware of a bright light extremely high up in the sky. I could see it was reflecting light but I could tell it was way too high for an airplane, and a helicopter can’t go as high as this was.  I was watching it and realized it wasn’t moving, but just sitting there. Suddenly 3 more lights appeared, moving and took a formation around the first light, to the left. They all sat there for several minutes when they All started moving and changed formation, then sat there several more minutes.  This went on and on, them moving and taking different formations, then sitting, for about 20-25 minutes. Then they all seem to back up and just disappear.  I did get photos of these lights in the sky.  I watched for about another half hour and they never reappeared, so I started to relax and play with my dog.  I kept glancing up, and about the 3rd time I glanced up, I about died of shock. There, right in front of me, flying over the backyard right next to mine (to the east) was two UFOs. They were flying fast, and were perfectly aligned, like a mirror image. They were white, and they were cylindrical shape. They were completely silent, no sound, no vibration.  I could see them perfectly as they were very low. I was just telling myself “Study them, Study them!” There were no windows. They each had an extremely light bright circling around each one of them around their center, and meeting in the middle of the two, which were what looked like a few feet apart from each other.  They glowed exceedingly. They flew over her yard, their roof, and then they were out of my sight. I jumped up and looked for them but they were gone. I didn’t see where they went but I couldn’t see them  anywhere.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,40.60249592476489,-111.97358369905956

(See the Black Star on Annotated Map.) Object was previously obscured by trees, but as her vehicle made the turn around the bend in the road, it came into view.  She had not seen or known about it before getting to that spot.  It was moving slowly in an angle to the right but coming towards her.  It appeared to be moving slow and in her general direction.  The flight path seemed to be more or less level in flight, neither ascending or decending.  When she drove further down the road to where the second marker is on the map, that's when it immediately zipped off to the right and disappeared. (See the Black Star on the Annotated Map.)  It was a very quick maneuver that didn't go up or down from there..just off to the right in her field of view.  The other strange part about this was that when it shot off to the right, i! t seemed to disappear while in full view, just kind of winked out.  There were no trees in the way or anything obscuring the view when that happened.  She slowed down and began trying to see if she could find it again but to no avail.  When she continued down the road to the third marker on the map, she saw a helicopter (marked as a blue star) which she thought might be lifeflight as they fly up from Nashville and often take people to the hospital down there.  It had more than just the white lights so she knew it was something normal. At this point, she was about to tum off of 101st when she called her husband to tell him to check his MADAR unit. The phone call was made at 9:33 pm.  She was only a minute or two away from the house when she made that call.

It was lingering so I looked to my right where neighbors were in their dock to see if they were blowing bubbles but of course it couldn’t have been because the object was definite in its movement and it was literally hovering. I kept looking up at it and then all around me to see if anyone else was out on lake or could see it with me. I kept gasping with both excitement and wonder. I did speak out loud and said what on earth is that? To myself. It then lifted a bit in no apparent rush. It was definitely translucent to silver it turned itself to and then flew away from me and when it was about 200 ft just above my house it disappeared. I immediately called my neighbor ! to see if they had a drone out but they didn’t and it had no lights or wings it was literally a ball. Maybe from that distance the size of a softball not large at all. It was most definitely just hanging out. It was quite close. It was also quite beautiful. That’s why at first I thought it was a bubble with the shimmer and iridescence. I clearly looked all around and into the water to try to make sense of where it had come from. It also was completely silent.,2019-12-01T00:00:00,44.4735,-69.0551

Lasts 4 hours. UO Sighting Thursday Sept 19th 2019 Calling this a “UO” sighting as it I cannot say the object was “flying” and entirely different than any UFO report I have heard about. Left work at 4:00 as usual and came home to change clothes and go for a run down at the ROCORI track as has been my routine for the past number of years. Probably left my house around 4:30 and jogged across the picked oat field and towards the practice fields on the northern part campus. Lots of sports activity this particular day with football games/practices of various-aged kids etc. with a game taking place at the farthest NW field adjacent the ball field and Co Rd #50. At least one bus parked there. Proceeded with my run/workout routine which consists of push-ups, sit-ups, stretching, mixed between a series of laps around the track. 1200M, 1600M, 800M, 400M, 200M, 100M. I always time the runs all but the 100M just in case I happen to run a personal best. The entire routine takes probably a bit less than an hour as I generally always clock 12-13 minutes for both the 1200M & in-between workout as well as the 1600M & in-between workout. This day was perfectly clear with blue sky, hardly a breeze (if any) and zero clouds that I am aware of. At least not a one in the SW-NW horizon that I (and others) were fixated on for the next few hours. In finishing either the 1200M, or 1600M, I laid down on my back in lane #7 at the SW main finish line (as typical) and did my sit-up routine. Upon finishing, while still on my back & head to the North, I noticed a white dot (as it appeared) way up high in the sky which I first figured was a pelican or eagle or seagull as over the years I have seen white birds soaring way, way, up high wile stretching. However this “bird” was not moving much if at all. Again, this is broad daylight, blue sky at 4:30-5:00pm. Definitely the only feature in the sky aside from the sun which was further W of the object. If memory serves the sun was a tad and higher on the horizon than the object from my perspective but not much. As far as how obvious this object was in the sky I would say not obvious at all unless one was looking in the right direction. Who looks up into the skies anymore anyway… As I watched the object on my back it appeared to slowly travel back-&-forth N & S slightly a few times however my heart was pounding from my workout so uncertain if it was due to that. Being utterly baffled as to what it was I laid there longer contemplating it being a drone copter that someone at the school was flying. After a few minutes of ponder I got up to continue my workout and onto more laps hoping like heck the thing would not just disappear leaving me frustrated. On the next set of laps I cannot remember if I was able to focus/see it as I rounded that SW corner but as I finished the laps and again laid down to do sit-ups…it was still there! At some point as I laid there I made a conscious effort to determine it’s location in the sky and definitely remember noting 3. One being directly over me (possibly a tad south). The other being directly above the school. And the last being a bit to the West of the school. Again these are only from my perspective having no clue how high or big this thing was. Following my workout (cannot remember if I finished it all or not being a bit occupied) I noticed 2 young boys (ages 5 & 3 approximately) playing at the south end of the bleachers. I desperately wanted someone else to see this thing so walked over to them asking if they wanted to see an “alien spaceship”. As any boy would they said yes and put their eyes in the direction of the sky I was pointing. I really no idea if they saw what I was seeing but the older boy did say “I see it” and was looking I the right direction. The younger said he saw it too however was looking the wrong way. At this point I was getting desperate to find another adult to confirm this object so headed out the south end of the fencing as it was the only gate open to the track. I kept searching for an adult or older student however nobody happened across my path and I didn’t want to appear too crazy having no shirt on, all sweaty, and pointing to the sky at “aliens”. As I headed back North towards home I came across a bus where the female driver was inside reading a book. I hesitated at first but gingerly peeked in the open door and said…”This is possibly the strangest thing you’ve been asked but I’m seeing something quite odd in the sky and am wondering if you would also take a look to confirm I am not going nuts.” Or a version of it. Her comforting reply was something to the affect of…”My folks live in CA and see weird things in the sky all the time so nothing surprises me”. She put down her book and grabbed her smart phone and struggled her way out of the bus as she had some struggles standing/walking. We walked south through the thin line of trees at the S side of the parking area and as I pointed she immediately saw it and said…”Well that’s weird.” I could not see any movement however the object seemed to be moving slowly from SSW to WSW as I needed to keep looking more West each time I needed to re-find it in the sky. She then put her phone up to either photo or video. It is somewhere around 5:30 now. At this point I was wanting to get home to my son and get his eyes on it as well so jogged back across the oat field, up to the house, into the workshop & grabbed my binoculars which are Bausch & Lomb 7x35 Zephyr. Here is where it gets weird… In my backyard I found the object even further West and should mention it never seemed to change in size, color, brightness, speed, or anything. When I put the binoculars up to it I was quite startled as I can only describe it as a bright, full, Mini-Moon” however was not too convinced of it being the moon as I knew the moon phase was already past full. I then ran upstairs to tell my son to grab his smart phone and come outside where I passed the binoculars over to him. His comment was pretty much same as the bus drivers being…”What the heck is that thing…” No doubt at this time I am ranting about it being a planet of some sort so we both grab our smart devices and start searching for visible planets, stars, etc. He then proceeds to map the thing with his smart phone as he has an ap for stargazing. I found dialogue on it possibly being Jupiter as Juipter is/was bright in Sept. however it kept mentioning we should see it along the horizon at dusk which further confused me as it was no where near dusk when I first saw it and we were still 2+ hours from it. I’m then trying to convince myself it is the moon as it looks exactly like it with gray shaded features and however much smaller and brighter. To describe the brightness I say it looked like a strongly back-lit, semi- opaque, piece of perfectly round, white plastic. Kind of like some of the LED overhead lights we have today however with the moon(ish) gray shadings. With my son’s ap, he finds the moon is on the other side of the globe. He then says…”I’ve got it…It’s Arcturus!” and shows me the screen which I cannot argue with except…There is no way we should be seeing surface features on a star! With my binoculars, any star is going to look like a pinpoint of light…not a moon. As we banter back-&-forth about possibilities and questions he lies on his back in the grass to steady his elbows and snaps a couple photos through one lens of the binoculars. I take some video with my pad as well making certain to video the surroundings to pinpoint the thing at a later date. After approximately 20 minutes of searching internet and looking through binoculars my son gives up and I jump in my vehicle with binoculars and head to a friend’s farm a couple miles away as I had called him to see if he was around and could see what we are seeing. Which he could. On the way I call my wife who is at work and ask her to go outside and look as well which she does with at least one co- worker. As I get to his property he immediately walks over questioning what the heck it is and then I hand him the binoculars as he did not have his own set. More astonishment as he is seeing the same thing in it being moon(ish) however he says the gray markings look like the batman symbol to which I somewhat agreed however more blurry, a tad misshapen, and more squished up in the upper left of the circle. I then proceed to tell him the only thing I can think of is it being Jupiter and read from the dialogue I found on my pad as he is shaking his head knowing the time is not right for viewing it nor is the direction. Our at his farm we had perfect viewing of the object with no obstruction and it is now getting more towards evening so it was even more visible. Again…It is my opinion it never changed size from when I first caught glimpse of it. However it kept moving westward as we were now looking almost due West. As we are studying the thing and coming up with hypothesis, his father and brother drive in and we hand them both the binoculars. His dad finds the object first and comments it could possibly be a space station. I mention something about satellites to which he says they zip across the sky which I then did remember as we saw them often when night fishing for walleyes up in northern MN. This object is no comparison to those. Not even remotely. Everyone goes away shaking their heads in confusion. Chores still needed to be done. I go home to shower and get lunch ready for work on Friday. Friday Sept. 20th I get home from work and walk around the property scanning the horizon South to West to NW and see nothing. I return to look each hour or so and still nothing…At possibly 7:00pm I text my friend asking him “Where did Planet X go!?! and this is his text/reply… 8:01pm I was wondering the same thing!! Do you think it might have been one of those weather monitoring balloons? I watched it until around 8pm last night, and it got really orange/red like the setting sun. My brother ** also saw it turn red and he said that he saw it disappear/burn out/go black. Intriguing none the less!! Saturday Sept. 21st I again went out for my run at the same time however with my father who was visiting for the weekend. I searched the sky a number of times and saw nothing. Sunday Sept 22nd Since I am aware of 8 adults that saw this object my hope is to have them each document what they saw independently. I won’t share this document with them till we have everyone’s, independent, account. May not pursue the bus driver’s account. Time will tell.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,45.4732,-94.4124

I live in kind of a secluded house not like other homes but right next to a community park.  I was laying in bed with my boyfriend when his sister started yelling for help to find her dog.

What I saw was a formation of lights just suddenly appear in a triangular shape (when they appeared they were moving forward) before disappearing quickly (while moving forward).  Honesty I find it hard to explain all together. The only thing I saw were lights but staggered in a triangle shape but a triangle without the bottom line lit up if that makes sense.  There were maybe 9 lights, there was no noise at all. This happened very fast and unfortunately my boyfriend did not see it.  My sisters boyfriends came back from taking her car out to look for her dog and luckily she had the dog.  She said she had found her dog had run pretty far off near the area I had seen this in the sky.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,33.859164858490566,-117.57944646226416

We were approximately 20 min into the drive, when I saw an orangeish amber orb of light coming up fairly quick on the car in the rearview mirror.  I was thinking in my head of what it could be.  There had been no headlights, it was orange or amber colored, and definitely higher than any motorcycle light would be.  So having gone through all my logical thoughts, and run out of ideas, I asked my friend to look behind me, and tell me what that was. She stuck her head between the two front seats, and it came right up to the trunk of my car. It was a little less than a foot in size, and was just a glowing translucent ball of light. Not like a bright light glaring at you, and blinding you or making you see halos. And not a reflection type light, but like an orangy amber orb, colored from the inside. A lot brighter than a lit up balloon would be. For lack of a better descripti! on. Also, we were driving about 60mph, maybe more once it was following us, and it was keeping up with and staying the same exact speed as us, and in the same spot for several seconds. Not like something mechanical that would lose and gain speed to keep up, but right there with us, and almost like checking the car out. Then it moved slowly to the drivers side back window, as if checking that out, and then just as i thought it might come right up to my drivers window, it took off super fast into the field. Just as it did that, a car came around the corner. Almost like it knew the car was coming and took off.  This was in an area where there are no side roads for many many miles, and even had side rails at this spot, so no cars could even pull over. Theres no street lights around, and its complete desert mountains all around. My friend saw it close enough to know it was not a drone, and had no mechanical parts. And i seriously doubt anyone would be out there in the middle of nowhere with hardly any traffic just to pull a prank on some car they will never see again. And im not sure of any technology that is just a ball of light, that can still travel around or be directed. Im an empath, and i felt it had intelligence, and was curious. Our windows were decorated with aliens and ufos for the Alienstock event we had just been at, so maybe it was curious about the windows. It didnt seem dangerous, just curious.  The next day we told many people at the event what had happenned. We had several people tell us about an orange light that came out of the sky, just above one of the stages, and kind of curved upwards before taking off at a high speed. That happened around 11:30pm according to the people, which was close to the same time as my experience. So was it connected? And what kind of orb of light can be seen from such a far distance, and up closer at the same level of light, without getting brighter?  Ive searched online for similar experiences, and only find the sky orbs, but no close up ones like we saw. So I would love to know if others have had similar sightings.  As for our backgrounds, I'm not sure how much, or what you want included in that. We both have average jobs, and normal lives. My friend is native american, and also a bit empathic. Obviously we are interested in the subject, since we were at Alienstock. We also follow paranormal stuff. This was her first sighting. Im of mixed white nationalities with a bit of american indian also, but mostly welsh and irish. I have had many sightings before. I live at the bottom of the Nevada Triangle, in Fresno county, and there are lots of sightings in my area. Although most of my main sightings were in the 80's and 90's, with only one incident of missing time that I know of. Im in my 40's and shes in her 50's.

They were rounding a telecommunications tower off in the distance.  At first I thought it might have been aircraft lining up going towards Logan international airport, but after observing them for sometime the lights were just hanging there not moving, and after several mins they began to move.  I asked several people there that night if that was a normal occurrence.  The two bar tenders and waiting staff replied no, it was the first time they had ever seen something like that.  The lights began to move off in another direction and towards the ground were they were not visible anymore.  If this was a flight pattern for landing air craft there should have been more coming in intervals, but have after these lights were g! one there were no more lights that came.  From my vantage point I believe the lights were near Swampscott, Ma, and the Salem, Ma. Roughly seven mins after being there I took a picture of these lights, and then they began to move, but they were going very slow, not like an ordinary planes flight path that should have looked quicker even at the distance that I was at.

My first thoughts of the night were who exactly gets to occupy which altitudes in the sky? Because I noticed several aircraft in the air that evening, some at extremely high altitudes and others seemingly occupying various other levels of the atmosphere.  One aircraft in particular, that I presume to be of the private variety local to the Virginia Tech airport was flying in unusual patterns with a green, white and red light on it. I had taken the time to watch it carefully because it appeared to be unusual compared to the other aircraft I am accustomed to seeing in the air at night.  Considering I observe a lot of aircraft in the sky, it’s a regular occurrence here in Blacksburg, this particular aircraft was behaving in a way that made me consider the possibility some kind of driver’s education, behind the wheel class was going on? A minute or so would pass as I continued walking down the path and I looked up into the sky again to see the most amazing things.  There were three objects in the sky, one at the 11, 12 and 2 o’clock positions and they appear to be on fire. They were clustered together, seemingly moving independent of one another but the object at the 2 o’clock position moved around freely, very firefly, serpentine like and appeared to change altitudes and directions efficiently. There was a rocket booster looking affect to the objects, but they were clearly emitting some kind of flame.  Unfortunately, I did not have my camera with me but I did sprint in vein in an attempt to get one. By that point, the objects were gone. The airplane I saw moving erratically in the sky no doubt was observing this same behavior and there was an uptick in traffic in my area immediately following the event, so I would have to think it was witnessed by more than just myself on ground level.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,37.25986910569105,-80.42627073170732

My mom could see my face as I thought in my head ""If that thing starts moving, I am OUTTA HERE"" sure enough as my mom turns around slowly in horror it now starts heading our way. recorded a video and dialogue between my mom and I as well as the craft is captured. craft was a compilation of 7 small lights bundled closely together. craft almost 'waited' for my mom to turn around as well before it started its dance. it would quickly maneuver 3 different directions impossibly before going completely invisible and showing up miles or a mile from last seen area. it did this maybe 5 or 6 times IN 5 or 6 seconds. Moved so quickly even my mother kept saying Why?? lights were pink on outside edges with violet or purple for the inside! 5 lights. its movements defied conventional physics, Newtonian forces would have destroyed anything else attempting that.

I explained to my mother that this craft is the united states navy x-37 - using mass reduction drive together with piezoelectric superconducting material (ultrasonic vibrations causing noble gas to ionize) she understandably didn't know what the hell i was talking about. I explained 'Ok, its meant to refill combat planes on the field, needing those movements and maneuvers not just to get around but to evade incoming fire . craft was with us for around 5 minutes now appearing overhead and a mile away in the same second. finally in the video (video shows craft as 1 blurry purple ball) I say 'Oh i think i can hear it, sounds exactly like an airplane' because craft was completely silent the entire time, as i said that i could see a regular commercial airline start to come around from the to! ps of houses. As soon as that happened, this craft became ...e! mbarrass ed? it stopped moving crazy and put itself on a straight trajectory, accelerating instantly but not going too insanely fast it b-lined until it went below horizon. my mother wouldn't go to sleep unless she found something similar online. which she did amazingly, and only based on the movements it was doing in the video were exactly the same speed and velocity as we saw. by 4 am my mother finally went to sleep content with what she saw online and in person that night. still confused, but happy someone else had filmed it.

I then used a set of binoculars, and easily found the the flat topped upside down cone shaped thing.  It had circles on the side that expanded and contracted, all in clear lights.

I did not attempt to take a photo.  Regrettably I do not know why.  I was actually rather mesmerized by this object.  After about 45 minutes, it disappeared. The following morning I asked the ship's captain if they had seen it.  He seemed to know nothing about it, but did seem interested in my account.  He said the ship's drone was not flying and they did not have cameras that film off the back of the ship.  The bridge faces forward which explains why they did not see behind the ship.

I work as an airport firefighter.  My shift starts at 2:00am.  Since, I make this drive in the dark everyday, I'm very familiar with the normal towers, FAA obstruction beacons and such.  On my drive in, near the small town of Crestline, KS.  I looked North and noticed three very bright white lights in a perfect triangle pattern.  They appeared to be hovering in place, possibly as low as 100-200 feet off the ground, but at night it's hard to judge that.  Confused, as I knew there wasn't anything in that area cell-tower wise, my first thought was a possible military helicopter formation with their forward facing landing lights on.  Again, since I work in aviation on the graveyard shift, I'm used to seeing aircraft lighting.  However, these lights didn't have any of the other mandated FAA aircraft lighting.  For example, there were no red beacons, no green and red directional lighting, none of it.  Just three, perfectly still, perfectly symmetrical bright white! lights.  Over the next 15-30 seconds, I had to keep looking back at the road since I was driving 65mph.  Each time I looked away, one of the lights would disappear.  First there was three, then I looked back and there were only two, then one.  Until they were all gone.  Still confused as to what I had seen I was simply looking in the general direction of the now dark space the lights previously occupied, and suddenly I saw a bright blue flash, followed by something streaking to the west as fast as I've ever seen anything move in my life.

On a clear evening, Big Dipper was very clear, my Dad and I were sitting around a campfire. He was sitting next to me and said “look” in a surprised and alarmed voice.  I was looking down but looked up and saw a very huge formation of triangles.   At first it resembled a flock of geese but immediately new that was wrong. It resemble a flock of geese because of it’s  ‘V’ formation and the distance between the triangles was similar to the distance between geese. The size was amazing.  If I extend my arm and extend my hand it nearly took up my entire hand.  There were 5 or 6 triangles on the left part of the ‘V’ and 5 or 6 on the other right hand part.  Over to the right was another ‘V’ shape but further away or at a different angle.  We only saw this object for 2-3 seconds.  It was flying from east to west,  almost directly over our heads..  Each triangle was the same shape and size.  The size of each one is difficult to determine.  I drive to Seattle Tacoma International airport frequently and when I see an airplane in the pattern I put my hand up in front of me to try to gauge the size in comparison.  All the aircraft around Sea Tac appear to be small compared to these triangles.  Both my Dad and I seemed to think the object was very high in the sky.  My estimate is that each triangle was the size of 2-4 large aircraft nose to tail. Each triangle was perpendicular to the earth.  The entire formation moved as one and traveled sideways.  Each triangle appeared to be separate. There was nothing visible that connected them. There was no apparent indication of movement.  There was no sound.  It seemed to move with great speed.  From the time we first spotted it to when it left our field of vision was 3 seconds top.  We could see it getting smaller as it flew towards the Olympic Mountains. We think it flew out of our sight. If so the speed would be incredible.  We regularly see jets flying towards the north end of the mountains on their way to Asia.  We see these aircraft for more than a minute.  Port Orchard is approximately 30 miles from Sea Tac. There were no lights we associate with aviation. The only light was a white-yellowish glow coming from each triangle.  The glow was contained to the middle in a slight oval shape. Some of the light spilled over to reveal straight edges of the triangle. Each of the triangles had the same color and light amount.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,47.512492746113985,-122.61571813471501

When looking up at the sky there was an object that seemed quite large hovering in a small area. There were several lights around the bottom of the object which is how I was able to see it slightly moving in sort of a circle.  I assumed, at first, that it was a plane, but as I stood there it didn't seem to be really going anywhere.  It seemed to be very high up above the clouds, though it still seemed quite large. I decided to try to film what was going on with my phone. It couldn't quite pick up the large object even zoomed in as far as it would go.  It did, though, pick up a strange white light that seemed to just be zipping around the sky around the larger object.  This object moved very quickly in a random pattern back and forth around the larger object.  It seemed to almost disappear for a super brief period and then it would reappear on the other side of the larger object in the blink of an eye. As I said, I did get it on video and have watched it several times and even had my husband and sister watch it and we cannot figure out what could be moving around in such a way.

I often see comets or shooting stars as I sit on a bench on my front porch. Sometimes they are like a thin white streak through the night sky. Sometimes they are closer to earth and are a bright beautiful yellow. I enjoy seeing these, so I will often try to catch them. Last night at 2:19 or so I was sitting and I noticed something above in my peripheral.  I looked up and it is a perfect v flying against the night sky.  Glowing, and I am immediately out of my seat, rationalizing it to myself.  Those are birds. It looks almost like the V birds make but somehow perfect and they are moving totally unlike birds. Nothing is staggered, it's almost like it's coasting.  The light had seemed extremely bright when it was basically over top of me, but once it started to move rapidly away, it began to get slightly dimmer, but I could still easily see it against the night sky. In no time at all the V is getting longer and longer in the distance.  The formation is heading towar! ds town so I can see the shape against the slightly lit up backdrop above the trees and I swear before it dipped below I could see the outline of a ship.  It seemed wide like a saucer but thicker height wise then what I generally think of a saucer.  I have lived here for more than a year.  It is a tourist town on the coast and there is a military base very nearby.  The Eglin Air Force Base. Basically this town is tourists and military members. I have never had an encounter like this before. I was on the phone with a friend of mine just screaming, ""What is that? That is not normal."" Because, it wasn't. Airplanes fly over my all the time.  I am used to the roar at all hours of the night. I have watched from the beach as the air force practiced flying their jets in formation, and my daughter cried because it was literally too loud for her.  I know what ships sound and look like in the sky, but whatever I saw last night was totally silent. No hum to the air. No roar as it passed by.  I was terrified and giddy all at the same time.  I almost started to cry, because in the midst of this thing I did not understand I realized it was sort of a gift.  I am writing this in the hopes that you maybe get something from around this! area last night, that someone else saw something and I am not crazy.  Even if no one else did see though, I never thought I would get to see something like it.  It was a singular experience that was difficult to describe.

At first we thought it was helicopters but soon realized with their movements and colors changing at identical times it could not be a fleet of helicopters.  We passed by them as they hovered above and about 2 minutes later I looked through the rear glass of our vehicle and they had moved into a circular formation.  I had never seen anything like it it my life and wish I had thought to pull out my camera. After scouring the internet trying to find if others had reported the same thing as what we saw I noticed there was a video that was posted this week from some lights off the coast of Wilmington, NC, and I honestly believe these were the same lights that we saw.

At approximately 9:40 pm, I heard the distinctive sound of fighter jets passing overhead. We hear that maybe once a month or so & I often run out back to watch what seem to be F18s or F15s fly by usually n pairs, usually heading roughly south. we live very near Moffett field as well as the San Jose Airport & a small airport for private planes I believe is called ""Reid–Hillview"" for private planes.  The sky is always full of planes, big & small, commercial & military. Google & NASA both have a presence at Moffett. On this occasion is was dark, night time, a not entirely black sky, very polluted with with lights was full of planes as always. 2 Fighters were heading south at a moderate altitude (probably several thousand feet) they had several sets of lights on. In an unusual twist only a few minutes later a second set was heard. I went out back again and watch 2 more fighters streak loudly southward. Both times I called my 8 year old son out to see, the second time I called out the whole family. My wife & daughter, not terribly interested took a long time to come out by which time my son & I had been watching a bizarre, triangle formation of red & only red lights crossing the the entire sky from the Santa Cruz mountains, eventually passing over the TV & radio towers on the peak of the east hills. It took about 2-3 minutes for the formation of objects to cross the entire sky & disappear from view, into the distance. The objects held a distant but incredibly accurate triangle formation. The red lights were not ""blinking"" in a regular pattern, they were alternating in an ever-changing coordinated, often very rapid sequence like no aircraft or group of aircraft that I, personally have ever seen.  There was no discernible repetition or pattern to the blinking.  It seemed coordinated & deliberate almost like Morse Code or music. As the objects passed over the nearby foothills they took a surprisingly long time to disappear into the distance.  To me this was an indication that they were higher & larger than they had initially appeared.  There was no particular sound that seemed associated with these particular objects.  Usually we can associate the many sounds coming from the crowded sky with the objects responsible.  The fighters for example are far louder than anything else ever is. There were a hand full of other odd characters in the sky that night.  Presumably & seemingly conventional aircraft with somewhat odd light patterns, always-on bright white lights, more & brighter lights than the usual commercial or private aircraft seeming to circle around the entirety of the silicon valley for most of an hour before/after the strange triangle passed overhead. My son and I watched this formation from one horizon to the other.  My wife & daughter saw the second half. I didn't go for my camera because I didn't want to miss anything.  Most likely this was a formation of drones or stealth fighters.  The lights were weird to the point that they must have been made deliberately weird.  I wish I had footage so I could try to figure out which symphony or what Morse code message some Goole nerd had probably programmed into the light pattern just to be a smart ass . What ever it was I didn't particularly like it, less for it's weirdness & more for it's condescension.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,37.44014376470588,-121.87126447058824

There were 7 of us on the boat.  We left the sandbars and headed out about 7 miles as the sun was setting, towards a reef sight and known fish haven.  Because of the storms that had passed through earlier, the water was rough, with 3-foot seas, we decided to make a turn South and then head back just after the sun had set.  We were pulling a jet ski so we could only move at around 4-5 mph in fear of snapping the tow line.  As we were approaching the pass between the Anclote Key Preserve and the sandbars, two of the people on the front of the boat started talking about seeing what they thought was a bag or a balloon sitting on the water up ahead and to the right of the boat.  We had no lights, other than standard navigational lights on at the time, however, because of the moisture in the air, the city lights were causing the water to have enough light reflected on it to see ahead in the water.  As we approached the object, the 4 guests on the front of the boat were trying to figure out what it was, going back and forth as to whether it was a big plastic bag, a balloon or maybe even a big bird of some sort.  However, as we got closer is was apparent that the object was bigger than everyone though, probably around 4-5 feet across, cylinder in shape and maybe 4 to 5 feet tall.  As we came to with 100 feet or so of the object, it lifted quickly into the air straight up and hovered at around 8 to 10 feet off the water.  It was a dull color, and you could tell it was solid but had no shininess to it at all.  Everyone on the boat sat in silence and disbelief as we passed by the object to the right of the boat as it just sat there. No sound, no lights - nothing.  Once passed, I turned to everyone and asked, 'Did you all just see that?' and everyone was still looking trying to see it.  I turned! on my flood/spot lights, and turned the boat around because w! e all st ill thought it was something that may have been attached to the water and floating, but none of us seen any sort of cable or string attaching it to anything.  After turning around, and making a couple of passes in the shape of a figure 8, we did not see the object again.

At first i thought perhaps something from Edwards AFB or a plane headed toward Bakersfield airport. it was difficult to judge speed as it was coming mostly diretly toward me.  not knowing its size i could not judge. it then move 90 degrees to the right and at that angle of view i could tell it was going fast . It then went up, down, right .left like no helicopter  or drone or aircraft could maneuver.  As it moved across my field of vision and came closer it could distinguish a white, red, green and blue light on the craft.  No craft I know of is that shape or displays lights in a triangle shape and those colors. the maneuvers were not curves, but abrupt 90 degree angles. it also rose and fell at an am! azing rate of speed.  I got out of bed, watched it from my deck from which i can see many miles. until it  was obscured by trees between me and the craft.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,35.12935471698113,-118.50983018867925

It was a Tuesday night on Oct. 8. The ladies were already in bed for the night and I was out on a 3rd floor hotel balcony overlooking the beach boardwalk. I was drinking bourbon at the time.  It was around 23:00 and as I looks northward up the beach, I noticed Orangish Red lights in the air moving south following the beach. Weather was very cloudy and these lights were below the clouds. There was southward wind around 10 mph. as we were having poor weather last few days.  I first glance I thought all the tourist helicopters were flying down the beach with a landing or spotlight on. I though it was cool, an evening air show of sorts. But then the several lights started dropping other reddish orange lights from the bottom. Just like them but smaller. These lights descended a bit and disappeared. First thought was roman candles or flares.  I then noticed there was no sound coming from the objects. The tourist helicopters were loud, and I should be hearing them, but I wasn’t. As they drew closer. Still dropping their lights. I noticed there was no red or green wing tip lights. Just the reddish glow of the objects themselves. But still no engine noise.  As first one was in front of the hotel and myself, I noticed no white blinking tail light either. Just a spherical light at about a 45-degree angle, below the clouds.  And still no noise. It was at this time I woke my mother to look and see if she was seeing what I was seeing. She started watching the event mid-way through and also wondered what they were and also noticed no sound from them. The objects were still continuing to drop other lights. This entire time. My thinking if these were flares, they would illuminate the ground or water, but didn’t. they just dropped and dissipated. They were dropping light so frequently, there would be three small lights under the main. As the forth light would drop the first would dissipate. After 8 or 10 moved by the last one in the formation which unlike the others, was not dropping lights came by, and as they moved south disappeared into the low clouds. The objects in front were still dropping lights as I could no longer see them but the dropped lights still appeared as they fell below the clouds. This entire event lasted 4 or 5 min.  I still have no clue what I saw. I have considered drones, but cannot explain the dropping of the lights. I have considered candle balloons as they were moving south with a southern wind direction with pieces of the burning materials falling off. But the straight-line formation along with the regularity of the dropping lights discounts that to me. I frequent airshows. I am a fan of military aviation, and I can identify aircraft as I see them fly over. Not being able to explain this is irritating to me. I do not believe in UFOs. I still don’t. However, there is video footage online that is very similar to what I saw. And I finally realized I had a cell phone to record this and I did video the last sphere as it went by. But as I said. It was not dropping lights like the others so I have no proof of that activity.  If I was to describe this in UFO terms. Foo Fighter seems to match.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,33.68315,-78.93953909574468

It lasted only seconds-it appeared then disappeared. October 9, 2019  This morning I was driving to an appointment I had at the VA Hospital in Albuquerque, NM.  My wife and I moved to Albuquerque late last year.  I saw a stationary, very, very bright white light above the Sandia Mountain range at approximately 6:45AM.  It was difficult to look directly at the light.  When I saw the light I was traveling east on the Paseo del Norte (an east west four lane highway).  The light lasted just a few seconds before it ""winked"" out.  I didn't see a tail that one would see if it were a meteor.  I can't say if the light was above the mountain range or east of the range.  At whatever distance it was at it appeared to be the size of a pin head.  I don't know if it was a UFO.   Currently, Albuquerque is celebrating the annual Balloon Fiesta.  The fiesta started last weekend and ends this weekend.  There were balloons in the sky but they were all above the Balloon Park or spread out to the north.  It was no more than 5-15 minutes after the light went out that I saw a helicopter flying south towards the general location of the light.  The helicopter may have turned east, but the distance was too far for me to be sure if it went east or turned west.  By then I was merging onto Interstate 25 going south to the VA hospital.  One thought that occurred to me at the time was that the light I observed was a star becoming a super nova.  A second thought was that it may have been an airplane coming in to land at the Albuquerque airport.  I scratched that idea by the way the light disappeared and its high intensity.  By the way, there were no stars to be seen in this part of the sky as the sun was up on the other side of the mountain range.  I'm sure other people driving east would have seen the same light.  There were hundreds of cars on the road heading to work or the balloon park.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

Right after lighting up At 20:30 we (me and my wife) went for the ""smoke break"" (we're not smoking in house 'cause of kids).

I called out my wife, and we started watching that light.  After few minutes, I grabbed binocular (x30) and tried to watch object via optics, but it wasn't helpful, object still looks like a bright light.  After few minutes we noticed a second light, and little bit later the third.  These lights are slowly floated/moved in the sky. Fortunately, I do have a telescope, cheap one (truly :), this model  https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32968885736.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.f2f34c4dRnKHpZ  However this telescope has good aperture (76 mm).  After few tries I captured one of slowly moving objects by eyepiece (it wasn't easy 'cause of cheap telescope design, and because objects was relatively low).  But it's really hard or even impossible to estimate a real distance to objects, and real altitude. By the way, in the telescope I was able to see object a little bit close.  It looks like it has bright white-yellow light in front (like a lamp or cockpit window or I don't know...), and two small flashing lights on the sides.  These lights was mounted on airship-like dark body (but I'm unsure about shape and size).  I thought it's some kind of drone or quadcopter, but more it looks like mini-airship with mounted lights. All of these objects drifted slowly (but very slowly) or hung in the night sky; after 10 or 15 minutes one object started moving little bit faster and disappeared from sight soon (unfortunately, trees on our backyard are blocking view). Another object appeared after 2 or 3 minutes, and it came not from the ground (like a quadcopter, for example) but afar from the south. Finally, all these objects were darkened and disappeared at about 21:00-21:10. But another similar object was appeared just before I called you, at 21:50 (I went smoke, saw the object - but it was dimmer than before, and decided to call). Periodically I checked sky in that direction but haven't seen anything else. I do not know what it was:  military or private company night tests of drones/airships (flashing lights on the side looks like human made - spaceships/probes don't need small flashing lights at all), but something wasn't right. Who will allow that kind of tests in the highly populated area? Kids are playing or flash-mobbing? According to flight time and luminous intensity, it's not a regular retail quadcopters with LED flashlight attached. I don't know.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,42.388354336283186,-71.24498194690266

I could only see it that time because the sun was glinting of its metallic body.  That one was huge and its shape was very distinct.

Unknown aircraft nav-anticollision light configuration.,Ponce de Leon,FL,2019-10-11T19:30:00,unknown,<2 minutes,"Occurred : 10/11/2019 19:30  (Entered as : 10/11/19 19:30) Reported: 11/4/2019 3:36:19 PM 15:36 Posted: 12/1/2019 Location: Ponce de Leon, FL Shape: Unknown Duration:<2 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/150/S150407.html,"Unknown aircraft nav-anticollision light configuration. I was looking out my back door window at the stars about 7:30 tonight. The sky was clear and moonless.  I noticed a bright white light in the sky moving toward me from the south (from the direction of Eglin AFB). At first, I thought it might be a satellite, then I decided it was more likely an aircraft landing light and walked outside to get a better look.  There are no airports close enough to my location that at pilot would find it necessary to turn on a landing light, so I’m thinking that maybe the pilot forgot to turn it off after takeoff. As is typical when seeing an aircraft approaching with the landing light on, the brightness of the white light overpowers the marker lights, with the exception of the strobes, but I didn't see any strobes or beacons, just the brilliant white light. I estimated the altitude to be between 5 & 10 thousand feet, traveling 200 knots or less as it passed by a couple of miles or less west of my observation point.  My property is surrounded by trees 50 feet or higher, so, from my vantage point, my viewing angle of the craft was about 45 degrees, well above the tree tops. Unfortunately, my place is too close to I-10 and it was abnormally noisy tonight, so I was unable to hear the aircraft.  But judging from the ambient noise level, I'd guess it wasn't prop driven.  I could have heard a helicopter, and I think I could have heard props as well, but those new jet turbofan engines are really quiet, especially at the slower speed the aircraft was traveling. The first thing that struck me as odd as it grew closer and was positioned adjacent to me - the intensity of the bright white light remained the same, and did so until it went out of my sight continuing on its flight path northward. Obviously not a landing light.  At least, I've never seen an omnidirectional, steady-burning bright white light on an aircraft.  But it was close enough as it flew past that I could see four red lights well forward of the bright white light. Assuming an FAA standard aircraft navigation and anticollision light configuration, I should have been able to see a green marker light on the starboard (right) side of the aircraft, and either a white wingtip strobe, or a red or white strobe or flashing beacon on the lower fuselage, and a red or white strobe or flashing beacon on the upper fuselage or on the tip of the vertical stabilizer.  There also should have been a smaller, white tail light as well.  I should not have been able to see the solid red light, which is supposed to be displayed on the port (left) side of the aircraft. I didn’t see any beacons or strobes, red or white.  However, I saw a steady-burning red light out in front (what I assumed was the tip of the nose of the aircraft), and three steady-burning red lights behind the forward red light. In the 60+ years that I have been aware of, and fascinated by, aircraft, I've never encountered a light configuration like this on an aircraft.  And considering the non-standard light configuration, I was unable to determine the shape of the aircraft. I’ve been a private pilot since 1982, I was an avionics tech in the USAF for six years, a field engineer with a defense contractor on the USAF/Navy air combat training (ACMI/TACTS) ranges for nine years, and a Nav/Com/Weather technician for the FAA for 25 years.

It's been between 8-9 o'clock central time every night. It looks like a star at first but if you look at it for any period of time you can see flashing changing swirling colors (red,blue,white from a distance). There's no discernible shape. It hovers and moves almost imperceptibly over the city for about an hour until it's finally out of view.    I don't have a great camera on my phone (same for hubby), but we have a telescope so we checked it out. He was able to get a good view of it in the telescope and he freaked out a little which is extremely out of character. He's skeptical of everything but this thing shook him up. He said it looked like images and colors imploding (swirling like worms) into eachother. I have 3 videos and 2 pictures from night 3, not great quality but who knows what cleaning it up might do. I didnt notice until I watched the videos this morning but when it is over a building with a large light, the light gets very very bright suddenly and stays that way for several seconds.     On the second night, a helicopter circled it and flew away. I could see the helicopter directly behind it, just for some spacial perspective. The flashing thing is completely silent, the helicopter sounded like a helicopter. It's doesn't look huge but it's visible from miles away. If it's a drone it's like nothing I've ever seen.     I noticed in the pictures to the upper left of the main (orb) object of focus are 3 round lights that first form a triangle and in the next picture are in a straight line.

I turned to look but couldn't because what ever it is was in the direction of the sun. so i resided to take a couple of pictures in the direction of the sun, planning to look at them when it crossed my mind again. The following day i did just that and sure as a turd is brown there is something there. Now im not talking about something obscure or difficult to make out, its there, plain as day. The half dozen people ive had look at this are very quickly astounded by it because its simply not what myself or anyone else was expecting to see. I cant state that it's a ship or even something that is mobile in any respect. It's a series of circles, one inside the other from larger tom smaller. its definitely not a cloud and its material or structure is very uncertain. I guess im just hoping others will see this and ! who knows may know some thing. Have you ever read the book of Enoch? well in that book Enoch is speaking to an Angel, i think Gabriel. Any way Enoch asked this Angel what was it he was looking at that appeared like some type of Spiral something. The Angel replied, this is how we travel from place to place.

As our house is situated on a Western downhill slope facing the Puget Sound the objects seemed to rise into view from the North and proceed in a relatively quick manner to the South. The objects made no sound that could be discerned from our location.  As the objects proceeded South, they would eventually dim and disappear. It was a quiet evening with clear skies with a high ceiling.  Where we live is near Joint Base Lewis McChord and we are very familiar with the various aircraft that fly in the area skies and the sounds associated with the aircraft used by the base.  These objects were not rotary or fixed wing aircraft using the regular flight paths as when they do there IS a discernable sound that can be heard for many miles. If the objects were a considerable distance away then their transit from North to South was pretty rapid and their disappearance was as though they went into a cloud bank however, after discussing the disappearance with my wife, we both agreed that they faded and blinked out. This event lasted for about 10-12 minutes and consisted of approximately 25, to as high as 30 objects. I took two still photographs and nearly three minutes of video of the event.  I thought that I had captured more of the event unfortunately, when I switched from camera to video, I neglected to start the recording. I am a retired Firefighter/Paramedic and very used to seeing unusual things, events or situations and accurately documenting my observations.  This is a first for my wife and me.

As I was opening the gates to the parking lots I noticed a bright light in the east. In that general direction there is a hospital with a helicopter pad and I could hear helicopter noise so I assumed it was that. The light seemed very bright so I continued to watch it for a minute or two. At that point the helicopter at the hospital took off and broke the tree line. So I know it was not a helicopter at that point. After the noise drowned off the light continued to just sit in its position and I began walking towards the guard shack to get my phone. As I started to move I could see the one light starting to break in 4 lights. It wasn’t until it was extremely close that I realized it was a shape of a black triangle. With one light at the point, one light in the back middle, and one light left and right from the back middle light in each direction. It was roughly 2000’ off the ground (I used an altitude comparison sheet I! found online because it was very low to make absolutely 0 noise.). It was also going rough 100 mph, I state that liberally because I feel if you could drive a car in a straight line next to it you could easily keep up at 60-70 mph. It had no blinking marker lights to indicate wings or a tail. It did had a singular strobing light underneath that was only visible when it was directly over head. In 2000 there was a black triangle sighting in this town that was chased by three different police departments towards saint Louis, MO before they lost sight of it. There is also an Air Force base within 30 miles from where I worked so I thought maybe it was a plane heading there which might explain the no markers, but I don’t think it would explain the lack of sound and very slow speeds.. it was coming from the east moving west, slightly north away from the Air Force base as it left my sight of view",2019-12-01T00:00:00,38.7665,-89.6533

I happened to look up at a fast moving cone shaped object descending rapidly out of a low hanging cloud. The sky was blocked out by these low clouds. The sun either had already set or was blocked out by these grey low hanging clouds. There was approximately 35% ambient light remaining at the moment of the sighting. The clouds were at 1500 ft and broken. Some clouds were higher some lower but blocking out the evening sky. This object as I said dropped rapidly to approximately 500 ft elevation. It hovered there for 3 seconds then, It flew rapidly to the right, stopped after traveling about 30 degrees across a 180 degree field of view. After traveling quickly across that distance it stopped abruptly, held position for 3 seconds and reversed direction. It flew back in the direction from which it came as it gained altitude. It made several quick upward maneuvers as it traveled never changing shape as an aircraft would as it would turn to, or away from you as it m! aneuvered. It then stopped abruptly again. Hovered for an instant then it moved back to the right, as it very rapidly descended downward out of my field of view. It never reappeared in 5 minutes as I continued to scan the evening sky. I happened to be walking my dog and my dog alerted me to it, which began my sighting. My dog was frightened by the sight and she immediately turned around and headed back to the house we had come from 30 seconds before. It made a very faint humming sound as it maneuvered. It was cone shaped and seemed as though a bright whitish green light was suspended below the cone. It had what appeared to be a bright white light at the apex of the cone.

There was an instance where a plane or jet flew over the object and it then began to rapidly change colors. I also noticed the light rotate to a point where I was able to make out a bit of a shape. I saw a triangle, though my perception honestly could have been off. I took some video with my phone. This was a particularly starry night. I didn't think I'd be able to catch anything since normally my iPhone can't pick-up the stars at night as the camera is only so good. It did catch this light though and the movements I was catching was truly extraordinary. It was blinking/flashing and moving at speeds/in directions I've never seen any norma! l aircraft moved. It almost looked like something you would see in a video game/computer. Almost like a mouse cursor moving. The main light we saw was to the southwest. At some point while I was recording this light, my fiance alerted me to another UFO just to the Southeast at a bit of a higher elevation. This light was a bit more stationary, but had many similarities to the light I was recording. After we had gone back inside, about an hour later at 2:30 AM, my fiance called me into the kitchen to show me another light to the northeast of our house.

No thunder but I think lightning hit my house!!! it happened a total of 3 x i was looking out the window, and i couldnt see what flashed it would just flash no thunder I think the circuit thing must be right under my window and it was making loud bangs and flashing Right before too, I heard knocking in my dream like 10 mins ago and it woke me up and its super windy and storming really hard, and then this happened  (P.S. I checked, there is nothing but wall under my window. No circuitry or anything that could've caused the flashing and banging.

On October 17 around 8:30-9:00 at night, me and four other friends of mine took a walk. While we were walking we decided to go on a bridge (can be found on google maps at E 67 Street Raytown Mo) that was nestled next to a brewery and was right above a fairly busy road. It was pretty normal until one of my friends thought that they saw something in the sky. They described it as a disc like object that had lights on it that flashed from red to green very quickly. This was not an airplane as it was not in the flight pattern and the red light on a plane is always on and never flashes. We all figured that they were just scaring themselves and ignored it. Then I saw a flashing light in the sky that was also going from red to green but it was to far up to see any outline, before I even said anything about it my second friend of the other 4 saw it with me. We both, almost  simultaneously, said “What is that!?” Of course everyone’s instinct was to look up at it. Including me and my friend that saw it, 4/5 of us saw the light. The light continued to flicker until it eventually disappeared. I was thoroughly freaked out and was ready to leave but everyone else was fine so we stayed. Then the same friend that saw it with me and another one (now all of us except one had seen the lights) saw it twice. The first time they saw it it was for a split second and they were the only ones but the second time everyone saw it besides me. At this point we all had seen it and now we wanted to get to the bottom of it. We all went through the possibilities. It couldn’t have been a drone because they are loud and can’t legally go over 500 feet here. It couldn’t have been a plane because it wasn’t in any flight pattern and had the incorrect lighting. It could’ve been military equipment because there is a military base around here (this cannot be found on google maps) but it is scary nonetheless. I then started stalking the sky in search for something else and we all saw it two more times where the same thing happened. I then noticed here that the lights have a “V” shape so them with duller reds flashing with no green with the main light. Then upon more stalking me and one other friend saw two “stars” in a perfect line to each other moving along the sky slowly until we decided to look away and lose track of it. All five of us saw the same thing over and over again on that bridge and it was not anything I can really rationalize with.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,,

Not sure of distance as I was unable to determine the distance to the object but I believe it was under 1 km and the height was similar. Was reaching behind me for a set of binoculars I had in a backpack when the object blinked out. I looked around to see if anyone in the vicinity had observed the object but it was obvious I was only person that happened to have been looking at that section of the sky in time to see the object and to be looking at it when it disappeared. Scanned the same section of sky for around 15 minutes but object never reappeared.,2019-12-01T00:00:00,,

As we sat there we noticed something moving in the sky.  The object, about the size of a small star, would move from one spot to one another and stay still almost blending in with the stars.  Also, I saw once that very dim light from the object would be reflecting onto the clouds as it flew.  It would disappear behind the clouds as well.  When it would move It moved at about the speed of an airplane.  It even did some circular loop movements up and down that were way too fast to be a plane.  It would stop completely still and I would put my two fingers in between it to make sure I was actually seeing what I was seeing and sure enough it would move to another spot.  It would sit still for a few minutes and then move to another spot and sit still like a star.  At one point we thought we saw multiple lights mov! ing in a similar fashion but we tossed that up to us hyping it up.

I immediately thought it was wierd bc it was not moving and atill changing form.  I watched it for a few minutes before it’s shaped turned more circular -and moving lights.  Rapidly moving lights. The object in the sky did not move and was flashing all kinds of lights - purple blue green red white - I decided it was bizarre enough (now with no planes landing AT ALL -usually one lands ever few minutes)  To run inside and grab the binoculars.  I have a pretty decent pair and what I was able to see was a small circular shape with crazy lights flashing furiously.  I took a few videos as well. Upon gazing at the sky some more -it appeared there were 6 other mysterious crafts around the eastern skies - these ones were not flashing colors and not nearly as low as the other craft.,2019-12-01T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

In observing this for some time, I realized there was a dimmer smaller star by it and I have concluded that this bigger brighter star was connected to the smaller star, making it look like it would be a long pencil like shape, I am calling the Bigger star the head and the smaller dimmer star the end. They move together and the head will move in different directions as the end stays in place. The head also looks like it extends it's neck to move around like an insect would feeding on something or building something due staying in the same sky area spot it had been in. They look like stars. I saw another single star move across the sky and disappear by the fi! rst entity. This was looking above my backyard to the South in NE Ohio. There were no blinking lights.

I was driving my husband to his appointment around 11:25 am today.  As I was stopping at the traffic light on Alicante Road facing North, I saw a very unusual looking object in the North sky, in the direction right behind the traffic light.  The object looked like a formation of four or five shiny light, almost like a gigantic drone look.  I saw it flying or hovering in the direction of North sky for a couple of second.  Then it disappeared for a few second.  Then it re appeared for another couple of second.  Then disappeared once again.  I had to drive away after the signal turned green, so I don't know if it kept flying over the sky after this. I asked my husband to take a picture of it with his phone while this happened.  But he was not looking at the same direction as I was, so he was not able to take a picture.  He did not see it. I don't think it was a drone because of the size and very random place and time.  If it was a drone flying near the traffic light, I should be able to see as a drone.  This was flying far and high.  It was not a regular airplane nor helicopter I see everyday.

Good evening around 1845 on Thursday Oct 24 2019 my wife and I were driving Northbound toward Los Angeles on the 405. As we were passing through the town of Anaheim we noticed a unusual egg/oval shaped object that appeared to be floating then suddenly moving downward and upward erratically. I quickly pulled out my phone to try and capture what we were both witnessing. What we were seeing was approximately 100 yards off the highway and seemed to be above a parking garage by the looks of it. The color of the craft was grey in color with some shimmery texture to it. It appeared to be maybe 10-15 feet in height but was hard to tell as we were driving and it was moving frantically. I looked online on multiple sights and asked on multiple social media sites to see if anyone else that was around witnessed the same thing. I was able to get a decent 20-25 second video of the craft which I will attach. The first thing I thought of when I saw this was that it’s a big balloon that usually car dealers put on the cars if they are having a big sale of some sort. But after getting closer and than witnessing the object quickly come down then go back up I realized it couldn’t be a balloon cause they do not move that erratic or suddenly. Also there was no strings or anything attached to this thing. What I could tell this object was approximately 75-100 feet in the air. A little background on myself, I have noticed unusual objects flying since moving out here in California 4 years ago.  I’m 28 years old and am a Marine Corps OEF combat veteran.  Served just over 5 years before coming out here.  After that I worked for the government as a contractor and was around aviation heavily so I have a strong deep understanding and knowledge of aviation and in general flying.  This sighting was for sure a bit off and it wasn't anything iv seen nor know of that would be able to maneuver the way this thing did. Hope this was detailed enough and I was able to shed some light on the issue.  Stay vigilant.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,33.83243273727648,-117.89132517193949

For the record, my family and I just saw something extraordinary in the Southern California skies. We all had the same reaction— it was not normal. It was unidentified and it was flying. This occurred at roughly 19:30 pm on Friday, Oct 24, 2019. Sitting on our deck outside our West Hollywood townhouse, I looked up and saw what looked like two planets, close together.  I had never seen anything like this-- two planets, alone in the night sky in close proximity.  This was looking toward the south east. I thought it was a unique configuration of, perhaps, Mars and Venus.  I know very little about astronomy, but I knew this was unique. Very few stars were visible, largely because of urban lights.  But these two objects were piercing and bright, like a planet amid stars. I alerted this site to my wife ((wife's name deleted)) and sister ((sister's name deleted)). They saw the “planets.” As we watched, the ""planets"" suddenly began to disappear, or retreat. Specifically, the planet on the right side of the tight configuration began to fade first. Then the second “planet” to the left began to fade. They lost brightness in a thirty second to one minute span, disappearing into the sky in what seemed to be away in a direct line from our position toward outer space. We do not know if the objects were within the atmosphere or outside of it. I would say these very bright objects were roughly 45 degrees above the horizon in a direction from Holloway Drive in West Hollywood house toward the sky above Long Beach or thereabouts. This is a layman’s way of describing a direction that might be much different. We are a mentally stable family. We (three of us) are all certain we saw something extraordinary tonight. I hope others saw something similar and can corroborate our sighting. I have never seen anything like this, nor reported anything like this to any official or unofficial organization. We will never forget what happened a little more than an hour ago. Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) 310-((number deleted))",2019-12-01T00:00:00,34.0943,-118.3811

The craft began blinking red on the border of it (kinda like a plane would), but it was random when it would blink and there was absolutely no way to see an actual shape of the craft. The craft flew right over the road above us, keeping speed with us, and then began crossing back left over the road. I started flashing my high-beams repeatedly to signal the UFO that I see it and, in my mind, it was a friendly gesture like saying hello. I wasn’t sure if the craft even saw me as it kept flying left, but then we ! noticed it flies up to a group of 4 more of them! Two were glowing orange and the others were already  darkened and blinking. They were flying around  each other in like a tornado formation and kinda looked like they were just having fun. I kept flashing my lights as I was getting further away in hopes they’d follow me. It worked actually! Well, only two crafts that I could see actually followed me, but for an hour they stayed with me the entire drive to Prescott. I kept flashing my lights to make sure they didn’t lose me and to show I didn’t forget about them. It was kinda creepy that they actually did follow us all the way to our apartment because I really didn’t think that was gonna happen when I initially flashed them, but once we got inside our home for like 10 min and then came back out they were gone.

They all looked see through and like large circles of clouds or white smoke as if they were possibly trying to cloak within the clouds. They literally appeared to be large cloud like circles moving different directions and quickly...we saw about 8 total over 30 minutes. I absolutely believe this to be a UFO and a very strange one at that. They almost looked more organic in nature than like a metal made machine. No lights were seen on or around th! em...they were more just translucent. Three people in my family also saw these and agree they were not only incredibly strange but not of this earth.  This occurred within the city of Tulsa Oklahoma.  I did see a older video post on the UK Mirror that looked very much like the craft saw.

Monday October 28th, myself, my husband and my daughter witnessed odd crafts over the Seneca River.  We were in town at the local laundry mat and the clothes were in the dryer so my daughter and myself decided to go outside for a walk.  We walked down to the Seneca River and were walking eastward when we noticed a strange light flashing over the river to the SE. It was obvious this was something odd, it was stationary, but not, it would stay in one place until it jumped up or down or left or right, but we did not see it move, this may sound absurd but it was as if it was teleporting.  As we watched the light, another one appeared ( simply appeared in our field of vision, it did not fly in) to the south of the first.  They moved towards each other, the flashing intensified as if they were fire flies communicating, they passed each other, one over the other and then one lowered and one rose and they just sat there parallel to each other flashing.  We just stood there and watched, trying to wrap our heads around what we were seeing. Appx. 15 minutes or so into the event we noticed another light rising out of the trees on the far side of the river, it rose straight up, as it rose there was a steady bright light on the underside of the craft that illuminated the trees.  It climbed to a height slightly lower than the other two and proceeded in a southerly direction, it stopped and hovered to the south of the other two crafts. The third craft suddenly light up so bright it looked like another moon, or a streetlight, it was just the white light, very bright, for about 10 seconds before it proceeded back to the north gaining altitude as it went, at a faster pace and we lost sight of it.  The first two started drifting apart, seeming to teleport here and there as they went. As we watched them a fourth craft came in from the north, this one was larger, in fact I thought it was a plane at first until it joined the other two and dropped down below the tree line.  The fourth craft had the single bright light on the bottom that illuminated the trees and reflected off the river as it dropped in altitude, however it was a longer shape and had a third light on the rear that was a blueish color along with the flashing red and white lights on the front.  It lowered until we thought for sure it would land but then it took off at a high rate of speed slightly above the tree tops heading in an easterly direction. None of the crafts made any sound, the flashing lights varied, and seemed to react to on another.  Eventually the first craft just disappeared, the second remained, flashing and slowly moving around the area.  Finally my daughter and I broke away from the sight to go and get my husband.  We brought him out and the single craft was still there, he did not recognize it either.  He is a very skeptical person, I have never seen him unable to explain a light in the sky. Eventually after nearly an hour of observing these lights, it proceeded to go up and to the north and we lost sight of it.  I am 37 years old, a mother of three, and work from home as an artist.

I was in my way in to work, it was around 6:15 in the morning and very dark.  When I drive in, I leave my house and drive up a very big hill, so if it happens to be light out, I can see a pretty good view of the country side.  It was dark, so all I can see are lights and what is in front of me.  I saw an insanely bright light several miles away.  I was thinking it was a planet at first because it did look likt it was up in the sky, but due to it being dark, it was hard to tell with landscape elevations - so I was excited to see what it was as I knew my drive in to work would bring me closer to it since it was in the direction I was headed. I could see the light the majority of my drive (again, incredibly bright) and it never seemed to move, which led me to believe again it was likely a bright star or planet.  As I drove closer to it, I could see that there was more than one light, but one for certain was very bright - there were 3 other lights on it, one was red ! and I believe I saw a blue light.  The object was hovering above a farm on the road I turn on to.  I would have to compare its hovering height to two tall grain silos length - in other words, it was low for the type of flying object it was.  I ended up turning on to a side road near the farm it was hovering above to get a closer look.  The object was big, in my opinion I would think it would fit a 10x10ft room or bigger, and looked like it had 4 points from the shape I could see in the dark, the way the lights on it were laid out.  I turned off my radio and rolled down my window and did not hear any sound even being in the country. At first I thought it was a drone, but then thought to myself that that seemed incredibly big for a drone, and wondered why it would be out in the dark. I parked my car and the object immediately started flying away, towards the direction I originally came from. I took a picture of it, from the view of it flying away from me (it didn't turn out too gr! eat). When it flew away, the pace was relatively slow. I decid! ed to fo llow it because I really couldn't believe what I was seeing. I followed it for 2-3 miles and then saw another object of the same description that it was flying towards. I saw lights on the second object, but it didn't have as bright of a light as the first one I saw. The objects got higher in the sky but seemed to hover around the same area while increasing its height in the air. The original one I saw started flying back towards where I originally saw it, and the second object flew the opposite way. At this point, they were both pretty high up where they could have been mistaken with a plane if a person happened to look up in the sky. I turned back around to go towards my work destination, still following object 1's direction, but it was moving very fast. For another 10 minutes of my ride to work, I could see the blinking lights in the distance. I eventually had to turn the opposite way of where it was, so I no longer was viewing it. I would say it was 5-7 miles from me by ! the time I had to turn off, which also made me wonder if a drone had the capability to travel that far from its starting point. I am not the type of person to care about this type of stuff, and I'm sure there is a good possibility it was a drone, but it was pretty unreal to see.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,43.2407,-89.5098

It was moving very fast compared to several other airplanes I also saw coming in or taking off from McCarran Airport.  It was almost teardrop in shape and left a vapor trail of some sort.  In 5 seconds or so the light was gone.  My first thought on this was:  That almost looks like a shooting star but way too big.  Here in Las Vegas the stars are hard to see at night because of the “light pollution”.  I have seen actual shooting stars and of course they look very small but flash only briefly before they vanish.  I jumped on the computer and this site to see if anyone has reported it yet or seen anything here in Henderson, NV.  So far nothing has been reported.  As far as the description of the aircraft I saw, it was almost teardrop in shape, almost shiny and very bright.  In comparison to the other aircraft in the air at the time it had no lights of any kind.  Our airplanes of course have red, white, and green landing lights.  This aircraft did not. I only saw it for approximately 5 seconds kind of like the duration of a shooting star.  Then the whole thing vanished.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,36.026650762829405,-115.0438399445215

I want to start by saying that I tried every way I could think of to explain this away but I could not!  What I saw was real I am still not sure what it was but I know it was real.  I have a background in Medicine and business management.  So I deal in facts and figures and I have done this for the last 30 years.  I am not prone to exaggeration as anyone who knows me can tell you .  On the evening of November 2, 2019 around 7 pm a friend of mine and my 7 year old granddaughter were coming home from having dinner out.  As we came down our subdivision hill we saw a big light in the distance.  My friend and I both said what is that?  My friend said it looks like someone’s large outdoor light.  As we got closer I said is that it?  It looks like a really low star.  It started to move toward us very slowly and as it moved the one big light separated into two lights that stayed very close together but kept coming toward us very slowly.  We rolled down the windows to see if it was a plane or a helicopter by chance but it was total silence.  This was the oddest thing to comprehend.   My granddaughter by this time was very scared and started crying for us to move before the police came she thought we were doing something wrong sitting in the road.   She could not understand what was happening.  I put my head out the window to see if I could see it better it was so low it almost touched the trees.  It was a large black triangle shape behind the large lights in the front.  It could not have been a plane it was going to slow and it did not make a sound.  We watched it as it moved slowly toward the trees. As I was driving we could see it in the distance through the trees it seemed to hoover then headed toward the ridge line in the area where we live and then disappeared.  It could have dropped further down in the tree line or was just out of our sight.  I could not really comment on what it did in that area I do not know.  Later that night around 9:30 pm I took my dog out as I usually do, in the distance toward the ridge line above the area where I live there was a smoky looking cloud.  Since it was a clear night I thought that was odd to be there.  Then in the smoky cloud red lights started flashing as if sparklers were going off.  This is the same area that the larger object was heading toward when it disappeared from our sight.  I came inside and told my friend to look out her bedroom window could she see what I was seeing and she did.  This is when we started looking on the internet to see if anyone else that night had seen what we saw.  We could not find anything about it.  The next day Sunday 11-03-2019 I called the local police department to see if anyone had reported anything strange in the sky the night before but no one had reported anything.  I don’t know what we saw but I do know it was not a plane or helicopter.  My daughter said it could be a stealth plane but after research it did not look exactly like one.  I also did not see that a stealth could separate it lights as this object did nor would a stealth have any reason to be in our area.  If anyone has an explanation for this I would appreciate knowing as I have been going back and forth about what I really have seen.  It is hard to comprehend.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,36.50270386100386,-82.5479583011583

This sighting happened when I was a young boy and my family were living on a 200 acre farm outside Sylvia, Tennessee. I was about 11. My younger brother was the second witness – he was a year younger than me. The memory of this is still very distinct in my mind. I have always had a good memory and have been of a relatively scientific bent (Ph.D. in Chemistry). I have never witnessed anything even remotely like this before or after this one event, but the one event stands out as very real (not dream-like).  In my family's two story farmhouse, my brother and I slept in one ground floor bedroom, and my parents slept in the next room over. Both bedrooms had a window looking out to the east, where there was our gravel driveway, an area of grass/weeds about 10 – 15 feet wide, then a barbed wire fence and (at the time of this sighting) a field of sorghum. It was late summer, and the sorghum was nearly ripe, with big seed heads. I'm sure we had the windows open, because we had no active cooling.  One night I woke up and, glancing out the window, saw a saucer-shaped object hovering silently and motionless over the sorghum field, not too far out past the fence. I estimate it was 20 – 30 feet across, a classic “flying saucer” shape with a dome in the upper middle. It was about 20 feet off the ground, very visible, very solid-looking. There was some considerable moonlight, and I remember the object reflecting a good bit of light, so it had a fairly smooth, polished surface. Being a chemist, later in my life I had the opportunity to observe a lot of different materials, and the closest to the object's appearance that I have seen is the metal platinum. The object definitely looked metallic.  Needless to say, I was amazed. I woke my younger brother, and we both watched the object for a minute or two. The object did nothing. It did not move, was rock-steady, and we heard no sounds. My brother and I were starting to get a little spooked, and we went to get my mother and father up. By the time we had gotten them awake and looking out the window, the object was gone. My parents thought we had been dreaming or the like, reassured us, and put us back to bed. They probably thought we had talked ourselves into seeing it, or some such. But both my brother and I, discussing the event many years later, both strongly agreed that we had seen a real, very solid-looking metallic object that night.",,,

I was only 5 years old when these events happened, but my memory is very strong and probably the reason I am the only person who remembers the encounter. Most of these events were blocked from me until I watched a TV program that showed a book with illustrations of aliens and alien ship types.  When I saw the ship I had been taken aboard, my memories suddenly came back.  I was 13 years old when my memory resurfaced, and I will explain what happen that led to my amnesia of these events until that time. In the summer of 1978, my older sister and I went outside to play.  We lived on Mountain Home AFB in Idaho in family housing just across the field from the Elementary School. The field and the school can still be seen to this day.  My older sister and I had been having odd dreams and even sleep walking. One night my sister was found outside in the middle of the field in pitch darkness having apparently slept walked.  At the same time, I was having nose bleeds that could not be explained.  I believe we were being abducted and programmed for a particular event although I have only one memory of trying to get away from a small odd creature that looked like a little monster in a Catholic nun costume.  So, probably we were taken aboard the ship several times, but I have only been able to recall the one encounter. Well, in the summer of 1978, for some unknown reason my older sister and I were drawn to the large field between the housing and the school on the AFB. Here we joined several! other children all grouped together in pairs of one female and one male. We formed a circle and then backed up keeping out circular formation. An alien spacecraft then suddenly appeared and hovered above us. It had a saucer section at top and then a longer section that dropped down with another small saucer-like section below. The long part was constantly rotating while the top saucer section did not move. There was a beam of blue light and then my sister and I were suddenly aboard the ship in a hallway. I saw something on the wall that looked like a ship with a highlighted area and the word, “The Bridge,” suddenly entered my mind as if the sign spoke to me. In the hallway were two bed that look like the kind found on Ambulances. My sister was on my left and were behind the beds facing a wall and a doorway entrance to another room. To the left of the door was a young female who looked to have very sparse long hair and was dressed in a nurse’s outfit, but probably was only ! 14 to 18 years old. She was taller than both of us, but not as! tall as my mom who is 5’5”. To her left or moving to our right was the opening to the door and sitting on a swivel chair playing with a computer panel of some kind with many switches was a bald male who looked similar to the female. Both had human-like qualities but were not human. To the left of the opening and moving farther to our right were two humans. Both were USAF military and had the American Flag clearly displayed on their uniforms. One seemed to be of very high rank, as he had decoration on his left side pocket. Both were high ranking and apparently were medical doctors. There was a hall to our left and two hallways that broke off to our right with a flat wall with the sign in the center. The female nurse seemed to use Telepathy to communicate. My older sister whispered to me that she had very thin hair. The female nurse became upset and was crying to the other aliens using telepathy that the children thought she was ugly because of here sparse hair. My older sister and I could hear her in our minds too and we immediately consoled her and told her she was beautiful. The two military men were of different sizes. One had brown hair and was short and the other, the higher ranking officer, had blond hair and was much taller. The brown hair man asked us if we knew why we were here. Without thinking, my older sister and I blurred out to play with the children. We said it in unisons. This answer disturbed the brown haired man and he turned to the blond hair man for reassurance. The taller man nodded and the brown hair man said he had to give us a physical before we could play with the children to make sure we did not have measles or any other diseases we could give ! to them. At that moment several tiny aliens entered the room. I could barely reach the doorknob and these aliens were about half my height. They probably were not even two feet tall. I felt their fingers for a few second and suddenly we were all dressed in medical gowns. The doctors were dressed in medical robes and we had patient medical gowns. I hopped on the bed and the brown hair doctor did a quick physical on me while the blond doctor checked my sister. He then slapped me on the leg playfully and said I was healthy and fit to visit the children. At that moment a very large alien entered the room with a huge smile on his face. He was over two meters tall and towered above the tall doctor who was probably more than six feet tall. The alien had a very long neck and big black eyes. He was wearing clothes that matched his skin tone, which was grayish green. He put his arms out and put his arms around the doctors. It was clear this alien was in charge. During all of this, th! e alien-hybrid sitting on the chair watched and kept looking a! t my sis ter and I as if he had never seen human children before and seemed very curious. After the large alien gave his or her approval the smaller aliens grabbed my sister and I by the arms and took us down the hallway to our left. We then entered a different part of the ship were there was a misty like atmosphere or fog. I was then taken to one room and my sister to another someplace further down the hall. In the room was an alien hybrid child about my age with large light blue eyes the same color as my mothers. He did not speak, but used telepathy to communicate with me directly into my mind. He said if we completed our task first, that he would win a prize. I knew this alien child was my brother. We shared the same mother. Our task was to stack wooden blocks with numbers on one side and letters on the other. We had to form a geometric shape, spell out a sentence, and solve a mathematical problem all at the same time. I helped him stack the blocks to form a triangle, spelled out a sentence in English that referred to a cat, and he solved the mathematical problem on the other side. We did it very rapidly and he was very pleased with me and said he would be getting a special prize. The little aliens came back into the room and led me away and redressed me as we walked. Then there was that beam of blue light and I suddenly was on the ground outside the ship looking up with my sister on my side and the children around the ship in the same circular formation. We then all moved to one side of the ship and looked up at the windows of the saucer section. I could see my brother looking out one window and waving to me and I waved back. My older sister was waving at a very tall alien-hybrid boy with brown curtly hair similar to mine. He was probably over seven feet tall, but looked to only be a teenager. There were also several other alien-hybrid children and young adults looking out the window and waving including the nurse at us and the other human children standing next to us. The ship then moved rapidly and stopped for a moment. It hovered for a couple of seconds and then shot off into the sky out of site. When then left the other children and ran home to t! ell our mother what had happened. When we got into the house we discovered our mother was still giving our baby sister a bath in the sink. As long as we had been on the ship she should have been done by then, but she was still washing here as if time had stood still. To this day, my mother, still remembers us talking about the little people and the spaceship, but she thought it was just a game we were playing. My older sister remembers nothing of the alien encounter, but she remembers this next event. The next day, a station wagon with a heavy set brown hair man driving and a curly blond tall woman drove up to my sister and me and asked us if we would like to go for a ride in the new car they just purchased. The man explained it would just be around the block and then back. The car was a station wagon with wooden trim panels and was a big car typical of the 1970s. In the back seat were several children including a boy that was with us the day of the alien encounter. This boy had blond hair and was taller than my sister and probably a little older. All the children were laughing and saying stuff like around the block right and then laughing about it. My sister said we could not get into the car because our mother would not allow us to get into a car with strangers. My sister still remembers the car and the conversation to this day. The man then asked if it would be okay to take a photo of us, and she replied yes. The man looked at the woman and asked her if that would be o! kay, and she nodded yes. He then took a photo of us using a camera with a really bright flash. The next day, I remember hearing a buzzing sound in my head and complaining that I could not remember anything. I knew something was wrong. We moved from Mountain Home AFB soon after and went to another AFB. I did not recall the alien encounter until I watched the TV show some years later and the images of the alien ship, called an Alien-Hybrid Nursery Mother Ship triggered my memories. So, for eight years, I did not remember anything that had happened after the flashing of the camera. Interesting how that ended up in the Men in Black Movies. Everything I have told you is the truth. I have carried this memory for many years now without talking to anyone but my family about it. The US Government says they are now taking UFOs seriously, but have they already known about aliens all along? Unless those two military doctors had their minds wiped too, I would have to say the answer is yes. They not only knew, but actively participated in alien abductions. I have never again had an alien encounter, at least none I can remember. Maybe because I was able to remember they decided to leave me alone, but who really knows? I thought I should post this and let it be known before I forget or something happens to me and my story is lost forever.",2019-12-19T00:00:00,,

I personally like stars and the night sky very much. I can point out and name at any given night with a clear sky about a handful of stars, planets, constellations and other celestial bodies. The reason I'm saying this is because I understand the night sky to some level at least.  Starting off I was with a friend of mine, we both went to the terrace to light a cigarette. The skies nowadays are pretty clear at night here in Belgaum and the Stars looks amazing. As I was observing the Orion's belt, just below the Orion's belt, that is in between the Orion's belt and Sirius (which was in the East direction at that time) I saw 4-6 pulsating red and brown lights moving slowly in a V formation from my left to the right in the sky. As soon as I saw them I shouted to my friend and asked him to see it as well. But till he saw it to where I pointed it had already moved to the right part of the sky and faded in the night sky. All of this happened in about 5-6 seconds.  When seen from one arm's length the object was the size of a baseball. Around 500 mts - 1 km away. About 45-50 degrees from the horizon. It wasn't like super low but it was at a distance. These lights seemed to move in unison at the same speed, which made me think that they may be attached to the same body. While they were slowly moving I saw the lights kinda pulsating and leaving a tiny after- trail of light for a minuscule amount of time. The lights moved slowly from left to right and faded in the night sky.  When I witnessed this I freaked out as to the what the hell I just saw. I had no rational explanation as to what it was. Then I explained all these details to my friend. I was breathing heavily and was super anxious. The first thing I did was I went on Google and typed ""V formation lights UFO"". The first link I got was "" The Black Triangle UFO - Wikipedia"".  Wikipedia had exactly the same description - pulsating lights, seen at night time, lights in V formation, last sighting 2018. I was flabbergasted. After this I started going through different images of this UFO, I stopped at one and it was exactly what I saw. I still can't explain as to what that could have been. It was too huge for any aircraft I've seen. Military-grade stealth aircraft? I seriously doubt that. It faded in thin air. Gives me goosebumps recalling the incident. I would love to talk more about this with someone !",2019-12-01T00:00:00,,

My family flew across the country from a family member’s wedding yesterday. While we were flying above Utah, around 40,000 to 50,000 ft in altitude, we saw a white oval shaped craft flying in the opposing direction of the plane. It was traveling at the same altitude and was moving rather fast. It was also emitting red/purpleish fumes from it’s rear, something I have never seen before. It was very surprising. I took my phone out to take a video but did not do this in time. This occured around 4:05 NDT. We also saw two jets traveling in the same direction of the craft later on at high speeds. We saw the first jet around 4:12 NDT and the second around 4:54 NDT. This specifically occured as the commercial flight was above central/southwest Utah. In regards to the craft, it was extremely close to the plane, which is surprising as known flying vehicles would never be allowed to be that close to a commercial airplane. The shape and appearance of the craft differed ! entirely from anything I have seen before. It was a white pill shaped craft with no noticeable wings, exhausts, or external features that I could see. As far as size, I am uncertain. Obviously it looked pretty small from the window of the airplane as my eyes perceived it. I think it was a pretty big craft though because the jets that followed were of similar size from the perspective of the plane. This was a very shocking event for both my mother and I, who observed the craft and the subsequent jets. I will be reporting this event to as many organizations and entities as possible.

My Father and I had to park at the top of the driveway (on the road) because we would be unable to get out due to the snow. As we began walking from the side of the street to the top of the driveway we saw to orange/yellow lights. One light high above and one light much lower below. The lower light was slightly off line of the higher light.  As I looked into the light, you could tell it had a structure and shape, but the light drowned out the ability to visually identify. The lights made no sound. When my Father and I both were fixated on the lights, they began to move. They moved counter clockwise, equal distance from each other in perfect alignment. They made one complete rotation until they were completely horizontal directly in line with each other. Then they stopped moving entirely.  After they stopped moving, they stood still for about 3 seconds. And the light to the right began to move toward the light to the left. Once the light to the right got near the light to the left, it stopped. And after 2 seconds, the light on the right shot a third light below it at a high rate of speed (sparks came out of the light when it birthed the third light) forming a perfect Inverted Triangle. The light on the right became dimmer once the third light came out. The Inverted Triangle sat for about 5 seconds (no sound). And the light on the left slowly moved into the cloud, followed by the light on the right and the third light last and disappeared into the clouds.  It has been many years since my Father and I have witnessed this, and from time to time I ask him if he recalls that evening. His story never changes. During this experience, I asked to retrieve the large RCA Camcorder we had within our house but my Father told me not to leave, and to watch. We went inside and told my Grandfather, he acted like we were insane. I asked if we should call the police (we didn't). We drove to his friend's house to tell the story to a house full of people, they didn't care.

Standing on balcony looking west over pacific ocean, commanding 180 degree view. Notice Venus-like, bright, white light low in north-northwestern sky. The light is stationary for first few minutes of observation, then moves steadily west to take up new stationary position less than a hand's width away with extended arm. Light still looks very far away, beyond airspace.  The light suddenly starts to behave--morphing from a single white light into a circle and then a vertical line before returning to its original form, a single white, star-like light. The light then begins to vibrate and appear blurry. Out of the blur materializes/emerges a single red light, not blinking, that is suddenly within proximate airspace and clearly moving south down the coastline. At this point the single red light is approximately 50 miles north and within a minute it is much closer, approximately 5-10 miles, still moving south slowly and steadily.  At this distance, what was once a single red light is becomes four red lights, each one a corner of a perfect square. As the lights pass at their closest, directly out at eye level (approximately 200 ft above sea level), the ""side view"" is of 9 red lights, 3 rows of 3 red lights in a perfect square moving evenly and SILENTLY at an approximate distance of less than a quarter mile.  The 9-light grid continues steadily southward down the coastline, and now the rear view is again four red lights, each the corner of a square, except now with one extra in the middle of the square, so now 5 lights moving at the same steady, unwavering, silent pace.

It happened in Slovakia (I have relatives there), but I am from the Czech Republic. I was outside the house alone at that time. There were no clouds in the sky that night and I saw the moon. The garden of that house is the size of a small field.  I was standing at the corner of the garden near the road enjoying the fresh night air and had a good view of the sky behind the house. Suddenly I noticed small red regularly flashing lights coming from that direction (north). First I thought it was some kind of airplane, but as the lights were getting closer quite slowly I realized I could see a shape of that object. It was a triangle.  When the triangle got even closer I saw there were another lights on the bottom side and I also noticed that it was flying very low not too high above the rooftops and it was quite large. I heard silence. The movement of the object was still very slow.  I was curious and waited until the triangle reached the sky above the house and garden. Then I finally saw it was so large it hid the sky view for me. I had a perfect view on the bottom side.  There were three big blue round lights at the angles of the triangle. The blue color was lighter than for example a police beacon blue, but not as bright as ice blue. Each blue light was surrounded by a circle of small round white lights which were very bright, I don’t know how many of them surrounded the blue ones.  The blue lights were also connected by three lines of medium size elliptical lights (smaller than blue, but bigger than white) which were changing color from white to red and back. The lights illuminated the triangle good enough for me to notice it was from black metallic-like material with blue-green reflections (it reminded me a reflections on insect wings).  My curiosity turned to fear when the triangle stopped flying further and remained hovering above the garden, but even lower than before. I rather went closer to the house to hide under the roof, because I thought it maybe wanted to land on the garden. It went down again that time more than during the stopping and at that moment I knew the triangle was too big to land on the garden. I was relieved a little.  The triangle  stayed hovering above about 10 minutes. I also had a weird feeling like if something was telling me to go right under the triangle, but I didn’t do it (but it could be just a feeling)  Then the triangle  started moving again and slowly flew away (south to The Low Tatras).  The  following day during the return from the mushroom picking I noticed a lot of people standing on two fields. I supposed something had happened and took a closer look. There were stripes of burned earth randomly placed over two fields and some fruit trees were damaged. One man was swearing aloud (I think he was the owner of those fields). But I can't be sure this is connected to my observation, it could be a result of disputes.",2019-12-19T00:00:00,,

My cell window looked in the opposite direction of where the road is located near the jail. I could see a softball field, then the fence, and then beyond the fence nothing but trees. Further in the distance to the right of my view was a water tower which could be seen among the trees. I was lying in bed reading when a light shone through the window.

It caught my attention because there is no road in that direction and after being there for the better part of a year i had never seen headlights through the window.

I watched as what I initially thought was a car seemed t! o lift off the ground very slowly and silently. The craft came closer and closer. The contrast between the light and the darkness made it impossible to see what it looked like. From what I could make out I would describe the craft as shaped very much like a car. The edges were not sharp, there were no corners, although it was shaped a bit like an arrowhead. It reminded me of a stealth bomber about the size of a small sedan. Looking at it I felt as though it could only contain one occupant or possibly be controlled remotely. It moved very slowly toward me passing almost directly above me, passing over the roof of the jail when I lost sight of it. Once it was within about 15 feet of me I could feel the vibration of it’s “engine” it reminded me of the sound of a computer fan.

Hello,  This sighting happened approximately 6 years ago, while I was working night shift as a machine operator.  I went outside to smoke a cigarette.  I've always been a stargazer, so I've seen moving satellites on a few occasions.  They look like a ""slow"" moving star.  This object I witnessed appeared to be a satellite at first, only about double the size and maybe the same altitude as a satellite.  I saw no discernible shape, just a bright light, about the same brilliance as a star or satellite.  Satellites move on a steady trajectory across the sky, which is why I'm reporting this.  This object moved along steadily at first for about 5-10 seconds, then moved in a way I can only describe as if it had some  sort of pulse engine, it was a rapid acceleration/stop, acceleration/stop...but it was a smooth motion.  It kept doing this until it disappeared from my line of sight behind a building and I lost it.  I've never seen anything like it before or since.  I took to the internet to see if others have seen anything similar, I've only come across one other person on a forum who has.  This is why I checked the box to be contacted by an investigator, in case there are questions, but also so I can ask if you've  heard of anything like this before.

On 11-05-19...7:06 pm my neighbor (42 year old female) called asking me to go outside to see some strange orange lights in the sky. She said she had never seen anything like it before. I & my stepdaughter, age 17, went outside on my south facing 2nd floor porch. I'd say we were outside by 7:10 pm. At first we didn't see anything. There was the sound of a plane going over but not extremely loud & that soon passed. Approximately 5 min after we went out, my stepdaughter saw first, then I saw, 3 or 4 clear, bright, orange round balls of light in a cluster. They were at around 45° and in the southeast direction. They seemed close, though I'm unable to give any estimate of distance. They suddenly appeared and after no more than 5 seconds had all disappeared again. They seemed to disappear sequentially, not all at once. No sounds at all were heard at this time. I thought possibly flares, but, like I said, there was no ! sound of any planes or helicopters in the sky. And also, these seemed to be not far from me, in a very populated residential area. Why would anyone be dropping flares in such an area? We waited but didn't see any more balls of light. However, about 5 minutes later, we both saw just inside the bottom of a low cloud an oval appearing white light, much larger than the orange lights. It flashed on just once, for a few seconds, that we saw. It was mild with patchy clouds & light breeze that night. Although it has rained earlier in the day, there were no storms or lightning in the area. It made us wonder if the small orange lights could have been dropped from whatever the oval white light represented. I've never seen anything resembling this before.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,34.7386,-76.7677
