It seemed to be sort of turning/tumbling slowly as it slowly flew by.  Right after it disappeared behind the rooftops in the north/west there was a red light coming from the same direction the first object started in (south/east) and going in the same direction (north/west).  The light flickered a little as it passed behind a tall tree.  No leaves on the tree yet, so it could still be seen as it passed behind the bare branches.  The light went out as it was passing behind this tree.  Then the exact same object as the first flew from behind the tree in the same path as the first (also no lights).  It flew slowly in the same direction and the disappeared behind the same rooftops except slightly more to the right as the first object.  No lights.

So it crossed the wires and the ditch at a 90 degree angle to the highway crossed the highway , then across the ditch on my left side but still maybe five hundred feet ahead of me and as soon as it crossed the left side ditch it turned like a fish a 90 degree turn to the right and was going parallel with the road but i was speeding up and it seemed to mimic my speed and there was a grove of trees and when I got through them I could not see it any more until i got to the town of Cibilo texas and it turned down the road that goes past the police station but I couldnt make the turn and of course thats when I finally thought to get my cell phone out and try to get a video.  So here I am doing about 10 miles an hour looking at the sky through my windshield and I pass a police on the side of the road looking like what the hell is this guy doing ??  So that was the last time I saw it.  I thought it  must be something the military was doing cause there is many air bases in the area.  But how could that thing move so slow crossing the road and not stall?  Description  was simple it looked like a arrow on edge with the top angle lit up but not the bottom and the light was like a very classy glow as if all florecent from the point all the way up to the  upper part of the top angle. so you could see it from the front but when it crossed the st! reet and turned I could barely see the glow like a aura . I al! ways fel t like if a ufo came from another planet , if they had that technical knowledge I doubt very seriously that they would need lights to get around at night and those lights did not light their path anyway it was merely a bright glow and I doubt that they follow FAA rules that they have to have lights  and also it didnt try to hide one bit in fact on the radio next morning I heard them say some lady reported seeing it too. I did see it and followed it , it was amazing what ever aircraft it was. I didnt see any exhaust from a motor and there was no sound at all and they didnt care if they were seen,so either the military has a very cool aircraft or we got company, I m going with military .",2020-06-25T00:00:00,29.550599999999996,-98.1118

The UFOs were in the South covering the whole of the heavens as tho a pearl necklace.  It wrapped me in sheer astonishment. Today is my birthday.

I found it odd that the south sky had more bright stars than normal.  I traced the curve of the big dipper's handle with my eyes arcing down to Arcturus followed by a brighter white 'star' and then finally to Spica.  The center 'star' was  just about halfway between the other two.  I watched the bright 'star' for about 5 seconds. I could see no evidence of motion.  Being a little rusty on the night sky and beginning to doubt I was looking in the right area, I decided to check myself.  I again found the big dipper and followed the curve of the handle to Arcturus.  Now the middle star was gone.  I fixed on the area trying to find it. Soon it returned in the same place.  As I watched, it dimmed and disappeared for a few seconds then again brightened into view having the same brightness as before.  I failed to find any flashing lights that would belong to an aircraft or notice any slight change in position.  The trees were low and I had nothing close enough for reference on movement.  As I moved to get a tree top closer to my line of sight it again faded to nothing.  I stopped and watched carefully looking for flashing lights or for it to reappear.  I kept my eyes on the south sky for several minutes searching for any light that might be aircraft or satellite, but nothing. The few times it dimmed or brightened it did so over about 1 second and then held that brightness or lack of. I know this is rather weak as sightings go and it was quite likely a satellite.  However it did seem unusual when it failed to leave the spot where I originally saw it (as best I could tell), and apparently reflected sunlight to me even though it was on the dark side of the Earth (if it was a satellite). If I didn't mention something it didn't happen (like lost time).",2020-06-25T00:00:00,41.2292,-80.4244

They were bright white lights like typical satellites, but they were extremely bright (I estimate an apparent magnitude of -3.5).  I pointed out to my dad that there was a Starlink train coming up over the trees but it stopped at three satellites. A few seconds after they had all cleared the trees, the third satellite in the line suddenly vanished.  The other two continued on for another five seconds before the second satellite accelerated very quickly to the South. Assuming this was in LEO, they may have been traveling at four or five miles per second. Based on this I estimate the satellite accelerated to upwards of eight miles per second in less than three seconds.  The satellite then accelerated to nearly twice its original speed as it's still curving towards the south. Once it had finished accelerating towards the East, the satellite immediately began curving back North, stopping its Southward movement and accelerating to the same speed in the opposite direction in only a few seconds.  Once it was perfectly in line with the other satellite it ceased all movement on the North/South axis immediately as if it had hit an invisible wall. It continued to gain distance between it and the other satellite before it vanished. The remaining satellite continued on as normal.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,44.0861,-117.0188

I am an educated person who has obtained an Associate and Bachelor degrees of Science in fields where observation is important.  Like anyone I look up at the beautiful sky at night to see the Moon and Venus this time of year.  They are located in the western sky, the land down below is a flat plateau of lava flow remains from days past, from Albuquerque.  To the East, the Sandia Mountains which from view consists of rocky granite boulders to scattered pine and juniper forests and rises approximately 1 mile high above Albuquerque. To the East is where I am drawn at 830pm, finishing up some yard work, and the wind has calmed with sunset.  Between the houses, at a distance seems it is above the mountain I think, there is a Steady Red Light with a slight strobe effect to it.  I thought I saw a white light strobe behind the red light and then it is solid red again.  Let me give my location if you looked at a map of Albuquerque.  I am between Paseo Del Note and Academy St. and Ventura Blvd is one block to my east.  Well, it is probably the helicopter, I think, it is always flying around at night and making rounds.  No, wait, its a plane coming in from he East to fly over the mountain and it will move south.  Well, now I am interested, it appears now to be standing still and there is no sound all.  Now it is dark out, and it appears to me that it is way over the mountain at a great distance. I keep a steady stare at the object, now it slowly appears to be am object that is hovering above the mountain.  Only a slight, vibration made it appear to wobble maybe due to wind that is how I knew it was hovering.  I an see the top of the mountain and sky and then the Red Light.  One minute goes by and object slowly rises like a balloon a short distance up and stops.  It seems like it is observing something on the ground, which the houses completely cut off the lower half of the mountain view from my vantage point.Staring and curious, it rises very slowly a short distance again and stops.  What the heck is that?  No one around to see with me!  Ok, I will see what it does and that was 20 seconds of time. 1 minute 30 seconds, the Red Light, starts to descend down, I am going to lose it behind the mountain it seems, it gets to the top and lowers and the Red Light is still there!  It is in front of the mountain, not behind.  Much closer than I thought it was, but that is the foot hills.  There are houses and desert out there.  Are they making contact with someone?  And in that part of the foothills there are no street lights just houses out there.  I can see the Red Light lowering straight down steadily.  Dark mountain behind makes it clear to see.  No back and forth or pausing, just down. It goes down and I lose sight of it because of the houses.  Now that is all fine and sounds really interesting right?  I am not done. Ok, I have to get higher, how?  The place I am working has an above ground pool with a 10 foot scaffolding deck to jump into the pool, I run to the ladder about 6 feet from my location and climb, swing door in and move to the location I had seen it lower but now I am higher about 10 feet.  I move back and forth looking to see if I can get sight of it. Then I did.  I see the light, but it is white!  Iit has moved to my left as if it traveled a shirt distance, the light is moving up, the light goes out!  Staring the light turns green, rising then it completely goes out as it was rising.  After that either is was in a spectrum now that was invisible to my sight or it moved out fast, but it was cloaked from then on.  I urgently tried to gain sight of it and it was getting late out, dark and the lower half of the mountain was not visible to me due to houses.  That was disappointing.  The whole sighting was very quick. Took at the max about 3 minutes. I decided to come and see if anyone else had made a report about it or saw something.  I have seen the helicopter and what is important is that you hear it before you see it.  It is loud.  There was no sound.  At my distance, and the canyon of the mountain behind it should of made an echo or sound, there was none.  An important note here is that the helicopter circles when observing areas and keeps moving, rarely to stop and hover, wind may be a factor here.  The lights and the way they changed were not of the normal craft seen in our skies in NM.  Never have a seen a Green light on the helicopter. Once again, sequence was red light then slight white strobe behind and then solid red,  lowers moves to the north at low altitude went from invisible to white while rising and invisible to green still rising and then gone.  I just want to add that when I first saw the red light,  I caught a slight glimpse of white dots to the north of the red light as if they were in relation to each other.  But that was a 2 second glimpse and then it was only the red light.  I omitted it from the factual observtion because I doubted what I saw.  Thank you.

I follow astronomy and am reasonably familiar with night sky objects.  What did I see?  Along an arc running from tree-top level in the northwest thru a point directly overhead and continuing southeast along that same arc, a succession of star-like objects that, taken singly, would be thought to be stars.  They looked like stars and had magnitudes similar to most easily visible stars in the night sky. However, they were moving, and were spaced equidistant from each other along that arc, a distance I’d guess was 10 degrees or so (about the width of one fist extended at arm’s length) in the sky.  The event lasted for maybe 90 seconds to two minutes, at which time the last object in the string of objects disappeared in the southeast. I don’t think they were commercial aircraft because there were so many of them. I heard no engine sounds and they kept in perfect formation.  Maybe it was a military exercise or perhaps a launch of low-earth-orbiting satellites.

The area I live in is a very quiet and dark neighborhood so any kind of unusual activity is quickly noticed.  What drew my attention was the fact that I had just heard some kind of aircraft over head but couldn't tell what it was because I had music playing so I figured it was just a jet or airplane but then I noticed lights flashing in the backyard.  This is NOT normal at all in my area and if I see lights at all it is because someone is here . Also my neighbor has censor activated lights that turn on when someone is up very close to the property but they did not light up and that is why I got out of bed and shut the music off because I saw lights in my yard and the neighbors but the censor lights had not been activated.  I shut off the music and started to go towards the door in my backyard.  I noticed that the frogs and crickets suddenly went silent and I got goosebumps on my arms.  I was trying to look up at the sky because I saw what at first I thought was a star but that it was very bright and seemed to be moving rather erratically and in a jumpy and unusual pattern.  I know for a fact that it was not an airplane because of the way it moved from side to side, it couldn't have been a helicopter because it was completely quiet and so much that even the frogs and crickets had stopped so it was complete silence . I also thought for a brief moment that it could possibly be a drone because they are common now in society as well but I can and have heard drones before and it was silent and the light emitting off this thing was far more powerful than even an airplane and looked bright enough to be a star.  It danced above me in the sky for about 10 minutes and then flashed across the sky towards the North so I know that it couldn't have been a drone either because of the speed that it went and there fact that it! was up so high.  I came back inside trying to grasp what I had! just se en and to ask my partner what he thought as well because I had alerted him to the lights and he was watching from back in the bedroom.  He was quite shaken up as well and said that he couldn't identify the object either because like me he said that it was no airplane he had ever seen, he heard no noise as well and he noticed the frogs and crickets stopping also, and he said that it was too high and too large to be a drone.  We sat in bed and were discussing what we had just seen when I noticed another flash up in the sky. I looked up and very very high in the sky I could see what at first I thought was three stars, but that they were moving as well.  There was three lights that were at an angle in the sky that made a perfect line but the three star looking lights were moving up and down very very slowly like as if something was hovering. I started to think I was losing my mind or that I was going crazy but I asked my partner if he noticed or saw anything unusual in the general ! area I was seeing this and he confirmed that I wasn't seeing things because he said the exact same thing that he noticed that there appeared to be three diagonally aligned stars slowly hovering back and forth very high up in the sky.  We watched for about 10 minutes and then they were just gone and the frogs started to croak again and the crickets started up again. It was very creepy and unusual at the very least and neither one of us could figure it out. I tried to search for anything weird happening in the skies in our town and near by towns that following morning but there appeared to be nothing about it in any of the news feeds that I searched in and then that is when I stumbled across this website so I decided to give my account in hopes that I wasn't the only one besides my partner in the town to observe this strange event.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,39.16921421319797,-119.75176954314722

And it wasn't moving. At all. The thing was literally just sitting in the air. I was telling my mom, over the phone, this was the freakiest thing I've ever seen, and trying to explain how it looked when it suddenly started moving. It didn't accelerate fast like most ufo videos show, but instead just kind of putt-putted across the sky. I couldn't watch it the entire time because I was driving on the interstate. I took my eyes off of it for a couple seconds but when I looked back, it was gone. I can only describe this thing as looking completely metallic, with a sort of oblong body and honestly I'd most closely relate it to a train car. I know that sounds stupid but that's the closest similarity I can think of.

The airport is so close to where this ufo was spotted (in a residential neighborhood) that plane’s could be seen and heard taking off.  The flying object seen was approximately the length/width of an average home.  When seen, it was approximately 200ft in the air above me.  What stood out the most was the red dot of light in the center of the bottom (stomach one could say) of the aircraft.  Smooth shiny metal, like one might see on a brand new car from the 50’s, detailed this aircraft as seen in the illustration above.  It accented the red light while branches of this metal lining reached the sides of the aircraft.  The actual build of this ufo was of blue color at first sight, but when looking longer, it had more of a teal color, one might even perceive as green.  The aircraft’s build was smooth with absolutely no bolts or screws in sight.  Along with ! this, the blueish teal material around the metal-like accents looked almost translucent and soft.  When this aircraft was in the air, it did not fly in a straight line, but more so hovered and traveled where it liked.  There was a low rumbling noise that came out of it, but there was absolutely no exhaust coming out of the hovercraft like a normal airplane would have, including no smell of gases leaving the ufo as a normal aircraft would have.  When flying away, the ufo simply disappeared in the distance.  When first spotting this aircraft, I attempted to take a video which ultimately failed as when I was holding my camera completely straight, the aircraft seemed to push and pull my camera away and unfocus it, which reminded me of trying to stick two pieces of magnetic pieces together which can't be done as the force between them moves each of the pieces away.  There was a white light that topped this saucer which is what could be seen from far away.  The side view drawn above is more of a rough sketch of what I saw, only drawn to give one an idea of the shape, while the view from directly underneath is a more complete and accurate view of what I saw, as this is when the aircraft came very close. ",2020-06-25T00:00:00,41.59971620416253,-93.61890936570863

We live a few miles east of Redmond WA.  We decided to spend some time in our hot tub, and about 9:20 PM my wife went in first.  When I joined her about 5 minutes later, she said she was seeing something strange in the sky, namely a series of moving lights.  These were points of light about the brightness of a 3- or 4-magnitude star, moving one after another in a straight line from northwest to southeast, evenly spaced, moving at the same speed, and apparently quite high up.  From our position the line or track initially led directly toward the star Arcturus, but slowly shifted westward a few degrees.  From our deck we could see the track for about a quarter of the sky,  from the eave of our house directly overhead to some trees on the edge of our property.  An individual light took 30 or 40 seconds to traverse this interval, and a new one would appear before the previous one had disappeared.  My wife said she had already seen perhaps a dozen when I came out, and together we witnessed maybe 20 or 30 more.  After about 15 minutes, clouds moved in, lit by the quarter moon high in the west, and obscured our vision.  We frequently see aircraft while in the hot tub, most commonly flying east to west, at no great height, and showing some typical combination of white, red and green lights.  But the lights we saw last night were nothing like this. (In fact, we only saw one other aircraft during this interval, flying up from the south at moderate altitude and passing to the southeast.  Even it was a bit atypical, having only two bright yellowish-white lights like car headlights.) My first thought was that we were seeing some military transport, but the sheer number of lights seemingly makes this explanation unlikely. In summary, I have been watching the sky my whole life, and have never witnessed anything like this event. My wife was a bit unnerved.

I focused on this light and saw it pass between two dimmer lights that I thought were stars. After a second I realized that the light hadn’t moved at all because it was actually a star and what was moving were the two dimmer lights tracking in a southeast direction at airliner speed.  I’ve been hearing about the Space X star link satellites and looked for other lights moving in conjunction with these two lights but only saw the two lights moving across the sky.  The two lights were spaced at approximately 15 degrees apart and continued in an east/southeast direction for about 15-20 seconds until I lost sight of them due to the trees. I did not hear any sounds of an engine nor did I see any red flashing lights to indicate these objects might have been some type of known aircraft.  I also did not see any pulsating from the lights on the objects while I observed their flight.  The lights were far enough away that I wasn’t able to distinguish the shape of the objects.

I watched it go across the sky and when it was about half way across my field, it turned into an enormous light.  It lasted for about 3 seconds.  To me the light was about the size of a quarter or half dollar.  It had an orange color to it with some white also. It was well defined but fuzzy, something that’s hard to explain. It looked almost as if there was a cold mist between myself and the light. Then it went away and the pinpoint of light continued in the direction it was going.

They weren’t high enough to be a plane and they were just sitting there not moving in any direction.  I assumed they were connected to a tower to alert air traffic of the small mountain/foothill.  The height was too high to be a tower but it was pitch dark and I was trying to make sense of it.  As I pointed them out to my sister and cousin in the car, they turned off.  Not all at once but kind of just like powered down quickly.  I waited for them to come on thinking if they were on a tower, they’d be on a timer and they would reappear on and off.  They didn’t.  About 15 seconds after they went out, there was a tiny flash of white light in the darkness where the other lights had been.  Still I was the only one who saw it.  Thankfully, about 15 seconds after that, 3 of the lights came back on and stayed on for a few seconds in which my cousin was able to witness them as well before turning off again for good.  Then another larger white flash of light and then nothing.  We kept looking and nothing again.  We watched behind us until we were too far.  They were gone.  So 2 days later we were driving back home to California and as we came up on that same mountain/foothill, we investigated to make sure there wasn’t a tower there.  There was nothing.  Just desert.  Also, just west of where we saw the lights there is a foothill with towers on it, lots.  But they were far behind us at the time we saw the lights and they are clearly visible whereas the foothill we saw the lights near has nothing on them or on the ground below.  Just don’t want anyone to think we saw the foothill with the towers, it was definitely behind us at the time where these were directly to our left (north).  Maybe someone knows what this was but I’ve made this drive multiple times a year for the past 15 years and I’ve never seen anything like that out in the darkness.

It came to my view almost immediately from over the garage.  We both noted that it was a bright orange light, but appearing to be glowing, maybe burning, with a somewhat fan-shaped brighter glow above it than in the lower 2/3s, around the light.  It was bright enough to think it was a plane with its headlights on coming straight at us (probably even much brighter), only it was one large orange light, not a white pair of lights.  At arm’s length, it was about the size of a pencil eraser.  At first we thought it was very low, as it was moving very quickly in a straight line that went almost directly over us.  At that time of the night the sky was still clear, with only a few clouds coming in from the SW.  We had been looking at stars, so the sky was still quite visible, and pretty.  There was no wind.  As it went over head, we listened for airplane sound and never heard any, even after it had completely disappeared to our NW.  As it went over, it was clear that it was higher in the sky than we first thought – maybe 10,000’ or more.  We get Seattle air traffic here regularly, and they are at 30,000’ as they go over and we can easily hear them.  After it passed, it grew dimmer, much faster than when it was coming at us.  It was very bright the whole time it was coming at us, but as it passed, it was darker like it was the back of whatever was causing the light.  We speculated that it might have been a satellite burning up, but I don’t think they travel SE-NW.  We also thought it might be a meteor burning (which would explain the glow around it) but it never appeared to have a tail or burning debris falling off.  Amazingly, it appeared to be traveling in a very straight line.  It disappeared over the mountains to our NW, somewhat south of Wenatchee.  The whole duration of the event was probably only about a minute.  Our time of the event will be pretty accurate, because I immediately went into the house and called my brother.  The phone recorded my call time.  I am a retired Army officer and a retired school counselor, and my friend is still working with irrigation water equipment.  To us, it was a UFO – unidentified flying object – because we couldn’t identify it.  We are sure it wasn’t a plane – jet or prop – or a local drone, because we never heard a sound out of it.

I called earlier today and it was explained to me that I could have been experiencing a trick of the eyes or other phenomena as the object observed hovered in the sky for around two hours, and there would have been plenty of phone calls in that time about the object. I don’t know what to tell you. I’m not sure if it was high enough in the sky for a large enough group of people to see it, but I could be wrong. It was too high to make a phone photo or video worth much of anything. With so much going on in the sky last night because of the asteroid shower, I don’t know how others weren’t looking and didn’t notice and call in. I’m a prided skeptic. I don’t consider myself a “UFO person.” I have no history of mental illness or reoccurring hallucinations of any kind. However, last night was such a weird experience for me I searched out this forum thi! s morning and write this post.  Last night around 11:10-11:30 PM my girlfriend and I interrupted a film we were watching to go outside and watch the asteroid shower. We were watching the asteroids for a while and looking up at the stars, when I noticed what looked like a star or a satellite that was moving what seemed like far off in the distance. We walked into the back yard, to get a better view over the house and because it was darker there. We both noticed it was moving a visible amount but it an elliptical, circular or linear fashion. Other stars in the sky behind it were stationary. On the phone I wanted to say “I *know* I saw it move!” but I knew you’ve probably heard that before. The only thing I can say is that it moved in the sky enough to travel over the tree line from our point of observation to back behind the same tree line again. It would stay perfectly still for a moment, and then it would move sporadically up and down, and then side to side before skidding over to another section of the sk! y. Over the course of an hour and a half, it made its way across the horizon- but not like a star or asteroid or satellite would. It would wobble, shoot forward, rotate slightly, and then remained fixed for a certain point- usually for a few minutes at a time. At a few points I was convinced it was a drone, but the movements were not similar to a drone‘s at all, and it wouldn’t have been able to fly for that long. Plus, it was so high in the air, it would have been closer to a helicopter in size.  There was uneven light coming off it, and it reflected on the clouds. It looked almost as bright as Venus at a few points, but you could tell that it was reflecting more on the clouds around it than the surrounding stars or planets were- like it was closer to them. At first, we thought it was a star, and then we thought it was a drone or some other hovering craft because it kept moving back and forth in the air a very noticeable amount. At one point I thought it was an asteroid because of how much fluctuation there was coming from the light source in the sky, and how quickly the shape of the light was changing. I misspoke on the phone, it was East of my location, at 86 degrees exactly- I downloaded an app on my IPad to take note of that specifically. Within the first two minutes of observation, it moved a great deal and sparked in light intensity, and reacted to what looked like another light in the sky. They moved in a semi circle fashion in relation to each other, and then! one split away. It looked like an asteroid. They were just far away enough where any iPad footage I took would have been meaningless with the wobble from my arms. One departed out of my frame of view, traveling North-Northwest within the first five minutes of me noticing then phenomena.  When I used a pair of binoculars, I discovered much the same- even with bracing myself, it was very difficult to see what the form actually was. It was moving, but I couldn’t get enough of a view to see what it was. At one point I could have sworn I saw an orange light shoot up into it, but I couldn’t be positive because it reminded me of an asteroid, and was very far away. It then remained stationary for a long while. I returned several times throughout the night alone, and each time the object was still there-however at a different spot in the sky. It would always move at some point though- and after a few minutes. Both my girlfriend and I confirmed movement in the same direction and the same time. She went inside much earlier than I did, and did not return outside. At first, the object looked like it had a trail, then it looked like it was surrounded in an aura of white light, then it looked like there were beams of light coming down from it three different directions.  I know you guys probably get a lot of far out stories and dramatizations, but this really happened and is going to stay with me. At one point, it settled in the sky and seemed to rotate and descend a little bit beneath the clouds- and when it did, I got a clear view of a stream of curved light emitting from the edge of the illuminated point, and for a moment against the sky I saw a dark gray saucer. It rotated, and I saw a ring of red lights underneath it. I covered my mouth with my hand and started shaking. I had to go inside after and lay down this was around 12:15.  I went to sleep around 1 AM. I checked if I could see it from my bedroom window before going to sleep at around 12:30-45 but I could not.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,43.1473,-77.4427

The object was directly over the neighborhood approximately 50ft above the ground, it was so close to the roof of my two story house, after a few seconds and I could see more clearly that it actually had 3 lights on the bottom and had a very obvious saucer silhouette.  The object continued to pass over my house and the neighborhood in a matter of a minute. It was only in my eyesight for 3 minutes before the trees in the distance obscured my view.  I think it’s also worth adding the object made a very low hum that felt like a vibration or possibly an engine hum. Another thing to note is that my puppy is a dog that barks viciously at aircrafts flying over him like helicopters or military aircrafts, in my area it is not uncommon to see military flights, even with the unidentified aircraft so close to him he was incredibly calm and didn’t move a muscle.

To my left (north), I saw a silver cigar-shaped object which appeared to be floating motionlessly about 2-3 miles away at an altitude of approximately 2000-2500 feet.  The object did not appear to be emitting any kind of light, other than the sunlight refracting off of its bright hull .  It struck me as looking very much like one of the early Zeppelins (ex. LZ-3).  It was not perfectly cylindrical, but had longitudinal ridges suggesting girders.  The ends were not conical, but rather pyramidal.  The silvery color, though, was much brighter and refracted more light than doped canvas.  It looked like polished aluminum, or perhaps dull stainless steel.  It was not, however, as bright as Mylar.  My first thought was that someone might have been flying a model airship at a nearby RC airfield, but I quickly dismissed that idea. The object was at too high an altitude and too large. The RC airfield is several miles west of where I saw the object, and furthermore, the wind was too strong for the controlled flight of a lighter-than-air craft. A remote-control dirigible would have been swept away by the wind.  My second thought was that I might have seen an aerostat (tethered balloon) and in fact I cannot guarantee that it wasn't. However, aerostats are not typically cigar-shaped, or metallic. An aerostat would have been buffeted by the wind, straining against its tether. This object remained perfectly still, suggesting that it was heavier than air. I observed the object for about three minutes, until I drove over a ridge and lost sight of it.  I drove by the RC airfield about 10 minutes later. No one was there. On my return trip about 1 1/2 hours later, the object was gone.  I am a 36-year-old professional housekeeper and organizer. I have a bachelor's degree in English. I have an interest in aviation history, particularly lighter-than-air craft, which is why I took such notice of this object. I do not do drugs and seldom drink alcohol, and to my knowledge I do not have any mental illnesses. You may contact my by Email if you would like more details or have questions.

The light I saw and two other witnesses remained stationary for 10 secondsThen would disappear and reappear moving right towards Paulden and repeated to disappear and reappear until it finally faded over Paulden. We talked about what we saw and agreed it could’ve been an airplane a firework or something from the weather. Then what we saw last night was when I had to report.  We were looking into the sky because the moon and the stars were extremely bright last night so then we noticed a orange glowing planet like ball over Paulden something I thought I really didn’t notice before. Then we started talking about the lights we saw the previous weeks. And if you looked closely at the orange like planet it was like there was little twinkles orbiting it like almost s! omething electrical or metal if you really looked closely but they were small shards orbiting it.  Then those small shards finally faded and so did that planet or ball of light or whatever it is. Honestly I’ve been trying to give this my best scientific explanation and so has my dad. I wish I had magnification last night to see what was going around that orange light. Finally to give you some perspective of where I saw it from I live at the base of Mingus Mountain and look over the skies of Prescott Valley Prescott Chino and Paulden.,2020-06-25T00:00:00,34.65223076923077,-112.29900769230768

I first noticed it when I seen a bright glowing object in the sky with orange flares coming off either sides.  As I would start walking closer towards it, it would come in closer dimming its light. I knocked on my neighbors door to get a witness, but my knock went unanswered. As I was in the vestibule to the neighbor and out of sight of the UFO, it went higher into the sky.  When I returned to the sidewalk, the UFO would come back in on me.  It followed my every movement.  It was instantaneous movement.  If I moved left, it immediately went left on queue with my movement.  Same with all movements.  When it went to the highest peak above the lake, it would blink orange looking like an inordinate star. Only when it faced directly north.  When it was more on the northwestern side, it strobe between blue, yellow, and orange.  I finally got my neighbor outside during this time and she also witnessed that when someone was around me that it would go into the distance.  I had her stay close to the building in the vestibule, so I could prove to her that it would come back if I were alone. The amount of time that it took to come back so close from the distance it was at discounts a drone theory.  When it came in, it would hove r at least 200-300 yards in the sky just above the development across the street. Earlier that day, my fiancée and I had done chalking on the sidewalk in huge letters that says, “STAY SAFE OHIO, WE’RE IN THIS TOGETHER.”  I finally finished around 8:30-9:00pm on the chalking. Within the hour is when I noticed what I’m explaining. I do have video.  Other people in the neighborhood have also seen this within the last couple of weeks. A neighbor across the street a couple of weeks ago was so scared that she took her dog back inside immediately when they just started their walk because the dog got really freaked out.  It was at the point that I went to get that neighbor to witness this as well that the UFO left.  This was around 3:00am on Monday, May 4th, 2020.  Like I said, I did get 2 videos.  The shape is hard to describe.  When it got close, it looked like a metallic, circular bottom with a cylinder top.  When it was close, only one dim light that looked like a dim UV light would appear.  In the distance is when the lights would strobe again.  The main consistent color was orange.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,41.3882,-82.3754

My room is on the 2nd floor, and it was dark outside at that moment. The windows with low window sills are on the other side of the room.  I noticed lights behind my windows (where they shouldn’t be) and looked.  There were 4 big red lights forming a square + multiple other lights of different color (white was there for sure).  This whole configuration was steady and falling down fast, and I’ve been seeing it for only 1.5-2 seconds maybe, but I think I caught it distinctly, and it was quite big.  Seeing that, I thought I see some small aircraft crashing near my house, even though it’d unexpected location and time for it to happen (at first, there is overall very small aircraft activity near my city). I took my headphones off, there were no sounds.  This is the angle I saw my room from: It was darker outside than it’s in the photo. The arrow shows the direction of the fall.  It was hard to determine size and distance, and I didn’t see a form of the object, only lights. I don’t think it could be bigger than a car. Outside the window there is transmission line in 15 feet, then rare trees, then the road (30 feet from the window). It looked like it was at the road distance.  I emailed a photo of my room from the needed angle. I showed the location of the object and the direction of the fall. Also a part of the map.

I live in the “typical” Russian countryside: it’s not rural, but drones just don’t fly here. * A sudden visual hallucination? I don’t use any drugs. I was fully awake too. * There was nothing in my room to cause these lights. * Could  the transmission lines somehow cause it?",2020-06-25T00:00:00,,

It was spherical, orange in color and at that instant it was grapefruit. We stood watching this object as it came closer and grew in size. When it got closer to us a flat ring became visible rotating around the sphere, similar to Saturn.

Around 9:30pm I went outside on my deck and laid on my reclining chair with a wool blanket.  I always say quietly, ""Come on alien friends, star friends show me something up there please.""  Nothing happened.  Then I shined my 5mW [5 mega-watt] green laser at one point in the sky for about 5 seconds and then turned it off like fishing.  Then I waited.  That seems to draw them in.  About 3 to 5 minutes after that I started seeing my alien/star friends.  They look like stars moving across the sky.  A light turns on, moves across the sky a little bit, and then slowly turns off the light.  In the same spot, about 5 times, a light turned on, moved across the sky, then turned off, then another what appeared as a new light turned on, faded across the sky in the same path and turned off; 5 times that happened.  So I went inside and called my dad on the phone to come see this.  ! He got out on his deck next to my deck in about 5 minutes.  Then I said ""Show yourself again, my dad is out here.""  About 2 minutes later a very bright star like object moved from south to north above our houses, I pointed next to it using my green laser so my dad could see; He was in pain because his back has been hurting him, but he said he saw it.  It faded out completely.  It was very bright at first and completely faded out while moving from south to north.  This was my first 2020 ufo/alien experience. -	4-18-2020 around 9:30pm neighbors Mike and Janet and I all saw a light moving across the sky from south-west to north-east similar to a satellite but then after it goes by another one would come.  This happened 5 times or more on 4/7/2020 and another 5 times or so when standing in my driveway looking at the stars with my neighbors.  Then I laid in my reclining chair on my deck and it happened another 10 times or so and saw 2 of the headed in the same direction but they were pretty far apart from one another.  I said “Come down here alien friends” and saw a light turn ON to the East and then OFF.  I said THANK YOU.  Then about 10 minutes later a light about 250 feet above the pond in my back yard from East to West fell like a falling star effect.  My neighbors were outside because they said someone told them to go outside and look at the lights in the sky [ufo’s]. -	Around 10:15pm 4/26/2020 laying back on my reclining chair on my deck I saw the fastest light going across the sky that I ever have seen so far.  It was moving from West to East looking over my roof while laying on my reclining chair.  I said THANK YOU and then the light slowly faded out before the object went out of view.  Usually objects/lights will continue moving until out of view.  They purposely turn their lights off BEFORE going out of view with me.  And then… about 15 minutes after that I saw a huge flash of light in the sky north-east [Imagine those fireworks that create a FLASH of light with a big BOOM!!!  I saw that but without the big boom sound].  They’ve done that before for me last summer. -	About 3:40am 4/27/2020 I had one of my favorite alien/ufo experiences.  I was laying back in my reclining deck chair looking at the stars waiting to see if my alien/star friends show me anything.  And then where I was looking, in front and up I saw a light moving from south-west to north-east really dim but I could see it.  I said THANK YOU.  And then BAM… a bright light flashed to my left, much closer to the ground.  I looked in that direction hoping to see another flash… nothing, and then BAM another flash of light I saw clearly… and then the light faded in slowly, out slowly as it was moving from west to east… and them BAM!!! a super bright light with sharp edges [the light seemed to have detail, like lines coming out in all directions], and then it went back to fading in and out as it moved East until it went out of view.  Meanwhile, that first light I saw kept appearing in the same place and then moving from south-west to north-east, and when it went out of view it wo! uld repeat again starting in the same place like it circled around and followed the same path.  It did that 7 or so times.  This was one of my favorite experiences tonight.  So cool, amazing, awesome!!! -	5/9/2020 around 3:30am I saw a small flash of light to the East, the a little North-East, and again.  I said “Come down here.”  Then to my right [south] about 20 feet from me, about 30 feet from the ground, flying mostly horizontal with a little downward angle was a light that looked like a red hot piece of coal with a trail behind it [It looked like a mixture of black, orange, yellow like how red hot embers/ashes look].",2020-06-25T00:00:00,45.0061,-93.1566

The UFO was one single craft, and appeared to be at a very high altitude, at least 15,000 feet. The conditions at the time the UFO was spotted were:  1. Clear skies 2. No clouds 3. Stars were visible 4. No aircraft around (because the country was under lockdown and all means of travel suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis) 5. No sound made by the craft. 6. No change in behavior of animals 7. No physical effects observed 8.

Date SUMMER SIGHTING  1.	  PRIOR TO SIGHTING  We were 3 girls at about 6 grade age walking my hometown road going back home from our friends home who was one of the three of us who saw the bright object in the sky which was about 9 at night.  It was already dark outside. A.	The Sighting. i.	  We arrived to a T in the road where we would be turning left to go down a hill to my house but just before having to turn all three of us saw a extremely bright light up over the tree skyline that caught our eye. We stopped and observed it as the spherical bright light appeared to be coming toward our direction instead of flying away from us.  At first I thought it may have been the house down the road if you were to turn right at the T and their bright yard light that was maybe directed more up than towards their driveway, but when the bright object started to get closer, brighter, and bigger (approximate 2 to 5  hovering over the tree line)  I knew this wasn’t their spot light.  2.	MANEUVERS OF THE FLYING OBJECT.  When we realized this object was something of interest due to the brightness and low flight altitude we continued to watch it.  We became increasingly nervous because we realized that there wasn’t any sound that we should be hearing if it was a helicopter or low flying plane, and that it appeared to continue to be flying in our direction.  As it flew over the tree line that was about 1 to 2 miles away and approximating it another few miles up and away from us it was more clear and it was a bright round sphere but the light was so bright it could have been square but my observation I saw it as a sphere in the sky. The object suddenly hovered down at a 90 degree into the tree line to where we lost sight of it. It took maybe 2 seconds for it to hover down. Then about 1 or 2 seconds after that it hovered back to its original position over the tree line. It then started to fly a little faster toward our direction. (The speed was not fast but a slow smooth transition in movement). I! t again made an up and down movement describing it as a touch and go (like the Navy fighters do when practicing. I was a Naval  Photographer eye witnessing  these often and I held a secret clearance later on in my 20s . ) It again began getting closer and that’s when we began to run from fear and ran about half a mile to my house .

I was under the impression that that they were visiting the area to collect information on the cattle (and possibly frogs) in the pasture.  I never felt scared and multiple times they approached me and would put some object over my right hand.  (Years later I dug out what I thought was metal sliver from my index finger..but maybe it wasn't??? I still have the scar) The aliens were a little taller then me and seemed to glide more than walk.  Greenish grey outer color, large dark blue eyes, large heads. Ship always looked the same...off white pill shaped (no wings, no sound). Lights would appear and disappear over body of vehicle.

In the spring of 1963 I had just turned fifteen years old and had gotten my driver's liscense.,Laurel,MS,,disk,8 minutes,"Occurred : 3/12/1963 20:00  (Entered as : 03/12/63 20:00) Reported: 9/7/2020 9:18:04 PM 21:18 Posted: 11/5/2020 Location: Laurel, MS Shape: Disk Duration:8 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/159/S159266.html,"In the spring of 1963 I had just turned fifteen years old and had gotten my driver's liscense. A friend of mine and I had a double date with two young ladies we had been dating for a while. We were in my dad's car. We picked up our dates at approximately 7:00 PM.  After getting a burger we proceeded to a ""parking spot"" in the edge of the country that I had recently found.  As I pulled into the area I turned the car to the right, and I stopped the car with the nose pointing basically northeast. I was looking out through the front windshield when I noticed what appeared to be the full moon rising.  I had a telescope as a kid and kept up with the phases of the moon and knew there was no full moon at that time.  As I recall there was no moon in view at all. However, the first object I saw had the appearance of a full moon in color and close in size as well as it rose above the horizon. As it rose into the sky it changed in color from a deep reddish gold to white much as the moon does. As I watched, a second object the same size and color rose from the same place and went through the the same appearance changes as the first. Then a third obect appearing identicle to the first two rose into the sky. They were in what I call a ""reverse lazy L"" with the third object being slightly left of the first two and below horizontal to the second looking something like this in the sky:   (^)  (^)   (^)  They were moving almost directly toward me. It was a perfectly clear night as I recall it. They were identicle in appearance as far as I could tell. They were very striking in the sky. I excused myself from the car and my date and walked about twenty yards from the car in the dark. The objects were now well up into the sky at about 45 degrees above the horizon. I am not a good judge of altitude at night, but I will guess they were somewhere around 2000-2500 feet. They were ""Piper Cub"" slow, and taking a guess they seemed to be flying somewhere around 70 mph in formation perfectly together.  At that point I called out to my friend to join me. To give you an idea of how striking they appeared, when my friend got about half way to me our dates saw them and completely panicked. They were screaming and crying for us to take them home. I asked my date to calm down, that this would only take a few minutes, and we would go. She seemed ok with that. However, from time to time the screaming would break out again. At one point I remember one of them asking, ""what's that"", and the other said it's a dog. Then quite...  AS my friend and I watched, the craft continued on their course from NE to SW. They were perfectly silent. I could see stars disappear and reappear behind them as they flew. They were three seperate objects. There were no other aircraft that I could see or hear. I was fifteen years old, had 20/20 plus vision, and according to the USAF in 1969 had much better than average hearing.  Their appearance : They appeared to be about 2/3rds the size of a big full moon in the sky. They were perfectly circular looking at them from beneath, and I did not notice any feature I could call the top. Imagine a man's plain gold wedding band, a little broader band than the ladies'version, an ovaled edge and charged with the most beautiful color gold you can imagine. And I mean ""charged"" with what I will call an almost nuclear appearance, resembling a very bright aurora. That would be the outside edge of these craft. They were lit from edge to edge with the area just inside the edge (which was white) appearing to have less light than anywhere else but yet bright. They were gradually brighter looking toward the center. Then in the center was something that looked like Jupiter on a bright night that was slowly undulating and twinkling.  As the first two came to almost overhead the light of the third object appeared to fluctuate from side to side and it had changed direction flying to the northwest. They flew away on those courses until they were out of sight.  I felt no threat from these craft. in fact I remember a feeling of tranquility as I watched them. At one point I had a feeling of mutual awareness.  When we walked quickly back to the car, the girls were very upset with us. One shouted, ""Look what time it is!"" Indeed it was almost 10:00 PM, and I was late getting my date home which in those days was serious business. I remembered hearing one of them shout, ""What is that"" and the other saying, ""It's a dog"". So I asked about it, but they said that it had not happened which seemed odd to me. My girl stayed upset with me for a couple of weeks.  The following Monday at school (9th grade) I came out of a class and saw a couple of friends. I was telling them the story when suddenly a young man came up to the group that had assembled and loudly announced that he and his dad had also seen them and that they were not ""flying saucers"" and that we were not supposed to be talking about it. All the group flushed in different directions. I never knew who the kid or his dad were. To be fair there is an airport in the direction the first two flew away toward. There is also a Naval Air Station about 65-70 miles away in the direction they came from in Meridian, MS. I also have seen large black, unmarked, dual rotor helicopters that come from the NAS flying that approximate course from time to time up to the present.  I entered the USAF in 1969.I was stationed at a SAC base in Orlando, FL. I have serviced many air craft from B52's , KC135s, C130s, many fighter air craft, and including U2's that were top secret at that time. I have seen about every running light and approach and landing light that existed at that time. I serviced Air Force 2 twice.  However, I have never seen anything like what I saw that Spring night here at home.  I believe it was about 8:00 PM when I first saw ""the moon"" rising, while I knew it was not the moon. I watched the craft for I think eight to ten minutes. When I got back in the car it was almost 10:00 PM. I do not know where the time went.  What I can tell you is that my friend would never talk about it all. The last time I talked to him before he passed I asked him again what he thought about it all. He said, ""lights"", and he changed the topic. I have lost contact with the girls. They are probably still angry with me, lol.",,31.69650882352941,-89.11289705882352

(just shortly after dark)in the summer (june-sept) between 1973-1975. i was about 12-14 years old. my mother asked me to go outside to burn our paper garbage, we lived on the end of a dead end street beside a swampy area and regularly separated and burned paper refuse at the edge of a large mowed area we maintained,and the start of the wooded/swampy area about 20 yards from our house. i was watching ""the ""A"" team"" on TV at the time(may help time frame) and not wanting to be interrupted, i ran out our backdoor fast dropped the paper sack full of paper trash, flicked several lit matches into it and ran back inside. when i approached the back door my mother was still standing on the porch holding open the screen door with her back and looking off in the distance.i ran past her into the kitchen and heard her call me and say ""what is that?"" i turned around and went back beside her and she was looking off in the sky to the southeast. i saw what appeared to be lights flashing and started to dismiss it as a plane so i could return to my TV show. the lights appeared to move in an odd way and looked too low to be a plane, my response was cut short to ""it's just a...."" and i knew it was not a plane or helicopter. there were 3 lights in the form of a triangle and looked to be spinning and shifting back and forth as the object ""wobbled"" towards us slowly. it appeared to be a green,red and blue light but a white light was visible in the mix, however not located on the object in a solid fashion like the other 3 lights. i became enchanted with staring at it and my mother seemed to be in a daze, my mouth was open to say some sort of explanation, however my mind ran thru a list of goodyear blimp(too fast) helicopter(no sound)airplane(too slow). i felt euphoria and a sense of calm overtake me but i could not speak.i slowly stepped towards it and down off the porch to stand on our driveway and could not take my eyes away from it. it was coming directly towards us and moved like a hoola-hoop and each rotation of the ""hoola-hoop"" was like a slide forward. i remember thinking of a rotary engine at the time and mazda had commercials about rotary engines on tv. it got closer and was silent and large and the triangle shape made by the 3 lights seemed to be mounted around a central circle or sphere and rotated or ""hoola-hooped"" around the central mass. i was now positive it fit no logical explanation or known physics as it would fall from the sky moving so slow but a blimp could never move in that fashion and that was the only explanation i had as to its silence. it hoola-hooped or ""slid"" toward us and the only thing i could compare it to was 2 magnets opposing each other seemed similar to what held this thing aloft. it was almost overhead near the mowed area beside our house and i felt in a trance somewhat and began to think ""land!..we are friendly, please come meet us, and felt a sort of love and warmth inside as it continued to approach me, then i started to realize i could hit it with a rock it was so low and my mind went to shift to proof and police and shooting it down and calling the media and getting famous. we always kept a loaded 22 rifle behind our back door,my mother shot squirrels with it. i broke my mind away from the object and ran to get the gun, it was not there. i ran back out and it was now hoola-hooping away from us east northeast as if it read my thoughts and changed its mind, i felt guilty for thinking things that made it go away. it continued slowly east toward willow street and 39th ave just east of I-65 until it was out of sight.i called state police and they said nobody has reported anything.i felt sure some others had to see it, i looked in the newspapers the next week and saw no mention of it. it was first seen at the intersection of the nickle-plate railroad tracks and interstate 65, low enough all the cars on the interstate surely would have seen it. it traveled to the south end of 41st and swift street gradually getting lower then east toward 39th and willow street gradually getting higher. my mother seemed in a trance most of the time and afterwards refused to talk about it in any detail. i felt it may have spotted me throwing the lit matches into the trash and the flashes attracted in in the dark, i felt it was reading my mind the entire time and would have landed (if it would fit) beside our house if i did not start thinking bad things. i am left thinking why if it was from outer space etc would it have ANY lights on it, it would not need to obey any flight regulations or such of earth people. It was not any known technology then or now, that i am aware of.",2020-11-05T00:00:00,41.5179,-87.2353

I replied that the Deepest Darkest Secret of Washington, D.C. was: that Extraterrestrials are Real, Extraterrestrials had been coming to Earth for thousands or millions of years and Yes the U.S. Government was engaged in programs with Extraterrestrials. But because of the American media Censorship this information was “never” brought to the American People. Even today I am still being Censored for telling the Truth about Washington D.C. because I am “not” a Political Party member “even” by Investigative Reporters who condemn mainstream media Censorship. I have told People that they should Stop doing Washington, D.C.’s Censorship for them by continuing to say “when” we have contact with Extraterrestrial Life in their long drawn out speeches about what should we do “when” it happens: it happened Decades ago and have active working Relationships with Extraterrestrials. I have had a number of Encounters with Extraterrestrials one which happened while I was in the U.S. Army the Summer of 1976 as a member of C-Battery 2/81st FA at the Graffenworh Training Facility in W. Germany: one day I was called on to be part of a Clean Up Detail that was assigned to pick up Trash in a wooden area. While moving thought the Forest I saw what I thought was a Doorway to a WWII Bunker and went inside. Inside I found what I thought to be a Rifle Bunker, I leaned on the Cement and it felt real, I looked out the Firing Portal and saw Forest. After a little more that 2 ½ minutes I left the Bunker. I was immediately grabbed by a Sergeant who asked me “where did I go”?  I told him I went into the Bunker and turned around to show him and the Bunker was gone and a large tree was in its’ place. I looked to my Right and saw 2 Soldiers one standing on the others shoulders with a third Soldier beginning to climb up them. Later one of these Soldiers came to me and told me; they were Brothers  from New York, Detroit, Washington D.C. and they did “not” climb Trees, one of the Sergeants had thought that I must have Climbed that Tree and Ordered them to Climb up and see if I was up there. I was told that I have been missing for 45 minutes. Later I asked the 1st Sergeant’s Clerk, a buddy of mine, about my Disappearance knowing he would tell me the Truth. He said that I had Disappeared for 45 minutes in a matter of fact way. Before I could ask him more a Sergeant came into the Office with Business and I left The following Saturday when the rest of the Unit was released for the afternoon I had to go for a Jeep ride with SGT H and SSG J, we went  to the area we did the Clean Up and walked through the Woods to the place I Disappeared. I had been in the Army long enough to know that they wanted me to Change my Report and I would remain there until I did and not be able to go Drink Beer on my afternoon off so, I said to SSG J loud enough for SGT H to hear “for the Official Record I didn’t go into a Bunker”(I was never asked where I did go if not into the Bunker) “but off the Record I did go into a Bunker”. SSG J said to me that I was not the only one to go into the Bunker there were other Soldiers who had also gone into a Bunker in the Forest and Disappeared from their Units. Later when I had the time to sit and think about the situation I came to the conclusion that I had been used  by the Extraterrestrials in a Scientific Study like when we put Mice into a maze to see how they figure it out. All of the Soldiers who saw the Doorway and went inside, no other Soldier saw the Doorway only them. Where the Doorway led to was a Different Dimension that was created by the Extraterrestrials; one thing I noticed momentarily was the German Grass Directional Marker that I saw from the inside the Bunker I had passed in the Forest further back and should not have been able to see it from the Bunker but I Dismissed it at the time The most important thing that showed it was a Created area was the fact that in a Bunker that had been open for over 40 years there was no:  Dirt, Pine Needles, Leaves, Flies, Spider Webs or other insects it was just clean light grey Cement. This didn’t catch my attention because I had been on Construction Sites with my Union Carpenter father and had seen newly poured Cement before but it didn’t Alarm me. What I did Think was; why weren’t there other Soldiers in there since it would be a good place for a Cigarette Break. These Extraterrestrials know the Human Body well enough that they know we needed Oxygen and the Atmospheric Pressure of Earth to Survive when they Transported us to a Different Dimension and Forward through Time as part of their Scientific Research; they harmed no one. The Experience was like reading the newspaper in your living room, getting up and going to the kitchen for a Drink of water and then returning to reading your newspaper: there were “NO” Flashing Lights, “NO” Theremin music or other Hollywood Sound Effects, “NO” Lightening Bolts or Electrical Current, “NO” Spinning in a Circle or Transporting like on Star Trek; there were “NO” Hollywood Special Effects at all. What Angered the U.S. Army was: that someone was taking Its’ Soldiers out from under their noses and they did “not” know how they were doing it. Extraterrestrials are so far advanced over Humans that trying to Think about what they can do and what they know is the conceitedness of low IQ Humans. And now the Physical Evidence for you that I am the U.S. Federal Agent I say I am: in 2017 I filed a Federal Lawsuit against President Trump at the U.S. District Court Western District of Washington case no. 17-CV-0223 where I identify myself as the U.S. Federal Agent I am and “was not” Arrested for Impersonating a U.S. Federal Agent. [You can look the case up on the U.S. Federal Courts website] Some of the media Censorship People claim that just because I Testified for the U.S. Federal Court that I am a U.S. Federal Agent and did “not” get Arrested for Impersonating a Federal Agent did “not” mean that I am a Federal Agent; can you Believe them? Well, do you think that you can Break the media Censorship of my Information perhaps you know of a media outlet or show that would be interested in this and other information I have been trying to get to the American People for their Benefit.

I don’t recall the exact date but what I saw has been engraved in my mind. I have hand nothing but ridicule in telling my story, but what I saw was very real and nothing from current humans. I stood in front of it for over 5 minutes.  A friend and I were traveling from Reno Nv to my brothers ranch just south of Clearlake Ca. I was driving westbound on Highway 20 about 10-15 miles west of I-5 from the town of Williams. I crested a ridge and was entering a long valley where the road was straight. On the far end of the valley I saw a large sphere with multi colored lights flashing all over it.  My initial impression was that it was a hot air balloon out at night with Christmas lights all over it. I pointed it out to my friend and we were both wondering what kind of idiot would be out a night in a hot air balloon with Christmas lights?  As we crossed the valley (about 3/4 of a mile) we noticed that it was right on top of a large oak tree that had grown right on the eastbound side of the road. I said “it looks like it’s stuck in that tree. Serves that guy right for being out here at night in that hot air balloon.”  When we made it all the way to where the tree and object was I pulled off on the shoulder of the road, directly across the road from it.  We took a moment to look at it as I was looking for the basket but there was none. The multi color lights never stopped flashing. I told my friend that I was going to get out and try to help. We both got out and stood on the edge of the road and looked at it. It was about 40 feet tall and 1/2 as wide, shaped like an egg. I told my friend that I still couldn’t make out the basket as I still thought it was a hot air ballon. I decided to cross the road and offer help. It was right on top of the tree.  As I walked across the road I started yelling “do you need help?”, but I heard nothing. I walked completely across the road and now I was standing at the edge of the tee looking directly up at it. My friend stayed on the opposite side of the road where I had parked. I yelled up again “are you stuck? Do you need help?”, again nothing. It was at this time that I could clearly see there was no basket.  As I was struggling to figure out what exactly I was looking at it shot straight out int space at about a 45 degree angle. It shot so fast I expected to hear a sonic boom or something but it was completely silent. We never heard a sound. You could see a color trail from where it was to where it went. My friend and I both yelled out “woah, that was no  hot air ballon!!”  This is the moment I realized that what we saw was a UFO.  When we arrived at my brothers we immediately told him what we saw. He called us liars and proceeded to make fun of us. Shortly after the nightly news came on and the first story was about multiple UFO sightings in the area we were at. The news channel said they checked with the local Air Force base (Beale AFB) and that they said they launched a rocket. A rocket?? I was standing right in front of it! It was no rocket!  Between my brother’s heckling me and the military base BS I have kept my experience to myself for over 30 years.

So I watched and saw it was moving towards me in an erratic manner.  It would stop and hover bobbing around, almost as if out of control.  Then it would go straight up, stop, wobble and start to move again.  At times it would drop straight down in altitude, then back up.  The only time it looked steady was when on the move.  While hovering it was all over the place. I grabbed a pair of 8X binoculars and got a pretty clear view of this amazing object.  Although a dark sky it looked like a diamond shape, longer horizontally than vertically.  What stood out the most were 2 large circles of light.  These circles seemed to be on the side facing me and took up 3/4 of the UFO side.  The circles were perfectly round.  The left circle was a deep red and the right circle a dark sky blue.  The lights/colors were not glaring, but rather flat with depth.  The lights did not flash, nor did they change.  Through the binoculars the beauty of these lights memorized me.  So perfect, so smooth/ depth dimensional.  I called out a friend and she confirmed what I saw.  Eventually this UFO started moving away and North towards the Straight of Juan De Fuca a few miles away.  As it left, again it would stop/hover in an unstable manner.  It again dropped straight down, then moved off eventually falling out of site below a near tree line.  There is a small airport nearby and I see private planes and helicopters.  The object I saw was no plane and flew far more erratically than a chopper.  Although it was originally about 1.5 times as high as other small craft flying by.  As I watched, it did drop to private plane altitude.  I would say it travelled in a semi circle arc covering 2-3 miles.  It was totally silent and I can hear the engines of private aircraft easily at similar distances.  If I had to estimate, this UFO was bigger than the local Coast Guard helicopter.  At least twice as big and bigger than a school bus.  More like 2 or 3 city busses stacked.  The light circles were disproportionally large.  There were no other lights and I could see the dark diamond shape.  The 2 large lights were always visible, so I got the impression this UFO never turned/rotated on axis from me.  I know what aircrafts are and can say with certainty, what I saw was like no other aircraft I've ever seen.  I will never get thos! e 2 huge lights out of my mind.  Was this a drone?  If it was it was far larger than any US military drones I've seen on TV.  Besides the 2 lights I found it's erratic instability at rest while hovering very unusual for a craft in the sky.  My reason for reporting this is in hopes someone else near me saw the same UFO.  Plus what I saw impressed me enough to report.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,48.0656,-123.0613

Hi, I’m ((male's name deleted)), I live in the Boston suburbs, I have a Bachelor Degree in English from University of Massachusetts Amherst.  The event took place in my hometown, Milton, a Boston suburb in late October 2009 (I think it was on Wednesday, the 28th of October). 	The event occurred at night.  I was driving back from a job site in Marlborough, Massachusetts, and after exiting the highway in Canton, Massachusetts, entered the roads of a small nature reserve called The Blue Hills, heading towards Milton.  It was raining lightly.  I was driving on Unquity Road in the Blue Hills, headed towards the intersection of Blue Hill Parkway and Canton Ave, in Milton, around 6:40 pm when I noticed, to the left side of the road above the tree line, a rotational light, as though a lighthouse was built in the middle of the woods.  I looked at it, knowing that it was a UFO, for that could be the only explanation of the sight.  Just as I am paying attention to the light, I see an asterisk shaped blob of light on the side of the road, followed by the image of a medium height gray alien.  I couldn’t keep my eyes on it, and had to keep driving, as it was rush hour and traffic was heavy. 	After the event, I started feeling ill, getting panic attacks, then, in 2012 May, started having visions of an alien gray in what I can only describe as telepresence.  I was working as an intern at a domain parking company in Waltham, and one day after leaving the office, entered my parents home in Milton, going upstairs.  I looked in the guest room because something caught my eye, and witnessed a short gray alien with a large head situated within the wall of the room above the bed.  I walked back and forth a few times, in disbelief, then as I sat down at my desk in  my room, thinking about what I had seen, the creature began to engage me, entering my thinking space and thus began what has become commonplace to me over the past 8 years. 	First, the gray seemed to produce an image of Storm from the X-Men (old animated series that was on TV in the 1990’s) which the gray used to communicate to me.  I understood this as the gray had scanned my memory, since I used to watch that show frequently as a child.  Over the years I have been bedazzled by dozens of sights similar to this one, I assume the gray has been making, confusing and befuddling me.  I initially asked to be left alone, but the gray refused saying “no” when I asked it to leave.  I then began having debilitating visions, leaving me unable to work that lasted all summer (2012), briefly leaving me in peace for 8 months the following fall and winter through spring, then returning, horrifying me summer of 2013 to current present (2020).  	 	Every once and a while the visions become very strong, startling and overpowering me.  The creatures (there appears to be more than one now) seem upset that I seek out information about UFO sightings, insisting that I turn back (telling me to “turn back”), though I have tried that to no avail, as it seems to persist in engaging me, burrowing into my thought, even indicating it was planning on getting violent.  The aliens repeatedly use words from Proto Indo European, that I had to look up online, often saying “sair” which I found on Wictionary as some Portuguese word meaning “leave.” They also say “zair” which I have discovered means “die.”  These two words they say the most.  It is unnerving. 	I have experienced sleep paralysis often since then, seeing a blue tinged insectoid alien twice.  I have told the local Fire Department about my sighting.  I seem to be in constant communication with the entity/entities; it is very unpleasant as it appears I am merely allowed to sleep.  I feel as though I have been snared by the creatures, and if they wanted they could kill me by preventing me from sleeping.  I often times have closed eye visions of alien grays, light browns (like from the cover of Strieber’s book Communion), reptilians, and stranger looking creatures.  I have experienced being tazed by them from an unseen weapon while trying to fall asleep once (in the absence of sleep paralysis), as they are able to that also.  My experience has been very complex, confusing and drawn out.",2020-04-09T00:00:00,42.2389,-71.081

My 2 friends and I were in the back yard around the firepit just after midnight. We were stargazing, which we often did.  I am an amateur astronomer and have seen some cool things in my 50+ years (several fireballs and strange moving lights that are not satellites or planes) but this was the most amazing.  It appeared to be a triangular craft that streaked across the sky very quickly.  We all looked at each other with amazement right at that moment, so I know it wasn't just me thinking I saw something, or a figment of my imagination. Later, we compared notes, and we all had seen the same thing. We were observing from Dawson Creek, BC (Canada) . The object travelled roughly from the northwest towards the southeast.  It was triangular, but an acute isoceles in shape, not like the equilateral ones that I have heard about, perhaps conic, but it was very fleeting so all I can attest to was the 2-D triangular outline.  It was dark, so it was like looking at something that was dark gray against the black night sky, so it was sort of camouflaged, but it seemed to have a faint aura around it.  We had the sense that it was blunt-nosed (not sharply pointed at the nose), but not as wide as the space shuttle or anything like that if you saw it in sillhouette from underneath. It was VERY fast, appearing to travel from horizon to horizon in about 2 or 3 seconds. absolutely silent.  No engine noise, neither at that moment, nor afterwards.  No sonic boom, nor was there even a whoosh sound that something moving very fast would be expected to make as it travelled through the atmosphere. Nothing. We had the sense that it was not very high up. Perhaps somewhere between 5,000 and 7,000 feet or so, so we should have heard something at some point if it was any sort of commonly known propulsion. It was definitely not as high as standard commercial jets. It's travel path was straight and appeared to be angled about 15-20 degrees towards the south of the zenith at the point we were observing from (not quite straight overhead). We didn't have the feeling that it was ET's or anything like that. We ended up feeling like it was a very advanced military craft of some sort.  For example, it's travel path was consistent of something as if it was travelling from a base in Alaska towards Cold Lake, or Suffield (Canadian forces bases in Alberta) or something like that, but now we're only speculating.",2020-04-09T00:00:00,55.76659999999999,-120.2362

My brother and I are afraid and hesitant to share it to others as people might misunderstood and labelled us with weird behaviour especially in our country. I couldn’t make a report in our country as I couldn’t find any UFO researchers too. At first I thought it was just me but my brother remembered too and we cannot deny it anymore, especially recently when a video of September 14, 2020 UFO showed up to a lot of people and I found out about TR3B military. The aircraft that we saw is quite similar to this objects that reminded me more about the incident years ago and would like to share it.  I would like my statement to be added in your research study, hoping it will help. We also like to be enlightened and find the answers in time.  This happened between 1998-2004 Philippines in Alabang Area for about 3-5minutes. We forgot what year it was as we both couldn’t remember much but as times goes by as we age there are things we remembered on what happened that night. It was late night maybe around between 21:00-23:00 at our house. Our house is located in South area of Manila and located on top of the hill. My brother and I were playing outside of the house with my parents when we saw a triangular aircraft going closer to our house. The black UFO were moving silently and gracefully towards our rooftop. There’s no sound of engine and it was moving  slowly and stopped on our roof. The distance is very close to our roof, the aircraft turned off the lights (the lights are like beams that you can see on the sides of an airplanes)  as they stopped and parked on top of our rooftop. As they turned off the lights, the entrance or door in the middle of the aircraft  opened and there was a very white bright light wherei! n we couldn’t see anything.  It took only seconds when the door opened on top of us and it closed again. Then theres a big flash of lights on us, it’s like a camera click thats so bright that is similar to Men In Black movie that they use. The aircraft lights were turned on again ready to take off after the big flash. When the aircraft lights were turned on they vanished in just a matter of second in the sky. I cannot explain how it happened that they just went to the sky very smoothly and vanished in a matter of seconds. That incident happened with our parents but it was only me and brother who just remembered it. And during that incident the surroundings are weird as if it stopped the time and we were frozen and as they flash the light on us and left we couldn’t remember anything much especially our parents couldn’t remember any trace of what happened, especially by the time the aircraft stopped on the rooftop and opened the doors and before the big flash. But as we grow ! old we remember the highlights of the incident and we know for! sure it really happened. And I was stunned when I saw the TR3B because it’s quite similar but during that year and especially in our country that military aircraft is impossible. Until now, we couldn’t believe it happened to us and this amazed me and my brother.  It’s still questionable for us, why the villagers people seemed not to see the aircraft nor our parents couldn’t remember anything. The aircraft is really beautiful, sophisticated and seemed advance/futuristic structure of aircraft ( It’s not a colorful aircraft) . How can such aircraft glide silently on air, stopped on a very low height (too close to the roof for an aircraft to stop)  and vanished in just seconds and flash of light on us, that maybe erased the memories and caused our parents not to remember anything  and might not seemed to work with me and my brother. Lastly, we couldn’t remember much what happened between when the door opened with bright lights and and by the time they flash a light on us before they left as if the time stopped and the unexplainable weird surrounding is still a mystery.  I would like  to share this in your study. Thank you",2020-11-05T00:00:00,,

I decided to drive up the hill away from the flares on location to see it my eyes were playing tricks.  So I watched for a couple minutes and decided to go back.  As I was getting back in my truck I looked up again and saw this object move from the left to the right.  I thought maybe I could get a better look if I had the time to set up my telescope.  Then I seen it start flashing and start to get brighter  At that moment I watched it fly from the Northwest to the southwest in a matter of seconds.  Then it stopped and started circling around a few other stars.  I wondered if it could have been space junk or a destroyed sattelite until the 2 ""stars""t was circling started to move.  The 2 objects started chasing eachother moving down towards the horizon. Then as they moved around one another, they both made these strange je! rky movements and then all I could see was what looked like red electricity then a red and blue explosion that light the inside of the clouds up. After the explosion I seen one of the objects moving towards the horizon, then I notice vortex from where he was grom but it dissipated quickly.  Then I seen it changed shape or take shape since the I couldn't make out the initial shape of the object since it was moving too quickly, that's when I seen it turn black and shiny.  As it hit the horizon it disappeared and reappeared a  short distance from where it was. It did this twice before I lost sight of it.  After that I was amazed but also shocked at what I seen. I decided to set up my telescope to see if what I seen was a sattelite flying over head or something falling from orbit.  While I set up I looked towards the spot I seen the explosion.    seen another object fly to the north with the same speed and movements as the others. I watched it stop in the sky and stay still.  Then 2 ! more joined it and another one fly below the others and stay s! till.  Th en after about 5 minutes they moved into a triangle like formation and pulse and shaking. As I watched another object maneuver around what appeared to be more stars make  another explosion followed by a bunch of little red dots and flashes, in a matter of a seconds it was done. Then one by one these objects flew into this triangle formation towards the top in the same spot as the others then speed up and disappear.  I watched close to 15-20 fly through and disappear while for a second every time they passed through it looked like a very small vortex form and disappear.  I was awestruck and a little frightened.  At the very end I seen the bright one that I had first seen, and it passed through and disaapeared as well.  Then I watch all 3 objects fly in that same pattern towards the east.  As it was leaving it looked as of there was a faint line in between them. It looked like it tilted upwards, but it was hard to tell, then they disappeared.  I forgot to mention that all of these o! bjects had a white light that would change intensity; the one I seen turned black had a the shape of a Bell then as it turned black it looked like a dumbbell with a bottle cap on the top towards the middle.  The rest were more saucer shaped but not as compressed. The bright one was harder to make out from it’s speed and the way it pulsed.

I went outside to walk my dog before going to bed at around 2:30am.  I live in a townhome complex in Hermantown, MN.  As I was walking my dog, I heard a sound that I can only describe as ominous.  It was like a low grumble/rattle and sounded almost like construction equipment.  Confused, I looked around and saw nothing nearby, and due to the time, nobody would be working. I decided to call a friend, as the feeling of something bad about to happen made me feel extremely worried of being outside.  As I walked around the townhome complex, I was gazing at the stars, as the sky was pristinely clear.  I saw what I assume to be an airplane (a few rhythmic blinking lights moving at average speed).  Then, as I scanned the sky, I fixated on what appeared to be an extremely bright star.  As I watched this star while talking to my friend, I noticed it was moving. I stopped walking to ensure I wasn’t seeing things, and the object continued to move across the sky smoothly yet quickly headed north/east (toward Lake Superior).  The object moved at an upbeat pace, and appeared to be getting smaller and smaller.  I walked around the corner, as it was about to be blocked from my view by one of the townhomes, and by the time I rounded the corner a minute later, it was gone.  The eerie feeling had left my body, too.  The airplane was still visible in the sky.  Overall, I was shocked that I saw something so clearly that looked so much like a star.

I was a skeptic, non-observer, and until then, UFOs were for lunatics and movies (thanks for decades of social conditioning).  My friend, a biologist, amateur pilot, and a professional businesswoman, had, over the course of several weeks, slowly revealed to me that she had seen things at night in the sky on many occasions that she could not explain, while walking her dogs around the large farm she lived on at the time.  As a pilot and amateur astronomer, she had easily ruled out all conventional aircraft, meteorites and common weather anomalies to explain her repeated observations.  The extent of her sightings up until April 11, 2016 were stationary lights resembling stars that got brighter, dimmed, and got brighter, several times, over several minutes, not seconds, seemingly on command.  She also observed objects resembling satellites in apparent size and distance travelling in non-linear fashion.  Curved trajectories, zigzags, right angle turns and reversals in direction were n! ot uncommon. I considered my friend to be a rational, intellectual and intelligent person. I listened politely to her description of her observations and her subsequent research into the topic.  A part of me believed she believed what she had seen, and a very small part was concerned for her sanity.  We are good friends and of one mind on many topics, including the notion of a universal consciousness, so conducting a CE-5 and an evening spent star gazing seemed a harmless enough indulgence, in support of a good friend. It was early spring and it was still darn cold at night, not to mention the pond on the adjacent dairy farm had just hatched a fresh batch of mosquitoes.  Around 9:00, we wrapped up in blankets, stretched out on gravity chairs and proceeded to play Dr. Steven Greer's CE-5 recordings, while observing a brilliantly clear, cloud free, non windy night sky.  I felt a bit silly. We observed several commercial flights, large and small, satellites, and a few meteorites hitting the atmosphere.  After an hour or so, we meditated in CE-5 fashion.  I remember thinking intensely how much I needed to know if this phenomenon was real, so I would know my friend wasn't suffering from some sort of delusion, and asking 'them' to appear so we would know definitively that they existed and we were not alone. We did see three or four of the dimming and brightening repeatedly 'stars' she had described, which piqued my interest, but I was still busy trying to rationalize what we'd seen, not yet convinced they couldn't be explained. I was freezing cold, getting eaten alive by mosquitoes, and I had an hour and a half drive home and work in the morning.  I stood up some time around 10:15, and started to make my excuses, when I saw a light like a fireball on the northern horizon about 3 miles out at what I estimated around 1000 feet above the treeline.  There was absolutely NO sound - either from the object or the usual night sounds from animals around us.  It was orange, red, amber, yellow and white and switched between these colours.  If I had to estimate it's size, I'd say it was around the size of a helicopter, which we ruled out immediately. It was moving erratically and not like a conventional craft at all.  It was moving right to left (east to west) overall, but zigzagging up and down, forwards and backwards, right to left, and down and to the right at the same time.  It sometimes appear shimmery, as though it was fading in and out of reality.  It was too far out to be explained by wind, which was practic! ally nonexistent that night. There were no 'drips', so it was not a Chinese lantern.  I checked with my friend to make sure she was seeing it too.  She was just as in awe as I was. We watched it for 10 to 15 minutes and repeatedly asked it to come closer.  It did, but only slightly.  Together, we ruled out everything conventional we could think of, including a small plane, drone, ultralight, helicopter, military flare, searchlight, etc.  It was simply not any of those things. Then my friend said, 'Hear that?"" We heard a jet coming in from the left and behind us (southwest of our position), heading northeast as it passed us, directly headed for the object we'd been watching.  A second jet came from behind and our right (southeast of our position) a few seconds later, headed north northwest toward the object.  A third jet appeared from the northeast, well north of the object, heading southwest toward it. We started yelling at it to go; that it wasn't safe.  I actually felt some responsibility, since we had 'summoned' it. It waited until the jets were within a mile and shot straight up and north faster than anything I've ever seen and disappeared into the atmosphere. My friend later said it dipped before it took off and she wondered if the F-18 Growlers had attacked it with their electronic weapons. We were in shock at what we'd just observed. If it weren't for the jets, I might still have seen trying to rationalize what we'd seen, but their actions confirmed we'd seen something of interest to the U.S. military. The jets circled the area for some time afterward. What had been a perfectly clear sky was overcast in less than 3 minutes. We hid inside the house until my fight or flight kicked in and I drove home in a shocked trance. My perception of the world had changed completely. Later, my friend reported the jets circled the area for about an hour before leaving. In fact, the first group left and a second group came for a circle around the area. She was watching from her deck in the dark. Whidbey Island airforce base is the only place the F-18 Growlers could have come from. We know they were Growlers, because their sound is familiar to us, living only 50 miles across the water. Canada does not currently have jets on its west coast, so Whidbey is the only place they could have come from within the time-frame. Growlers are outfitted with electronic weaponry. Since that time, we have both had strange experiences.  My friend in the 3-dimensional world with further sightings, and myself in the lucid-dreaming world, where I consider myself a student of the universal consciousness.  I believe our 'neighbours' are tuned into the telepathic connection between all of us and that is how they appeared 'coincidentally' on the evening we 'summoned' them. There are no images of this incident.  We were too stunned to stop and grab cameras.  We were afraid it would disappear. My friend is willing to corroborate this version of events, but does not want her name to be shared, as she still runs a client-based business and is concerned about appearances.",2020-04-09T00:00:00,48.7829,-123.7027

My kids and I were outside in our driveway at approximately 9:00pm on 10/16/17. My daughter drew my attention to many pinpoints of light flying overhead. They appeared to me to look and move the way a satellite appears in the sky however, they did not appear as if they were at height altitude because the pinpoints looked brighter and just seemed like they were not that high in the air. As I stated they tracked like a satellite, we’re moving in the same direction and not uniform. They moved at different speeds with some passing others, The speeds were not that fast while some moved faster than others. No audible sound. There were probably no more than 5 in any given ‘row’. This phenomenon was observed for at least one minute as we just looked up in amazement as they passed up. This event scared my 12 year old daughter. I have never seen anything like this and could only compare the points of light to how a satellite looks in the sky having only seen one at an! astronomical meet. I told my daughter that this is what a  UFO is. It only means that we don’t know what it is, not that it must be alien. At that time I could only guess that could have been drones which I also found hard to believe. A coworker told me it could have been re-entry debris form a satellite or something. I have just today discovered that the Pentagon has developed drone swarms. I would expect a drone swarm at night to look like what we  saw.

I am sure of the day, but not the year. It was Fourth of July in early afternoon.  I went into my large backyard and happened to glance up.  The sky was bright blue and small white clouds were traveling northward. There was one large cloud to the near northwest that was the same color as the rest, moving (sort of bubbling in place but not changing position in the sky). The smaller clouds were moving past it, above and below. Then I realized that the large, stationary cloud was mostly concealing an enormous craft. I noticed it because most of it was concealed by the cloud, except for the front and about 4 or 5 dark openings.  The color of the craft was a pale, washed-out gray.  From my vantage point, I couldn’t tell whether I was seeing a side view of a disc or of a cigar-shaped object. The overall effect was like seeing the nose of a cruise ship peeking out of a cloud.  The structure I could observe resembled a 3-layer cake. The top layer was the smallest and had no openings. The second layer was larger and wider, and had about 4 or 5 dark, vertically rectangular openings, being a bit wider at the bottom. The rest were concealed by the cloud. The third layer was still larger and had no openings that I could see.  I don’t know how big the craft was but judging from what I saw, it must have been hundreds of feet across.  I have never doubted life beyond that on Earth, so the sight didn’t much affect me. I went back in the house, came out again five minutes later and it was still there. It was gone about twenty minutes after that. I should have had the presence of mind to photograph it.  I have told my wife and two other people about this.

It again stopped for 2-3 seconds then zipped well over 7 miles towards our right (south of us only 1/2-2/3 miles from us ) and stopped again.   This time 5-7 seconds... it was bright but non familiar glow slightly pulsing.  Though it was bright - it didn’t light up the mountain side like I would have thought it should .   Like a helicopter searchlight would .     Then zipped straight past the horizon line away from us to the south in about 1 second or less .           From my experience in the military, there is nothing that accelerates like that then comes to a complete stop !      The g forces alone would crush a pilot !      Drones ( even the! classified ones ) use a propellant and would leave a sonic boom !     Nothing , not a single sound was heard .    The mountains, usually loud with ambient sounds were silent.         We called this hotline to see if anyone knew what we saw and the guy answering was rude .

We stopped to take a leak and change a diaper or two on our youngest .    But thinking back I’m not sure why .    Most likely I was so puzzled by what we saw we were going slower than the speed limit .   We were tired so not sure if that’s anything like “ missing time “.      Those of us who have young kids know what I mean ..   the whole day is “missing Time” when you have kids .

I pulled off highway 195 just south of Uniontown to look at beautiful cloud formations, some of the cloud formations were dramatic others visually unusual.  Looking west at the clouds, a small area of them were opening up and separated enough to reveal a portion of a UFO floating in the sky. The visible portion of the UFO seemed to represent the classical disk/saucer shape with highly reflective body surfaces.  The bonus for me was that I had not seen other descriptions identifying a triangular structure along the top edge of the craft.  The triangular structure ran from a point high on the fuselage, its vertex, to the full outside edge circumference of the craft where its height above the center of the craft appeared to match the height of the point where it merged with the fuselage.  It looked like the outside surface of the triangular structure was made of the purest of gold, highly reflective with a bright golden color. The pattern on the golden structure consisted of square panels that each appeared to be slightly concave.  Each panel appeared to have engraved patterns something like hieroglyphics distributed around the outer 2/3 of each panel.  The golden structure appeared to be a hollow port of some kind based on the end facing me that showed a darkening interior further back from the close end “opening” of that structure.  No heat waves were visible from the port or any surface on the ship. I could not see the entire ship but if it was a disk I estimate its diameter to be 200 feet or more.  I estimate the ship was sitting at an elevation between 600 and 900 feet above ground.  The ship stood rock solid at a constant elevation and did not move laterally in any direction.  There wasn’t the slightest noise or sound of any kind coming from its direction. I became worried that I might be detected by the ship, a situation that could end badly for me if they didn’t want to be seen.  I decided not to point my camera in its direction. Instead I began photographing a barn about 45 degrees north of the ship location.  When I looked back the ship was gone, the cloud opening was mostly there but not the ship. Since the sighting I have been looking for reports of similar ships but I have not seen anything like it.  So I prepared this report and two sketches of the UFO to share and learn if anyone else has seen a ship like the one I saw.  I made one drawing of the structure to be as detailed as possible and used it in the second sketch with clouds.  The second drawing shows the segment of the ship I saw through the opening in the clouds.  I apologize in advance for line work flaws.

There were no lights to be seen as it moved from the SE to the NW in the sky at about 100 to 300 ft above me, instead it had something I could only describe as either active camo or a cloaking device that was active as it moved. This effect made it easy to see in the sky as it sped by even in the dark, allowing me to estimate the craft to be similar in size to a B-52 or some similar sized plane or jet but without any features we would recognize today.  I wish I could say 100% that it looked like the so called TR3B but with how fast it was moving I could not get that clearest look at details that would lead me to believe one way or another but it was very similar to say the least.

It was a beautiful clear night and, due to a lack of light pollution, we could see the Milky Way. We were listening to music, enjoying the fire, our conversation, and just being together when we noticed a really bright star that got brighter as we watched. We were facing SE on that beach., the lake was calm and reflecting the lights of the homes across it like a mirror. We soon realized it was not a star, because it was moving slowly toward us. It was quite large and brighter than Venus, which planet had gone out of sight a bit earlier that evening, when we first spotted it. At first it got larger and brighter, then as it moved toward the NE it slowly dimmed and appeared to get smaller and smaller until it  disappeared from our sight, as if it had gone into space or just disappeared. It moved quite slowly but steadily. and was in view for about 10 minutes, perhaps longer. We are avid sky watchers and are familiar with satellites, planes, choppers, the space station, and drones, it was none of those; it was much slower than any of those move across the sky and we could hear nothing after turning off the music to check. All of us kept saying to the others ""Are you seeing this?"" and of course, we all were. I'm not exactly certain what time it was; obviously, it was after 9 PM, because it was full dark and Venus had gone behind the hills to the NE quite a bit earlier.

I was pulling into my garage of my apartment complex in West Fargo on July 1 at 9:20 pm.  I began to back my car into the garage, when out of the corner of my eye, I see something in the sky.  I put my vehicle into neutral and pulled the parking brake before exiting to get a closer look at what it was.  As soon as I put my eyes on the object I knew it was something I had never seen before.  It was a metallic sphere around 3 feet in diameter, the color was dull but I could tell it was solid metal. At first eye contact I was about 50ft from the object and it was hovering 5-10ft above the power lines that run perpendicular with the road. As soon as I consciously thought, ""That's a ufo"" the object began to move.  I ran closer to the power lines and began to pull my cellphone from my pocket to record video. The object moved quickly north east directly into the wind. It moved how i would describe ""on a rope"" as if it was not affected by the wind which ! is strange for a typical object of that size like a balloon.  I would estimate the object went from standstill to moving around 30mph in under 5 seconds. After I finally was able to retrieve my cellphone from my pocket and open the camera to record I estimate the object was 2000ft away from me and at an altitude of 1000ft. The video i recorded you can see the object but its very small and you cant get much from it other than that it confirms I did see an object. After I recorded for around 10 seconds I watched it go directly into a large storm cloud and disappear from sight. I believe its important to add that I believe im a credible observer who is unlikely to misidentify a drone or balloon being that I have lots of experience with drones.

I scanned the sky and identified the source of the sound.  The object appeared stationary with nothing else around it.  I noticed also it appeared to be slowly rotating and the sound was changing.  I decided to grab my camera and after many attempts got 1 decent photo.  The sound started to change and I would say sounded like a pulsing rocket engine.

I told my friend it was coming his way but he could not see it.  It slowly turned to the west and drifted over the bay.  After the craft went out of site a single fighter jet came over the house in a broad turn on a similar course, but with a wide berth like it was flying in a much larger circle.

I told my wife, and she said to get off the phone and try to record it.  I got out of my car and looked up and saw a craft, shaped like a letter t, or a cross.

After the fireworks displayed in my neighborhood had died down, I stood outside awaiting more fireworks to start blasting around again.

At first, I thought it might have been a helicopter or a plane with large lights, but then I thought that lights from an airplane cycle through red and white lights and there was no noise coming from the object.  I know a helicopter at a far enough distance can’t be heard but they were coming in from the southeast and heading northwest past my area and at the closest distance I still couldn’t hear anything from the flying object.

All of a sudden I saw a small, distant light that looked and moved just like a satellite, traveling North Westernly over Minneapolis.  Nothing strange there. Suddenly there was a flash of light around the satellite-thing and it stopped moving right where the flash happened.  It stopped very near to a bright star - or maybe a planet - in the sky. If I held my hand out at arm's length the distance was probably the width of my thumb from the star/planet to the satellite that just... uh... parked. A strange pale blue ambient light appeared around the star, then flickered and moved toward the satellite.  This is by far the strangest part of this experience.  It almost looked like light warped by gravity around a black hole or something, like a teardrop shape, and the tip of that shape was going toward the satellite/UFO, almost like it was sucking energy out of the star.

I quickly lost sight of it, but think it may have changed directions.

I looked up at a 45 degree angle and there was a chrome/ mirrored oval / LP Gas tank (like you see on farms) type of craft approximately 6500-7500 feet in altitude. It was moving slowly from East to West and then stopped and hovered for a few seconds as I pulled to side of road. As I lifted my I-phone to take a picture, the craft dropped behind the cloud. I took a few pictures and one of them came back with why appears to be the nose/tip of the craft stick out of the cloud. There was no exhaust, noise or light other than the sun reflecting off of the chrome body of the craft. I stayed and continued to look up for 15 - 20 minutes but never saw the craft again. The height of the craft was based on average altitude of cumulus clouds. I would estimate the cr! aft to be approximately 45-55 feet long and around 10-12 feet high.

On July 24th, 2019 at approximately 1730 myself, a representative from the German Forestry Service, and a local hunter were standing at the parking area of a lake belonging to the Grafenwoher Bundesforst, at which I raise fish for sale and consumption. At the time, Combined Resolve, an annual training event, was being conducted by US Forces and there were several UH 60 Blackhawk helicopters maneuvering in the area. To the north was a tree line, the lake was to the south, and the sun was still high in the sky to the southwest. The parking area which we were standing on was between the tree line to the north and the lake to the south. It was very hot, with almost no clouds in the sky. The representative from the forestry service pointed towards the sky to the north, directly above the tree line, and said ""What in the world is that?"" Myself and the other individual looked to the spot where he was pointing and saw only a commercial airliner. The airlin! er looked to be at cruising altitude so I assumed it had come from Nurnberg International airport to the west. We both asked him what it was he was referring to as we could only see the airliner. He said ""There was a bright light there, behind the plane."" Moments later the light appeared and myself and the other individual both acknowledged it. It looked as if an extremely bright planet or star had just appeared but, being that the sun was still high in the sky I knew that this could not be the case. The light was a bright white, almost like a xenon lightbulb, but the intensity was incredible and it did not radiate. It truly reminded me of what Venus looks like as opposed to a star in the night sky. It was a very bright day with the sun still high in the sky to the southwest but the light was nonetheless extremely bright. It then faded to the point of no longer being visible, then reappeared and disappeared in irregular intervals. The light was directly above a tr! ee, above and behind the airliner. As the airliner passed by t! he light remained stationary. We watched the light appear, disappear, then reappear for approximately two minutes and, using the tree below it as a guide, I could tell that it remained mostly stationary in the sky. It is important to note that when the light was off we could see nothing in the sky where the light had been.  After observing the light for approximately two minutes, the representative from the forestry service went to his vehicle and retrieved a pair of binoculars. These were the kind used by hunters and were of very good quality and very high power. The other two witnesses passed the binoculars between each other, saying that they could now see an object where the light had been. One of them said he couldn’t tell what it was while the other stated that it looked like “a balloon.” When the binoculars were passed to me I looked through them and could clearly see a triangular object with a dark, almost black rim around the outer edge and three black circles at each end of the triangle. Although I never saw the lights come on while looking at the object through the binoculars I assume that these three black circles had been its source. I lowered the binoculars and looked without them at the object. The light came on and it once again reminded me of a planet or the ISS reflecting the sun's light as you might see it at night; albeit much brighter. After a few seconds the light turned off and I put the binoculars back up to my eyes and could once again clearly see a triangle shaped object with three black circles at each end and a dark outer edge. The shape of the object reminded me of a billiard rack, standing upright on one of the flat edges. The tips of the triangle were rounded. We observed the object for about five or six minutes, and during this time it moved only slightly to the east. We continued to pass the binoculars around, each of us looking at it and commenting on what we saw. I also observed what seemed to be something either coming out of or protruding from the object, extending downward and vertically from the bottom. The ""protrusion"" was about three times the length (top to bottom) ! of the object. At a couple of times during the observation I saw the object turn slightly to the west and could see at this point that the object had depth. When the object made this slight westerly turn the sun, which was still high in sky to the southwest, reflected brightly off of its surface.  I happened to be holding the binoculars when the lights turned off one final time. This time, however, the object disappeared as the lights turned off. I could no longer see it although I had been looking directly at it. I lowered the binoculars and said to the other two ""I think it's gone."" I raised the binoculars again, found the spot above the tree where the object had just been, and saw it as it rapidly accelerated to the east and out of the field of view of the binoculars, still oriented in the manner it had been the entire time; like a billiard rack standing on one of its flat surfaces. I attempted to find the object in the binoculars again but was unsuccessful. We did not see the object again.  In hindsight, there are two things that now seem notable about the physical appearance of the object: The first being that without the assistance of the binoculars the object was not visible. This makes me think that the object must have been very high in the sky or very far away. The commercial airliner that had passed by a couple of minutes earlier was clearly visible to the naked eye. This object was not. The second thing of note was that when looking at the object through the binoculars it seemed as if the entire object was covered in a haze, much like when heat radiates from hot surface on a hot summer day.  I am a contractor working for the US Army and have worked as a member of and with the US military in various capacities for 21 years. I hold a current TS/SCI clearance. I know what military aircraft look like. This object was not a drone, it was not a plane, it was not a helicopter, it was not any conventional military or civilian vehicle that I know of. Because this sighting occured over a US military installation near live fire ranges I did file a report with the range control firing operations Officer in Charge.",2020-11-05T00:00:00,,

It was dusk/ almost dark so perspective was weird, but the tree line ended up obscuring it from my vision after driving by.

Mid-day sighting against blue skies. Roughly 20 white objects in a pretty tight formation, with one in lead at center of line which was parallel to the horizon to start. No rumble, roar, or any noise we could associate with the grouping.  I was working at about 10,400' in Crested Butte, CO and the formation was several thousand feet above us (two other witnesses in my immediate company). All facing South, I estimate our viewing angle never rose above 70 degrees, starting at 0-5 degrees to our Western horizon. Visual contact started just over the Maroon Bells and was maintained until it passed in front of the Sun, where we all lost it within a few seconds of each other. Looked roughly like this if against a horizon you are facing dead-on “........:........”  The distance covered from where contact started to where we lost it against the sun, at our altitude, is over 7 miles, and again these were several thousand feet above us. I had to research tundra swans after the sighting to see the altitude and speeds they fly at even in jet streams and I couldn't find any flocking birds that would be that high in our area. The entire sighting lasted 90 seconds to 3minutes max. We all remarked that the formation was moving at jet-speeds but I have no recollection of their speed changing or stopping at all. Stayed constant.  The ones in back behind “the leader” were all sort of jockeying for position, though. They made only lateral moves to either side and they did it throughout the sighting. No”hitting the brakes” and swooping around from behind. They were all staying in line but sort of hopping over one another to their port-starboard, back and forth.  Very strange. I have followed the “Colorado drone swarm” story and know satellites cause a lot of confusion but this was midday and these were well above over the counter drone heights that match other reports even the FAA conclusion.

Shortly after entering the expressway traveling northeast at a 7:05pm, we noticed a helicopter in the distance zig zagging back and forth across the expressway and behind it was a single orb-like light relatively low in the air. 	We decided to keep our eyes on it because it seemed unusual.  After watching it for 2-3 minutes, it became two lights.  Whether it split or manifested, as a third one does later, I don’t remember.  At this point we were traveling in an easterly direction with the path of the expressway. 	Immediately after splitting, one light rose higher in the air and towards the north just to the left of the expressway and the other dropped lower down but still to the left.  The helicopter moved further away to the right side of the expressway right after the second orb appeared. 	I told my daughter to immediately start filming the lights.  The two videos were recorded on her iPhone 10.  After recording 25 seconds of the two orbs she stopped recording for some reason.  Since I was focused on the road and orbs, I didn’t realize it at the time. 	 It was then we realized the two orbs had turned into three.  It was difficult to see because the lowest orb was behind the very high netting of a driving range facility when it happened.

It looked like a golf ball suspended in the sky.  I could see it had dimension with my naked eye, but found it very hard to capture it with my phone camera as clear as I could see it.  The object did not move, it stayed stationary the whole time.  We watched it for about a half hour.  We went inside for about 15 minutes and when we returned the object was gone.  The sky was clear, not a cloud in sight, so it simply disappeared and didn’t just move in the sky like the moon would or any other celestial object.  I shared the pictures I took to our local Facebook forum to see if anyone else in town had seen the object as well.  No one else claimed to have seen it, but many had explanations, all of which were not possible.  Some had suggested it was the International Space Station, and to my knowledge the space station moves in the sky.  This was stationary and seemed to be in our atmosphere, not in orbit, because I could see it had dimension (shadows on the edges).  Others had said it could be a weather balloon, but again, it would have moved, even a little.  I would love to hear some professional opinions.

On 7/29/20 at about 2130 EST I observed what at first I took to be a satellite. It was a small point of white light similar in appearance to a dim star. I initially observed it WNW of my location, at about 45 degrees elevation. What drew my attention to it was that it increased in intensity to about the brightness of an average star, then went dim. After about 10 seconds, it increased intensity to about the brightness of Venus, then went dim again. I estimate that each “pulse” took about one second to complete from off, to on, to off again. It was much slower than a strobe or blinking light that one would see on conventional aircraft, and was a gradual increase and decrease in intensity.  The object continued alternating this high/ low pattern about every 10 seconds. It was moving slowly from its WNW location across the sky, almost overhead, heading approximately SE, and was difficult to track as when it was not pulsing it was not visible to my eye. As it rose from about 45 degrees to about 80 degrees, it “pulsed,” and also appeared to emit white sparks. It very much had the appearance of a sparkler type firework, but the sparks were only a few in number and lasted for a brief second. I initially thought the object had changed course due to the appearance of the sparks, but soon again saw it continuing SE repeating the pulsing pattern.  I eventually lost sight of it when it was approximately SE of my position at about 45 degrees. I estimate that the object was visible to me for approximately 10 minutes. It is possible it was a military aircraft of some sort, but I have never seen or known them to behave this way.",2020-11-05T00:00:00,40.8393,-73.2797

Approximately 10 minutes after our arrival, we saw this extremely bright, pulsating object appear over their roofline moving west to east/northeast at a somewhat steady pace from what we could tell. It was about the size of a golf ball held at arm’s length. When my husband first set eyes on it, he saw it as a spinning sphere-shaped object. When I looked at it initially, it was an odd shape – like a rectangle with a circle at one end. It was not a Chinese lantern, satellite, or anything else familiar to us. It was difficult to tell how far away or above us it was. As we faced south, it appeared to the southwest at a 40-degree angle from us. We did not see any lights on it that would indicate it was an aircraft (red, green, or strobe lights), and it was silent. It was sphere-shaped, bright white with other purple-blue flashes of color and appeared to be pulsing and spinning. It was difficult to focus on with! your eyes to see any distinguishing features.  Our friend tried opening a Stargazer app on her phone to see if it showed as a satellite, and had trouble getting her phone to cooperate. While that was going on, which was maybe 3-5 seconds, I looked back towards the sphere/light and noticed the object changed altitude somehow when it was about 90-degrees in front of us. It was now about the size of a dime held at arm’s length and about to pass behind a tree in the next neighbor’s yard. My husband had been trying to video the object when it was closer but the camera app crashed and he had to reopen the app and try again. He jumped up onto the deck bench to have a higher perspective and was able to begin the video recording after it passed behind the tree. The object was now to our left (southeast) at a 20-degree angle from us and at a much higher altitude.  The sighting lasted a total of about a minute before it disappeared to the east-northeast at an 80 to 90-degree angle from our position.  After zooming in on his video later, and watching it frame by frame, it was morphing between shapes and colors mentioned above. He took screenshots from the zoomed-in video, and took a screen recording of the original video zoomed-in on his iPhone.  My husband is an engineer, has an FAA Airframe & Powerplant license, and is an amateur drone pilot. I work in accounting and was once a private pilot.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,41.533,-87.8898

With such close proximity if it were a small plane or helicopter it would be reasonable to assume there would be some kind of noise generated by the object, but there was none.  Over the space of about 20-30 minutes I just kept looking out the window and it was still there. I decided to try to take photos and videos of it with my cell phone to see if that would make it more clear by possibly bringing it closer to view. The one still photo I took was just a yellow dot. I did notice that the finder mechanism on the phones camera that usually detects faces or something to focus on immediately focused on the yellow light, which I believe those cameras only detect and focus on artificial light sources because I have not seen the focus pick up on natural light from stars or the moon.  I then took two videos with my phone and then went back to bed. I did not actually watch the videos until September 9th. I was not expecting to see anything other than a yellow dot. When I watched the videos, I noticed the object was moving a lot more than I was able to notice just viewing the object in the sky at the time. So, I then expanded the video and that is when I realized the object appears to be spinning and moving a lot and throwing off a lot of light.  I showed the video to my daughter on the evening of September 10th. Then last night on September 11 at 9:30 pm I saw what appeared to be the same light in roughly the same location. I took a few more short videos and have included the one the seems to show the object the best.  I told my daughter and son in law on the 25th and they also observed the light from their bedroom window in the same apartment as me. On September 11th my daughter and I both stood on the deck taking videos of the light together.",2020-11-05T00:00:00,43.3055,-71.3158

Upon stepping out to see why, the group of maybe 100+ birds got even louder. Almost like the sound of a loud creek or river.  As I walked up to examine why, Many orbs ascended slowly out of the tops of the trees.  They were *very* close and I could see them well.  Each orb was about the size of a soccer ball. Every sphere resembled a soap bubble, except they were all perfectly uniform, perfectly sphere, crystal clear.  As the swarm rose higher, the group of about 30 orbs began to form two seperate clusters.  They then became either much more reflective of the sun at a higher altitude, or, they possibly began to emit their own bioluminescence or possibly mechanical light; as they became much brighter as opposed to translucent.  Once they had achieved an altitude at about twice the height a drone would fly, the objects then began doing 'maneuvers', and forming geometric shapes and patterns such as triangles, 90°angles etc. By the time myself and a second witness ran inside to grab a better camera and return, the sighting was over.",2020-11-05T00:00:00,47.21257223776224,-122.4597204895105

We were facing east and I had a view of a clearing between a horizon of trees. The weather was clear skys and comfortable.  I saw a yellow/orange orb in the clearing, off in the distance, traveling south to north. It did not seem to be moving very fast horizontally (about the speed of a plane) but it was zig-zagging vertically fairly fast. Almost like it was bobbing back and forth. It also seemed to get brighter and dimmer as it moved. I stared at it for a few seconds and then told my boyfriend to come and look.  I walked into the front yard to get a better look and by the time he got to were he could see it, it was gone. Approximately 10-15 seconds total to cross the clearing and go behind more trees. I told him what I saw and he joked with me that I was making it up.  We went back and sat down on the porch for a few minutes before I saw another yellow/orange orb following the same path as the previous one. This one was a bit smaller, about half the size as the first. This one did not seem to be zig-zagging but was slowly flashing like the first one. Also, it was traveling in more of a slight arc, or uphill angle than a straight line. I went back into the yard and my boyfriend quickly followed.  Just as I looked back into the sky there was a 3rd yellow/orange orb of light with the same characteristics as the 2nd one. It was following the 2nd one but was traveling lower. These 2 were moving just slightly faster than the 1st one and were not as bright.  We went back and sat on the porch and talked about what we saw. Not long after that we started noticing there was a lot of air traffic above us. We live near an airport so it's not unusual to hear and see planes but they typically follow the same path each time, just a hair west of our home.  We saw planes in every direction for probably 20 minutes, including a couple helicopters. The first 5 minutes it was like they were coming and going from all directions. It almost seemed dangerous. We saw at least 10 planes in that 5 minutes. Then we could tell a few of them started just going in circles/ovals. There was one to the south that seemed to be moving fast and in tight ovals. It looked like a plane but I'm not sure if a commercial plane could turn that fast. It could have been a helicopter.  After the initial 5 minutes of chaos there was a loud roaring that sounded like it was right over our house. It was louder than any plane we've ever heard go past in the 6 years we've been here. It sounded exactly how you would think a flying saucer would sound when its hovering over you and about to abduct you! You could feel a vibration in the air and in your body. It lasted around 5 seconds. I ran out in front of the house as soon as it stopped and saw a normal looking plane following the normal path to the airport. It was just very odd.  Everything just died down after that and there was no air traffic.",2020-11-05T00:00:00,39.5825,-86.3679

I was walking from my class at Uconn. I forgot about the video until the next morning. When I watched it I noticed a craft flying through my scene so rapidly and when I enlarged it the boxy shape looked like nothing I’d ever seen before. I noticed it hovered for a brief second then sped into the clouds and disappeared. When I slowed down the footage it was still moving very fast but I could clearly see it stopped in mid-air for a fraction of a second then continued. I showed it to a pilot from Delta that I knew and he said it truly looked like something not from this world so I decided to report it. The shape looked cigar like however when enlarged and pixelated it seemed to have giant rectangular wings, an elongated nose with a dark patch which looked like a pilots window and ! a very short tail that could barely be detected. I did not see it with my naked eye or notice it however when I watched the footage and especially when I slowed it down there was a strange sound that was in the background, almost like a zoom and a whoosh that could e been used on a sound track to indicate fast flight.

It moved westerly and my visual ended when it went below the roofline of the shop in my neighbors’ backyard.  Initially I thought it was the planet Mars, just particularly brilliant.  But when I realized it was not stationary, I snapped a quick photo and then returned to the house to get my husband.  We both returned to the backyard and it was moving and seemed closer to us and moved westerly.  It appeared to have a whitish haze around the sphere that emanated about two times as wide (also circular habit seemed dimmer on the upper left side) as the red pulsing sphere and the aura lasted only a few seconds, then it returned to a solid pulsing red color (my husband saw it pulsing red and blue). I’m not even sure if I would call it solid.  It soon was starting to go behind the large silver maple tree in my neighbors’ backyard so I walked! about 40 feet south so I could continue to keep a visual on it.  I was able to capture several short videos on my iPhone and then it appeared to turn southerly and seemed to be moving away from us moving in a southwest direction and downward rather quickly.  This whole experience lasted  from  9:53-9:54 (21:53-21:54) before it moved out of my sight because a structure was blocking my view.  I believe it was about 50° off the ground when I initially saw it and when I lost sight of it, it was about 25° off the ground.  It appeared to be a bit larger than Mars is to the naked eye and I approximate it did appear to get a bit larger as it moved across the sky.

Hello and to whom it may concern: My name is ((name deleted)), I live in a small community in Alabama called Grant, which is very small, but still an enjoyable place to live. It’s peaceful and quiet. It’s a little bit of a drive to get to a larger city but it’s beautiful countryside to see. But what I’m about to tell you happened in the summer of 1979.  It was going to be my junior year in high school outside of the city of Monroe, Louisiana.  The company we worked for was called Geophysical Field Surveys, a company that searched for oil. I can’t remember the exact date but it was late in the evening, just as the sun was about to go down. The crew was finished for the day, and we were all at the pickup spot waiting for the van to take us back to the hotel. We were all just waiting like I said earlier, joking and winding down. One of the drivers of what was called a skidder that drove through the woods in order to deliver the cables that were to be laid out along the main cable. One of the drives, not yelling but in a louder voice, asked “What in the hell is that!?”  We turned and looked up and everyone got quiet really quick.  Floating just above the tree tops was something huge and blacker than the early evening sky was.  What was there was shaped like a like a han! g glider.  There’s no where near by where a hang glider could be launched.  The hang glider shaped object made no noise as it floated above the tree tops.  No one said anything as it floated above the trees.  When it was almost directly over head, we could see that there were no visible details under the bottom.  Again it was totally silent.  I can remember everyone standing completely quiet.  It was still moving across the tops of the trees and we all watched as it moved slowly out of our sight, still making no noise. After it was gone completely out of sight, no one said a thing.  We heard nothing about this thing in the news  after we got back to our hotel rooms.  The next morning there was still nothing on the news about anything weird being seen by anyone the next day either.  We didn’t get a very good look at the thing from the side angle but what view we did get, the “craft” didn’t look very thick though. Even though it passed almost directly overhead, it was difficult to judge just how wide the craft was.  I have always remembered this i! ncident because it was the first and only time I could say that I actually saw what could be described as an actual u. f. o..  There was no shiny parts on the craft that any of us were able to see.  It was totally black.  Like I said earlier, the memory of this has always stayed with me. I still to this day have no idea what it was, where it came from. When we all saw it, there was not a closed mouth among our group Not that we were all talking, but our jaws were pretty much on the ground. I know this letter isn’t very detailed, but if you or anyone there might want to talk about what happened let me know through either email or maybe later I can give you some of my other contact information.

I was working as a non-scheduled, on demand, commercial pilot for a company that was based in Wenatchee, WA.  I haven't checked the actual date in my logbook that this occurrence happened yet, but I estimate that it was late fall in 1992 (I'll verify).  Another pilot and I were paged at roughly 11:00 and informed that we would be picking up a United Airlines maintenance crew and tools at SEA and flying them to GEG to repair a 747, standby and then return them if they completed their task.  We were wheels up before 00:00 from EAT, picked up the maintenance crew/tools by 01:30 and arrived at GEG estimated 03:00.  After standing by for roughly 1.5-2.0 hrs, we were released to return as the crew would not be able to complete in a known duration. It was my leg as captain and we departed approximately 04:30-05:00.  It was a very low ceiling inversion that was only 200-300 ft and CAVU weather above. Immediately after departure, GEG tower informed us to contact Fairchild AFB instead of the usual/expected issuance of departure frequency.  The first officer contacted Fairchild and immediately after affirmation they advised us of traffic at 6:00 type/altitude unknown, unusual call in that we it was not just IMC conditions, but we were transiting over an active military airfield.  Several call and responses were delivered as they reported traffic rapidly moving from the 6 position to obviously overtaking us on the right side of out aircraft.  First officer didn't see until it was at out 3  position out of the eyebrow window above his seat.  At this point it was estimated to be several hundred above our altitude (we were still in a climb) and moved at such a rapid rate, later conversation between us confirmed that no typical aircraft could move at this rate.  When the UFO was off our nose and above us and in plain view, it literally went vertical and was gone in what we estimated to be 5 seconds. My first officer was very disturbed by this event and pursued getting civilian and military ATC tapes, but the military apparently doesn't need to release these transmissions unless requested from an entity other than a civilian.

At approximately 6:05 am (right where El Monte and Baldwin Park [in CA] meet), while driving on the freeway, in the morning blue sky I saw a very bright and very sharp chrome colored light about the size of large star in the sky at about 45 degrees up.  After watching said light for about 5 seconds and tripping out on its unique qualities, the light began to fade away very slowly and very smoothly.  The light did not appear to move. When I first saw the light, I thought it was a star (it was stationary like a star), but I quickly realized that it was far too bright outside (sky was blue) to be a star.  Then I realized that this light was far sharper than any star, and this light did not twinkle or change colors like a star.  It most definitely was not a star. I knew it was not Venus because again it was far too bright outside to see any planets, and the light I saw was much smaller than Venus which is huge during this time of year.  Also, Venus’s light has a clear white color whereas this light I saw a had a chrome or kind of colorless “color.”   Then I deduced it was not an airplane or helicopter because this object was stationary and there was only a single solid light, no aircraft body, no blinking lights.  At that time of day if it were an airplane or helicopter, I would have been able to see it. But it was just a light. It was at this point that the hair on the back of neck started to stand up and I realized this is VERY WEIRD! About One second after feeling this “omg!” feeling the light began to fade, but fade in a very kind of subtle and smooth way. It was an extremely smooth and measured fading of the light. As the light was fading, seemingly in reaction to my “omg!” reaction, I was yelling out loud (alone in the car) “what the heck is that! OMG! Its fading away!? What the f*ck!!! It was truly bizarre. The light reminded me of a magnifying glass focusing the suns light—it was a very sharp and very focused light, easily the sharpest light I had ever seen in the sky. And its chrome “color” was unlike anything I’d ever seen in the sky. If the light was fading because it was moving farther away from me then the light was heading to outer space.  From my location to the light’s location and angle, if it moved away from me it would be vectored towards outer space.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,34.0853,-117.9609

The entire time it did not exceed my current position in altitude - not trying to be too technical just trying to be accurate. It it was spinning it seemed to spin counterclockwise.

While talking, I noticed that there were a few bright stars or planets in the western sky.  As I was looking at them, 2 red side by side lights to the left of the stars caught my attention, flying in my direction, west to east.  I thought it was a plane, but I rarely see planes come from that direction so it was a little unusual.  I didn’t think much about it and continued my phone call. At this point something unusual happene.  The two lights began to slow down rapidly and came to a stop.  They stopped just before they would have flown over my building and out of my view (the building I live in has 46 floors).  I thought maybe it was a drone but it seemed kind of high in the sky and I did hear any sound coming from it. The person I was talking to said I said “WTF is that?”  I told him what I was seeing and he told me to take a picture of it.  I remembered I was on Bluetooth and my phone was on the kitchen counter.  I rushed inside, got my phone, came back outside to take the pictures.  When I looked up to find the reds lights, there was now only one small red light visible, still stopped in the sky.  I took 4 pictures of the sky where the light was, brought the phone down to switch to video but when I looked back up the light was gone.  So I took a picture of the western sky where the bright stars or planet were. My friend on the phone was listening to my commentary while this was going on and said I sounded like one of those people on those UFO shows while it was happening.  We laughed if off, I couldn’t explain what I saw so I decided to drop it.  About and hour later I decided to look at the photos I took.  I realized then that I captured the red light in the photos.

On Tuesday February 25, 2020, at precisely 6:10 AM MST, I was leaving my residence and decided to look directly upwards into the night sky to observe the stars.  It was a compulsion I had that I normally do not perform.  At this time, the sky was clear and still dark.  There was no moon present, at least not in my visual field of view. I noticed a moving object high in the sky – at what I would estimate to be in the high upper atmosphere or beyond – I would say a lower satellite.  And that is what I thought, it was a satellite traversing from west to east (measured from 260° W going towards 80°E).  The observation was made close to 50.923767, -114.122889 – Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  I was looking directly up and possibly 2° from the vertical and facing North – I want to stress,  I was looking nearly upwards.  My view to the north was blocked by my house and my back was to the south – this is important later. At first I thought it was a satellite.  Having observed satellites for many years (being in my 50’s), I know what one looks like as they traverse the sky – and this one looked no different than them.  There were no flashing lights, it remained white without changing color and remained the same magnitude of brightness. What caught my eye was it was being followed by another moving light, at the same pace.  Not being able to judge height, and therefore distance, all I could do was record the time gap – approximately 5 seconds.  Stranger now, was a third, then a fourth.  I had counted 16 consecutive lights.  All matched the same speed and course.  NO DEVIATIONS.  There is no telling how many lights previous to my looking up had passed.  Also being late for work, there is no telling how many more were still in the cue.  These were not planes flying formation as this was a long linear line and no contrails. The lights covered an arc angle of approximately 30 degrees in the 5 seconds. This was absolutely not a series of meteors.  Too slow and no trails as well as brightness never wavered.  I have observed many meteors, both high atmosphere burn outs and low atmosphere brilliant ""burn outs"".  This was none of them. I am a professional engineer of 30 years who prides myself in being open but logical.  I thought that these could be satellites, so I checked the satellite map when I got to work.  Enclosed is a snapshot of the map (available on request).  My interpretation of the map shows NO satellites (at least 16 equi-distanced) directly above me from west to east.  The map was set to the time of my observation. I attempted to take a video, but it was too dark and the phone was not able to record the lights.",2020-04-09T00:00:00,51.04237871352785,-114.05744246242263

I was not using any equipment or devices to aid my observation.  The sky appeared free of any interference such as clouds, dust, or smoke.  I was not under the influence of any legal or otherwise substance or liquid. As I continued to observe the location given above, I briefly averted my eyes away from the sky and when my eyes returned to the area of Jupiter and Saturn, I observed a white dot moving quickly along a path slightly east of a midway line between Jupiter and Saturn, moving in a straight line from SSE to NNW.  At first I thought it might be the ISS, but realized it was moving too slow to be the ISS, having seen the ISS on several previous occasions.  The size and brightness of the white dot was comparable to that of the ISS.  I did not observe any flashing lights such as one might see when observing a high altitude airliner. After realizing that the white dot was moving too slow to be the ISS, I continued watching the white dot until it reached a point NNW of Jupiter/ Saturn, at which time the dot stopped moving.  It remained motionless but began to fade or diminish until it was no longer visible.  I continued observing the location where the dot was last seen to see if it would reappear, but it did not. After approximately 60 to 90 seconds, my attention was drawn to a moving white dot, identical to the first, in an area of the sky to the east of Saturn,  traveling in a SE to NW direction, from south of a straight line from Saturn to Jupiter to a location NW of Saturn/Jupiter, but still east of the line of the first white dot.  The description of this dot is identical to the first in size, brilliance, and color. After achieving a point NW of Jupiter/Saturn, this dot also stopped and as I watched it also began to fade until it was no longer visible.  I continued to observe the area of the last visible location of both dots to see if they reappeared, for a period of time of about ten minutes.

What I saw was a white Tesseract in the dead center of the orb, it was constantly in motion and pulsating. Completely silent. I wasn’t scared in any way, I was rather calm and just curious. As I started to back away, it started to move away slowly as well, up into the sky.

Earlier in the evening maybe 02:30, saw a bright light, not as bright as venus is now, but brighter than all the stars moving slowly upwards from  just below and to the west of the north star.  It moved slowly, about satellite speed, for only 1-2 seconds while getting much dimmer and dissapeared.   At 04:57 a little further west of the north star, slightly below it,  I think it came out from behind the tree top, nearly as bright as venus, faster than a satellite, at least twice as fast moving almost due east.  For only about 1-2 seconds it was bright, then it got dim, like a satellite and seemed to speed up.  At least twice as fast as a passenger jet.  If it was a jet fighter, it would have been not far away for that kind of speed, and loud.  There was no sou! nd.  Got very dim/disappeared near the north east tree tops.  Total of 4-5 seconds.

The Florida shoreline was only 1-2 miles out.  I surmise this by the two stationary lights that were slowly passing by as the vessel was proceeding back to its port in Tampa, at 13 knots. (As observed an hour earlier on the cruise ship tv in the main lounge.)   While I have tried to find the exact position of the cruise ship using a few online marine vessel tracking sites, I am disinclined to spend the $40-some fee to better pinpoint its location.  If you already have subscribed to the services of one of these marine vessel historical tracking sites, it would be easy to plug in the name of my cruise ship, and that time between 23:55 - 0:30 to find a more precise location of where the cruise ship was at.  With that being said, as my friend and I were kicking back and just looking out into the distance, I observed a white light traveling northward (right to left from my vantage point). While it was cloudy out, I could make out the object above with what looked like to be an airplane, that was between a half mile to one mile off the ground. In that it was traveling at an airplane low-level, and in that there was nothing else in the sky to view at that moment, I kept my eyes on it.  Mind you, its appearance was a blurred white object in the sky, akin to what an airplane would like as it was on runway approach withinin cloud cover.  What my friend and I saw next is why I am writing you now.  The northward white object disappeared (I chalked it up to a heavier cloud cover), and not more than 1-2 seconds later, a much smaller red light (an object that was the size of a satellite in the night sky) appeared where the white object previously was, and traveled a perfect 90 degrees left to it, which lasted 1-1.5 seconds, whereby the same red light made another SHARP 90 degree turn and traveled to my left, whereby, it made another SHARP 90 degree turn further upwards in the sky (resembling some kind of “inverted shooting star”…except shooting stars do not travel that direction!), and then it was gone.  The red light object never wavered from its path, nor its speed, nor its perfect 90 degree turns.  There was no mass to this red object I saw, and why I could see it clearly through the clouds - I do not have an answer for.  Perhaps it was its brightness.  My friend first chalked it up to a drone, but I demurred in that it was simply moving too fast (in both its white form, and in the red form).  She then said perhaps it was a laser, but I digress.  The area we were traveling past was not populated (as referenced, there were only two lights - period - on the horizon, and the skies were dark).  If the white light was some sort of spotlight, I would have seen something emanating from the ground.  And, if in the remote event it was someone else onboard the cruise ship with a large spotlight, the clouds would have been illuminated differently.  This light was definitely from within the clouds.  So ends my sighting.  This is the first time I have ever experienced such an unexplained night sky phenomenon.  I keep an open mind to life, and have a critical sense to my reasoning.  Perhaps this was some government project, but I am left stumped on how the close-white object transformed into a smaller red object, along with the fast speed, and the series of precise 90 degree turns, culminating with a trajectory high into the sky before disappearing.  Thank you for your consideration.",2020-04-09T00:00:00,,

I was on my way to work at the lumber mill, in Oregon.  It was December, about 5AM in the morning.  Coming up the road towards the mill, I looked up at the clear night sky and saw what appeared to be a large chrome ball. There were no lights on it, but the chrome seemed to be light itself, however, the air around it didn't have a glowing haze or anything.  It's hard to describe. I could see it was slowly following the river across the highway, near the mill. I slowed to a stop to watch it.  It moved awfully slow and I was taking in the detail.  It really looked like chrome, and I saw no windows.  It seemed to be about the size of a pickup truck.  It kept going until some tree obscured my vision, and I started to drive up the driveway to work. I was in awe of what I saw. It didn't occur to me to grab my phone to snap a picture, however, I have a cheap phone with a bad camera, and the photo wouldn't have come out in the night sky. The mill is a large complex a! nd has many tall lights.  It seems the object may have been inspecting the mill, perhaps trying to discover what it was.  I discussed this with my uncle who was a Green Beret in Vietnam, and who did 27 years in special Forces.  He told me he has seen the chrome ball 3 times in Mexico, and one flying saucer about 30 feet above his head.  He also claims that some “men in black” showed up to his house in Mexico, while he was away, and the neighbors told him about it.

The grounds encompass ±1,000 acres and include a public airport (PMP), Goodyear Blimp operations center, horse stables, outdoor shopping mall, municipal golf course and dog park.  My vehicle was parked in the public parking lot located at the southeast corner of the property, approximately 25-feet from a chain link fence that denotes the border of the airport grounds. I frequently park in that lot and have become accustomed to seeing aircraft take off from runways 28 and 33. The confluence of the runways is ±1,000-feet west of the fence line at that location. Airplanes that take off from runway 28 fly directly over the parking lot at a very low altitude.  The weather was clear and visibility was excellent. I had my (prescription) sunglasses on and was monitoring some thunderclouds that were forming off in the distance, to the west/northwest.  I was sitting on the tailgate of my truck, facing the airport. I’d just removed my shoes and was looking down at my feet when I heard an airplane making its way down the runway. I looked up to see a small prop plane that had just taken off from runway 33. It was headed south/southeast, moving right to left, and was ±50-feet off the ground when I focused in on it.  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed an object at a higher altitude that was moving left to right, in the opposite direction of (i.e. towards) the airplane. From my vantage point, the object appeared to pass directly over the airplane. I thought to myself “the pilot must have seen that.”  Because the object was much smaller than the airplane, I assumed that it was a helium filled party balloon. I looked away and thought how dangerous it was for something like that to be floating in the airspace of the airport.  Immediately, something didn’t sit right with me. I looked back, relocated and started tracking the object. I watched it very closely for ±5 seconds until it was out of my view. It definitely wasn’t an airplane, helicopter, balloon or any kind of drone that I’ve ever seen. I don’t know what it was.  It stuck out like a sore thumb, thanks in part to the contrast provided by the backdrop of the thunderclouds that were forming in the distance, but more so in the way that it moved. It moved effortlessly and never varied in speed or altitude. It was as if the object was gliding on an invisible track or rail. Most curiously, it seemed to be tumbling, every which way. Nonetheless, its trajectory was in a perfectly straight line and it was moving much faster than the plane. It was surreal.  The shape of the object has proven difficult to describe. It had no discernible points, edges or sharp angels. Rather, everything was rounded and smooth. It was slightly oblong, kind of like if you squished a football from end to end.  - It was the size of a large trash can or 55-gallon drum; - It was flying at an altitude 2 to 3 times higher than the airplane; - It was moving 3 to 4 times faster than the airplane; - It was solid black and not reflective; - It didn’t have any windows, doors, seams or markings; - It didn’t have any lights or make any sound; - It didn’t have any props or rotors.  Although there were other cars in the parking lot, no one else was around. Presumably, they were out on the trail. There may have been people on the golf course who saw it, as it flew right over it and out of my view.  I pulled out of the parking lot at ±7:15 PM.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,26.259570237239398,-80.18338936017254

Suddenly I heard an extremely loud noise that sounded like it was coming from all directions. The only way I can describe it is a whirring sound, like something going in a circular motion. I’d say it’s like an old washing machine but the noise didn’t sound crisp, it was dull.  The noise was accompanied by a strange feeling in the air, almost electric. I quickly got a bad migraine; I get them when there are drops in barometric pressure so I’m not sure if that was the case or the noise was so loud it caused one. The noise then abruptly left, and it sounded like it suddenly started down the road with the same whirring. Sometimes it would cut out and in again. Sometimes it would reappear near my house then move again. After about 10 minutes it stopped.  I thought I was the only one that heard it but then the town Facebook page exploded with reports of the same noise. Another person said it felt like the noise “vibrated her body”. More reported waking from a dead sleep to the noise and that it was like a bass tone because of the depth and feeling. The reports came mostly from the northern and central part of the town, but a few reported hearing it in the south, east, and west.  I saw a UFO once before, with my mom about 7 years ago. We were both skeptics, but our experience made us both believers. When this recent incident occurred I didn’t immediately think of a UFO, but when I felt the energy I could sense this was something not normal. I’m an academic with a MA working in a field that is very no-nonsense. I want to find an explanation for everything, but I can’t find one for this.",2020-11-05T00:00:00,41.7039,-72.5461

Her grandfather had a house near were we were.  Her and I went into the house and made a pot of coffee got some snacks and food for the children to eat and sat down at the table on the porch which was a screened in porch that was connected to the house without a wall they had taken down the wall between the kitchen and the screened in porch the table was in the screened in porch we were sitting and talking and I could see something in the back of her head and it just appeared. I looked at it and she turned around to see what I was looking at, cause she'd notice that whatever I was looking changed my whole demeanor. It went from my right to my left down to my right to my left again and I said “Bell do you see what I see. She says “yes I do”.  It came to the right again but it kept getting closer and it came up over o ur car which was across the driveway, the way we had the car parked, there was a driveway and then the cars would park facing the swamps with the back to the driveway. It hovered over our car about 10 feet above the car approximately 5 to 6 seconds and zoomed off Into the woods in the swamps. It was very large I would say 3 times the size of a car and it was shaped like a saucer the side slanted down there was a half round dome on the top than the bottom slant matched the top slant.  There was what looked like a band on the bottom with lights. The top set went right and the bottom set went left.  It was metallic. the lights were white like a car headlights.

Late at night at an unknown date, probably in the late 70’s, my mother glanced out of an eastward facing window in our Palouse area family farm house.  It was harvest time and she saw bright lights near the top of a hill to the east southeast.  At first she thought that it may have been a combine working at night but this was our property and our machines were all parked for the night.  As she looked closer she was able to see what she described as a “wing shape” silhouetted against the night sky with several white lights visible.  She awoke my father who also observed the phenomenon as the object drifted slowly away to the east southeast and out of sight behind the hill.  At another late night date my mother was awakened by our dogs barking frantically in the back of our home which faced toward the north.  She went out to see what was the problem and observed a red glowing globular object about the size of an automobile floating from east to west about 50 yards from where she stood behind the house.  Interestingly, when in a conversation with a couple that they had known for many years, my parents mentioned their experiences.  These people related a similar experience one night on a county road nearby where a similar red globe was hovering very low, nearly touching the ground, in the middle of the roadway.  As they approached, slowed and stopped their vehicle the red glowing object shot vertically up and out of sight at great speed.  These people were so frightened by the experience they had never mentioned it to anyone until they heard my parents story.

So then 5 minutes go by and I look back up and the red dot/light was still there.  Obviously that wasn’t an airplane because it was one single red light and I thought of a helicopter but then again the red light looked like it was very far away and I heard no noise what so ever but I knew I saw that red light very bright and easily.

I decided to take my dog on a walk in a gravel pit down by the hay flats in Wasilla one evening.  Everything was normal with the walk and about 20 min into the walk my dog was getting cold and let me know he wanted back into the car. We walked back to the car and I let him in and as I unhooked his leash off of his collar I seen out of the corner of my eye 3 bright lights in the sky about 500 yards away and 250 feet in the sky.  The sky was clear and stars were out but these lights were dramatically brighter.  I turned my head and looked right at it and it was just hovering in one spot. I knew exactly what I was looking at and couldn't believe it.  Since I was out with my dog in an area with known wildlife that can attack people I did have my AR15 on my back but no way was I tempted to fire at it.  I set my rifle in my car and grabbed my Cannon DSLR camera and as soon as I had the camera the craft slowly started my way. To my luck my camera didn't have a memory c! ard so I found one as fast as I could. When I looked back up at it I seen a dark colored triangle with bright white lights at each corner of the triangle. At this time it was right in front of me making a gradual left hand turn. It had to be at least as wide as a Boing 727. Next it did something I never would have guessed. As it was turning right in front of my eyes I watched it shift from a huge triangle and turn into a military C5 Galaxy yet there was zero sound. It was about 100 feet away and now pointed away from me gaining altitude. It must have tried to camouflage itself but way too late. I had totally forgotten about my camera till this point so I raised my camera and couldnt find anything at all in the viewer. I took three hail Mary pics and watched the thing slowly disappear high into the sky. My 3 pics were shaky and blurry of corse but it showed the back of a craft with lights at each corner and also 2 red large engine looking things along the flat craft's back s! ide. I've never heard of a UFO changing into something more co! mmon for a viewer to understand but it makes sense it would disguise itself. One thing that I'm concerned about is that when I first seen it it wasnt fully dark out yet and when I took the pics and it was headed away from me it was pitch black out.
