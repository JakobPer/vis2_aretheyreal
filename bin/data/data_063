There was an unusual swoosh pattern, a large swoosh pattern.  The “stars” in the swoosh pattern were blinking in a sort of Morse Code way, as if they were talking to each other.  I went outside a few times until almost 2 am and they were still out there. Tonight (7/11) around 9:30pm  I went outside to smoke a cigarette and I saw a bright light above, as I looked up it dimmed greatly and blended in with the stars, that’s when I noticed it was moving fast across the sky, too fast to be a plane and too high.  I made my boyfriend come out and look. He also saw it, it went over my house so I did not see where it went.  I watched the sky and off in the distance over the houses across the street I spotted another one, blending in with the stars, I watched it – every “star” it passed brightened as it was passing it and dimmed again after it passed, I watched it until it disappeared - my boyfriend came out and saw it right before it disapeared.  Since there are street lights out front it was kind of hard to see, so I went out back (about 9:45pm) and kept looking up in the sky.  As I was looking at the stars, suddenly one started moving across the sky and as it was headed straight for another “star”, that star shifted right and let it! go by then it moved back into place. Another “star” that it passed started moving in the opposite direction.  There were greenish light streaks moving a little ways to the left of it.  I watched all of them until they disappeared. Then around 10:15pm I went out front again and saw yet another one moving across the sky, it did a zigzag then went straight. Each one of these things were visible for under 5 minutes each before they disappeared. It is now 12:22 am and I have gone out several times since then and have not seen them again.  I will keep looking and if I see them any more tonight I will post again. If anyone else reads this and sees the same thing please post it.  Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a star or planet?

Then disappeared beneath the treeline.  About 25-30 minutes later, my husband went out to see if the object had reappeared.  He yelled for me to come out and take a look.  The object was now moving in an unusual eratic almost zigzag form flying southeast.  We noticed 3 redish orange lights and then disappeared.  I have to say we are both feeling quite dumbfounded.   Once the object disappeared from the southwest was what looked to be a star moving in the same direction as the object and then also disappeared.   There was no sound, no lights blinking.  This was not an airplane or helicopter and I'm certain it wasn't a satellite.   We don'! t have too much knowledge on the unmanned military aircraft which I guess could be a possible.

We asked them to hurry up and look because this one was lower in the sky than the others we showed them were.  When the light was west of us for the heck of it I flashed my light at it twice.  I got an immediate response of a flash from this light. It went from a normal star sized light to almost a headlight sized light but very bright.   My wife immediately asked me to try it again and immediately it flashed again.  The time from the first flash to the second was no more than 20 seconds.

It was a bright white glow which appeared to be multiple lights with no colored lights. The speed and abrupt movement was nothing like I’d ever seen.  We were used to seeing and hearing jets in and around Phoenix but never at night.  Jets frequently broke the sound barrier over Phoenix during that time so we were used to seeing them and this was not one of them. There were 9 of us in the car.  My two parents and I were in the front seat and my 3 brothers and 3 sisters in the back seat.  My two parents and I saw it clearly for the duration of the event which lasted less than one minute or half a minute.  Four siblings saw the event and the other 3 were sleeping. It had to have been a weekend day because my parents would not have had us out that late on a week night. There was much commotion in the car and my parents, who were normally calm and serious, sounded alarmed and scared, which scared me.  The term UFO was not used; we all used the term ""flying saucer"" to describe it.  My father abruptly told all of us that we were never to speak of this again because the child welfare people would think they were crazy and unfit parents and take us away.  We never reported the incident to anyone. I mentioned it to my parents several years later in the 1980s and they both remembered the incident vividly.  In February 2009 all of my siblings were together and I asked if any of them remembered the incident and all four of them that witnessed it remembered the event. My parents are now deceased but all siblings are living.    Phoenix was a really small town back then.  South Mountain was a nice area, not a slum like today.  There were radio towers on top of the mountain.  From the top of South Mountain you can see all of Phoenix as well as Luke Air Force Base and Sky Harbor Airport (which was very small back then). I’m reporting it now because I thought there should be some record of the incident for posterity. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date in 1959.  PD))",,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

I was 17 at the time and living with them. The three of us went outside and Witness #1 directed our attention to two bluish-gray chevron or boomerang shaped objects low on the horizon.  They were identical in size, color and shape with one exception explained below.  Instead of being parallel to the horizon, both objects were perpendicular to it. The objects appeared to be about 1 mile north of us traveling west at very low speed, perhaps 5 mph or less.  The lead object was perhaps 500 to 1,000 feet in front of the second object.  We did not hear any sound from the objects, but I did not expect to since they appeared to be about a mile away. Witness #1 went back into the house and returned with a pair of 10 X 50 binoculars.  All three of us had a turn viewing the objects with them.  I noticed while viewing through the binoculars the top third of the second object was blinking into and out of sight (similar to a fluorescent bulb immediately after being turned on) at the rate of about once per second.  I was left with the impression the second object was experiencing mechanical problems or some sort of malfunction and was being escorted or possibly towed by the first object as the distance between them never deviated.

For the 13 years that followed, I assumed it was just a bad dream, that was until my Mother described having had witnessed something exactly identical that had also occurred to her 13 years prior, in the same location but on a different night. One evening in 1977, in a small apartment building in Hanna City, Illinois, I as a 5 yr old child, had been awoken to something that was incomprehensible and terrifying.  This particular night, I went into my Mother’s bed to sleep which was not routine for me. Sometime during the night, I was awoken by a strange cylindrical, machine-like object. It was approximately the size of a coffee can, maybe a little bigger. It hovered 3 to 4 inches off the floor and spun silently as it moved around the bedroom. There was a slight glow around this object and it seemed to almost have intelligence about it. How it got into the building, I don’t know. I was positioned on the right side of my Mother’s queen-sized bed, and she was asleep on the left. She never awoke during my witnessing of this object. I first noticed it as it entered through the bedroom door on the right hand side of the room. It was metallic and appeared to have sharp edges. After it made its entrance into the bedroom, it hovered in front of the foot of the bed going right to left. I could see its glow cast just below the foot before it had emerged into sight. It then proceeded to come back and make a turn around the right front portion of the bed and slowly approached me along the right side of the bed still hovering/spinning approximately 3-4 inches off the floor. As it made its way to just below where I was sitting watching it, it ascended up to my level. At this point I was paralyzed with terror, I could not scream or move. I lost all consciousness and never had another experience like it again. I have no memory of what occurred after that, what it was, or why it was there. 13 years later, when I was 18, the experience came up in conversation between Mom and I somehow, and I learned it was not just a dream. She had the exact, identical experience, same description, and same outcome as I did. Since then, we have been completely at a loss for an explanation of what it was. We have been trying to find other’s with the same experience/sighting. I have a feeling it may have been some type of alien drone or probe, for it wasn’t much like a ghost or apparition. I have read about hundreds of E.T. and UFO sightings, but nothing is described to like what my Mother and I witnessed. I have had only one actual, “typical” UFO sighting since that thing in the bedroom.  In February, 1994, at  Ft.  Leonardwood, MO.  Between the hours of 10:00 & 11:00, on a clear day, there was a silver, diamond-shaped UFO in the sky moving in all sorts of sharp angular directions, and traveling from one end of the sky to the other in just fractions of a second, which must have been at least 200 miles ground distance. I had no other witnesses, but I was fully coherent and aware of what I was witnessing. It was visible for maybe about a minute, and it took off and disappeared from sight. I have no question about the UFO sighting in Missouri, for it seems to be like one of thousands of accounts. But nothing compares to the mechanical-cylindrical object that both my Mother and I witnessed on different occasions without knowledge of each other’s experience of it. I would love to know if anyone has an idea of what it really was, what its purpose was, and why only my Mother and I had the experience with it. To this day, I’m baffled but open to any explanation.

On the night of December 15, 1992, I left Marshfield, MO and was going to visit a friend who lived just outside Elkland, MO.  As I was crossing the I-44 overpass at Exit 100, I noticed a bright gold colored light to my left.  It appeared to be no more than 100 feet off the ground and less than a mile west of me. Hundreds of people reported sightings of mysterious lights in the nighttime sky in the vicinity of Northview, MO (I-44 exit 96) in 1992, and I personally saw lights from a distance many times myself, and spoke to others who saw things up close, but this was by far the closest I had ever been to it. As I traveled west on Missouri Highway 38 toward Elkland, I kept watching this object.  The farther I traveled, the closer it got to me and no matter which direction I was traveling, it was always at my 10 o’clock position.  This was very unusual given the fact there were several 90 degree curves on this highway.  I could sense that I was being watched by whoever or whatever was in control of this object.  When it got to within a quarter mile of me, I decided to stop and look at it with my binoculars. I made a left turn onto Conklin Road, stopped and turned off my headlights and engine.  The object also stopped directly over Conklin Road about 1,000 feet west of me.  It was about 50 feet above the ground, totally motionless and soundless.  It was oval shaped and about 25 feet in diameter and approximately 12 feet from top to bottom. With my binoculars, I viewed the object for about 2 to 3 minutes.  It was the same color as yellow gold jewelry and had several black dots scattered randomly on it.  It also had a tiny bit of red on the very top I could only see with the binoculars.  It definitely was not a red light and it did not blink or strobe. The temperature that night was around 15 degrees.  I don’t know if this had anything to do with it, but I could see a distortion around the object similar to what you would see rising from and asphalt highway on a hot summer day. The car I was driving was equipped with a spotlight.  While standing there looking at the object, I decided to aim the spotlight at it and turn it on and off a couple times to see what, if anything might happen.  After carefully aiming the spotlight toward the object, I turned the switch on and off twice in rapid succession.  As I was turning the light off the second time, without a sound, the object went straight west and was completely out of sight in less than a second.  This was the last time I saw the object. What was really strange about this was the fact the object did not start at zero miles per hour and gradually increase its speed, but instantly went from zero directly to something like 2 or 3 thousand miles per hour without creating a sonic boom.

The object was large and saucer shaped with bright lights of different colors along its outer rim and on top and bottom.  The object was approximately 150' or more in diameter, and approx 10-20feet in height, and was stationary just above tree level and less than 100 meters from my postion.   I got a very good look at it.  The profile of the object was 'eye' shaped but it was round.  It made no! noise nor disturbance.  I watched it for a minute or so.

Almost immediately, I saw two bright orange balls of light in the sky, diagonally north of where we were driving. I yelled for her to pull over. We quickly parked in a parking lot facing the objects, in front of the Towpath Hotel. We jumped out of the car, and at that time, a man in another car pulled into the hotel and parked. We did not get his name, but the three of us watched this phenomenon together. These two objects moved at a very fast rate, independently, in all different directions, around each other, then they suddenly stopped and seemed suspended, parallel to each other. They were large and appeared to be at about the height that a plane would fly when descending. My friend took a picture on her cell phone. After a couple of minutes, the ball on the right very slowly seemed to recede and disappear. After it was completely out of sight, the ball on the left slowly receded, on a parallel path to that of the first one, until it disappeared. The three of us talked about it briefly, with all of us agreeing that they could not have been lights or aircraft that we’ve seen before.

On Wednesday night February 25th, 2009, at approximately 9:45 pm, I was going to my garage via my patio/deck and looked up to the skies, as I often do.  From that location I can see most all of the southern half of the sky (horizon to horizon), but only about 20 percent of the northern half and no horizon.  Unfortunately there is a utility company office and repair facility south of my home that has large floodlights, that are on all night and kind of fades out the horizon area directly south, but directly up and most of the southern sky is quite clear.  I am in the habit of scanning the skies at night for about 30 seconds, most every night, and sometimes more than once.  This night I did scan the southern sky and it was clear and all stars were very visible.  I looked to 12 o’clock straight above me and I saw what I would have to describe as one of those clusters of faint stars that you see in the sky on a real clear night that almost appears to be a circle of foggy light.  But, what I was seeing, was instead, an object moving very fast.  No light was emitting from the object, but most of the object was discernable by what appeared to be reflective light, but not sharp or bright.  It was a very dull, again as if it was one of those star clusters, but you could see that it was a hard object.  This object was moving extremely fast from straight above me towards the SSW horizon.  I believe that it was a very large object, very far above me.  It’s shape exactly was very hard to determine as the edges of the object were blurry and it’s apparently very fast speed.  It could have been round or triangular and appeared to be fairly flat.  If I had to guess, I would say that it was 10,000 feet or more above me, and with that size of an object, it would have to be traveling at several thousand miles per hour.  Within 4 or 5 seconds, it vanished as if it faded away.  The object made no sound.  I looked for and found a star cluster and it did have a similar size and appearance, except the object I saw, had a surface! look to it, especially in the center.

I pulled into the drive way and stopped about halfway down, opened the window, and turned down the radio to see if I could hear anything.  I could not hear any sounds other than the car engine. I parked the car and we went inside. I pulled out my Binoculars, went to the back porch and proceeded to watch the object. There were no visible flashing lights on the object.  It was a very bright whitish/orange and traveling at a steady speed in a North/Northwesterly direction. I observed aircraft pass over my house and in the distance, all with the telltale flashing lights. This object was considerably brighter than any light on an aircraft.  Too contrast, I witnessed an airplane pass under the object, in relationship to the horizon, and could easily see the flashing lights. I went inside and brought out our telescope to get a closer look at the object. I could not make out any visible edges, only light. The object seemed to pulse but never left it's course. My youngest daughter and I watched it until it vanished over the horizon. As a clarification: We live on one of the flight paths used by Dover AFB. We have seen combat helicopters, regular helicopters, Chinooks, A-10s, F-16s, and C130s pass over. Growing up, I lived near Andrews AFB, and we have a small airfield on the outside of town (about 4 miles from me) and Easton airport to the south, So I have a lot of experience with identifying aircraft.

The light initially appeared to be a shooting star, but was not as vibrant as a star and not moving as rapid as a shooting star either.   As the light moved over our heads heading towards the northwest, it appeared to be not just one light, but a group of about six lights in the shape of the letter V, or very similar to birds flying in a group.  The shape of the V formation was not perfectly symmetrical like you would see from lights on the tips of a commercial airplane. It took approximately 20 seconds for the lights to appear and to move out of sight towards the northwest.   The lights were not as bright as the lights that are on a commercial airplane.  In addition, there was absolutely no sound.   If these lights were coming from a jet or a commercial airplane, it would have to make sound moving at that speed which it did not.

He was looking up in the sky and noticed several sea gulls flying in circles.   Then he noticed a small white dot in the sky that looked like a gull but that was way higher in the sky.  He watched it for awhile and it didn't move.  It just hovered maybe 50-60,000 feet for awhile and then just dissapeared.  I thought he was just seeing things or that it was a plane.  The next day, I go to the pool with him and he shows me where he was looking in the sky and I was giving him a hard time laughing about the possibility that he saw a UFO when I notice there are a bunch of gulls flying around again.  As I'm looking at the birds, I notice this little white dot VERY high in the sky, definitely higher than commercial aircraft fly in the area.  It was so high it was really hard to tell what it was.  It wasn't moving at all which was creepy..  It was just sitting there.  I ran back to the house to grab my camear and binoculars.  When I came back, the thing had moved a little to the east.  I was able to see it in the binoculars but it was still super far away.  I could make out white, silver and a small glint of red.  I tried to zoom in with my camera and take a pic but when I switched from the binoculars to the camera I lost the object in the sky and couldn't find it again.  It totally dissapeared or just got so small on the horizon I couldn't see it anymore.  I'm totally baffled.  I somewhat believe in UFO's but I'm wondering if this was more like a government craft, the space station or some other explination but we're researched and the space station was nowhere near this area of the sky that day and there were no other reports of this sighting, except for a very similar post in San Jose July 2009 on this site.

Then I observed what I thought was a satellite until the satellite went from moving from a northern to southern direction to veering to a southwesterly direction.  Satellites do not normally change their directional course as they cannot.  They always move in the same direction without veering off course.  This satellite seemed to be dark gray in color and was silhouetted against the night sky. I saw this with my naked eye. Then I saw the similar flashes of light again.

I looked at the bike, shut the barn, and the night was so beautiful I just looked up at the stars.  The sky was so clear and the stars were so crisp, I wandered to the middle of the yard trying to pick out constellations.  Heck, the stars were so bright, they ALL looked like constellations, so I just decided to head in to bed, and as I lowered my eyes, I saw it!

It was a dark sphere, roughly 10+ times the size of the biggest star, with strobe-like blue, white and red lights flashing around it in all kinds of ways.  Like one of those kid's balls you hit and the lights go wild inside of it, only on the outside of what I saw.

It hovered, totally quiet, rising a little, or dropping some from time to time.  I didn't want to leave it for a camera or to get someone up for fear of missing it doing something or being gone.  I watched from my neighbor's side yard and for awhile and from the big empty lot across the street where the school used to  be.  I watched, and watched and watched, and it hovered and slid around totally quiet.  I watched and heard a few planes go by, and heard three trains pass through while I watched.  This thing made no sound.  I kept trying to see under or around it for something supporting it, or waiting for it to make some kind of move I'd recognize as a plane, etc.  Nothing.  After some time, it became harder to distinguish the color of the lights, and I realized it was getting smaller, and then I realized it was moving away from me.  It just kept getting smaller and smaller, bobbing around until it became just a pinprick like the st! ars, then it just disappeared down behind the trees.

We noticed a bright object in the early morning sky. We focused my video camera on it, we then centered the object on the video cameras screen, then paid no attention to it. We then talked about what we had seen earlier that night over the lake, then turned back to the camera, and noticed that the object had moved. We continued to observe the object until it suddenly disappeared. We thought that the object could have been a star, or planet at first but quickly realized that the earth simply doesn't rotate fast enough to account for how far the object progressed across the sky, and even if it were a star or planet the path it would have followed across the sky would have been entirely different. We then thought about the idea of the object being a aircraft, however I did not see any anti-collision, landing lights, navigation lights, or wing lights that were blinking at a timed interval on this object. The object appeared to be pulsating with no predetermined order, and flashing an array of colors. I further concluded that the object could not have been a aircraft because the object was on a eastern heading towards the rising sun so with that being said after the objects lights went off, the sunlight would have reflected off of the aircrafts fuselage still allowing it to be visible. I am former Air Force, and I have been around a lot of different airframes. I've seen many different aircraft in the sky, and I can identify all of the airframes the USAF currently has in service, along with a good portion of those in the civilian sector on sight. However this object doesn't appear to be any airframe I am familiar with. Let alone the object was traveling at a extremely low airspeed, which in most cases the majority of aircraft would have a very hard time trying to stay airborne at such a speed. Not to mention the object was either in or extremely close to the NO FLY ZONE located around the Perry Nuclear Power Plant near Madison, Ohio. I eventually lost sight of the object when it suddenly disappeared from sight. I saw it disappear with my own eyes, an my friend saw it disappear on camera. We managed to capture the object disappearing on tape and we analyzed it frame by frame the best we could. I will be posting the videos link and the images link for the frame by frame breakdown below so you can see what we witnessed for yourself.

It was moving in smooth fluid motions, not in a jerky manner. The flash from this object was very bright and constant.  We were watching this object for a couple of minutes as it was moving about the sky.  All of a sudden, we noticed another bright light in the sky fairly close to the first one sighted.  The second object seemed to be moving in a circular or looping motion.  The four of us continued watching these objects for another minute or so until both objects were either to far to see them any longer or they disappeared/vanished.  We did not see the second object moving towards the first object at all during this incident, it seemed ! to just appear close to it. When I returned home later in the day I tried to duplicate the brightness of the steady ""flash"" from the objects, I put a piece of aluminum foil under my overhead kitchen light with the shiny side towards the light bulb to reflect the light.

My wife and I had gone to the beach, as it was an unusually warm evening for mid-March. The sky was absolutely clear, with a sliver of a Moon that looked like a big smile, and tons of visible stars. I had spotted a satellite moving directly overhead moving from south to north, and we watched it until we couldn’t see it anymore. Just then, my wife says, “Look , there’s another one!”, and points due west. I turned to look, and I saw a  very, very bright white light moving from the west toward the east. The light had a blue tint to it, kind of like an LED light bulb is, as opposed to an incandescent bulb which is much more yellow. When I first turned and saw the light, it was at around 45 to 50 degrees, moving fairly quickly west to east in a straight line, it’s path just south of us. If I held an aspirin tablet between my fingers at arm’s length, that would be slightly larger, but reasonably comparable to the size of the light. It was by far the brightest thing in the sky.  As the light moved to about 85 degrees, almost directly overhead, it never deviated in intensity, flashed, or seemed directional in any way, like the headlight of a low flying airplane would. It then began to move in a wide arc toward the southeast. As it did, it began to slowly dim, until it was the size and intensity of  any random star in the sky. In fact, it now actually did look like a satellite, except for the fact that it was turning toward the southeast. We watched it for another few seconds, and then it just winked out. My wife and I were discussing what we had just seen, still facing the direction we had last seen it. I was excited, as I have witnessed the same type of light on two other occasions from my backyard (which, incidentally, faces due west), but I was always alone without any other witnesses.  As we were talking, there was a sudden bright flash of light, similar to a camera flash, at about 45 degrees, just a bit east of where we saw the light blink out, maybe 15 - 20 seconds before. We both looked up and saw what appeared to be 2 satellite sized lights moving  SE to NW in a path that would go directly over our heads. They were moving parallel to each other, although one was moving slower. As we watched, the slower one started to “pulse”. It was going from looking like a satellite, to slowly dimming until it was completely dark, and then slowly brightening back to looking like a satellite again. I then realized that the faster of the two actually was a satellite, as it continued ! across the sky in a straight line at the same speed. The “pulsing” light now started moving in a more northerly direction rather than northwesterly as it had been. It began moving slower and slower until it eventually stopped, hanging at about 55 -60 degrees in the eastern sky, doing it’s pulsating thing. As I turned back toward the northwest to see if the other satellite (which by now had passed by us) was still acting like a satellite (which it was), we noticed a small plane flying directly toward us at around 700 ft headed toward a small landing strip a mile or so down the road. I immediately looked back to the “pulsing” light. It grew dim and bright a few more times, then it stayed steadily bright, and looked like an ordinary star. The plane served as a comparison to the original light we saw come from the west. First, the plane’s headlight was very yellow in color and much dimmer. It also had obvious green and red flashing lights, and it was loud; very easily heard over the breaking of the waves, whereas the mystery light was completely silent. Also, the plane’s presence gave me a sense of how high the light was. I guesstimated the plane to be at about 500 - 700 ft and descending, which made me feel like the first time we saw the light, it was about twice that height. The second time, it looked as high as the other satellite, even though it was only 15 - 20 seconds later. My wife told me that when she first saw the light and said, “Look, there’s another one”, it was the size of a satellite, and in a fraction of a second, it was super bright and huge, which is right when I saw it the first time. After the plane flew by, the light, which was now stationary, and looked like an ordinary star, faded out and we didn’t see it again. I also wanted to say that during the first part of the sighting, my wife had a feeling of dread, and had started to cry. She kept saying, “I don’t like it.” over and over. I, on the other hand, was excited, and was extremely happy to have a witness with me.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,40.76192392638037,-124.13557055214723

It is also the brightest light in the sky, which also emits a faint pulse.  I believe it is masking itself as a star by maintaining a stationary position outside our gravity well giving the appearance of a star progressing across the night sky. Every night I watch it move in short erratic patterns, vertical, horizontal and circular, which I believe is to maintain its fixed position. In the past month I have discovered several other similar lights in the sky that I had originally thought were stars. My father, two of my sisters, my brother in-law, my mothers first cousin and her house mate and two of my friends, have all confirmed what I have been watching for the past three months. I do not drink or take any kind of mind or mood altering drugs.  All of the above mentioned people were sober at the time they confirmed my sighting.  I am not looking to be put in the public eye.  I just want somebody to come out and verify my sighting, which has been ongoing for the past three months. PS This is not a one time occurance!  It is an on going event every night. So if you decide to come out, you won't be dissapointed! If what I'm seeing is real, and if I'm right about what I believe it is I'm actually seeing.

The line faded away and it remained a cluster of white lights. My daughters looked and it and said it looked like it was turning. When I looked at it again the lights went from bright white to a purple, then went out and we never saw it again.

At approximately 19:15 hours on October 20th 2008 I went out on my second story apartment balcony which faces north/northwest to have a cigarette.  Gazing east/northeast I observed a string of dark red lights in a boomerang formation travelling southeast to northwest.  The lights never changed formation leading me to speculate they were not individual objects but that they belonged to a singular object.  The light appeared to blink in a tip-to-tip sequence, alternating starting points. The object was occluded from my view after about 30 seconds due to a very large tree in my building courtyard, so I moved to the other side of the porch hoping that the object's path would allow it to be visible on the other side of the tree.  It unfortunately was not. I did however continue to gaze into the sky hoping maybe it would appear.  About 5 or 10 minutes after the initial sighting, I happened to look back in the direction I originally saw the object only to see it AGAIN or an identical object traveling in the same exact  path as the first object.  I would estimate this sighting was the same duration, my view being once again occluded by the large tree. This second object as it passed seemed to me to be followed by one or two aircraft.  Whether these were  jet or helicopter I am not certain. As far as judging the size of these two objects, I was asked by the gentleman manning your hotline to approximate using the full moon as my measure.  Based on this I can say that the objects tip to tip could have touched the top and bottom of a late evening full moon, if not complete wrap around it. I am no aviation expert but having lived in this area for over two years I am quite accustomed to hearing and seeing commercial jets and private headed for LAX or Burbank pass over my building.  Had this object been one of these judging from its size, it would have been extremely low and emitting very loud engine noise.  There was no discernible noise coming from these objects. My wife who would have normally been here is away on business so I was the sole witness to this event unfortunately.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,34.155417931034485,-118.50961655172415

UFO SIGHTING July 25, 2008   8:15 p.m. P.S.T San Fernando Valley, CA  	My friend and I were in transit when the sighting occurred. He was driving and I was seated in the passenger seat. We were in the southeast area of the valley in the city of Van Nuys. We were traveling southbound on White Oak Avenue when my friend pointed out a strange object in the sky directly in front of us. Before I proceed to delve into more detail about the sighting, I must emphasize that my friend and I are considered amongst our peers to be quite argumentative and skeptical when any topic of conversation broaches or offends our strong beliefs in logic and reason. Both of us are avid readers of scientific non-fiction and I am currently obtaining my Bachelor degree in science. So, neither one of us are prone to the unquestioned acceptance of fanciful tales of a pseudo-scientific nature. I live next to an airport and therefore bear witness to a never ending flow of air traffic of all forms of commercial, private, and military aircraft. This object was quite obviously not an airplane or helicopter. This object was in the shape of an ellipse and was a dull gray color. Aside from the complete lack of any wings or propellers, the attribute that was the most immediately startling and indicative of the object’s unconventional design was the array of multi-colored lights evenly distributed about the circumference of the object’s surface. On each side, there was a blinking red light. The rest of the lights appeared to flicker through the color spectrum. The distance of the object was difficult to judge because there was no way to discern how large the object was. However, it was either close enough to us or large enough at a distance that we could easily see the edges of the object against the sky. This was not just a cluster of blurry glowing dots. We turned left on Vanowen St. and began heading east at which point the surrounding buildings, which had been intermittently obscuring our view, gave way to a wide open field which gave me an uninterrupted period of approximately five minutes to study the object in the sky. This object did not change or vary its position in the slightest. Even after our trajectory had changed, its position in the sky did not. Eventually, the cityscape completely obscured our vision of the object. We were unable to capture a photograph for lack of a camera. However, I have included a sketch of the object drawn immediately after the sighting. Hopefully, someone else has seen this object and can shed some light although I hold no illusions about the likelihood of ever having any form of answer concerning this disconcerting experience.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,34.18714851694915,-118.46126228813559

The two nights prior to this night I had been noticing that there were becoming more and more stars each night.  This night, as im standing there, many airplanes begin to fly over head.  In total time of about 7 minutes, there were 6 planes.  Two where coming on my left, flying strait from east to west.  Four planes were flying directly over me, two of them clearing way up in the air, while the other two clearly flying low.  All planes were identifiable by their lights, the two four high ones making a small triangle with three lights, one white, and two blinking red and green.  Even the lower ones were noticeable with about 4 white lights in a line and a blinking red light I could only assume at the tail.  As they entered my airspace, I could hear the low planes, same as they left my airspace. As the first low plane passed directly over me, I noticed a newer ""thing"" just as low.  It had 4 white lights but these lights were to bright to be that of a plane and not quite bright enough to look as the stars did.  The lights almost made a shape of an ""L"" with the top two pretty much directly in formation, the third a little more to the right and out of formation and the fourth a little more out of the formation of the third.  Again I was looking at the first low plane that was just beginning to leave my airspace and took note of the sound it was making.  This L one however made no sound, speed was a little bit faster than those of the planes I was noticing but also, I did take reference of how smooth it seemed to go.  Of course it was night and to dark to truly see the smoothness in its ride, but I couldn't help but think and wonder about ""smooth"". So a second low craft is coming over me, and I turn my direction to where I noticed the L thing and as a joke tempting more ""stars"" as I called this L thing, to fly.  That's when I see this single white light cruising through the air.  Now this Single, was as bright as a star.  Just as quiet as the L,  but was moving at a speed that was incredible.  This Single, with its speed, could definitely be described as moving really smooth.  Some say it might have been a shooting star, and I'll go along with it, but it was going to slow to be what I think I've seen as a shooting star, but way to fast to be any aircraft I've ever seen flying.  What really caught me was as it cruised I could see two stars that were directly in its path.  That natural humanistic thing to do was worry about a collision, due to the angle of which it was being seen.  But I kid you not, as they crossed paths, they became one, and as the Single would leave each of the two stars, I did take note that when right next to each other, they looked identical.  Both in size, shape, and brightness.  It was really quite inspiring to see something like this, that I could not explain, but still could not jump to any conclusions.   If this sounds familiar, please contact me.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,35.78376197916666,-78.80133489583334

The second object approached and when it was directly overhead it appeared to change direction and shoot straight up then disappeared.  There was absolutely no sound as the objects approached and passed overhead. One observer saw four brighter areas on the outer edges of the underside of on object that he describes as energy cells rather than just lights.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,45.01795454545454,-78.5293

The objects had a triangular white light pattern with a red strobe between the two objects closer to the front.  The first object was smaller in size than the second object.  I managed to track the formation with my telescope for a couple of seconds and it appeared to be one object shaped like an isosceles triangle.  If it were 2 aircraft then I would have noticed irregularities in the distance between the two, but there was no lateral movement between the two, they kept a very static distance between them.  I believe the shape was distorted because it appeared to be between 2 to 5 miles to my South. The red strobe seemed to be huge and I could faintly see the outline of the back end in the telescope.  The object moved across the entire sky in less than one minute without making a sound.  When I held my fingers up at arm’s length the object seemed to take up 3 fingers worth of sky.  If I were to estimate the height I would guess that it was probably between 5,000 and 10,000 feet up.  I have never seen an aircraft of this size in the sky. We live near Tinker AFB and have seen just about every aircraft in the inventory.  This thing was way bigger than a C-5 galaxy and moved much faster without making a sound.

Initially it appeared as a blue hazy star, and simultaneously we both commented that it was oddly blue and had never seen it in that part of the sky.  In comparison to the other stars and the Big Dipper constellation it appeared to be very high and a star rather than an airplane.  We live in the vicinity of Dulles International Airport and regularly see the headlights and beacon lights of approaching and departing planes following regular paths and intervals.  This light however was distinctly higher.  For the first few minutes of our observation we thought it could be the headlight of an oncoming airplane as often airplane lights appear bright and stable when they are approaching head-on before turning; the steady blue haze created by the humidity.  However, no other airplanes approaching from the west or departing from! the east had this glow.  After approximately 5 minutes of observation, the light became brighter and white, with an aura of blue circling it then red.  The bright white light would disappear, as if an airplane turning course away from you, but then would suddenly reappear, with a broad swatch of bright white light from left to right as if an airplane with lights across the breadth of its wingspan.  While this light pattern was changing back and forth from bright white to blue/red haze, the position of the vision also dramatically changed.  It appeared to get closer rather quickly, and also much lower in altitude, while moving right and left.  Using the approaching and departing airplanes lined up as a reference, the light moved faster to the right and then to the left than any of the airplanes in their flight pattern.  Also the light descended and ascended quickly, faster than any helicopter I have ever seen.  Its movement from right to left, up and down came in abrupt sta! rts and stops, seemingly without building momentum or slowing ! of momen tum.  The right and left and up and down movements gradually lead it closer to the ground or horizon, still the size appearance of the light making it look quite off in the distance and not a small craft up close.  As it approached the horizon it seemed to descend very fast.  If it was travelling away from us it was at sudden great speed, if it was descending for a landing, it was straight down and at a descent much greater than any vertical landing craft I have ever witnessed.  After approximately 20 minutes of viewing it was not longer in sight.  We spend an additional 10 minutes viewing the area of the sky and horizon but it did not reappear.",2009-08-27T00:00:00,39.2581,-77.8705

I pulled out my phone right when I saw it, and as I drove through the intersection I was getting closer and closer, but the light was so dim, and with the rain, it wouldn’t show up on my phones camera... when I get to about 2 miles past the intersection, it was to the left of me… I look back at it and it wasn’t one light anymore, it was 3 lights in an equilateral triangle.

Now, it was a dark rainy night, so it was hard to tell if the object was pretty small, and as close as it seemed, or if it was really way further away than I though, and a big structure.  All I know is that it was under the clouds, so this object was very low to the ground, lower than planes ever fly around that area.

The very low lying storm clouds were up against this part of the Moosic Mountain and the Orange Ball glowed through the light gray dense type atmosphere descending floating downwardly like a parachute. My first thought was that it was an approaching plane going into the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre International Airport after clearing the Omni Guidance Tower atop Archbald's Salem Road Mountain Top [elev 2200'], but that the Orange Ball was  under 2000' elevation too low for normally approaching aircraft! I approached me from the East as I awaited it to change course to the South West, the norm, as it never did I suddenly realized it was something different! The clock was 9:14 Luppini time, only found in Jessup, PA. After stopping for the Stop sign, I traveled about 600 feet and pulled off the road just as another car passed me. I was across from an inspection station garage. I got out of the car as the Orange Ball was descending toward the ball park's high tension power lines that cut right through the middle of the complex three fields plus. I could hear an electronic type crackling noise very similar to a continuous mosquito zapper as it approached closer in the near still quiet! A sliver in the clouds opened up leaving me with a clear overview! The Orange Ball was headed toward the top of the high tension electrical lines for sure! My immediate view was now looking straight up under it as if it were an ultra-lite type aircraft. It was stepping downwardly by first floating forward and slightly upwardly in a jerking type motion going out about 50 feet or so with four or five jerks then dropping down sharply at a very steep slope rapidly coming to a stop (similar to a mountain climber descending a steep incline) It then repeated this over and over again step by step coming down slow but surely and cautiously! I seemed to be aware of my presence as may have been the reason it was so cautious. I observed this for about 8 to 10 downward steps now having descended about 800 feet and still coming down! I immediately rushed back into the car to dig out an old 35 mm camera in a box in the back seat and tried to get a shot using the camera setting in place as it was dark and I had no light! While doing this I missed the low point of the Orange Ball as it was already stepping upwardly reversing steps and I only got one shot because as I rewound the   sudden down pour of rain was unbelievable. The clouds closed up and in upon the Orange Ball as I dove back into the car all wetalong with the camera! It should be noted that when first sighted the size appeared to be about half the)size of a car (elev 2000')and about the size of a car at its lowest point(elev 500'). It's apperance was multi colored 1) black nose, 2) then dark red behind the black, 3) then red behind the dark red, 4) then dark orange behind the red, 5) then  bright orange behind the dark orange, 6) then bright white light behind the bright orange. The Orange Ball made no noise with exeption to the electrical crackling and zapping as it moved very slowly in a floating like motion! I think it was gathering the lose EMFs from atop the high tension electrical power lines like maybe rechargin itself! Last fourth of July two groups both before and after the fire works display observed the Orange Ball! Over the last 40 or so years many have reported white blob type sightings usually under 200 feet. It acted like a timmed animal when being fed some food off the back porch as it was so-so cautious as it knew it could not come in contact the electrical power lines and unable to see clearly in the low lyng rain clouds, but!probably needed to recharge or die! If only I had my binoculars as at its lowest point (400' elev) I could have really seened the detail. I then went down Hill Street to the Convient Mart to see if the local Cops were on their coffee break but no one was around! I then proceeded to Frank's in Simpson for a late dinner another place were some type of UFOs come and go up the Lackawanna River Basin toward the headwaters in Arart, PA, their  apparant area of interest when traveling through! The total time of this sighting was about 5 minutes.  DATED: 8/10/09 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes himself as a professional engineer.

The visibility was greater then 10 miles, the cloud layer was scattered at approximately 5000 feet and the winds were out of the south east at approximately 10-15 knots on the surface. At 8pm eastern time, I observed a lighted object roughly 3 miles to the north west of my position about 60 degrees above the horizon, moving south paralleling the west coast of Siesta Key.  The object initially appeared to be a plane with an engine fire but as it approached closer to my position it became apparent that it was more of a spear emitting light similar to intensity and appearance of a common marine flare, flickering yellow and orange/red in color. The object traveled from its position north west of me, almost due south, paralleling the coast for about 2-3 miles.  At its closest point of approach it was due west of my position by approximately 2 miles, or about 1.5 miles west of the beach of Point of Rocks.  At this point the object appeared to stop moving and began to climb.  I was unable to determine if the object actually stopped moving, or turned its motion directly away from me.  Either way, the object climbed into the cloud deck and began to fade from sight as it passed through the 5000’ scattered cloud deck.  As it began to climb and fade from sight, another object, identical in appearance to the first, appeared approximately 2 miles to the north west of my position at approximately the same altitude taking an almost identical flight path as the first.  The first object had faded completely away by the time the second object made its closest point of approach to my position.  It also appeared to stop or turn away from my position like the first, climb and penetrate the 5000’ cloud deck and fade from sight.  The entire event took approximately 4 minutes from visually acquiring the first object to the second object’s fade from sight.  My best estimates of their velocity would be in the 60-120 knot range.  I estimate this based on the position of the object above the horizon in relation to the cloud deck which I estimated to be at approximately 5000’. There was no sound associated with the objects, as mentioned above; they emitted a tremendous amount of light energy with flickering similar to a flare. I was able to train a high power telescope on the second object and saw nothing but a pulsating light that I would have reported as a flare if the trajectory had not been what it was. I currently work as a professional offshore pilot in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean.  I have seen flares, fighter jets afterburners at night, oil rig burn offs, boat fires, large shooting stars breaking apart, plane crashes and countless other night time lights and phenomena.  I am convinced that this was none of these. Doing my best to confirm that I did not witness the flare of a vessel in distress, I spoke with the local Coast Guard Sector.  As I was explaining what I observed, the Petty Officer Cut me off mid sentence and asked if I think I saw a UFO.  I advised I was not sure when he told me that he just received a report from another source in the same area of an identical sighting and it was being reported as a UFO.  I placed calls with all of the local Air Force and FAA airspace controllers, who all reported no operations in the area.  I followed up with the Coast Guard on the December 26th, who advised there were no further developments with this case.

The sky was bright to the south due to the setting sun, with some high altitude clouds in the background. Visibility was very good. There was a slight breeze from the north, which was slightly bowing tall palm trees in the area. I became aware of a stationary black dot just above the skyline directly to the south of my location. I first took it to be a tethered advertising balloon, but soon realized it was too high in the sky, and would interfere with aircraft. After several minutes I went into the house and got a pair of binoculars to get a better look at the object. With the binoculars I could see the dot was actually oval shaped. There were five or six smaller circular objects spread out below the oval in a semi-circle. These objects were not visible to the naked eye. I watched for several minutes, periodically fiddling with the adjustments on the binoculars to get a better view. The large object seemed to remain stationary, while the smaller objects slowly moved about beneath, seemingly grouping up with each other in various configurations. All the objects were opaque black, backlight by the bright light of the setting sun. The oval looked like it might have had a reddish spot near the top, but it could have been due to the lighting. I watched for about five minutes until I received a phone call. I tried to locate the objects when I finished the call several minutes later, but they were gone. I cannot estimate how far away the objects were but feel they were fairly distant. There were general aviation and commercial aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting. I rule out balloons due to their not reacting to the wind and the regular spacing that the objects maintained in relation to each other. Balloon I have seen released into the sky quickly dissipate and follow random paths following the direction of the wind. I am no computer whiz, but I have made two drawings which I will attempt to attach which illustrate my observations.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,33.93964338565022,-117.4001158071749

I was on the west side of my house between my house and my neighbor’s house.  I was walking northward towards my back yard.  There were a few low clouds that were mostly transparent.  I saw a streak of light traveling from east to west above one of the clouds.  Because I saw it through the cloud, it was kind of blurry.  It was traveling very fast, and it only lasted a few seconds before it flew out of site behind my neighbor’s house.  My first thought is that it was a meteor.  However, I watched a meteor shower several weeks ago, and this “streak” traveled a longer distance than the meteors I’ve seen.  It was also traveling the opposite direction of the meteors I saw a few weeks ago.  (I admit that I don’t know much about meteors, and I assume they can travel in any direction.)  However, this streak didn’t look as long as the meteors I saw and it lasted longer.  My next thought is that it was a spotlight, but! I searched the horizons, and I didn’t see any spotlights shining up and moving around.  My last explanation was that it could have been some light refracting through the corner of my glasses lenses, and it created some sort of optical illusion.  However, there were no cars driving by or any other moving source of light that could have caused that.  Also, since I’ve worn glasses for years, I can say that I have never experienced an optical illusion of a light in a cloud due to refracted light though my glasses.  It was too fast to be a plane, plus there was no noise.  It was most likely a meteor, but it didn’t look or behave like the meteors I’ve seen.  But I admit that may be because my sight of it was distorted though the low thin cloud.  I would say that the chances of this being some sort of ET craft is very low, but since I couldn’t positively identify it, it was a mystery to me, and therefore, a UFO.  I just wanted to report it so that there would be record of it in c! ase someone else saw something, too.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,36.13170004240882,-86.7768134860051

I went outside and saw what looked like 3 large white balloons grouped together. It seemed as though it was reflecting the light from the setting sun, but as the sun set the objects got brighter, a lot brighter. I also noticed that even with the light breeze, the objects were not moving.  I soon realized these were not balloons. There were no other stars out at this point and I started getting text messages from 4 other friends telling me to check out whatever it was in the sky.  As I was in my backyard looking and describing over the phone to my friend, I could see one large orb in the center with three other orbs around it, seeming to be attached. The outer orbs were changing location, but always remained equidistant from each other (triangular formation). The object was fairly close, less than 10 miles away. I could also see a faint glow or haze around the object. My friend who called me was on the other side of town and it appeared much smaller to him than it did to me. My neighbor was outside in his backyard so I called him over and we started watching it together. As we watched, the orb flashed pinpoints of white light around it. It then began flashing pinpoints of red light around it.  After a few more minutes the center orb began to dim and the flashing pin points of light stopped, then the outer three orbs turned red and got brighter, becoming the only visible lights. At this point my neighbor’s roommate came outside with his camera and took pictures.  While I was on the phone describing what I was seeing, a small flashing light shot out of the bottom and headed northwest towards Albuquerque.  I could see a faint contrail behind the orb. This light was only visible for about 10 seconds before it was out of sight. The main object still remained in its same location but began to dim again.  Once in a while I could see a small light appear next to it, but I had to look away from the main object! to see it.  Several times I also witnessed the object to move slightly to the side or slightly upward, but always returning to its original location. Over the course of an hour, it remained it the same position in the sky, getting dimmer whereas the stars started to become visible and got brighter.  After an hour and a half it was difficult to see and was dimmer than the stars, but remained in the same place in the sky. I am sure there will be more reports, as I had 4 friends from different locations in town that all noticed it on there own and told me to check it out.  It was also nice to have my neighbor watch it with me as he was able to verify all the things I was seeing. As a side note, I found it interesting that it seemed to be directly above the NASA facility which is on the western side of the mountains from White Sands Missile Range.  I have seen other strange things in the sky before, but never have I seen something so clearly that remained in the same place for so long and have so many other witnesses.  I don’t have the pictures, but when zoomed in, it looked like 3 orbs in a triangular formation with the light stretching towards each other.  It resembled a hot air balloon but was clearly not.

I was looking directly up for satellites/meteorites and noticed a burnt orange colored circular shape silhouette moving slowly (like a bird soaring) in a northern direction (this was nothing that came from the campfire as it was big and had a very high altitude).. it wasn't easy to spot unless you were looking in that direction as there were no lights and no sound, just a faint big circular dark/burnt orange colored object. I pointed my 300mW green laser pointer at it to ask the other 5 witnesses if they could see it and after tracking the object with the laser for 2 seconds it quickly (in less than 1 second) moved away from the laser to the west a few hundred feet (it looked like a few hundred feet from the ground, it could've been a few miles at that altitude).. then it moved slowly more to the west, until i hit it again with the laser and it then quickly moved south.. then east.. then north again... and then east until we lost sight of it behind some tree's. It seemed that it didn't want to be hit with the laser, and would quickly moved away from the beam. The laser was shining high enough that when i hit the object the laser beam would reflect off the object (as if you were pointing the laser at any solid object) until the object quickly moved out of the way, then the beam would be high in the sky again. The object made turns between 10 + 90 degree angles and moved fast when the laser beam had hit it. The amount of time that passed between the first sighting of it and when we lost sight of it completely was approximately 20 seconds. 1 of the ladies got so scared she ran inside her house.

At the same time, my wife called a friend of ours in Morristown (halfway to Wickenburg) and had her step outside to observe it. She said there had been reports of lights in the sky, in the same area and at about the same time for the last few days. We continued to watch it and as we got to Wickenburg, we saw people on the sidewalks and parked cars with people outside watching it too. About 45 minutes had passed by now and I went to my back yard and continued to watch it. My neighbor was outside too, and I drew her attention to it. We continued to watch for another 15 or 20 minutes. I took a picture with my phone and the sky took but the object didn't. As we were observing it a jet flew by in the general area  of the object, about 30,000 feet or so, (the passengers must have hadf a real good view of it) and it looked to be 6 or 7 times bigger than the jet. I observed something like a red or orange glow and within a minute, it moved straight away from us and looked mlike a star ant then was gone. There were no stars out yet.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,33.9105,-112.879925

I was tracing the outline of a pine tree in her yard against the dark sky, and noticed at first what I thought to be a star, behind a branch of this tree.  I noticed it as the wind caused it's branches to sway, revealing this object. Then this ""star"" began to slowly move out from behind this tree.  It was an orange-gold in color and spherical, much like a star would be, but it shone much, much brighter.  Also, it's movements were rather peculiar - it's rate of motion wasn't necessarily fast, but it definitely did NOT move at a constant rate.  It would move across the sky slowly, then speed up slightly, then slow again, almost like it was floating or dancing.  Also, it did not move in straight lines, it would wobble almost, and sway slightly as it moved. I watched this object move around the sky in this strange fashion for about a minute, when I realized I should wake my sleeping girlfriend to show her too.  I woke her, and then we watched for about another minute.  Then, it slipped back behind the tree, and I struggled to follow it through the branches.  A jet or a plane then came into sight as it flew across the sky, and I knew it was a jet or plane due to the strobe lights on it, and its steady rate of movement across the sky.  It also flew out of sight behind this large tree, into the same vicinity as the object.

The purpose of the visit was to borrow his video camera in the hopes that I'd catch some of what I'd seen the previous evening on video. I was leaving his house with the camera when I looked up North in the sky and saw something appear in the sky seemingly out of nowhere. I can't be certain how to describe its movement but it was similar to that of a jellyfish. After about 30 seconds a second one appeared. I hollered to matt who came out on his balcony and confirmed what I thought I was seeing. They began to move in a easterly direction. Sometimes appearing to drift and at other times they looked to be propelling themselves. It’s important to note neither object drifted the same way as the wind or clouds. We watched them for about 15 minutes until they were out of sight. At that moment a plane that looked very similar to an airliner but painted all black or b! lue on the bottom swooped through from east to west at about 500 feet in altitude right where I had first seen the ufos. Then directly after the plane swooped through Matt began hollering to look directly up in the sky. Over head and very high we saw a number of lights blinking on and off and dancing around.

At 11:40 p.m. we went out on to the balcony to enjoy the night air.  We were passing to the east of the Dominican Republic after leaving St. Thomas earlier that afternoon. Just after going out on the balcony I noticed a while spherical shaped light out on the water a couple of hundred yards out form the ship. I remarked to my wife, ""What's that light out there""?  She said, "" It's a ship"". But then I pointed out that there wasn't a ship to be seen and the light didn't look like a ship light. It was very intense, bright white, and there were no other lights around. Within seconds of saying this, the light began to rise up from the ocean surface. It reached a height of approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. After rising up the light appeared to be more spherical. It then began to perform acrobatic maneuvers. The object would move along a few seconds in one direction then dart back across the sky at a nearly 180 degree angle from the direction it was traveling. As we were seeing this we pointed the object out to a group on a balcony just above us. They confirmed that we were all seeing the same thing. The object darted around in the sky for a few minutes then moved back down to the ocean surface. As it moved down, it appeared to be coming right at the ship. All of us watching the object kind of stepped back and had a moment wondering if the object was going to come all the way to the ship. As the object approached the ship, about 150 yards out, it went into the water. We could see the light under the water for a few seconds, and then it disappeared. While watching the object my wife and I were talking to the other witnesses making comments like, ""Are you seeing what I am seeing?"", ""Wow!"" and variations of ""Holy Crap!"". We confirmed with each other that we had all seen the same thing. There is no doubt we all saw the same thing. However, none of us had any idea what we had just seen. The object moved in ways I never seen a manmade flying object move before. It cut and darted faster than any bird I've ever seen. At times it moved so fast it was hard to track it moving across the sky. Then it would stop. It was an incredible event. I have no idea what the object's origins or purpose was. I have no idea if it was man made or of some other origin. If it was man made, we have  craft that can do some incredible maneuvering. That it went into the water and disappeared  made it all the more incredible and all the more mysterious to me. I have no way of knowing other than the what I saw and the feeling I got while seeing it, but I'm pretty sure we all saw something not of human making. I could be wrong. Its possible we have some fantastic craft. But if I had to bet, what we saw did not come from humans of this time frame.",2010-05-12T00:00:00,,

As I was walking out of my house I checked the time, it was 7:52pm.  I was taking out the garbage. Once outside I glanced toward the western sky and saw what I first thought was a large black bird(buzzard)gliding through the air on wind/thermal current. As I continued to watch I noticed it was moving in a straight line, no wing flaps, no variation from the southwest to north east direction it was moving.  I realised that it was no bird and thought maybe a ballon. It was a black circle moving in a straight line. I then realised that it could not be a ballon, because there was no deviation in it's path, i.e. no floating or oscillating movements as baloon would with wind currents. I then quickly went inside to get my binoculars. Back outside I focused on the object. I noticed it was solid black, not reflecting any light at all. Kind of a flat black if you will. It was also a perfect circle! Not egg shaped like most baloons being round at the top and more narrow at the bottom.  Anyways I as watched through the binocs it had nothing attached(i.e.string)no lights, no markings whatsoever. I would guess it was about 2-3k feet up, making no sound at all. The thing that puzzled me so was that it flew in a straight line, never deviating from it's path. I watched for maybe 3 mins until it flew out of sight in the distance.  It was moving around 25-30 mph. Not very fast at all. Well I go back inside wondering what I had just seen, when I decided go back out to make sure I closed the lid on outside garbage. I still had binocs in hand. While outside I looked back to the area where I first spotted the circle and lo and behold there is a second one exactly like the first moving in the exact same manner and path as well as speed.  I estimate these thing were no more than 2-3 feet wide. I checked the time and it was 7:56pm. I also watched this object through the binocs until it flew out of sight. It looked identical to the first object. I went back inside and checked local weather radar on cable TV. The winds were light 3-5 mph out of the southeast. If it were big ballons they would have been traveling in a straight line against a cross wind! I have no idea what I saw, but I know what they were not(bird,or baloon). The Sun was setting but there was still plenty of daylight.  Weather was clear with light clouds. These black circles stood out very well against the sky. If anyone had been in our area and looked up they would have easily spotted the objects. I know people see alot of things, some explainable, some not. But two perfectly shaped circles, black, travelling in precise straight lines with no deviations in their path is really weird.

Of course, this 4th of July involved fireworks. Note that what I am reporting as ""fireballs"", ""glowing lights"", or hovering spheres, are not the likes of any firework which I am familiar with. Around 9:15 p.m., a friend and I sat on my back porch watching fireworks displays from various neighborhoods around us.  We set off a few of our own, but nothing big.  Neither of us had any alcoholic beverages that day or night, nor do we do drugs; our states of mind were as sharp and relaxed as possible. When looking south, during a lull in the fireworks, we both noticed (and promptly pointed out to each other) 4 objects in the dark sky.  We were looking at about a 35 degree angle of elevation.  The objects seemed to hover in place, making only minuscule adjustments to hold formation due to strong winds.  They glowed with an orange-red light, the closest approximation of which I can make is the HTML Hex code #CC1100.  It was not an extremely strong glow, in that I could not see it illuminating any objects on the ground, trees, or even that much of the smoke present from the fireworks.  However, it was clearly bright enough (or close enough) to reach my friend and I with no problem.  They were arranged in what looked from our viewpoint to be the shape of a rhombus or diamond shape, but I cannot say for sure due to our angle and imperfect depth perception concerning their distance from one another.  They seemed to act together, as though they were all present for the same cause or of! the same force. Other similar formations could be seen from the front of my home looking northward; one directly north and one in the north-northwest.  The latter formation was at a greater distance from us, causing the glows to appear smaller and sort of blend together, creating uncertainty on the number in that formation.  We could only assume that there were also four there, as this is how the others were arranged. The formation to the south was still closest to us, and we mainly observed it.  It remained still, emitting no beams or objects, but the objects seemed to alternate positions every 45 min. or so.  About 5 min. after a rotation, the object closest to us (on a the point of the rhombus) darted towards us significantly. It hovered now above the pond directly behind my house.  It faded in color and luminescence as it neared, becoming completely matte black by the time it reached us.  It hovered there, and had it not been for fireworks on the horizon and city lights illuminating the haze, it would have blended easily into the night sky.  We had a Nikon D5000 with an external flash and telephoto lens, and immediately started fumbling for it to try to capture it on camera.  The camera would not boot up. It usually takes about half a second to turn on and become ready to shoot, if that.  But it wouldn't. The battery was charged, for we tried two of them, both of which had been charged that day.  It was in the right way and there should have been nothing to interfere.  In the dark, I tried to use my lighter to see if there was some fault or something that could prevent it from working.  It was a push-button or electronic butane aerosol lighter, where one clicks a button down, creating a spark, and igniting a jet of butane fuel.  The fuel came out as usual when the button was depressed, but the spark would not work. Neither would my friend's. We took this to mean that after going into some sort of less detectable mode, it also activated a device that shut down certain electronic capabilities within a reasonable proximity.  Unable to capture it, we could only stand in awe.  It looked to be about 15 ft. in diameter, and rotating a bit in one direction before reversing its spin. It spun fairly slowly, almost like it was just drifting there.  After about 3 min. of suspension, it flew back to its formation.  It did not change color, but by the time the craft got back, the formation was then the same shade of matte black.  It was unbelievable how...black it really was. It seemed to just suck in all light.  There were minor indentations around the craft, visible when not luminous, around the ""equator"".  Just short dashes, impressed into the material. This allowed us to notice the rotation before. After reforming, the formation flew northward at unnatural speeds.  There was no time for acceleration. It was just...going.  It went from a stop to its desired speed immediately and remained steady at that speed until arriving near the northern formations.  They joined to form a loose squarish shape. This larger formation flew northward while gaining altitude at a steady pace.  I can't imagine why only the one formation would go into its ""undetectable"" or stealth mode while in the larger formation, but it remained that way during its exit. My friend has done no real research into ufology or related fields, and previously was just oblivious.  He had no opinion.  He always took a tolerant, but non-believing, attitude towards matters like this. I have read numerous books, online articles, and viewed a vast amount of serious multimedia on the subject, including photographs, video recordings, and audio clips.  I don't consider myself to be a serious researcher by any means, but I do take matters of this nature seriously.",2010-07-10T00:00:00,37.5629,-97.2285

It moved slowly at times, and few times picked up a little speed. I told my girlfriend to take a look and she began observing as well. About a minute later, the second light emerged and started a similar path, never moving up or down. The light was a bit dimmer than the original 5 cluster sighting.

In my career I have seen many strange things, but this observation clearly tops them all as far as being unexplained.    On July 4, 2010, at approximately 2145 to 2155 hours, I was sitting near the bank of the Missouri River on the 300 Block of River Drive North in Great Falls Mt.  I was sitting with my family waiting for the city fireworks display that was set to start at approximately 2200 hours.  We were sitting on the east side of the river facing westbound where the fireworks display was going to be launched. As we were waiting for the show I noticed an aircraft flying eastbound over the city (Est. elevation 10,000 feet high).  Normally this would not be note worthy because we were sitting under the flight path of airplanes landing and taking off from the Great Falls International Airport.  This particular craft caught my attention because it appeared to flying too high to have just taken off from the runway.  Normally, I have noticed flights that don’t land at the airport fly on the outskirts of the city.   Also, I noticed an extremely large glowing yellow/reddish color light underneath the aircraft.  The light took up the whole diameter of the craft.  The light appeared to be the approximate size of a Boeing 747.  I observed no red or green tail or wing lights on the craft.  There was no apparent spotlight shining in front of the craft.  I also could not hear the craft’s engine.  It should be noted it was extremely windy and this could have had an effect on the sound waves reachi! ng my location.  The craft also appeared to be flying slower than a jet craft would have at that altitude that was not planning on landing. At this time, I pointed the craft out to my wife.  At the same time we both said we have never seen an airplane or helicopter that looked like that.  We debated over whether a satellite would have the same characteristics.   During this time there were approximately 15 people that were sitting near us on the riverbank.  Several of them were watching the craft also.  Some of their conversations were similar in nature to ours (Unknown names of the other witnesses). I continued to watch the craft as it continued eastbound until I lost site of it as it headed east past the city.  Great Falls has Malmstrom Air Force Base, Homeland Security Base, and the Montana Air National Guard.  My job has allowed me some access to these bases on occasion.  To my knowledge, none of the aircraft they fly looks like this.

I was taking my dog for a short walk and glanced up at the night sky, as I always do.  It was overcast, so I didn’t notice any stars, but there was a glowing orange object.  I had to stop and stare at it as long as I could see it, which was probably 2 or 3 minutes.  It looked to me to be kind of a disc shape, with an oblong oval shape up through the middle.  It was glowing orange.  It looked like it had a red light on top momentarily.  It didn’t have a real crisp shape.  I’m not sure if that was because it was glowing or what.  I was facing the West and looking up at about a 30 degree angle.  I’m not sure if that’s right, but it wasn’t directly overhead, but slightly down.

On the night of the 4th of July I witnessed something in the sky that I could not explain.  Yes, I understand that everyone is shooting fireworks into the sky.  However, what I witnessed I do not believe were fireworks.   I was with a group of friends, some adults and some children.  We were firing off fireworks on a dead end street.  Lots of people in surrounding areas were doing the same. We had just fired off the last of the fireworks and things became quiet for a few minutes.  As I walked into the street I heard one of my friends say, ""Hey check out thos!""  As I looked up into the sky, I was expecting to see some more fireworks exploding, only these did not appear to be fireworks. What I saw in the sky that night were small, round, what I considered to be balls of light.  They were a yellowish orange color.  At first there were only 2 that I could see so I continued to watch them.  They were moving constantly at the same speed from the south to the north. These objects were moving horizontally not vertically.  Everyone in our group became fixated on these things. Within seconds we saw more balls of light following. I really started to pay attention at this point.  I asked my friends if they had any idea what they were, although no one had any good ideas.  These things just kept coming from the south and fading off to the north.  I started to take some pictures on my phone because I had no idea what these were.  I don’t have a video phone so all I got was still pictures. I wanted to narrow this down to somehow explain this.  These things were not making any noise that I could tell, they all stayed in the same position as they moved by, and they were not moving! fast.  From the time you first saw one it would take at least 1 to 2 minutes until you could not see it anymore.  There was no smoke or con trails behind these objects.  They did not flash or have any lights on them.  These things were round in shape but you could not see any “hard” lines on them.  They were on what seemed to be a straight line path going from south to north. I did not count them because of the sheer volume of these things.  There had to have been over 100 of these.  They all trailed pretty close behind one another and just kept coming, yet they were not in any pattern or formation.  I would guess that these objects were trailing across the sky over the distance of at least 5 to 10 miles.  From start to finish we watched these things for every bit of 10 minutes. I actually called my girlfriend to ask her if she could see the same thing in a neighboring town, she could not see what we did.  I talked to other friends that were just about 1 mile away from us and they ! said they saw them but thought they were hot air balloons. My friends did not seem to be concerned about this and were saying that there was probably an explanation.  I myself was not satisfied with this. When I got up the next day this was all I could think about.  I started to look on the internet for answers but got none.  I have lived next to an air force base all of my life and have seen many aircraft in the sky yet what I saw that night I cannot explain and I wish I could.  I actually thought that since this was such a huge thing going on in the sky on the 4th of July that it would be all over the news and in the news paper, yet there were no news stories.  I believed that thousands of people had to have witnessed this also, there has to be video of this somewhere, and credible people had to have seen this. What I witnessed that night I still can’t explain and I am still looking for answers.  I do not assume that these were ""UFOs.""  However until I can find out what they were; they are still UNIDENTIFIED!  I remember clearly what happened that night and I am willing to tell anyone, I just want some answers.",2010-07-10T00:00:00,38.51653927392739,-89.95791188118811

I first noticed it at 35 degrees WNW from my location.  It continued up overhead to about 85 degrees (almost directly overhead) and gradually faded out of view as it got smaller and smaller ESE at about 10 degrees above the horizon.  It took about 25 seconds to move this distance.  I did not hear a sound coming from this object so I would say that it was above the Earth’s atmosphere but not as high as the International Space Station (ISS) as I’ve spotted that a few times on separate occasions and on one occasion I saw the station also pass almost directly overhead like this object.  I cannot be certain how high the object was but that is my impression. The object appeared to be a flame although it was different from a typical rocket in that although it remained relatively constant it had a slight flicker to it like the flickering of a candle only a more rapid flickering with more of a sustained luminescence.  The flame appeared to have an edge on the forward side and came to a point at a length of about twice its width.  I could not discern a physical object in front of the flame as I was looking for something in front thinking it was perhaps a missile or the space shuttle.  The light of the object was about half as bright as the ISS at its brightest when I had seen the ISS at about a year ago passing directly overhead. I saw only the one object and it’s motion was continual and followed a straight path and it was moving at least twice as fast as the ISS (or perhaps the same speed but maybe half the distance?).  This object literally appeared to be rocketing across the sky.  It’s size from my perspective was about 1/8th the size of a full moon as it passed overhead.  There were 4-5 other witnesses across the street about a 100 feet away from me.",2010-07-10T00:00:00,41.39098647450111,-73.47073769401331

I wanted to at least go on record as having witnessed the following on July 21st at approximately 7:45 am (the incident only lasted about 25 seconds and I did not have a camera):   I was travelling eastbound in my car on Wrights rd in Newtown Bucks County toward the Peter Taylor farmstead where I was going to pick up produce for our farm stand.  I had noticed three parallel chemtrails high in the sky running from east to west.   Suddenly a bright light caught my eye next to the chemtrail closest to me.  At first I thought it might be an airplane with the sun reflecting off of it, but the brightness of the object and its flight path convinced me otherwise.  The object travelled alongside the one chemtrail, then shifted into it and back out.  At this time, a second object appeared (same size same brightness)  They spiraled once around the chemtrail and then quickly changed direction and seemed to disappear from sight.  It is difficult to estimate the size of the objects since they were high in the sky.   The chemtrails were fairly new since the one they were flying around was being formed at that time.(the jet was at least a half mile away from the objects.  I woul! d estimate that the diameter of the objects were approximately 1/6 to 1/8 the width of the chemtrail. I went on line the next morning to research any similar types of sightings (chemtrails with ufos).  I found several cases and therefore I wanted to add my experience to the database. If you have any questions please contact me. I am a high school teacher and I know what I saw. Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We are aware that many people accept the ""chemtrail"" phenomenon as being real, but we at NUFORC are unconvinced of their existence.

I zoomed in and noticed a black oval. I dismissed the possibility of it being a bird or plane because as you can see in the attached pics, the camera picked up cloud details nearby that are actually smaller than the object.  To me this indicates that at that level of magnification, wings would be seen if it was a plane or bird.  Additionally, if it was a blur of a bird in flight, there still would be areas of lighter or darker shades where light would reflect off wing, head, leg or abdomen surfaces no matter how blurred it may be.  There appears to be none of these as the object shows a consistent dark shade.  There does however appear to be an area of lighter shade along the top of the object, possibly implying sunlight reflecting off the top surface.

I know that we did not lose the object behind clouds because we could still see stars in the sky were the object was last seen.  I believe this to be a UFO, as I have never seen an aircraft of any kind move at this speed, maneuver the way this craft did.

A small reddish orange (almost fiery) orb was noticed in the East South East sky at 10:25 p.m. on July 21, 2009..  The orb was mostly overhead when first noticed but continued in the direction it was first seen (East South East).   It continued moving in a ""floating"" side to side pattern as it seemed to slowly lose its vibrant light and disappear after heading in the direction for about two minutes.  It was small in the sky but still dwarfed many of the stars and could be 10-20 combined in the sky.  It gave off a good amount of light until the end when it slowly faded out.  The sky was a clear night with little clouds, and none in the area of the UFO.   Almost immediately after witnessing the object we also saw a normal plane in the sky, and in comparison the two are very different.   We only observed one of the orbs. The witness is 54 and a male and was also witnessed by his 18 year old daughter and he called out his 20 year old son.  He is a life long citizen of Munising, Michigan and has seen a few unreported UFO sightings in his life, but has never seen any quite like this.  Also in our area we have multiple (anywhere from 5-25) of another type of ""light"" in the sky.  They have moved across the whole sky in instances and always blink red, white, and green.  They don’t appear to be satellites and are sometimes even in a kite formation.  On various nights they are completely unmoving or not even there, and other times they will slide around.  Once the first one was sighted we have seen many since and are there almost every night.  We aren’t saying these are UFOs but that we can’t explain them, and with the UFO sighted last night we feel they should be mentioned as there could (if the lights we see every night are something UFO related) be a connection.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,46.3424,-86.7798

Well I was returning from Las Vegas, NV on our way back to San Fernando Valley, CA.  My father was driving, we were just driving through Victorville, Ca on Palmdale Rd. As I looked into the sky, I thought about a cousin who once shared with me her UFO sighting experience. So I thought I might just get to see one. I had seen a few shooting stars but remembered how my cousin told me about what the light looked like. I was looking at the big dipper and looked at the North star and all the other bright stars. I looked again observing The Big Dipper and suddenly I saw what appeared to be a circle. It was orange with some red. The light was solid, not blinking, no color change. I had never seen a star like that…..at the same time I saw an airplane and its light blink red and blue. I tried reaching for my camera but not taking my eye off the object. I knew then that there are no orange stars, not normal. I asked my dad for the time, 10:35 pm. The orange circle then began to move slowly side to side but in a circular motion. It visually wasn’t to far from a star. It then began to move fast past the star. The circle seemed to be as far as a star but I knew it was in our atmosphere. It then began to move higher into the sky and it quickly hit a right and suddenly stopped. Right before my eyes the light just got super small and disappeared as if it bolted at lightning speed. It is Friday, July 24, 2009 and I cant believe that I had that experience. I don’t know what to think of it. I know what I saw is real. I always believed in martians. I feel weird. I now want to go out late night and observe the sky. I am not afraid, but it makes me question a lot, religiously. And how can they be so advanced? Well I would like to see more. My dad believes me.

There was still a visible star to the right of the object when it disappeared. Whatever it was it seemed to follow a ""controlled"", straight path.

I looked directly overhead, which at that time and season was toward the area of the sky around the fixed star Arcturus in the constellation Bootes. When I looked at the sky, I saw four luminous, round objects moving in a northeastern direction.  The objects were uniform in size their brightness was similar to an average star.  They were clearly flying at a very high altitude.  Thinking at first glance that they were a group of meteorites, I pointed them out to my husband.   It became apparent that they were not meteorites since their shape, speed and luminosity was constant.  They flew almost directly overhead at a high speed and altitude, and did not appear to be birds. As the objects continued to fly toward the northeast, their formation changed.  Rather than flying at a constant direction and speed, they began a movement pattern that was similar to a small swarm of insects.  They maneuvered around each other, almost playfully, staying in one group. The objects seemed to move in a more northerly direction as they assumed this new flight pattern and then flew to the north toward Washington, DC and out of sight.",2009-05-12T00:00:00,38.87033365758755,-77.18092101167315

She came out shortly after, at 00:03. We were all standing in the parking lot by the highway and talking.  I heard a noise of something that sounded like a distant airplane. Not too distant, but one that sounded like it might be close. I looked directly up, waited a second for my eyes to adjust to the darkness of the sky.  When they finally focused I saw what was dimmer than the brightest star (not including our sun) moving around at a great speed. It was quite small, this could have been because it was quite high in the sky, higher than most airplanes it seemed.  It seemed to be somewhat triangular in shape.  I watched it for a second, and it quickly started making sharp turns left and right, while still going at that same constant speed. It didn’t look like it was getting any closer. The first thing I thought was it was a bug flying around, but there was no way it would be that visible at this time of night. I told everyone and two of my other friends saw it, even one with glasses on.  The other friend, and the person we were waiting for to get off work didn’t see it.  The employee thought that we were smoking something that night, but that was defenetaly not the case.  I watched it for a good while, almost a minute, as it make incredible turns at such a high speed.  This thing could not have been man made. If it were, not many people know about it. I finally looked away for one second to ask how my friend and the employee could not see the UFO. And when I looked back it zoomed off.  I didn’t see if it went off somewhere else or if it just went straight up and left the Earth’s atmosphere.

Since it was sitting there just still and obvious for a couple seconds I wanted to grab my low power telescope as soon as possible. So I got my telescope and came back out.  It was still in this position. So I looked at it through my telescope, and all I saw was the same big gray rectangle but, this magnified, I could see that one corner of it (the top right corner) had a bent, broken off part. I zoomed in and out and if I zoomed out slightly, I couldn't see the broken off part. It just looked like the rectangle I saw without the telescope.  But through the telescope, as zoomed in as I could possibly get, I could see the faintest yellowish glow around the edges of the rectangle.  There were no sounds or rumbles whatsoever coming from said rectangle(s). Nor any lights.  Just dark gray. I know it had to be something far, far off in the night sky and not some kind of bag or weird toy (they're making all kinds of weird, powerful kids' toys these days) because even through my telescope it was still far and fuzzy.  And I've easily looked at Jupiter through my telescope before. After putting my telescope back down on a chair, I looked back up in the sky and it was gone... poof... just... gone. Very frustrated, I stayed on the balcony looking at the sky. The same thing came again, appearing over some nearby buildings.  But this one (or the same one?) was not spinning, just flying through the sky very slowly. I looked at this one through my telescope and saw nothing.  Not one thing!  So I looked up and it was gone, again.  Weird?  A little creepy. [Conditions at this time were 84*F outside and no clouds in view during this sighting]",2010-07-28T00:00:00,38.81477261146497,-121.27164267515924

I have been keeping an eye on it, trying to discredit this object as a mere, bright star or a planet (Venus perhaps).    Last night, 7/20/10, this object appeared brighter than ever.  It looks just like what an airplane's headlights would look like at night if it were coming directly at you, however, this object does not appear to move at all.  The curious thing about it is, it twinkles with a barely perceptible reddish hue. It will also dim to the point of being unnoticeable as if a dark cloud were obstructing the view. Interestingly though, there has been little to no cloud cover over the last few days.  I have tried to take video/stills with my phone but my camera does not fare well in low light conditions. But at the same ti! me, my camera cannot pick up any other star in the sky let alone a dot of light.  In conclusion, I can't discount the fact that planet Venus could be the culprit as I have little experience with astronomy.  But if you were to see how bright this object is, you would most likely say to yourself, ""That object is much too bright to be a planet or star.""

I am a 20 your old guy from the Netherlands.  I'm a Mensa member since a few months.  I don't drink nor use drugs.  I know quite some things about astronomy but I'm nothing close to an expert or anything like that. Since a few weeks I've seen an extremely bright ""star"" in the sky at night time.  The first time it seemed like the light of an airplain, yet it missed the blinking white and red light of the wings and it was so much brighter.  And it moved much faster but dissipated before it was out of view. It didn't have a tail or anything else a normal meteor has. Tonight I saw it again but it was completely stationary.  It didn't move at all. Not even when I compaired it with the stars.  When I first looked at it my eyes almost hurt of the brightness it almost looked as if it was a tiny sun of it's own but the light did not difuse.  Then I noticed that the light seemed to get a little dimmer but when I looked closer it was as if its aura (at night the moon has a circle of light around it sometimes when there's a thin layer of clouds) was shifting it made me think of the head light of a car in the mist yet it was very short-ranged and I couldn't really make out if it was really like a moving ""head light"".  But then around the object itselve.  Even though it was far away and due to the light not really clear I did have the idea it was a bit triangle shaped but it could just be rays of light. Now about half an hour later, 3:12 AM, it's gone.  I've kind of a light head ache of looking at the bright light but I only watched it for some 5 minutes and that was almost 30 minutes ago.  I also felt some sort of pressure on/in my head even when I closed my eyes, when I watched it. And I'm one of those rare, blessed persons who doesn't have head aches, ever!  But I could be a side affect of my light sensitivity, but still, sunlight never has an effect on anything like this. I also tried to take a picture of it but my camera wasn't able to capture it due to the extreme light contrasts between the black sky and the bright ""star"".

Tonight in Avon Lake, Ohio, at approximately 10:00pm my girlfriend and I saw something bright in the sky that was about 10 times the size of a bright star, when she asked if it was a star, I wasn’t sure. This “star” (first being spotted WNW) began moving west at a very slow rate and becoming more orange as it furthered itself in the distance.  At roughly 11:15pm we got out of the lake and I went to see if I could still see the star, I could barely see it.  In the time it took me to walk 15 feet back to my girlfriend, I looked back in the sky and there was what looked to be a fireball in the sky.  It was NNW in the sky and roughly a 45/50 degree angle off the water, about 40 times the size as the brightest star in the sky. This fireball was incredibly bright, with a yellowish color.  We had talked about how it was weird and possibly a plane.  I looked at my girlfriend, made another statement and looked back and there was a second fireball (about 25 times the size of the brightest star in the sky).  These lights hovered in the same exact spot for about 8 minutes or so.  One began to move while the other stayed stationary. The first fireball moved directly north, then directly east and looked exactly like a plane, then began to take a square shape and continue moving east.  The second fireball remained in place for about 5 more minutes and was still in the same position when we left. I’ve lived on Lake Erie my whole life and I have seen orange orbs that seem to be unexplainable. Objects moving far faster than a plane would move.  However I haven’t seen anything like this before.

It was bulky in shape almost cubed and left a trail but not a light trail like a meteor it was almost like a smoke trail like a plane would leave but it disappeared very quickly. It looked more like it was just moving so fast it was displacing the atmosphere around it.

When i looked again into the eyepiece after about 2 minutes i saw the ""star"" explode and emit sparks.  I also saw the sparks tumbling away from the disc.  Before this explosion the only objects in the sky were the moon,venus and the mystery star.After the explosion the ""star"" was gone.

They did not have any lights.  The first 1 or 2 we saw we thought  were clouds, but then realized there were many more & they appeared to be descending and moving at the same time.   In looking closer they appeared to look like parachutes. Soon after that, however, we realized that assumption was impossible.  First of all, the objects were traveling at an impossibly fast speed.  Even though we were driving on the freeway, they continued to pull further and further away from us.   Another reason that these objects could not have been parachutes was because they never came close to the ground.  Eventually, it seemed that some split off the the right of the freeway towards our house, and some went to the left of the freeway toward the Van Nuys area.   After we got off the freeway, we started to go up the hill that we live on, and I continued to look for any sign of the objects.

I was driving home from work south on Hwy 63 from Hayward, when I noticed a large bright light in the western sky. The object I saw was about the size of thirty stars put together.  It was mostly white with a little trace of red on one side. It was way bigger than any star or planet or plane I had ever seen.  It wasn’t blinking, and it didn’t appear to be moving.   It stayed in one spot low in the horizon; I’d say about twenty five to thirty degrees up. Baffled, I called my husband who was at home fifteen miles away in Springbrook, WI.  I asked him to step outside and tell me what the big object in the sky was.  When he asked me the direction, I replied, ""Don’t worry, you will know when you see it.""   It only took a few seconds to see what I was talking about. I asked him, ""What is it?""  He replied, ""I don’t know."" When I arrived at home, he was still in our yard watching it through a brake in the tree line.  We watched for about 5 seconds, and then it dipped down and to the right about an inch in a swooping motion.  I gasped, completely shocked, ""Did that just move?!?!?!?""  My husband replied, “Yeah, it’s been moving the whole time.”  We stood and watched this thing bounce around and move.  It dipped and dived and moved in small circles, almost as if we were watching someone flying a kite with a light on top of it, a kite you could see 20 miles away, with no wind.  Several times we had to move a few steps left or right because it would move behind the tops of the pine trees. We called our friend Dan who lives 8 miles west of us in Trego, WI.  When he stepped outside, he was stunned. When I was sure that we were not the only ones who could see it. I called 911.  I couldn’t be sure that whatever it was, it wasn’t dangerous. At about 11:00 it seemed to start heading down in the western horizon and it got gradually smaller, like it was going away from us. At 11:05, we couldn’t see it anymore. It was a clear night and we could see hundreds of stars and satellites, and even an airplane flew by.  But none of them moved or looked like this.

(It is not uncommon to see jets in the sky over northeastern West Virginia, but seeing three of them fly so close together and in the same direction is a rarity.) Within minutes, many more similar objects appeared, all with the same general heading, coming from multiple directions (most were coming from the south, and a few were coming from the north). At this time, there were about 10-15 objects in the sky. All of these objects had vapor trails, which is why I assume they were jets, but I began to notice that three or four of the trails were distinctly different from the rest; they had a slight blueish tint, and seemed to flash or flicker. I then noticed that one or two of the objects seemed to be traveling vertically, toward! the ground (albeit at a very high altitude); I didn't notice when these objects appeared or if they had been traveling west like the others, but I did notice that their trails were curved, as if they had been flying from the west to the south-east, then suddenly and drastically changed their pitch. I lost visual contact shortly after this as I was traveling in a different direction, but the event might have lasted longer.  I believe some of these objects might have been meteorites or debris entering the atmosphere.

LOL    You may share our story if you want to, but we would strongly ask to remain anonymous.  We could accurately be portrayed as a middle-aged (ugh! LOL) married couple in Modesto.  My husband is a professional whose name is recognizable to those in his field, and I hope you understand and respect our need to remain anonymous to anyone other than yourself. That being said, here's what happened:  (pasted here from what I wrote directly after seeing whatever it was we saw.  My husband and I ""compared notes"" as I typed, and are in agreement with everything detailed in the following account.)  Jan 13, 2010 approx. 11:20 pm PST, in Modesto, CA, my husband and I were in our backyard to take the dog out for the night.   The sky was very clear, and we were looking at the stars while waiting for the dog to ""go potty.""   My husband suddenly said, ""Look!  What IS that?"" and pointed up, towards the NW sky, but somewhat overhead. There was something flying very steadily, at a moderate speed - hard to say exactly how fast, not knowing how high the object really was, or how large it may have been, given unknown altitude.  But, we had the impression it was somewhat low-flying, and fairly large in size. It was completely silent. So much so, it was almost dream-like in a way.  It just didn’t “compute” that something could be doing that and not make a sound. It was definitely not a balloon, moving too evenly and directly.  No ""wobble"" or any variance in its trajectory or speed - very smooth, perfectly straight line, perfectly consistent speed.  It flew directly over us on its path.  I have no doubt whatsoever it was moving of its own power.  And this is hard to explain, but it was as if it was maintaining its level, speed and smoothness with no effort - as if gravity, air resistance or any of our conventional laws of physics were not an issue, if that makes any sense. There were no definite lights, however the entire object was dimly luminous.  It was certainly the source of the light itself, it was not a reflection or a beam of light.  Nor did it project any illumination or beam of light.  It just was kind of phosphorescent.  There were no visible markings at all.  It was not really bright, but sort of similar to how a light looks when turned low on a dimmer switch, or even less.  It didn't have finely exact definite edges - it was dim enough to appear somewhat diffuse, though the shape was completely discernable, and incomparable to anything known.   And it was definitely a solid object. The shape is difficult to describe - somewhat diamond gem shaped, but more rounded, sort of like a horseshoe crab shape without the tail.  We both had the impression we were looking at the bottom of the object without being able to see the sides.  The same perspective one would have if they held a plate or bowl overhead and could only see the bottom. The object continued on an absolutely straight path, traveling SE, and eventually we lost sight of it, after about 30 or 40 seconds from initially sighting it. What's strange, now that I consider it, is that it did not change in dimension, in other words, as it got further away, it didn't necessarily get commensurately smaller as one would expect from normal perspective, yet we both perceived it getting further away.  Very hard to explain.  But, it was as if it finally went out of sight more as a result of not being able to see its luminosity from that distance anymore, as opposed to it getting smaller and smaller. Oddly, I feel as if its shape did not change commensurately either, the further away it got, it did not appear to become more elliptical, as one would expect something of that shape to do in normal circumstances.  Nor did we perceive seeing “sides” or a “top” to it as one may expect.  Yet, somehow, we knew it was not paper-thin, we knew we were seeing the bottom of an object of undeterminable overall multiple dimensions.  Very, very difficult to explain adequately. Although my husband kept asking me, “What is it?” and I kept answering, “I don’t know!” we were both calm during the ""event"" - no feeling of fear or panic, more so a feeling of wondering or awe.  My husband felt it was a feeling of excitement, I felt strangely calm, but in wonderment.  It is only now, after the fact, that we are somewhat agitated, a little fearful I guess, and somewhat bewildered.  Like our logical minds are seeking an explanation. Something else odd – an estimated 8 to 10 minutes after our experience, a huge jet, definitely not a commercial passenger jet, flew over really low and fast, and was very, very loud.  We NEVER have anything like this in our area – only small planes, little commuter jets upon occasion, or commercial jets flying really high.  This thing sounded like a rocket or fighter jet, and was flying really low.  We had just come in the house, and upon hearing how loud this jet was, my husband ran back outside to see it.  He said that it went south, and then abruptly circled easterly, and then turned SE, and continued in the very direction we saw the object fly.  We just thought that was weird, especially considering what we had just seen. So – that’s the story!   As fantastic as it sounds, I know what we saw, and have absolutely no idea what it was, and absolutely no doubt it was NOT anything conventional possibilities can explain.  It was like nothing I’ve ever seen in my life.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,37.66861323741007,-120.99442244604317

This is now the 3rd time that I've seen this. Southwest of my location in Carlsbad, I spotted a bright blue light in the sky.  Following it, the light would turn blue as it flew to my left and then it would turn red as it flew back towards the right.  It circled in the same exact spot in the sky that I've seen it before.  The light also hovered, dipped, and shot up into the air, behaving much like a toy helicopter.  Once again, though, from this distance, someone must have put a ton of lights on it, if that's what it is.  The lights seem brighter than a normal aircraft's lights would be from the same distance.  It's seen south and fairly close to Palomar Airport, which is my concern.  In this third sighting, I contacted the local PD for the second time.  I did not report it to the local PD the first time I saw it, but I have for the second and third sightings.  I still believe that someone may be flying something that's either a remote control plane, helicopter, or a! toy UFO out of a neighborhood park near Poinsettia Ln and Ambrosia Rd.  I will get video if this continues.  It seems to disappear by slowly circling down towards the ground as it gradually drops out of view.  That's the main reason I believe this is coming out of a local park and not an actual aircraft flying out over the ocean. I may have the distance wrong, however, and someone may be flying this from the beach. The officer I spoke with told me that I was the only one that called it in tonight, so that's why I believe it must be closer than Interstate 5 and the coast.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,33.12780664961637,-117.30352710997443

After retiring to bed on a late Sunday evening in a cheap downtown motel room in Amarillo, watching television until I fall asleep, I tossed and turned until somewhere between 2:30 and 3:00 a.m., when suddenly a light flickered through the curtains.  I didn’t pay much attention as I thought it to be a neon sign on the Bank of America building across the street.  I rolled over and attempted to sleep when the light again flickered through the curtains.  I still ignored it, and again with even more intensity the light flickered through the curtains. I reluctantly got up and moved the curtains so I could see where the light was coming from.  I looked up at the top of the Bank of America building of about 20 stories high and the neon sign was not flickering.  I was closing the curtains when I noticed what I thought was a police helicopter surrounded by bright lights. Spot lights were coming from the base and shining in various spots in the parking lot.  My first thought was that it was some kind of drug bust and the helicopter would be landing with a swat team.  However, the craft did not land, but stayed hovering high in the dark night.  Now it had definitely got my attention. As I focused on it, I made out the shape to be a cube, definitely three dimensional.  I couldn’t make out any substance such as steel.  It was a cube of light, swirling bright light on a three dimensional cube.  I was still trying to rationalize what it could be.  I then remembered seeing special shape hot air balloons in Albuquerque which lit up at night in similar fashion.  ""That’s what is must be,"" I told myself.  Then something even stranger happened.  I heard musical tones similar to wind chimes or ancient flutes that we often hear in Greek mythology type movies.  But the sounds were coming from inside my head even though it felt I was hearing them with my ears. I became afraid and did not move for about 20 minutes while I continued to watch.  I finally said to myself, ""What ever it is knows I am here, and I cannot hide from it.""   I immediately dressed and walked outside.  I stayed underneath the 2nd floor overhang and peered out to see above.  It was even more magnificent when viewing through the night air although it was hard to focus on, somewhat blurred.  At that moment I was surrounded by an orchestra of musical tones again sounding like ancient flutes or pipes.  I thought to myself, how beautiful!  The song was child like, something you might hear a children’s nursery.  Again, I heard the music in my head and outside, but not in our natural way of hearing, hard to explain . . . To make a long story short, I packed my bags and was running to my SUV when an early morning garbage truck and driver stopped in the alley next to my car. I looked at the driver in the eyes and signaled to look up with my eyes.  I turned and ran with luggage in tow, got in my car and drove two hours to my home in Lubbock.  I drove to my sister’s office where my mother happened to be and told both of them what I witnessed.  By the look on their faces they were fearful for me.  I phoned a friend of mine who happens to be a deputy sheriff in Amarillo to ask if anyone had phoned in such a sighting in the early morning dark.  He laughed hysterically and said no, but would let me know if anyone did.  He did not call back.  I’ve since moved to Phoenix and have told only a handful of people what I witnessed that early morning on June 20, 2005, five years ago. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain anonymous.

I stopped watching them since i had to drive, but my wife kept looking.  Then she says ""oh my god"".  I am like, ""what?""   She says ""a bluish-white light just appeared in the sky and they (the ships) vanished"".  I was like ""no way""...and i looked where they had been and sure enough, they were gone, just starry sky was there.  Weird.   So we kept driving.  About maybe 5 minutes or so later my wife says ""there they are again"".  I was like ""jesus...what the hell"".   So i stopped again and we got out to see.  Once again the 2 big triangle ships were blotting out most of the sky but this time some kind of orange colored orbs were WAY up in the sky and floating in mid air.  They pulsed in color, yellowish orange, and there were 4 of them spaced out (i could not say how far because i had no spacial references).   Anyways, one of them dropped down lower than the others and appeared to be getting larger, and indeed it was rapidly coming closer to where we were even though it had to still be miles away.  We had our dog with us and he was barking and seemed pretty nervous at this point and i really didnt know what to do.  I thought maybe we should go back to the car but we just kind of decided to stay on the road and watch.   It stopped probably a mile (guessing) from us and was very very low to the ground. Then it hovered a while and went back the way that it came.   Then (sorry this story is so long) we were about to get back in the car when we heard a plane coming from behind us (northeast) and it was moving so fast it had to be a fighter jet, we could see the lights on the plane also even though it was pretty high up in the sky.  It was flying super fast towards! the glowing light orbs and the big triangle ships.   The damnedest thing, we saw the plane fly (from our vantage point) right close to one of the orb things and the plane blew up.  We saw it explode and drop out of the sky in flames but there was no noise, although it was far away and we thought maybe thats why we couldnt hear it explode.   So at this point i am thinking that there is NO way that we are the only ones seeing this whole thing unfold, so again i check all the radio stations but still nothing.   We both were trying to decide if we should keep driving south towards phoenix or stay away...and we decided to keep going.  As we got closer and closer to the city, the lights of the city made it impossible to see anything anymore and that was it.  I don't know what it all was but it was not possible for something that huge to fly like that and i still have no idea what it was.

I looked up and saw a HUGE sphere in the sky.  It was perfectly still, and made no sound.  I only looked up because of some birds--I wouldn't have noticed it otherwise--it blended almost completely in with the surrounding sky and clouds, but you could see the edges of it fairly clearly when you were looking straight at it.  It wasn't reflective at all, and I didn't see lights.  It was weird--I remember thinking it was almost like there was some kind of computer generated surface on the object that matched it exactly to the color of the sky and cloud cover, but you could see that the clouds didn't match up on the edges with the sky, and that they were moving a little differently than the real clouds.  I pulled my car over and got out to watch it for at least 15 minutes.  It didn't move.  I had my young children in the car with me--they had an after sch! ool appointment, so I had to continue on into Lincoln.  For the record, I know what a weather balloon looks like, and this was way too big and the wrong color to be a weather balloon.  I have no idea what it was, or how much longer it was there.  I should add that this was within 5 miles of the Nebraska Air National Guard base, within 45 miles of Offutt Airforce base in Omaha.  What did I see? ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.

I saw three to four dirt brown in color (not gray or black like birds look), and besides they were much bigger than birds..but they  looked animal-like I knew they weren’t birds, because birds soar or fly and these were just floating with the cloud.  But they had a form.  They were definitely not balloons. I also could tell they were quite large, because if a buzzard, the bigget bird around here was that high it would have been about a sixth to an eighth of the size of these things, and it would have been soaring and flying. They were stationary and were in a line side by side but separate individual objects, not moving any parts, just floating with the clouds. I looked at them for a short while but could not figure out what they were.  They didn’t look like anything I had ever seen before. I went into my house to get a pair of binoculars, but when I got back outside, they weren’t there.

As I took out my phone to  capture the Unidentified Flying Object (had a blackberry pearl at the time) and while I went to the camera mode to take a quick picture of it all of a sudden the camera was not working and the screen had gone completely white during this first event, and all of a sudden as soon as this object in the sky disappeared I look down at my phone and the camera function starts to work.  I knew it was time to purchase a new phone so I got a new iphone a couple of days later.  On the night of September 17th 2008. My girlfriend and I were walking down the street from my house and we saw the same object in the sky in the same place.  The object was just sitting idle for what seemed to be a couple of minutes .It was circular in shape and had a neon green glow coming from! it.  I knew the location it was hovering over.  It was hovering over the water I would say about 15-20,000ft in the air at the Port Whitby Boat Marina in Ontario, Canada.  Right around that area.  As the green glowing object started moving I knew it was time to test the camera out on my phone. As I take out my phone and get the camera ready to start taking a couple of pictures.  My girlfriend and I are stunned by what we are observing.  The object is idle in one spot, then in a split second must have travelled a couple of miles in the sky to the left.  Then stops for a split second again and then goes back in another split second to the right then once again stops for a split second then again another split second later back to the left when it stops in less then a second again then in speed that I have never seen before not even from fighter jets shoots off to the right into the sky and disappears.  I had managed to be able to take 2 pictures on my phone during this event of the ! object moving back and forth. I know for certainty there is NO aircraf t in the world that can perform such maneuvers and can have speed like that and be able to stop on a dime and again accelerate to incredible speed in what seemed like just a couple of miles.  This was no human constructed aircraft. It was from what I can tell an Unidentified Flying Object .

Then I saw 2 rows of 3 large rectangles of blue white glowing light. Each rectangle could have been house size.  They appeared to be at the rear of the craft as it moved away from me.  This reminded me of the Star Wars movie and the engines of ""The Millennium Falcon"". It was amazing how big this looked to me, I said out loud to my self, ""I hope its one of ours"". I had just come from the Grand Canyon and was driving almost due West on I40 toward Kingman AZ.  I had just passed US93 when I saw the electrical sparks through my windshield to my right.  It was flying along very slow for a jet and it had a ball of light traveling below it near the ground at the same rate of speed.  You can see the ball in the first few frames, might be a reflection too. I grabbed my video camera and while driving started taping.  In the beginning I passed a freeway sign, Blake Ranch Rd. Exit 1 mile.  I recorded until just after I pass the exit, the craft was to far away, maybe 3 or 4 miles.  It would have passed over the Kingman Airport or very close. When I played the tape later in Kingman, the time code showed I had traveled that one mile in 32 seconds!  No freaking way, I would have had to be going over 100MPH.  My car is 20 yrs old and was packed full, I was moving to San Diego, I was going up hill, no way could doing even 100 mph in that car.  Was I in a time warp of some kind?   I tested the camera and nothing wrong there.   I posted the video on Youttube, but its just shaky lights due to being hand held.  I also posted this report before but it must have been taken down!

I had trouble sleeping the night of my sighting, so I decided to go outside and water the back lawn.  I stepped out in the back patio and reached down to pick-up the water hose when I came back up I saw what at the moment I thought was a kite.  I immediately concluded that the object was not a kite because it stopped moving but continued to rotate clock-wise.  I stood and stared at the object to study its form, color, & shape.  This was the (MOST Obscure Object) I have ever seen… I also noticed that this object made absolutely no noise, and the most interesting aspect about it is its shape.  The object looked like a vertebrae or back bone and has it rotated it seemed to be flexing in a cumbersome motion. The color was a faded florescent blue, and the light that it emitted was even throughout the entire shape and form of the object. The size could have been 7-10 ft long and 2-3ft in diameter. The distance was about 40-50ft above me and facing north towards the Hollywood Hills. I ! wanted to go get my camera that was sitting on my desk so I backed away from the object to my back door keeping my eyes on it so I don’t lose track of its position. I ran to my desk grabbed my camera and ran back out to my patio. The object was no-longer in its previous position, It had climbed vertically straight up at what I estimated to be 1-2 thousand ft. I turned off the LCD display on my camera to see if I can acquire it through the view finder. I could not see the object, but I snapped 4 succession pictures in the general direction of the object. I could still observe the object with the naked eye but could not see it through the camera. I continued to watch the object for about another minute ½ then it passed out of view completely. I then placed a call to the (LAPD) to file a report. The Officer who handled the call listened intently and asked me 1 or 2 questions, and then offered to send out a chopper that was in the area to see if they could intercept the object.! I said go ahead but that I could not see the object anymore s! o it wou ld be impossible for me to give any position of where it might be at that moment. The Officer thanked me for calling and said that it was an interesting conversation and that if the object returns to call again immediately. I then called (MUFON) but got no answer.  After that night I had tried to make sense of what I had seen that night and the only explanation I can come up with is that it could (NOT) have been anything explained in conventional terms and it seemed to be under intelligent control because it stopped in mid-air almost at the exact moment I took notice of the object. It was like the object was watching me has I was watching the object.  And when I returned outside this thing had traveled straight up vertically 1-2 thousand ft, from the point and position from where I left it to grab my camera. This was truly the most strangest sighting I have ever experienced… I have had an Abduction experience when I was 6 years old, and throughout my life I have had UFO sighti! ng of all different types, but nothing like the 1 I had this night. I did a little research into this object and there was some video on YouTube pertaining to a sighting that Story Musgrave the Astronaut had videotaped from the Space Shuttle. Here the YouTube video Link that will give some idea to what I witnessed: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jotdaXX1w2A The object I saw moved in the exact same way has the video clip of the Story Musgrave Sightings. Its form or shape hard to determine whether it’s the same Object. But its movement is identical to my sighting. This sends chills up my spine when I think about it. I keep asking myself what could it have been??? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2010-06-23T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

Just then it made a large, graceful, consistent right hand arc and sped away.  I watched it for e few seconds until it disappeared into the horizon. I would describe it as a perfectly round, bright white, featureless ""ball"" about the size of a large washing machine.  It zipped by under the left wing about 400 ft. down and was traveling very fast (several hundred or maybe a thousand mph?)   As it arced a turn to the right it didn't deviate in altitude or in speed whatsoever, it just changed direction.  I was struck by how fast and how smoothly it moved through the air.

I don't know much about astronomy but I do know that there aren't that many planets to be seen that well, not to mention these ""stars"" were very close to one another.   After a couple minutes of trying to figure out what they could be they began to move.  They had been fixed in the sky and now were moving towards one another.  They were in very close proximity and moving all around each other.  The best way to describe them is to compare them to gnats or moths flying around a light source only a lot slower.  When they first started moving I thought maybe they were lights from helicopters but I don't think helicopters fly that close to one another and not in those kinds of patterns.  After 30 seconds or so of being confused by what I was watching they moved, in unison and fairly quickly, over the tree-line and I could no longer see them.

As I looked ahead, I saw what appeared to be a plane taking off.  It was flying at a height of about 250 feet, in an eastward direction at about a 30 degree angle.  It seemed strange, but I didn't pay much attention to it until I saw it make a dramatic climb in altitude.  It went from flying at a 30 degree angle to flying at about an 80 degree angle. It was practically flying vertically, and it was climbing altitude rapidly. After about 5 seconds of flying, it had probably risen to a height of about 600 feet. Then, it gradually began to level - off.   Once it was level, it slowly turned left and headed north towards me and my dog.  It banked, and its triangular shape became apparent.  It was probably flying at around 70 miles per hour.  As it approached and passed overhead, I was able to see its underside.  It was clearly a triangular aircraft. It was black or gray in color, and it had one small white light on each corner (which made 3 white lights altogether), and one small red light in the center. It continued to fly north, and I watched it until it disappeared behind the trees.  Throughout the entire flight, it made a low whistling noise, similar to a quiet ""whoooosh"" sound. It sounded similar to the sound that an airplane makes as it moves through the air, but I didn't hear the humming of an engine.   The entire experience probably lasted about 1 minute.",2009-04-14T00:00:00,41.7587,-72.9575

I looked towards the rear of the plane and saw a dark object. It looked like a cigar.  It may have been a disc but I could not tell for sure because it looked as if I was looking at a side profile of the object.  The object appeared to be moving away from the plane I was on and was turning left.  It was also above the cloud line and there was no tail as seen with planes. After watching it for about 30 seconds I took out my cell phone and tried to get a picture of the object.  However, by the time I got my phone out the object was gone.  It looked like the object had move so the plane was covering my view.  I still took a picture and there appears to be an object like I seen in it, but I am not sure if it is the object or the tail wing of the plane.

At first I thought it was a star, but it seemed way too large and bright.  The object appeared to be stationary at this time.  I did see an airplane flying by in a NW direction, at what appeared to be a much lower altitude than the large light.  By comparison it's lights seemed exponentially smaller that the bright object in the sky that I was focused on. The two did not seem to interact in any way. As I watched it began to look more like 2 stars very close together, then the space between the white lights appeared to grow larger. When the horizontal distance between them reached a certain size, the object began to move south toward where I stood. At this point I knew it was not stars, so I thought it might be an airplane, but it seemed strange that it had hovered in one spot for so long before moving, not to mention the way the lights went from looking like one light only to looking like 2. As it flew over me relatively slowly, I could see it was a matte silver color, and triangle shaped with 2 larger bright white lights approximately in the center of it and 2 smaller ones that were closer together and directly behind the 2 larger ones. It did not have the flashing red or blue lights that you see on airplanes. These lights did not blink at all. I think I could hear it as it flew above me, but the noise was very low, not nearly as loud as any aircraft I've ever experienced that was flying that low.

The video quality is not very good, since it is taken at night in the city, with the resulting light pollution, and the digital zoom to its maximum capacity. The recording is spectacular although the conditions of brightness and sharpness common to this type of devices. The video can be put under all kind of tests to ensure its authenticity. It is absolutely real. I do not want to avoid comments identify humorous or otherwise by known or not as well known. I hope you do not mind this detail. I've got a Private Pilot License, and thank to my experience and knowledge about flying, and the knowing on attitude and maneuvers of aircraft on airspace, that's why I'm absolutely sure that this are not ""conventional"" fixed wing aircraft. The only possible explanation would be that they were helicopters, but given the characteristics of air space location, time of sighting, weather and number of traffics sighted, it's hard to believe we're talking about this type of aircraft (and also due to other reasons explained below). Let's  describe the facts:  Location: San Sebastian, Spain Date: 06/22/2008 Time: 2:50 AM (local time)  The facts are set in a rainy late night, after a sultry day, classic Basque coast, in the afternoon that triggers a ""gale"" that completely changes the weather, thus passing a hot sunny day in excess , a late-night and early morning rain, the sky completely covered (the ceiling would be around 600 or 800 feet). Weather conditions certainly were not ideal, either for VFR (visual) or IFR (instrumental) flights. I leave a disco located near the mouth of Urumea river, 300 ft from the sea, and the first thing I see (outside the disco could at that time be about twenty people watching the scene) is something like flares or fireworks (is the first thing that went through my head just seen the objects). I never leave my amazement when I see that they are objects that have a bright orange light, fixed and weak (although the video appears in a flashing mode), which seem to be quite large, and maintaining a steady ascent flight (improper of a flare or firework). This is a sighting made up of at least nine traffic. I say at least it is the number of traffic which document the recording, but I am sure that before I started recording I could see more objects. I think there were around 13 or 15 spotted objects. I think this is a considerable number of traffics, which were moving in groups of 3 or 4, some in pairs and solo, with variable speeds from one another, although all were heading in an east-west direction, looking that its point of departure was off or the sea. I could not hear any sound coming from the objects (sound of rotors, ...). The truth is that my proximity to the disco would probably prevent me hear any sounds associated with them, but it is also true that in the case of many objects, it is logical that it had heard a noise, more so considering that the wind, even weak or very weak intensity, was at that time, and after the passage of the gale, north-northwest direction, so it was not a factor which prevented listening t! o sounds from that area, or that slowed them. The recording, in mp4 format and weighing 63.4 MB, has a duration of 4 min. and 25 sec., and has audio (with a ""taco"" or improper word included). I have to say it was something I could not believe. I was watching something that escaped my mind all logic by the circumstances of the moment, and physics of flight if we think of objects such as flares and fireworks. I had never seen anything like that. I have never spotted suspicious objects to be classified as UFOs but from my experience as a pilot and my knowledge of aviation, and from an objective perspective, I cannot give a logical explanation and some of what happened on that late night/early-morning of Sunday June 22nd on the sky of San Sebastian. Trying  to clear any doubts, I first put in touch with local newspaper ""El Diario Vasco"" once I got home (around 03:30 AM). From the paper, and to my question about whether they had received any calls or had known what had happened, they said no, and the person writing that I attended dealt with the subject telling me that I would have the exclusive on the matter. I did not provide any information in this medium, because my focus was solely on finding out what had happened, beyond creating a notice or cause any unnecessary minimum alarm. A few minutes later I put in touch with San Sebastian Airport with the intention of resolving any doubt in the case of several traffics had taken off from this airfield, which is unlikely since these facilities are operational only from 06:00 h. to 21:00 pm GMT. Indeed, a member of airport security personnel, along with several Civil Guard troops, at that time the only staff at the facility, tells me that since the closing time of the aerodrome there has not been any takeoff or landing operation. Thus, in the narration of the facts and seeking a possible explanation between the event, he tells me that there must have been a chopper concentration close to the field ... If so, that is, if it were private helicopters, where did they take off? at that time? in those weather conditions? how many? what was their fate? There are many questions, in addition to the already questionable as ""normal"" physical characteristics of the flight, since no one respects Training, traffic looking! each flight develops its sole discretion, even at times to provoke some kind of collision between aircraft. Also, the navigation lights are anything but navigation lights. They are more comparable to ""landing lights"", although these are only used at final approach maneuvers, landing and take-off on, but that's not all, as the brightness, hue, intensity and very important direction of the light beam, not easily explained. Landing light beams are projected in a sense, the flight path, and not through a kind of focus light at an angle of 360 ° as in this case. In the recording can be viewed at all times the same intensity of each traffic light, regardless of their position, and throughout the flight path east-west. Thinking on the possibility that, being helicopters, were those well known and dilapidated soviet made MIL-MI that usually come from Eastern Europe to Spain for the summer fire season, I contacted next day with the tower of Labacolla Airport (Santiago de Compostela, Spain) for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was a landing operation of such choppers over last morning. The only reason for contacting with Santiago de Compostela Airport was that is the only one airport in the northern half of the Spanish peninsula, with the exception of the Foronda Airport (Vitoria), which operates 24 hours a day (H24 operational). The answer given by the driver in command at that time was negative, indicating that there was only air military exercises of NATO airspace early in the vertical drawn from León to the west, there are therefore any flight plan or known traffic area in the hours watching the events. We are talking about a longitudinal distance between two points (San Sebastia! n - León) approximately 160 nautical miles (300 km). We must take into account the rigor that military and civilian authorities established to determine airspace to such maneuvers, for the danger they entail implicit in the civil air operations. Given these responses, only have the option of consulting military authorities and the Radar Control Center in Madrid, Spain. Not being easy the access to these establishments, I leave it to anyone interested in the phenomenon of inquiring beyond the initial investigations carried out. All these details about the physics and flight characteristics of the objects spotted have been discussed with different Airline Transport Pilots of recognized national carriers, they can likewise view the recording made, and very surprised at what is seen in the same, have not been able either to give a priori any explanation of the phenomenon. Like me, they could give as valid only the explanation that they were helicopters, yes, with all the questions raised above.

I estimate the object was over 1000 ft. above the ground.  The object resembled a tube that was larger on both ends similar to having a 747 bulging cockpit on both ends size large but size relative to a 747 is unknown and I could not identify any wings, white on top shaded on the bottom and I observed the object for 15 minutes while I traveled. After about six minutes total time it was directly to my left and still not moving. I estimate its distance from the road to be four miles plus or minus one mile. As I continued moving I kept looking back, the object remained where I had originally seen it but it became harder to find as I was driving. when I was about eleven miles from Deming New Mexico I could no longer identify it. It may have moved or it was just to difficult to see in the scattered cloudy sky while driving at 60 mph. Please don't criticize my looking behind while driving, there was only scattered traffic and at least I never use a cell phone while driving. The strange part of this is the object did not move, it hovered or at least from a moving car it appeared to hover in one location throughout the entire time. I have an engineering degree and I firmly do not believe in alien aircraft. There were other vehicles on the highway that should have seen the object, the border patrol agents at the checkpoint may have seen the object although it would have been behind them as they faced the traffic they would be checking. What I saw is unidentified, at least by myself, Einstein's theories seem to preclude the possibilities of space travel and until somebody, as advance in their thinking as Einstein comes up with a better theory I will continue to not believe in space travel, but I saw what I saw.",2009-04-14T00:00:00,32.22860909090909,-107.76305454545454

It was moving slowly in a northerly direction and began descending toward Chief Mountain northeast of us where finally disappeared below the horizon at about 2135.

It got dimmer as it descended but brightened sometimes.   My wife observed it looked blue as it descended.  It was clear and cold (-8 degrees).  Whatever it was, it was impressive.

Three anomalous stationary lights over Bowie for over an hour.,Bowie,MD,2009-02-27T05:05:00,unknown,1 hr. 10 mins.,"Occurred : 2/27/2009 05:05  (Entered as : 02/27/2009 5:05) Reported: 3/1/2009 1:05:10 PM 13:05 Posted: 3/19/2009 Location: Bowie, MD Shape: Unknown Duration:1 hr. 10 mins.",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69012.html,"Three anomalous stationary lights over Bowie for over an hour. At 0505 EST I went out on my balcony for my morning cigarette before getting ready for work. My balcony is on the second floor with a southwest-facing view. This was early morning so the sky was very dark and the conditions were calm and clear. As I looked to my far right I saw three lights in the sky. One white light was on the left and to the right were two white lights fairly close together. The two lights on the right were both strobing in regular frequency, but never disappearing between strobes. The three lights maintained the same distance between each other giving the impression that they were all connected. There are normally many aircraft in the sky and my location is within the southeast approach to Baltimore-Washington International Airport. I can also see planes on approach to Andrews Air Force Base to my southwest.  My immediate reaction was that this was a C-17 Globemaster (which I have seen on approach to Andrews from my office outside the Beltway) banking very slowly away from me on approach to Andrews. As I continued to watch the lights however, they appeared to be stationary and at a slight angle – the left light maybe 15 degrees lower than the two right lights. I am familiar enough with aircraft to know that this is not a conventional landing light configuration for fixed-wing aircraft and deduced that a fixed-wing aircraft would also not bank indefinitely. There were no red or green navigation lights also making me suspicious that this was not a fixed-wing aircraft. With the distance between the left and right-side lights at approx. 150-200 feet, I deduced that this was also too large to be a helicopter. I estimate the horizontal distance of the lights from my position at about 2-3 miles at an altitude of about 1,000 feet. The configuration and position of the lights never changed; the two lights on the right continued to strobe in regular frequency. I continued to watch the lights for 20 minutes – never changing formation. I hopped in the shower and got ready for work. I was looking forward to daylight so that I might get a better view of any mass associated with the lights.  After getting ready for work approximately 40 minutes later (60 minutes total), I returned to the balcony to find the lights exactly as they had been – same three lights, same angle, same formation, and same strobing. At this point it was now 0605. I left the house and drove across Route 301 to the gas station to fill up. The lights were still in the sky and daybreak was setting in. I proceeded in my car heading westbound on Route 50. As I looked out the driver’s-side window, I noticed that the lights were in front of me on my left-hand side (southwest). At this point daylight was setting in and I could make out grey mass associated with the lights, however, driving in 80 mph rush hour traffic meant that I had to pay attention to the road and I lost visual. While I thought this might have been a large blimp such as the Skyship 600, this was inconsistent with the grey mass which appeared more cigar-shaped from my cursory observation. When I arrived at work, close to Route 50 and the Beltway, I looked in the general direction from my office and was unable to see the lights.  After discussing the incident with a couple of co-workers I conducted an online search for “lights over Washington DC” thinking perhaps others might have reported witnessing the same event. I came across the incident report on ufocasebook.com from October 26, 2005. This report shared similarities with my experience in terms of number of lights and formation. They were able to get close enough to see a Blackhawk helo along with two lights and witnessed vertical and horizontal movement. I did not witness any movement at all and while I did see grey mass associated with the lights, I was unable to make any concise determination as to shape while driving down the highway.  When I arrived home that evening, I plotted the trajectory from my balcony in the direction of the lights (which obviously were no longer there) based on the corner of a Kohl’s department store across the street. The trajectory caught me off guard seeing as it crossed from the southeast side to the northeast side of Route 50 – I thought it would have been southwest. While driving down Route 50 on my way to work I witnessed the lights on my left (southwest of my position). I also did a little local research to see if any strange events were reported in the media. Well, something did happen the previous night (Feb 26) at 2200 hrs. An 81 car train carrying coal had derailed in a residential area of Bowie. In the derailment, 13 cars had skipped the tracks and tipped over including the locomotive. The incident is almost consistent with my trajectory of where the lights had been. However, the derailment occurred on the NORTH side of Highway 50, while I witnessed the lights on the south side of Highway 50. If this was a series of helicopters, how were they able to stay stationary in perfect formation for over an hour? Why would they be so high in the sky if they were monitoring an accident? And why would they hover over a residential area for that long that early in the morning? It just doesn’t add up for me.  I have no idea what the anomalous lights were. If there is some type of aircraft that does have this lighting configuration I would really like to know. So far, I have no answers.

It was underneath some light fair weather cumulus.   I watched it go southbound until it was out of sight - it did not accelerate or change altitude, estimated speed 250-350 knots based on the speed of the jet that the fleet described below was following.   About two minutes later on the same heading there was a fleet of identical objects headed south, it was not packed into one tight formation it was spread out so there were groups of two or three craft in formation.  The lead object in the fleet was tailing an airline jet on the same heading by about one mile.  The objects made no sound and emitted no light however I did notice a 'fuzzy' aura around them.  Based on the size of the aircraft and the fair weather clouds, I would estimate that the objects were about 3000 feet altitude and approximately 30  to 50 feet in diameter.   I tried counting the craft but lost count at around 8.   I was trying to focus on viewing one group, when another group would fly into my field of vision, confusing my counting. I also noticed cross-traffic, an airline jet crossed overhead higher than the cloud and higher than the fleet at about the same time. Yesterday was one day when I really wish I had my camera, I could have taken really good pictures, probably could have taken closeups with my zoom. The objects were all headed directly south towards the border. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate a date of the sighting.

I seen over Salt Lake City, Utah, Feb. 27, 2009!!! UFO’s over Salt Lake City Feb. 27, 2009.  (1) The first one I sighted at about 7:10 pm.  It had  3 very dim lights on the bottom?  The lights were in a triangle pattern moving very fast, silent and NNW direction.  It appeared to be bending light around it?  It was like it was invisible, like you could see though it in a way, except for the lights on it.  The lights didn’t blink at all and were white in color with a very slight gray yellow tint, and was very dim and hard to see.  Very stealthily, no sound at all. The bending of the light around the lights reminded me of the movie “Predator”. Like when the creature was kind of visible yet non-visible. I’m in the flight path of the Jets that come in to land at the Salt Lake City International  Airport, it was about the same height of the jets that come in to land but slightly higher and just west of me. My thumb held at full arms distance would be able to cover this object. The sighting was less than 4 to 5 seconds. See the 1st sketch below  (2) I’m excited to see such a thing, so I stay outside and watch the sky intently. I’m on the cell phone telling one of my friends about this sighting, he lives near Ogden City, about a 45 minute drive on the freeway. While I was telling him about the 7:10 pm sighting, I see another dim set of lights come straight towards me. Except this is Huge! It was a single row of 3 lights (dim) on a 45 degree angle. It moves straight over me with no sound at all and again in a NNW direction. The sighting was about 3 ½ seconds, In 3 ½ seconds it was gone! It was as low as the lowest jets fly that are preparing to land at the SLC Int. Airport. It appeared to be having light dimly radiating from above and around  it with almost a shadow like area around it too, I could almost see a craft on one side where the row of lights was. Over towards the right was where most of the light emanated from above the thing. It was like one side of a V of lights that were visible.  This thing also seemed to be bending light making it was very hard to see. If I held my arm fully extended with the palm flat against it still would not fully be able to cover this object. Like I said earlier it was huge! The time was about 8:30 pm. I had binoculars around my neck but was so dumb founded at this object I didn’t even think of the binoculars or of the camera in my pocket, plus it was so fast! See the 2nd sketch below  (3) I’m still outside watching the sky’s (8:45pm). My neighbor comes home and see’s me outside with a coat, hat, gloves and binoculars. With a puzzled look come over and asked me what I’m doing. I tell her and she starts asking me where I seen the object etc. So I’m telling her and  all of a sudden I see another object barely visible in a sense and very high traveling in a NNW direction. I immediately remember my binoculars this time and quickly find this object in my 10x50 power binoculars. It was like a flying wing with about 9 round lights forming a slight V formation. It was fast and silent. The sighting was about 4 seconds long. Her eyes were better than mine. I asked what she saw and she also saw a triangle pattern of lights. I can’t say that I could see much more than the lights. But it did appear to be dark between the area of the lights in the form of a wing type V pattern. We also noticed it had no sound what so ever. See the 3rd sketch below  (4) It’s cold out and I’m still out watching the sky, 3 in one night! What’s going on! Anyway it’s about 11:00 pm now, I’m in my back yard now, earlier I was in the driveway. I’m looking to the south. All of a sudden I see a dimly visible row of lights in a slight V pattern but yet almost straight across. It’s coming fast and low about the same height of the jets that come in to land at the airport. I quickly view this with my  binoculars. I’m shocked! It’s not one thing, it’s a group of white triangle’s. They were moving in a, a moving formation 15 to 17 of them in triangle formations in each triangle pattern the lead one would drop back to the rear and then move back to the front again, this was happening in unison along this formation line, from one side to the other(One triangle of formation with one in between the next triangle formation with one on each side of the triangle formation. They changed pattern about 4 times). It was very strange and puzzling. It also reminded me of birds in flight but different too. The sighting was no more than 4 ½ seconds. I would guess each craft was a little bigger than a small airplane. They had no lights on them but had a white glow to them with a Ripley effect around them. They were not bright at all, dim yet very solid looking triangles. They were a perfect triangle shape with a slight V notched out the back edge of them. They were silent and fast moving in a NNW direction. They went right over me. I stared at them intently with my binoculars. The width of the formation was wider than the palm of my hand flatly held out at arm’s length. Please see the 4th sketch below. I stayed outside until about 1:15 am, I didn’t see anything else peculiar.  All of this in one night! I will never forget this night!   I tried to attach my sketches but it didn't let me here, sorry.

On the evening of Feb. 27, 2009 my daughter and I were driving from the pet store on Lake Mary Blvd. to her place down Lake Emma Road in Lake Mary, FL., it was almost 9:00 pm. We noticed what looked like a very low flying aircraft, flying west to southwest, something about the way it behaved just seemed odd. It appeared to be triangular in shape, but it was difficult to really tell. It had 3 white lights. We stopped at her place to pick up a hat and then proceeded back up Lake Emma Road going north and started seeing a lot more lights that seemed rather low for planes and something about the way they were moving, while similar to a plane, was just a bit off.  The movements of the objects was smooth and steady, flying in one direction, but something just didn’t look right for a plane or helicopter. When we were on Greenway Blvd., almost to my house, we saw a larger, brighter lit object, with at least 4 bright white lights going very low and descending near the water treatment plant. This object seemed to vary in speed and almost appeared to be stationary for a short moment. We tried to follow it down the street to see where it went, but it quickly was blocked from our sight by trees. We did not hear any sounds from this object. We turned around at the library. On our way back could not locate the object we had seen several minutes earlier. When coming up the street next to ours moments later, we saw another large brightly lighted object flying very low, going west, but it to was quickly blocked from our sight by houses and trees. It appeared to be right over our neighborhood, within blocks from our house. We heard no sound from the object. The speed seemed too slow for a plane. This object looked like the object we had seen over the water treatment facility several minutes earlier. We went to my house on Whittingham Place and stood out front and out in the back yard off and on for about an hour. Over the coarse of this time frame, we saw at least 30 more lighted objects. The lights on the objects varied. Some had one or two white lights with one red blinking light. Some had only white lights, at least 2 or 3 and were blinking very fast, all at once or all at different times. Some objects had bluish-white lights with red blinking lights. There were a variety of blinking patterns and number of lights on different objects. I went out again around 10:30 pm, within 5 minutes I saw at least 12 more lighted objects, some were going southeast, some were going east, some were going west, some were going north. About half of them seemed to be flying abnormally  low. Several of them seemed to be much higher in altitude. I went out again around 11:00 pm and in one minute, saw 7 lighted objects. There were 2 objects going to the southeast and I could hear what sounded like a helicopter or small plane engine. I go out and look at the stars and moon often and have never seen this many objects  and ones that appeared to be so low or had the variety of lights and blinking patterns. I know we are about 5 to 8 miles from the Sanford Orlando Airport and are on the flight path for planes into and out of Orlando International, but I have never seen the planes flying this low in my immediate area or so many in such a short time, especially late in the evening. I am sure some of the objects were in fact airplanes, but I do not believe all of them were. I thought this was so unusual, I reported it to the Lake Mary Police, they said they would note it. It was a clear night with good weather and visibility.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,28.7578,-81.3397

They would make wide circles, then join in the middle, separate and continue making wide circles.   I watched for about two or three minutes, then noticed that they changed from clockwise to counter clockwise orbits. They gradually stopped, one at a time.  From the time I began observing them to the time they fades was about 5 minutes.   The shift westward from the time I began observing them to the time they faded was about 20 degrees.  I am reporting this because I could not discern any beam of light coming from the ground.   It looked like the lights were embedded in/emanating from the clouds.   I called for my 16 year old daughter and she also witnessed the lights.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,38.28988855325914,-77.48740445151034

I then looked back towards the road and asked the two passengers to look out the windows and spot it.  Once they found it, it had changed course and was now perpendicular to us, moving west.  We all agree that it looked as if it was more in Portland airspace then in Washington, but distance is relative.  The odd thing is, on top of the Incredible speed, was the fact that the craft was purely white in color, I do believe that FAA standards regulate for a navigation light on at least the wings and tail.  There were none of these.  Only white lights all around the craft with one white strobe light.  Again, it was going faster then I've ever seen even an F-22 fly.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,45.6452,-122.3789

Seemed to be too high in the sky to be towards and too spread out.   I was focused on the road, but they appeared to be hovering.  No specific shape other than lights in the sky.   I kept glancing back as I passed and they remained. I took the Mequon exit and doubled back to head northbound again towards Cedarbug.  I saw that the lights remained.  I had my Iphone set to video mode, but had not begun to record as I wanted to pull over first.   I took the Cedarburg exit eastbound and pulled over and noticed 3 other cars pulled over as well. Although I was hesitant to, I called 911 to explain what I had seen, tried to switch to video mode on my Iphone, but could not.  By this point, I noticed closer to 7 lights slowly moving in a northbound direction, all lights still spread out in no specific pattern.  Got disconnected from the 911 call. A woman with her two teenage kids came up to me and mentioned that they could not get their Iphone to videotape this either.   As we were visiting over a couple of minutes, the lights were moving away and then just faded out. Sheriff called back, and asked that I wait to talk with one of their officers en route.  No one else had called to report this. I indicated 7 witnesses.  I believe there were more than likely over several hundred passive witnesses driving both northbound and southbound while this was occurring.

Planes flew above it several times.   I used binocluars to make out the shape.  It's really bright and teardrop shaped.  This started June 10th and had accured every night since.  Only one night did I see it move.  Thats when I decided to report this.  That really spooked me a bit. 6-29-10 was the only time I saw it move.  I jumped in my car and followed it.  When it was flying I heard no sounds at all and the light seemed to change to a strobe looking light in the middle and appeared to have solid lights around the perimeter of the craft.  It appeared to stop at  times and change direction fast.  I followed it down to main street in Norristown where it appeared to hover for a while.  It also appeared much lower in altitude once it reached main street.  This for sure needs to be looked into.   I have ten or so witnesses including myself. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus in wnw sky?

Me my husband and my son went running downstairs and my husband went to the backdoor (running) to investigate because my daughter is very meek and quiet and never screams.

We ran straight out the door as fast as our legs would go.  Myself and my son never heard or saw anything we were just running for dear life.   My husband told us to stop behind the trees because he thought at any moment it would hit and we wouldnt get much father and we live in the country so its all mostly open space.  When nothing happened he told us to keep running as I horrifyingly saw him turn back toward the house.  We kept going as we went trying to call our dogs that had escaped with us.  My husband returned in his truck to state the object simply vanished he had no idea where it went but it never hit our house or flew over us.   So we continued the search for our dogs however one was struck by a car and killed.  Later when I spoke with my husband and daughter I was informed it had 2 bright lights and was up in the sky they could see the back neighbors house below it and it made no sound and teetered a little back and forth but the lights were always horizontal to eachother.  This object made no sound what so ever and my husband said he saw the silhouette and it was as big as our back pasture across and very dark.

At about 21:23 March 19, 2010, I walked out onto my back porch to smoke a cigarette.  I always keep my porch light off and my kitchen light off with only my dining light on.  I also close the door almost shut to keep the smoke out of my house and so I can see the stars better.  I often look into the sky at the stars which are very visible.  I noticed a very large and bright white light coming in my direction.  I noticed it zigzagging back and forth in quick changes in direction.  I thought that maybe clouds may be causing the illusion of the zigzagging.  As I watched it, I rolled my eyes off it on each side to make certain there were no clouds, there were none (was taught this by the military).  All of the sudden the object moved upward out of sight very quickly.  I could see the light go from very large to a tiny light to nothing at all but with a light trail behind it upward.  Just to make this clear, I served in the Marine Corp and worked with UH-1 and Cobra helicopters both at night and during the day.  I’ve been around the flight line both night and day with both rotary and fixed wings.  I did not see a starboard or port light on this object, nor did I hear any noise coming from it.   As close as this object was from me, if this were a fixed wing aircraft I would have surely heard the thrusters especially as quick as it went upward out of sight.  If it were a helicopter, I would have heard the chopping of the blades and there is no doubt in my mind that a helicopter could not have climbed that quickly upward to out of sight in two or three seconds.  The object was coming from the west with probably 15 degrees of it to the north.   Almost as soon as the object excelled out of sight, a plane (jet) of some type flew over my location coming from the south west.  I could hear and see the port and starboard lights on it.

At around 9:00pm my father was frying some fish outside and my uncle and I were preparing some food in the house.  My father opens the outside door and calls us out to go outside quick! We run outside and he points to the sky. We were facing North and we saw at first 4 amber (lighter flame orange) orbs moving in towards land coming from the east (ocean side).  They were about airplane altitude but I would say just a bit lower in altitude. They were moving very slowly but at a semi constant speed but almost evenly spaced apart traveling in a straight line playing follow the leader sort of speak.  There was absolutely no sound!  No red or green lights which is mandatory for aircrafts, and the sky was clear of any cloud cover.  We could see all the stars out that night. As the first orb got to about mid sky, it gave off a soft pulse effect and zoomed out of our atmosphere at an incredible speed, almost instantaneously turning into a distant white star, then after a second it was absolutely GONE!  It did not break the horizon like any regular aircraft, this thing broke out of our atmosphere! The following 2 followed suit, doing exactly what the first one did in the exact point in the sky traveling in the same direction.  By the time the forth one was reaching the spot in the sky where the others had gone, 3 more same looking orbs popped out from the same direction from where the other 4 originated from. This time the first one after about 10 seconds of moving slowly following the same path as the others, decided to zoom out to the point of looking like a white star and came back as the orange orb really fast!  After, the 6th orb decided to do a little dancing zig zag side to side a couple of times then got back in line.  They all followed the same direction and broke out through the atmosphere 1 by 1.

I am sixteen years old and I live in New Hampshire.  Last Saturday night I went out with my girlfriend, who lives in Laconia, when we had the following experience:  I was with her around 11.  We wanted to take her Mom’s car because it was nicer and we wanted to go look at the stars.  We went to Fun Spot at the back parking lot in Laconia.  There were 8 cars already there when we arrived.  Little by little, the cars started leaving one by one.  We were the last car in the parking lot.  Then the lights of the parking lot and the lights of the houses around us and the lights of the houses down the street started to go out one by one.  Then my girlfriend noticed something blocking the moon and asked, ""What was that?""  I knew it wasn’t a cloud because it moved back against the wind and blocked the moon again.  I don’t know how to explain this but it turns into a ball when it wants to slow down and move around quickly and when it wants to go fast, straight, it turns into a flat plate with maze box-shaped lined lights.  These were on all the time. The colors were dim yellowish white and did not change. I cannot tell whether these were part of the bottom or not.  It flipped a lot.  I did not know which side was right or up on it.  It was doing this over the trees  across the street from the parking lot.  It suddenly crossed the street towards our car. Its size was as big as 14 houses.  It was really quiet. That’s when we had to leave.  But I did not have time to turn on the headlights. We put the clutch in to start the car and jammed it into 1st and floored it.  The front end got picked up and the car could not move.  We steered left and right but the car just kept on going up into the air. My girlfriend was scared and she had boogers coming out of her nose while I was cursing.  The car was going up and the back wheels were off of the ground. Then I looked out of my window and saw that the parking lot park lines started getting smaller. Both our windows were down this whole time.  The front windshield started to crack and shake and the cracks spread from the passenger side to the driver’s side. It popped outwards like it was pulled out. Something yanked my wrist. Not aggressively.  And the whole time in my head something was telling me “Don’t panic,” or “Don’t be scared.”  And it wasn’t in English in my head but I got the meaning.   It wasn’t a language – I don’t know how to explain it.   And on my girlfriend’s side, it had her half-way out of the window.   Her butt  was off of her seat, maybe one-and-a-half or  two feet?  and the car was pointed almost completely straight up at the stars – yet I saw no stars. Every time I tried looking at it, in front, a white film went over my eyes.  It was kind of like staring at the sun with your eyelids closed.  I could not hear her screaming but I know that she was screaming. My ears felt like they kept on popping from the altitude.  I couldn’t hear.  The smell was like unbearable, like you want to close your nose.  It was spicy, like pepper-sprayish, and clean at the same time – it was a smell that you could stand but you would close your nostrils because it still smells bad.  When I tried to fight and get my wrist back in the car, that’s when the grip got stronger.  It was pulling my left arm up out of the window – there was no pain but it was strong – ….  I was trying to fight off the grip on my wrist.  My tongue was numb.  The horn beeped  by accident and the grip got a little loose.  It beeped again in the struggle and my arm flopped down in the car.  My girlfriend also fell back in her seat and we realized we were still up in the air. ! It  took 2 seconds for the car to drop. When we dropped, the air bags came out.  We floored it  as fast as we could through the town.  It was almost a straightaway to go to my girlfriend’s house with very few turns to take.  During this time, both of us couldn’t stop crying.  We arrived at her house and her Mom asked, “What happened?” All this took place from 11pm to 12:30 am.  It seemed like we were in the air for 10 minutes and it felt like it was forever.    Her Mom called the police, and a policeman came. The policeman did not believe us when we first told him what had happened until he looked at the vehicle.  There were no scratches or dents or anything.  He said that there was no reason for this to have happened to the car when there are no dents or scratches and no reason for the windshield to shatter and pop out the way it did. He had no explanation for why the windshield popped outwards. Also, when I went to open my cell phone in front of the policemen, I got shocked by it. On Monday, I went to my doctor to get a whole physical to make sure I was OK.  My wrist had a puncture wound while my forearm has a cut that is semi-circular and there’s blood on it.  I do remember that when I first looked at my arm after I got it back in the car, it was red with blood.  But by the time we got to my girlfriend’s house, there was no blood anywhere.  On the center consul of the car, there is an imprint of her hand.  I don’t quite understand what the policeman said but it was something about the skin of her hand leaving an impression. Now, I don’t like to feel bumps in the car, or feel anything that trembles like a boombox.  I don’t want to be out in dark areas at night. I also don’t like to walk out to my Mom’s car, anymore, outside. “",2010-04-13T00:00:00,43.564069411764706,-71.48186235294118

Anomalous aircraft seen over Fayetteville N.C. citizen.,Fayetteville,NC,2008-10-21T13:00:00,disk,6 seconds,"Occurred : 10/21/2008 13:00  (Entered as : 102108 1:00 PM) Reported: 10/23/2008 9:35:39 PM 21:35 Posted: 10/31/2008 Location: Fayetteville, NC Shape: Disk Duration:6 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66401.html,"Anomalous aircraft seen over Fayetteville N.C. citizen. Hello Reader,  Hello, I am 29 years old and my name is not important.   I am a father.  I am ex-military.   I run a small business here in Fayetteville N.C.  I have never been a real UFO enthusiast or anything but have always been a very open minded thinker.  So the other day I got a phone call from my mom telling me to contact my sister ASAP.  My sister lives in Marshalltown Iowa 1,100 miles away.  She also has to pay for outgoing long distance calls so normally we talk when I call her.   As soon as I dialed and said hello she says, very enthusiastically, “brother you’re not going to believe what I saw today!”   What was it?  I asked.   She proceeded to tell me how she was driving downtown towards the post office when she noticed an extremely bright object in the sky that appeared to be a floating star.  She described the object as being at least two stories high and definitely within the city limits.   She told me that she had no idea what it was but that she stopped and got out of her vehicle to get a better look.  When she got out looking towards the sky, she said the object was gone.   I thought about this for a moment and asked her what she thought she saw.  She said she had no idea but that it didn’t make sense the object had vanished so quickly.  I tried to offer her a reasonable explanation by telling her that it’s possible for sunlight to reflect off an aircraft very brightly and seemingly disappear when the aircraft changes direction slightly in the sky.   She was not totally satisfied with this and responded by telling me that the aircraft would have been flying too low.  When the conversation was over she seemed calmed down some.  I should mention that to her credit my sister is a very intelligent and grounded person.  Not one to make up such stories.  I believed she saw something.  The next day I had pretty much forgotten all about the phone call with my sister.  My business associate and I had just finished services at one of our customer’s property.  This was on Vista dr.  We both got into the truck and as I was starting the ignition I looked up.  Immediately I was struck by what I saw. The aircraft was big.  I’m estimating it to be about the size of a Boeing 747 passenger jet.  It was shaped almost like a blimp, “and this was the first thought that came to my mind”, but longer giving it an even more aerodynamic look.  It was very luminescent.  I could not make out any distinguishable shapes like you would expect to see on an aircraft besides the color.  The color had the appearance of mercury and I could also see some red towards the front upper portion. No tail, no undercarriage, no wings.   My mind was racing like lightning.  After about 3 seconds I yelled to my partner, “LOOK!”  And I pointed skyward.  She looked up, but not quick enough.  The craft, which was traveling at about 60 mph, had entered into the tree line overhead.  She looked back at me and I was still looking upward.  I saw it for about 2 more seconds through the trees and then disappeared back over the tree line.  I was AMPED!  I hit the gas and we began speeding through the neighborhood.  I was definitely getting another look at this thing!  I turned a sharp right at the corner and tore down the road.  We went about 7 blocks.  All the while I was looking madly up at the sky trying to see around the trees and get a better look.  It took me about 30 seconds to get to a better area.  I pulled into a parking lot and got out of the truck.  From this position I had a good 360 degree view.  It was a mostly clear sky and I could see for miles in the direction that the aircraft should have been headed.  Even then I expected to see something that made sense.  It must have been some kind of blimp or something.  There was nothing.  I was completely astounded.  Why didn’t I see something in the sky?  What the hell did I see?  It shouldn’t have been possible at the speed it was traveling to elude my range of vision when I could now easily see for miles.  This all happened at about 1: pm Oct, 21, 2008. At this point my partner was looking at me like I had gone bat shit.  So I gave her the phone and made her call the airport.  At this time I spoke to Trisha in the radar tower.  I asked her if any aircraft were currently flying above the downtown area.  She asked me what I had seen and I said that I wasn’t sure maybe a blimp.  She told me to hold on and then came back on the phone.  She told me that I had probably seen one of the many military aircraft that fly over Fayetteville.  I told her, “No Trisha, I want to know if you have any communication right now with any aircraft over the downtown area and if so, what specifically?”  She said that a C-130 had been flying over the downtown area.  I told her that,” no it was not a C-130.”  I used to jump out of this type of aircraft when I served in the military.  It is very easy for me to identify.  I should also note that I have lived in Fayetteville for 7 years now.  Being local for so long, and near Pope air force base, I am very used to looking up in the sky and seeing military aircraft.  You see everything from warthogs and C-130s to Chinook helicopters, to name a few.  Also, I live less than I mile from the air force base and have seen many different types of military aircraft, in the sky, on routine training flights.  After I spoke with Trisha in the radar tower I was both very excited and very confused.  I thought for sure that they would have some sort of explanation that made sense.  No, they had nothing.  Later that afternoon I called the police station and spoke with a dispatcher.  She had no other reports of anomalous objects in the sky.  I’m not sure if she made a report of my story or not but I told her everything.  I also called the airport back and spoke to Trisha again.  No one else had called in at all.  She gave me a number to Pope AFB.  I called and left a message to call me back please.  No one has called.  That was 48 hrs ago.  I have no easy explanation for what I experienced.  The events surrounding this seem just extraordinary, for example; my sister calling the day before.  Interestingly enough the presidential nominee Barrack Obama was here last weekend.  McCain is coming this weekend.  Do these things relate?  I can only speculate about that as I try to make some sense of things.  Another wild coincidence is that Great Britain just released a 1,500-page batch of top secret documents that were UFO related. http://news.aol.com/article/britain-releases-more-ufo-sighting-files/217434?icid=200100397x1211165486x1200734593   Although I’m not sure exactly what I saw I can tell you this.  Visibly it seemed immediate that it was anomalous.  It should have been in the sky longer.  The radar tower should have known what it was.  Many other people should have seen this as it was almost directly above downtown Fayetteville.   My sister believes she also saw something anomalous in the sky 24 hours prior to my experience.  Somehow this is all absolutely PHENOMENAL.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,35.03683522123894,-78.92246247787611

The sky is as clear as glass, not a cloud in sight from what I could see. About half way through my cigarette I see this faint light move extremely fast in a zig zag movement (a rough drawing using paint will be emailed) and as it moving it leave a cloudy trail behind it. It acted as if it were moving away from the earth. And then it just disappeared in a very bright light. The time is now about 4:54 AM. It lasted about 2-3 seconds I couldn’t believe my eyes so and then I decided to blow it off.  But as I’m finishing my cigarette I see three more faint lights zipping through the sky higher than the first one.  The other three were each in a different location all heading in different paths. The first bright light I knew was no airplane, helicopter, or shooting star. The movement was completely random. The other three could’ve been shooting stars but it was too coincidental. The first bright light:  Location: just to the left of orions belt The flash was so bright that I could see clouds that I couldn’t see with the moon light; the flash was a bright white with a blues tint. The trail if left disappeared moments after the light had disappeared. Now I see weird things in the skies late at night that I know aren’t airplanes but this first bright light was the weirdest. This is no hoax. Possibly anything but I just wanted to report this incase I was right.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,39.3795,-77.1656

Lauderdale and this beam took the shape of a cone beam.  Larger at the bottom.  This lasted for about 2 seconds and retracted.  It did not just disappear, it retracted.

We were watching it and the object's front end;ie, cockpit? was glowing with an dull amber light and their was an red pulsing light under the craft.  Also there were white lights around on the craft. Can't remember if lights were blinking or not.  Seems to me that the lights were steady.   We could not tell the shape of the craft as it was dark in color against the night sky. We did not here any sound from the object, but there was a diesel generator running nearby. It was definitely not an helicopter as the object was to big to be one.  It could have been some type of military aircraft but It sure was strange looking.  The ""wings"" if it had any, did not have and green & red strobe lights on the edge of the ""wings"". it may have had white steady lights though.  As the object flew south of us I went over quick to the other two security officers at the other work site about half an block away and pointed it out to them.

After adjusting my eyes, i realized this was no hallucination.  it was like a bright ball, seemed like an orb-- this is how it appeared from the ground anyways.  I swear this thing was playing hide and seek; hiding behind dark evil chem clouds (5th day of major aerosol operation)  Sometimes it would drift out and sit ina a ""hole"" (HAARP?) in the clouds right in the open like it wanted to make its presence known.  it always moved in liquid motions, very graceful. 10 mins after the sighting a helicopter (black- military i presume) came from the direction of hamilton and was heading directly at the craft a! nd kept flying.  during the arrival of the helicopter i noticed the orb was gone.  i continued my walk and within minutes not only was the orb back but there was at least 2 much smaller crafts flying faster weaving in and out of the clouds moving across the whole city.  these ones were much smaller and not so blatant, and they were always moving .  for the whole 40 min walk home the biggest orb always kept appearing, dissapearing behind grey clouds always in the same general area which was in the vicinity of the moon.  Before i went in my house i checked and it wasn't there.  i played on my computer for a while and thought to look out my bedroom window, and the thing was right where it was before.  it was never out of site for the entire night, but after 330 it seemed to just sit there and act like a star.  i went to sleep just before dawn and it was still there...  one thing i forgot to mention is that when this ball was next to a cloud that wasn't as thick you could see a! red/orange glow projected from the object onto the cloud.  al! so at ti mes  light on the craft would pulsate especially when maneuvering. I didn't see anything for a few days and then last night (aug 11) i was working at 3am (on lunch outside) and noticed several orbs again.  i had a friend watch them too and he couldn't believe it.  during lunch conversation i noticed what appeared to be a shooting star- but it couldn't have been because it shot one way and then reversed and disappeared.  this was all in a flash, so fast that i pretty much saw a "">"" in the sky ( like a zig zag)  anyways there were three big balls of light this time that mostly creeped in there own areas, posing as stars for the most part.  again they couldn't have been because we watched one start creeping, we lost him behind the cloud, then he slowly rose above it in plain site.  only one person at the lunch table was bothered to even look up ONCE... they were trying to tell me that it was stars, satellites etc without even looking up.   i really don't care because i know from chemtrails that bringing up anything ""outside the matrix"" just ma! kes you look crazy... even on a spray day with the sky in a grid pattern and magnetic cloud anomolies.  Anyways, around 5am i was hanging at the side of the factory with the other witness throwing cardboard in a bin and we decided to watch the several suspicious stars that were all out of place from a few hours earlier.  we noticed one slowly creep upward through a cloud and sit above it.(they seem to do that a lot...) the witness said ""holy shit, look at the red  light""! as it passed through a thin edge of the cloud.  it sat above and it was pulsating, got brighter and it either changed shape or the shape of the craft became apparent- which was sort of like a small case ""t"" without the bend on the bottom.  anyweay i finished my shift, and when i left it was sunny, clear and the chemtrail planes (2) were already starting for the day.  nothing else was in sight in the sky.  i have never had an interest in ufos until recently, i just couldn't help seeing it out of the corner ! of my eye the other day.  now that i'm watching the sky it see! ms appar ent that there's a lot going on we have no idea about!!!",2009-08-27T00:00:00,43.151100630914826,-80.26918643533124

Early Tuesday morning (1:15 AM)August 11, 2009, while outside my home in N. Ft. Myers, Florida, I observed an illuminated phenomenon high in the sky which was so very distinct and unusual, i have felt compelled to report it.  I have never before seen anything of particular interest in the sky.  The atmosphere was particularly clear at the time, and the moon barely halfway rising to zenith.  I originally noticed a light to the north, which i initially assumed to be the lights of a large aircraft coming in to land at our local international airport, which happens here frequently.  But when i focused clearly on it, what i saw was so unusual that the image was simply confusing.  It moved in a perfectly striaght line, horizontally, from N.N.W to S.S.E, on a trajectory not far below the moon. How far away from me it was is difficult to say, however, i would guess from my judgement of its depth of field for it to have been approximately level with the bottom of an average summertime cumulonimbus cloud, although it could have been higher.  It moved very rapidly, far faster than any jet-plane, but not nearly as fast as a meteor.  I estimate that i saw the object, which was originally quite far away, for perhaps 10 seconds.  It was coming toward me, passed in front of me, and then my view was obscured by tall trees nearby to the south.  The object (or objects)are difficult to describe.  The closer it came, the more complex and strange it seemed.  I would have to describe it as a long ribbon of translucently glowing light, much like a chemtrail illuminated by moonlight, which had imbedded within it, a series of very bright lights, perhaps a dozen or more.  The lights were brighter than the moon.  The appearance of this thing reminded me of notes on a musical staff, and as the various closely spaced objects moved along together, they left short luminous trails, with all the objects in perfectly placed  rows, yet spaced apart from each other horizontally at irregular intervals.  Their trails connected directly to the ones traveling behind them.  Two were especially large, and the others of variously smaller sizes.  They were moving very quickly, and seemingly perfectly horizontally to the earth.  It appeared there were more forming as they passed by.  There was no associated sound.  While this may not be of help, from my fully extended arm, if i was to hold up a ruler (and i'm of average height, 5'8""),the entire object or phenomenon appeared to be approximately 10 inches long horizontally, and 2 inches high, so it/they was very large.",2009-08-27T00:00:00,,

We pulled out our digital camera, but the objects were too small to be considerably noticeable.  Frantically, we pulled into the parking lot of Publix, just down that road, where we stopped and witnessed the six objects.  We sat there, befuddled, trying to determine what it was.  I remember rolling down my window, trying to determine if they were radio antennae. They appeared to be slow-moving, however, it moved faster than our car, which was traveling at about 35 miles per hour.  In the parking lot, another man pulled off of the same road to witness these objects. They stopped in the sky and appeared to align themselves in regular patterns.  The formation was as followed:  Four lights formed a square while the other two slanted in a line below the square.  They seemed to be midway in the sky, not near the horizon, but where you would expect to see radio towers.  They appeared to be the size of a planet in the night sky, but smaller than the moon.  From where we were standing, they looked to be about 10-30 feet in diameter. We stood in the parking lot watching them line up and move along for about 2-3 minutes.  During this time, an airplane flew below it, however, records at the Hollywood International Airport state that everything was as it should’ve been, and no special aircraft were in the air at that area or that time. The quantity and formation of the lights changed, however, the color did not.  They seemed to be heading west, towards the Florida Everglades.

It was a clear night and I was outside putting up Christmas lights.  I stepped back from the house and looked up to check the lights when I noticed a bright red light in the southern sky.  It was a little lower and to the left of the moon, about 45 degrees above the horizon.  It was about 3 times as large as Jupiter and about 3 times as bright.  I watched it for a while expecting to see some navigation lights appear as it approached me.  As it got closer I saw no additional lights and noticed it made no noise. I ran inside to get the binoculars so I could get a closer look, as it was flying almost directly overhead.  Through the binoculars I saw no discernible shape to the object, just a bright red light quietly going across the sky.  It maintained the same altitude and did not flicker or change direction.  I decided to run inside to get my camera to take some pictures.  I managed to get a few shots, however as I am not that skilled with my camera while taking night shots, I had some trouble getting the auto focus to act right.  The pictures show a red (out of focus) spherical light.  As I watched it travel north off into the distance it then started to blink and went out as if someone had turned off a switch.  I believe it blinked about 5 times prior to it disappearing. Besides the moon, this was the brightest object in the sky.  I would say the entire event took about seven minutes and when I went inside to write down the specifics I noted the time was 5:47 P. M. central time.  I live about 30 minutes west of St. Louis Lambert airport so I see airplane traffic all the time, most of which travels west-east.  I hardly ever see any traffic flying south-north (especially this low). About 10 minutes after the event I saw a plane coming in for a landing at Lambert airport, this object was roughly at the same altitude.  I am not that good at guessing altitudes so I was using this as my guide for an estimate.  My spouse said that my “incoming plane analogy” would indicate an altitude for the object of about 7,000 - 10,000 ft.  Please note it was not a plane or helicopter.  The body of a commercial plane at that height and directly above can clearly be seen on a cloudless night.  Additionally, engine noise and navigation lights for a plane should be easily discernable, none of which were observed. Again, the red light maintained the same altitude, did not flicker, made no noise and maintained a roughly south to north path.

It happened returning by car from the Homestead NASCAR championship race late last Sunday night. First my companion and I had stopped in Homestead for dinner in a local Mexican restaurant, which I remember closed at 10 or 10:30, and we left shortly after that to return to Miami. It was late and dark over the ocean as the car went over one of several bridges between Homestead and the islands east of Miami, where we were headed. Freeway bridges. I remember we were still well south of Miami when it happened. I was in the passenger seat with the passenger window open wide, looking directly out to the black ocean beyond the bridge. Roughly, to the east. There were lights along the walls of the bridge, but not too bright, because the darkness beyond was visible. It was very still and not many cars. No sign of anyone in particular below, or any boats there. Nothing stirring around the sky, the water, or on the sidelines of the bridge, where there were buildings or concrete, where some sort of aspects of the ongoing urban zone had vaguelly registered on my mind. It was not a swampy area or rural zone. It had been raining, and was still a little bit, so the humidity was feeling pretty high, and there was the apparency of some degree of condensation. Before my eyes my brain registered a sort of swooping thing, what I don't know. It was only visible there about a second, maybe less. The shock of it was less strong than my mind's effort to try to place what it was, but it couldn't. It still can't. It was possibly a foot across and a foot and a half long. But it was shaped something like a teardrop or a puff of smoke with a wider head and a long, thin sort of tail or an impression of a projection - sort of shaped like Casper the  Friendly Ghost in the cartoon, when Casper was about to swoop away, his ""tail"" down to a small squiggle. Hard to describe. But I had the sense, at the time, that the tail-thing was moving a bit. Propelling it? I couldn't say. But that it had some sort of motion to it stays in my impression of it. Not a terribly pronounded thing, maybe, but there was that aspect to my initial impression. The thing started out like it could have been a flare up of some kind, like when a fire or a spark might pass over a small concentration of gas lingering somewhere in the air and cause it to flare up for a second . That was exactly what it seemed like at the time. Except for things that bothered me about it, even as it happened. It was a rainbow of light flaring up toward me. I remember I started to automatically jerk back, but realized it wasn't coming any further. Throughout its entire form,it looked like a rainbow, almost exactly. Only not quite. Some of the colors were missing, mostly the subtle blurred shadings between colors, were sort of missing. And there was too much white, or yellow-white, in it, which increased with each successive flare, of which there were two more. The first one had a lot of green and blue and red, pretty much like a rainbow. Only the colors were too something - too milky, maybe - to be from light refraction such as I have ever seen it before. Too solid. And shaped like the blob I described. It came literally out of no where. I was staring out into the night to the right of the car, and it flared up out of nothing. One instant it wasn't there and the next it was. And to me the oddest thing was, even though  the colors were there so bright against dark night sky, there a blackness surrounding and encasing the spectrum which I saw was not quite the blackness of the sky behind it. It was black like the sky, but somehow it didn't quite match the sky. And odd as it seems now to have noticed this, the edges, where the black of the sky met the black of the shape, the edges between the two seemed to blur, where the object's edges sort of ""ran"" like a watercolor, over the top of the sky. It had something about it that reminded me of the quality and order of blackness of the old telephones in the 1950s. It had a different aspect of solidity than the blackness of the sky behind it, too, though in a way it seemed to match the color of the sky. And the shape of the spectrum inside of the black surrounding it was a bit off from the type of shape than I have associated with any random spectrum I have ever seen. And the colors were very solid and bright. Not neon bright. But, at the least, outstanding. And when it appeared, it loomed. It came out of nothing, surged a bit toward me, forward and nose slightly turning down toward me, and then stayed suspended there, and then just vanished. It didn't fade away. It's spectrum was not moving, but was not rigid, either, in the glow or strength of the colors it had. Oddly,the car was going pretty fast, faster than the speed limit, possibly as much as 80 mph, based how how fast my driver is inclined to drive in such road conditions. Yet I am aware for an entire half to whole second, I could observe it right there where I was looking. That seems odd, too. And it is also possible the bridge had columns or slates at regular intervals, because my impression seems to incorporate them into the event. The second incident was beyond another of these break points in the side of the bridge. The first one seems to have occured within a different break point than the second. The first one never came beyond the edge of the side of the bridge. I don't think it ever was extremely near to the bridge itself, though my impression was it was not very far beyond it. Maybe a few feet. The others were about the same distance. A couple of seconds later, when I was only a little beyond the first sighting, another, smaller sighting appeared. The same way. Maybe half as large. The second one didn't surprise me as much, it only seemed interesting. And it disappeared maybe a little faster. It had had more white/yellow to it, but was otherwise similar enough to be considered the same phenonena. The third one, basically the same, though far smaller and not so much color, came and went the same way, though it appeared before, or maybe as the second one was vanishing. I'm not sure I saw the third one vanish before we had moved beyond it. Neither of these were appearing to zoom toward me as the first one did. When they were gone, I watched a little bit for others, still sort of assuming they had been something typical for whatever atmospheric conditions there were off the side of the bridge. Once we were off the bridge I asked my friend what they were, and described them to him. He is a Miami native and has driven north over that bridge many times at night from work he was doing in Homestead. He had no idea what I was talking about and said it sounded like I had been drinking, which I had not. I asked him what was along the seawall along that stretch. He said he thought it might be something industrial, but he wasn't sure. He was vague on where that spot even was, only having ever passed over it on his way to somewhere else, and there are a lot of bridges along the route. My window was fully open  and I was looking directly out of it. I never smelled anything unusual. No car exhausts. No unusual smells at all. It was all fresh and clean out there, after a recent short bout of rain. There was no sound to what I saw. It all came and went so fast, no fanfare, no aftermath. In a way it seemed perfectly normal and natural. But it wasn't. I don't know what it was. .",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

This is a very brief sighting although I have one more to make with a similar unexplainable incidence. Me and my brother have both recently moved to Bainbridge Island, WA , are students, and as far as I am aware he has never encountered a UFO. I only have the prior encounter I will enter after this one which may not even classify as a UFO. My recent experiences and curiosity sparked my interest into learning of reports in my area of the same object. My memory is not the greatest, and in my report I have included only details I clearly remember. Anything else has been left out and I would not want to add on information that is false, even if by mistake. The incidence occurred at approximately 10:20 PM as I was watching television with my brother. At this time I noticed a low volume sound coming from outside. Curious as to what the noise was I stopped what I was doing, and changed my position. The room we were both in contains large glass windows that cover almost the entirety of the wall. As I changed positions I could see clearly an object that appeared very close to the ground for a plane, yet was not loud enough to be a helicopter. It was of saucer shape and had oval shaped lights which appeared to be of different colors. They seemed to create a haze for the object that was a grey/metallic color. The object swooped into my view for a moment, and then proceeded to shift up and to the side out of my view. The movements were very fluid as if the object was hovering. In a curious yet alarmed state I dashed to the window to see if I could catch another view, this time urging my brother who was before preoccupied, to look with me. The saucer made a swoop back into our direction and view, allowing him to confirm to me that he saw what was making the noise as well. As the object was in my line of sight again it had appeared to have changed shape slightly, becoming more of an oval, until it passed overhead and out of sight. Approximately five minutes later an unmarked black helicopter flew overhead with lights on. I believe my location plays a large role in what we witnessed due to certain companies located around here, and multiple naval bases. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I have a deck that faces SW and I have a nice piece of sky to view down to approx 20 degrees off the horizon to that direction.  I was watching some high commercial aircraft traffic on the Victor Airway above my house flying as usual from SW to NE, when I noticed directly above my deck a much brighter than usual star-like object moving slowly to the SW and then I noticed it had no strobes or navigation lights.  So I discerned this was a satellite and watched it for approx 10 seconds until it stopped for approx 3 seconds with no change in luminescence,  then quickly it did a 90 degree turn to the left or easterly from its original course lasting approx 2 seconds.

At approx.2139 hrs on 24 Nov 2009, I was watching departing air traffic from MEM pass overhead looking North.  Something caught my eye to the East.  I turned, and saw a Triangle-shaped object that had large dull white lights at all corners.  It was either in a right-hand bank turning North, or it was flying due West at a tilt because I could see the bottom of the object while it was apparently miles to the North of me.  It traveled at approx. Mach 1-1.5.  It was completetly silent.  That impacted me quite a bit because being a glider pilot as well, I know that even a glider at higher speeds causes a lot of noise through aerodynamic means as air is ""split"" around the aircraft.  The object passed below a departing CRJ-200 from MEM.  I would love to know if anything was picked up on the aircraft's TCAS, or by MEM Center.   I have the urge to call them, but fear the backlash that may follow.  It was approximately 200 ft across to all corners.  It had a dull grey looking surface, and as I said earlier the 3 large white lights were dull.  I don't drink, or use drugs.

It was night but the sky still maintained a its blue color as the last of the suns light disappeared.  Visibility was excellent.  I am wondering what I saw. I have been able to produce no logical explanation for unlit aircraft escorted (or followed) in the night skys.  Any small planes would certainly have visiable lights, and for three of them to be togeather, unlit ???  Fighter jets are out of the question, I would have been able to hear them, and the chopper would not have been fast enought to follow.  I have worked around aircraft, hands on, and I'm baffled.  I tried to call the police shortly after to see if there were any other reports, but in this small town the police station is closed at night. I hope someone will stumble across this post and provide an explanation, and I will check back tomorrow to see if anyone else saw this.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,43.3655,-83.5658

We could see two very bright, clear lights, to our eyes 30 centimeters apart (that is to say if you held a 30 centimeter ruler at arms length, that was the distance of the lights from our perspective) They flew one behind the other, the 2nd light a tiny bit to the left of the first, with no deviation of this formation. They were flying directly North to South. They were going dead straight at a steady speed, slower than helicopters that give city night flights, after 10 seconds they passed behind a all building and out of our sight. They were on a course that we have never seen flown by any other aircraft, heading out in the direction of the sea. The lights were remarkable, because they were absolutely silent. Even the jets at high altitude can be heard on our balcony. A few minutes later the Tokyo sky was filled with the usual 3 or four helicopters, and we could see 4 jets at varying altitudes passing over the city on the regular flight paths.

She lives on a mountain with lots of pasture and trees. We started driving down the mountain when we passed a car on a very big curve. There was a large break in the trees, and that is when we saw the UFO. It was approximately 400ft above the tree line and approximately 100ft in front of us. I was trying to make sure it was infact a UFO and not a plane, so I unconsciously started slowing down and stopped while we were staring and discussing its shape. It appeared to be rather stationary at that time. It had three bright lights we could clearly see, which seemed to give it a circular or teardrop shape. As we were talking it started moving more in our direction. It moved at an angle, getting closer to both the ground and our position simultaneously. At which point my girlfriend tells me I need to start driving again since she doesn't want to get abducted. It was like I was in a trance a! nd unable to move at first. After a short period of time I just snapped out of it and drove as fast as I thought I could without wrecking the car. I felt the only chance we had at it leaving us alone was making it to the nearby highway. She continued watching the craft from the window of the car while I drove. She noted it changing direction and following us. It was practically on top of us when we made it to the highway. We both lost sight of it for a short period as we continued driving down the highway.  Then we started seeing it sporadically through the trees to our left.  It seemed to be continuing in the same direction we were driving.  We decided to pull over and observe the UFO. This time it we did not feel threatened as it was much farther away from us.  When we caught sight of it again it was extremely high in the sky. Now we were able to see a blinking red light on another side of the craft. At first I thought perhaps it was a plane and we had really lost sight of the UFO. At this point it started descending. It was coming down in kind of steps. It would drop straight down and hover then drop again. This is when my girlfriend noticed the problem. That wasn't our UFO at all. It was a second one.  We saw the craft that had been following us moving extremely low to the tree line, almost in the trees. We could see both the bright white lights and the flashing red one on the UFO now. It was obvious the two UFO’s were the same type of craft. They were moving towards each other. The lower one was practically underneath the higher one. Then it seemed as though the lower one turned. All we could see of it was the flashing red light. I started wondering what made it turn and if it was coming in our direction. I was keeping an eye on them and the fact there wasn't nearly as much traffic on this highway as I'd like. Infact, at that moment there was no one to be seen. Then she uttered the worst words I've ever heard, ""Did you see that, over in the trees?""  I glanced over to see what she was talking about. To the left, directly across the 4-lane, in the trees we saw two tiny light blue blinking ""lights"" next to each other in a straight line. The way they were positioned so close to each other made me think of eyes, though I do not know if that is what they were. They were too high to be the eyes of any animal I know of in the area. There were no buildings and no people in the area either. They also were not responding like an animals eyes. They were actually blinking, like twinkle lights on a fade switch. There was no light pointed in that direction for anything to be reflecting. There was nothing but darkness and our car lights pointing directly in front of us. My girlfriend told me she'd seen it blink at least five times before saying mentioning it. The mere thought of what it might be scared me enough to immediately pull out onto the highway and drive quickly away. We kept searching for the UFO’s as we drove toward Huntsvill! e. We were unable to clearly identify the crafts again.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,34.5081,-86.3134

I left the kitchen and went to my living room and I still had that   pressure in my ears so I walked outside.

I recently bought a pair of Nikon Sportstar 10 x 25 binoculars and so I thought I would pass some time looking at birds, clouds and aircraft. There were scattered light cumulus clouds in the vicinity, but most of the sky overhead was clear and brilliantly blue. There was also a lot of air traffic. I watched three Boeing 737s pass directly overhead, a few minutes apart, and a four-engine jet somewhat south of my location. The larger jet was too far and too high to identify, but the engines left pronounced contrails.  The 737s showed up very clearly in my binoculars, although there was a slight atmospheric haze, but I had them sharply in focus. At about 16:20 (4:20 p.m.), just after watching the last of the 737s pass over, I began lowering the binoculars toward the horizon, when another object appeared in the field of view. I thought I had happened upon a small aircraft, so I steadied the binoculars to follow the craft through the sky. At that point, I realized that it didn’t look like an aircraft. It was filling a greater portion of my field of view than any of the jets had earlier. If it was a small aircraft, it should have been close enough to hear the engines, yet there were no aircraft sounds to be heard. If it was an aircraft, my view would have been about 45 degrees off its right front, with the aircraft banking in a right-hand turn, such that the wings would have been “level” with my point of view, but it was traveling perpendicular to my position, not turning toward me. For a second, I thought it was an aircraft similar to a de Havilland Tracker, with brightly painted engine nacelles. Then I thought it mig! ht be some kind of bird, first thinking that it must be soaring, because there was no motion of beating wings. But it didn’t really look like a bird. The object consisted of two large red-orange spheres, separated by a distance that was somewhat less than the diameter of either sphere, with a white body or fuselage between them and also a white body or fuselage attached slightly below them. The white shape(s) could have been spherical, about the same size as the red-orange spheres. It was hard to make out the shape of the white part(s), i.e., whether it was one body or separate pieces. the red-orange spheres were very bright in the direct sunlight, almost as if they were lights, but I don't think they were illuminated. I followed the object with my binoculars as it continued a wide, steady, unwavering arc in a clockwise direction, until I lost it from sight as it passed behind my house. At that point, I got up from my chair to try to follow the object further, but I could not find it in the sky. Whatever the object was, it had to have been some distance away, as it was as sharply focused in my binoculars as the 737s had been. For that reason, I ruled out the possibility that it could have been an insect and most smaller species of birds. If it was a bird, it would have been very large. The largest birds we have around here are pelicans, and this certainly was no pelican. I thought it could be a cluster of party balloons, but it was moving contrary to the wind and on a very steady path. Also, it was apparent that it was some distance away, both because it was sharply focused in the binoculars and because of the atmospheric haze between the object and me. Party balloons would not have filled so much of the field of view at that kind of distance. Because I saw it for only a short time and was not able to see it by the naked eye, I really can’t say for sure what I may or may not have seen. I’m reporting this mainly in case someone else saw it and either can explain it or would like confirmation that they were not alone in seeing it.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,52.1078373650108,-106.66923239740821

As I saw the object in the sky, other drivers saw it as well and started braking and pointing at the object.

On Thursday, April 22 my fiancee called me and asked me to come home as soon as possible around 10:55 pm. He said that he had witnessed a boomerang shaped craft flying low over our apartment. (around 3500-5000ft.) This has not been the first time we have witnessed an event like this, we had a similar one last year. When I came home he explained to me that he had seen a large craft flying overhead. We are used to seeing planes fly over us all of the time and he knew that this was not a plane. Also from our previous experience last year I assumed that if I waited outside long enough I might see something else, which I did. Flying north towards the mountains, off to my right, there were two slightly glowing orange orbs circling each other in formation. This is when I called to report the event. Then about ten minutes later a single orb flew in the same direction off to my left. Then again about 5 minutes later another one flew over but seemed to vanish as I was! looking at it and I could no longer trace its flight path. They were much like the orange orbs I had seen last year however not as bright and this time they were flying much closer to the ground.

On April 24, 2010, in Norcross, GA, at approximately 12:40 PM EST, I stepped outside my office to watch the start of a thunderstorm.  To the northwest, I observed a fairly large, black object in the sky above the trees but below the cloud ceiling (3600 feet, according to my local FAA Fight Service Station’s data).  At first, I thought it was a hawk, as they do sometimes circle above.  But as it slowly moved across the sky, it became clear to me that it was, in fact, a solid boomerang or backwards-L-shaped object.  It had no lights and was silent (at least to my ears), and it didn’t move like one would expect a gliding bird to.  As I reported above, this was during a thunderstorm, so with the cloud cover, there was no sun or anything else I could use to give it scale, but it appeared to me to be at least as large as a helicopter or a single-engine plane.  It was a solid, hard object, moving slowly and deliberately. It moved in a wide, horizontal arc towards me, traveling from left to right in my field of vision, and began moving to the north/northwest, away from my location, and disappeared, possibly into cloud cover.  One unusual aspect of this object was that the ""boomerang"" did not have a horizontal attitude like a plane, but rather a vertical one, hence the backwards ""L"" description. In the interest of accuracy and full disclosure, I should note here that I am mildly nearsighted and wear glasses for driving.  I was not wearing my glasses at the time of this sighting, and felt that there wasn’t time to go and get them.  However, my vision isn’t that bad, and I stand by what I’ve described. So, I immediately wrote down the details of my observation, and went to my computer to look up what to do in the event of a sighting of this type, and then called the local police who, in turn, sent two officers to speak to me right away.  They listened to me but did not take a police report, and instructed me to keep a camera handy should the object reappear.  I then called the Center for UFO Studies to make a report. I should also put on record with this report that I’ve had a mild interest in the subject of UFO’s and have read about them and kept an open mind.  However, I never expected to have my own sighting, and can draw no conclusions as to what it really was that I saw, except that it didn’t appear to me to be a plane, helicopter, or other known aerial vehicle.  It did not appear to be natural phenomena, but it did appear to be an object of some kind.",2010-05-12T00:00:00,,

Every so often we could make out a white jolt of light that seemed to project out from the object in random directions (quickly like lightning).  The object was brighter than anything else in the sky and mostly hovered in one spot but also moved from side to side.  At first, the light / object was large and did not seem to be very far away and I was almost sure that it was a strange type of lit up helicopter searching for something on the ground.  I opened the window expecting to hear the engine! and was very surprised to find that it was dead silent outside.    I worked as a professional photographer for a few years and have all pro level equipment.  I asked my wife to grab my camera (a Canon 5D digital SLR with 70-200 L 2.8 IS lens), tripod, and shutter release cable while I kept my eye on the light.  I wanted to try to get a long exposure that showed the path of the light over time.  Just as I got everything setup and settings dialed in, my newly charged batteries went completely dead.  I asked my wife to try to find some other batteries while I kept my eye on the light.  As time went on, the light seemed to be dissipating and was getting smaller as if it was traveling away from us.  I was also scanning the sky for anything else out of the ordinary and saw a high flying jet moving overhead.  The jet turned slightly and headed DIRECTLY toward the light.  We were watching as the jet approached.  My wife returned with new batteries and I took a 30 second exposure with my shutter release cable (no camera movement) with the jet approaching the light in the same frame.  At this point the light was very distant and just looked like a bright star.  As soon as the path of the jet overlapped and intersected the light, I expected to see the jet continue on it’s trajectory, bypassing the light in the sky.  I was absolutely startled when the jet disappeared completely from sight at the exact same time that it intersected the light.  It was as if the pilot shut off the strobe lights at the exact same time.  There were no clouds in the sky so I'm certain it did not go behind a cloud.  After analyzing the image, one would tend to discredit the image since the light appears to follow the exact same trajectory as the stars as the jet is approaching.    However, before the image was taken, the light was much closer, much brighter, and clearly traveled in multiple directions in the sky.",2010-05-12T00:00:00,45.0648,-92.8473

My mother was driving me to a doctor’s appointment at around 3:40pm through Westwood, NJ, facing west towards route 17.  My mother recalls exactly what I did when we reflected on this sighting.  I looked in the sky and saw a seemingly pyramidal shaped object.  It seemed metallic in nature; my mother describes it as a shiny aluminum.  It was dark, almost black at one face and extremely shiny at another face.   Also, there was some rotation that I observed on this object.   The most amazing thing about this object was its seemingly random and very rapid movement. Overall, this object was hovering over the town of Westwood, at one point right over our heads.  But in the objects vicinity, there was rapid movement.  At first thinking this was maybe an eye floater, since I was also inside the car, I opened the window and there it still was, moving very rapidly, yet in a general direction; It seemed as if it was headed somewhere.  The best analogy I can give for the rapid movement in the vicinity of the object is that of the following situation:  If you have a camera that you are holding and trying to focus on an object from far away, no matter how still you try to make your camera, the object always seems to be shaking.  This is what it looked it, like it was excessively shaking, even thrashing about. I have perfect vision and no history of mental problems.  My mother also claims to have witnessed this same phenomenon.  However, my mother was driving, and I actually took the time to open the window and capture the image in my mind, it is still very clear and fresh to me.   I also want to add that this was completely broad daylight on a clear blue sky with very few clouds. My mother and I would like to add that there must have been some other people who saw this object since it was in plain sight. Underneath I have drawn a picture of what it looked like. (This object would be against a clear blue sky). Again, it was trashing about spontaneously, not just traveling in a linear way. Also: I called the local paper, the Bergen Record.  They say that they received NO CALLS about this. I also called the Westwood Police station and told them about this, they said that they did not receive any calls regarding this phenomenon.    The officer from Westwood Police Department informed me to call Teterboro Airport to ask if there was anything in the air that day.  I asked for the number to call the airport; he could not find the number and instead told me that he would call Air Traffic Control (he said that if they needed to talk to me that they would call my house phone).  I haven’t received a call yet, and if I do, I will update this. Personally, I am AMAZED that in this broad daylight, NO ONE OTHER THAN ME called the the police or news organizations…it might happen later but to the people who read this:  I GREATELY underestimated the TIMIDNESS and PASSIVENESS of people in general.  To me and my mom, we thought that MASSIVE amounts of people would report this…but in fact no one else did. PS: I tried sketching a picture but it wouldn't let me copy and paste it into the box. I would be happy to draw a picture.",2010-05-12T00:00:00,41.0099,-74.0073

Actually the red/orange colored looked like more like an aura around a dark center.  It was too fast to be a normal satellite but slower than most shooting stars.  It wasn't bright like other objects in the sky and just barely noticeable.   One would have had to be looking right at it to notice it.  It was one of those cases of just happening to be looking at the right place at the right time.  The odd thing was that at one point it appeared to slow down and then speed up again. It never changed its course though.  The trajectory was very straight. To give you some background on me, I was a police officer for eight years before being medically retired.

I was looking at the sky facing south when my attention was drawn to a very bright reddish light low in the sky. It was about the size of a star, but it was the brightest thing in the sky. I watched if for about 2-3 seconds, before I realized it was obviously moving directly toward my position. It was getting visibly closer and appearing larger by the second. I called my son’s attention to it, and he also saw it. By this time it was not quite directly over our heads. I got a very good look at it. It appeared to be a round ball of reddish orange flame.  It definitely had the appearance of flames, but there was no visible smoke or sparks. It was completely silent and moving in a straight line, south to north.  I saw no visible structure of any type. There was no noticeable wind blowing at the time. It passed almost directly over our heads. I turned around so I could continue to watch it as it passed by me on its way north.  After watching it for a few seconds now from behind it, I saw it make a little series of zigzag movements, right, left, then right left, again.  It then continued heading off to the north in a straight line until it disappeared from my sight. It was impossible for me to accurately estimate the speed, size, or altitude, in the dark sky. If I was going to guess based on my gut feeling, I feel it was smaller (less than 3 ft. in diameter), rather than a large object and at a few hundred feet elevation, rather than higher. It was moving quickly relative to its size.  The total time I watched it was about 20-30 seconds, maybe slightly longer. There are a couple of things I am sure it wasn’t. It wasn’t a firework, like a rocket or mortar. It was totally silent, slower, and left no trail. It also did not look like any flare I have seen either. It was not smoking, sparking, leaving a trail, or appear to be dangling from a parachute.",2010-07-10T00:00:00,35.23324977973568,-81.17918458149781

Animated movie from prior sighting of 1997. We call this event ""The July Orb"" because we have witnessed this twice before, all in July. The event this year, 2010, was over Bothell, WA.  An orange, glowing orb silently and smoothly cruised from North to South in the same way a satellite would move, but was only as high up as a helicopter would fly. Myself, two other adults and two children also saw it. My camera was at the ready to photograph our fireworks and to pause light in the sky, and I was able to take a photograph!  The camera zoom is a 12x.  While the photo shows a tail, this is only due to the shutter being open as the orb moved.   The falling tail in the photo is due to me trying to find it to focus. Perhaps someone can figure out the size of this orb and it's speed based on these details!  Our neighbor came by and as I showed him the picture and explained what we saw he asked ""Do you mean like THAT!?"" Pointing up, there was the same thing, moving in the same direction. HISTORY Event 1: I first saw this same orb over Bothell WA, July 1997, and called Mr. Davenport to report it. I was so amazed that I created an animated version because it was hard for others to believe there was no other way to describe it other than a mystery object.  It also moved North to South, slowing and silently gliding.  However, the object was closer than the described 2010 event as I could see it pass behind trees in front of me. Event 2: July 2009, Couer D'Alene Idaho, 11 or 12 pm. My husband and my sister witnessed this same orb while sitting on the dock (south and west end of the lake).  However, it raised vertically from behind a home on the same cove about 6 or 7 houses south, or the trees behind it.  It glided silently and smoothly up, then past them and over the lake and then just disappeared.  The next day they went door to door hoping others had seen this, but no one had.",2010-07-10T00:00:00,47.81147361769352,-122.19987187993681

Suddenly out of the corner of my eye, I saw another one, moving in the same direction, but from a different point of the sky. It was at this time I got real excited, and started to scan the sky with my eyes to see if there were more. So I went out to the street and looked behind the house, and saw another one moving in the opposite direction of where the other 2 were heading (away from me). Within minutes, another one came from the direction that the 3rd was moving, but heading in the complete opposite direction (toward me). It was at this point that I got off the phone with my father to go get my wife so she could witness this phenomenon. As soon as we came back out, she spotted one moving right over our heads (the 5th one), at that point she was pretty nervous. Then as luck would have it, we see another (the 6th) coming from a completely new direction, lost sight of it as it was moving even faster than the others and quickly faded behind the trees. Right before going inside, we spotted one last one (a 7th). It too was moving fairly quickly, and within a matter of a couple minutes it was out of sight. At that point our necks hurt and we went inside. All-in-all, a very exciting night for the city of alliance, NE.

Several miles to the north, we had a lot of summer heat lighting taking place, no thunder.  When the lighting hit, it lit the clouds up with a nice purple color.  Very beautiful. I looked up to the West in crystal clear sky.  Overhead, my wife and I saw a very bright light.  It looked exactly like a star, only much larger and brighter.  It was flying in a straight path, and was silent.  No engine noise was heard at all.  The brightness was very intense.  The light did not blink or flicker, but stayed constantly light.  The object also seemed to be flying at a very slow rate of speed, and did not change altitude.  It flew directly overhead, but no object could be made out, just light. My wife and I turned around back towards our home so we could keep watching the object.  We followed it as we walked past three houses.  At the third house, our view was blocked by a few trees.  Based on the speed it was flying, we should have been easily able to see the object once we were past the trees.  However, the object was simply gone without a trace.  Whether the light simply turned off, or it shot off in the distance, we will never know.  The experience was incredible. That night, there were other aircraft in the sky besides the object.  We saw a propeller airplane far off to the East, and could hear its engine noise in the distance.  This object had no noise at all.

It wasn't like it shot away or anything it just disappeared.  We started talking about it the next night around a campfire with our relatives and they were like yeah yeah.   After about ten minutes of talking about this my wifes uncle in law spotted another light EXACTLY the same except this time it was moving from West to East same speed shape (a little larger do to it being closer than the last) and everything.   So we all watched it and it just kept moving finally everyone stopped watching it as it was passing over our heads except of course my wife, her uncle in law, and myself.  We all said hey it disappeared about the same time and everyone looked up and were all in shock at the disappearance of this light.  We started watching all the airplanes that were flying off in the distance and they all had a red and green light mounted on them and going about in the same pattern traveling from North to South and South to North and I do not at all think this was a private or commercial plane.  Now, we are all skeptical about UFO's and aliens and what not, but there was no denying that something was deffinately in the sky that night that ""WE"" could not explain.

Looking roughly to the North West I often watch planes coming out of Manchester and the headlights can be seen after nightfall rising above the horizon until the planes reach a trajectory of about 30 degrees when the headlights are extinguished.  I see those planes flying in a vector between south and southeast and I would estimate that the altitude is about 5000 feet when they pass the Dilhorne area.  I also see planes flying from east to west over Dilhorne at a similar height and assume that these are heading for Liverpool. These flights are controlled by the Manchester ATC people and are obviously coordinated to avoid any chance of a collision. At approximately 9.40 pm on Saturday 18th April 2009 I happened to notice headlights to the North similar to those of planes taking off from Manchester but coming from a point probably about 15 degrees east of the usual location.  Furthermore the headlights were orange, not the usual white. I will now refer to this plane as the object.  I then became aware that a Liverpool bound plane was passing almost overhead.  I must admit that I was somewhat concerned.  My vision of the orange light became obscured when the object passed behind my house and I had to move to the front of the house for a clear view.  The Liverpool bound plane cleared the collision point by about 10 seconds before the object reached it but it seemed as though the object had slowed down. Because of its unusual flight path and the orange light I was wondering if it might have been a helicopter.  However by the time that I reached the front of the house, the bright orange light had dimmed and I became aware that the orange light was in fact in the centre of an array of seven or eight lights forming a slender arc. The object made a slow sharp turn to the west and just a few seconds later disappeared.  I would estimate the trajectory at this point was about 40 to 50 degrees.  I have no doubt that the lights indicated that the object was saucer shaped.",2009-05-12T00:00:00,,

I was deeply disappointed to miss such an event, and thought that I would never have the same chance again. However, literally a couple of hours ago, I went out into my back garden to grab a quick ciggie. Normally if it is a cloudless night, I will look up at the stars, as in all honesty, in darkness my back garden is just as interesting to look at as it is in light.  However, after only being out for a couple of minutes, I had spotted a light over in the distance.  I presumed it was first of all a plane with it's lights on at night, but as it seemed to come closer, I started to think it was a plane on fire, as the sheer brightness, matched with the orange/yellow colour of a fire glowed from it. Although after watching it for a few seconds more, I do not believe this was so.  It closely resembled a diamond shape, but I could only describe as the colour that shone from it, maybe the diamond shape was an aura of light around this object.  I did pull my mobile phone out to take a picture, however I am afraid due to the age of my phone, the picture did not come out at all. As soon as I had thought the object was possibly a UFO, I quickly returned to my kitchen and rang up one of my friends to ask them to look out in the same direction, but by the time I had returned to the garden, the object seemed to be fading.  I assumed it was going the opposite direction, but the speed at which it seemd to shrink into the distance was immense.  I was too late in asking my friend to look for this object, but I shall be checking my local papers in the next day or two, seeing whether anyone else has seen this.  I certainly hope someone has managed to take a picture, as I have to admit I was very excited at what I had witnessed. (The length of time the object had been in the sky leads me to believe that it was not a flare from the coast, as it hung in the same location for such a long period of time, without falling). I have only now started scouring the Internet, and have come across http://www.nuforc.org/ I have also recorded these following details, the time is as accurate as I can guess, give or take five minutes either way.  I look foward to any reply, although I understand you must receive many letters from people with similiar stories, but I would ask if there is a chance you could let me know if anyone else may contact you regarding the following:  22:40 - 22:45 Saturday 18th April  UFO? -  Orange/yellow colour, like fire, in the direction the Belfast Lough points toward the mainland.

I could not see the actual craft or crafts; just the lights.  It looked like the lights of three fighter jets in tight formation.  The craft or crafts turned north-northeast and headed out over the Long Island sound towards Westchester and quickly faded from sight.  The turn was impossibly swift with no arc; more like an angle drawn on paper.  The shimmering part was like a Star Trek movie when the ship comes out of cloaking – it was like the light formation was there but you could see through it somehow -  half visible / half invisible.

I am writing this report about 5 minutes after the sighting.   I stepped outside onto my back porch at roughly 12:30am.  The sky was perfectly crystal clear and their was a 3/4 moon.   The object I saw was first thought to be a cloud.  But I thought it was very strange becaue it was so tiny compared to any other cloud I had seen.  The object was far in the distance.  I would estimate at roughly 5 or 6 miles away.   Regardless of me thinking it was strange, I still just thought it was a cloud especially considering it was greyish in color.  It stood absolutely still in the sky.   I had the moon that was about a fist's length away as a good landmark for reference.   I quickly went into my house for maybe 20 seconds to grab my binoculars which were right by the door.  I turn around and look out and the object is gone.  This is what made me decide it was not a cloud.  This fact combined with that it was not moving.   I figured a cloud doesnt just disappear in less than 20 seconds and it definitely wouldnt have moved out of sight in that time considering it didnt appear to be moving in the first place.

I showed my friends to confirm what I saw and they started finding more of these objects.  There was the main one (we called it the big one) above the tree, then, we started spotting one over lower trees to the right (we called it the right one). Then, one popped up in-between those two (we called it the middle one), and eventually one showed up underneath the big one. Now, my friends claimed to see very small ones surrounding them sometimes diving, flying around or “attacking” the main ones.  A few times we saw what looked like large bright shooting stars shoot down from them but it didn’t shoot acro! ss the sky, it quickly fell, seeming as if it may have fell to the ground.  We also saw beams of light across the sky often appearing to be blue. There was also this area that we called “the group” because it looked like a cluster of dim, glowing lights. I am sure these could not have been planes because we watched for hours and the objects were still in the sky around 6 o’clock am.  Planes go over our area frequently and the lights and slow speed were just a few things to prove they weren’t. It was truly one of the most intriguing, weird, and exciting things I’ve ever seen.

It was broad daylight, I don't remember what time, but I'm guessing around 4:00 PM. There was a plane in the sky, far away enough to just look like a white spot, but close enough to see it's lights, red and white I think.  And it was leaving a white trail behind it, like normal planes do. It looked like a typical commercial aircraft.  But below it, there was another object.  It looked like a white spot in the sky. It had no lights at all, and it wasn't leaving any kind of trail behind it, yet it was keeping up the same exact speed as the plane.  We watched it for awhile trying to decide what we were looking at, and eventually I decided to run inside and get my camera.  By the time I got back outside, the UFO was in front of the plane quite a bit, and too difficult to locate through the lens of my camera. We never got a good shot. This reminded me of another sighting I had witnessed a week or so before. It was in the same area of the sky, and also in broad daylight.  Again, I was on the porch smoking, and a small flash in the sky caught my eye.  When I looked up, there was nothing there. I watched for awhile to see what might have caused it, and a couple seconds later I saw it again, what it looked like to me was something (that I couldn't see) was reflecting the sun.  That's all it was, a bright white reflection that lasted a few seconds.  Disappeared, Re-appeared, and then was gone. I wasn't looking through a window, or anything, so I don't know what was reflecting the sunlight, but there was very obviously something up there. A few nights after that incident, my husband and I heard a helicopter really loud outside our house, he went to see, but I stayed in front of the TV..  He explained he saw what looked like a military helicopter, because of it's green color, flying around the vicinity of our house.

I walked about 20 yards from my semi-rural house to turn on the irrigation to my windbreak trees for the night.  After throwing the valve, I looked up at the night sky and saw an amazing array of lights moving from the southwest to the northeast over our neighbor’s alfalfa field, approximately 400 yds away and only 100 to 200 feet off the ground.   Four things struck me at once:  this thing was HUGE, slow, low and absolutely silent. I saw six white lights in a straight horizontal line, plus there was one blinking, smaller red light above the far-right light.  At my relatively close range, I estimated the thing at two to three football fields wide.  I’ve never seen anything flying remotely as big as this, in my life, or heard of any plane so large.  The whole array was moving very slowly, maybe 15-30 mph.  I had the feeling I was looking at the trailing edge of a huge wing, or perhaps the edge of a disc.   It moved slowly along its trajectory, headed towards town, where there is an airport. I thought:  ""If this is a plane coming in to land, it’s gigantic, must be some secret government job, but why is it silent and illegally (and dangerously) low?""   As it moved along,  the bulk of my barn blocked it out, so I walked rapidly to the other side of the barn, towards town, and there it was again, following its course, and I watched it disappear over the hill, with no change in the light array. Very quiet, very low, very slow, VERY large. The next day I told my brother about it, and he told his son, who happened to see the same thing, with eight witnesses, 15 minutes after I did.  My nephew only saw four white lights in horizontal array, and guessed it was two craft flying in formation, but like me, wondered why they were so low, so slow, and dead silent.  He said they seemed to meet up with another, smaller, moving, bluish-colored light, and then turned from their course and moved towards the southeast and that when they did, super-bright lights flashed for an instant, like a prism turning, and then they moved slowly out of sight. I hold ((deleted)) degrees in ((deleted--arts and sciences)), including ((deleted--multiple degrees)) from the University of ((deleted)), and a ((deleted--advanced degree from prestigious overseas university)).   I have never seen anything like this in my life; it took me aback for an instant, but then I rapidly started to catalog and process what I was seeing.  I have an open mind towards unusual phenomena, and believe that the unexplained represents a major frontier for science. For what it’s worth, I live within 10 miles of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, now undergoing cleanup, where eight or nine deactivated plutonium production reactors, and one live power-generating reactor, sit in a row along the Columbia River.   On another front, the first crop circle in the USA occurred within 5 miles of my house, and very near the flight path of whatever it was I saw.",2010-07-19T00:00:00,46.17882291666667,-119.16297812500001

I looked over and saw some fairly bright yellow lights in a triangle formation.  They were about the size of airplanes but much higher in the sky and they were only flickering, not blinking.   We pulled the car over to the right side of the road and I grabbed my camera to take a picture but just as a snapped the shot, they moved out of the triangle formation and into a horizontal line and began traveling southward very slowly.  That's when I switched to video-mode.  I stopped filming after a while because they didn't seem to be doing anything exciting and I figured they were just going to keep flying at that same slow speed until they made it over the mountains about 12 miles south of us.   We got back on the road and kept driving and immediately saw another light in the other direction (Southern Sky) that was much bigger and brighter than the first three and appeared to be hovering right over the mountains.   We passed by a patch of trees at that point which blocked our view of that second light and I mentioned to my boyfriend that maybe it was just an airplane tower at the top of the hill and that we were just seeing the light on the top of it.  But as soon as we passed all of the trees, that light has disappeared!   This freaked me out and made me wonder if the original ones were still there or had just disappeared too so I turned around to check and I saw them spiral together and disappear!

This peaked my interest and I went outside to check, but saw nothing. I returned inside and a few minutes later, the infrared cameras picked it up again.  I then inspected the perimeter of the building and searched up and down the adjacent streets; it was then that I noticed a bright red object to the NorthWest of my location.  It was above the cloud deck and was not a planet. Note that Mars was on the Solar Planar and visible to the East and other planets were obscured by cloud coverage.  I hopped in my truck and felt compelled to investigate this object.  As I headed around my block and onto Hill Rd.  I continued to keep an eye on the object, which was descending and/or getting brighter.  Having seen MANY objects similar to this one over the past 9 months, I was very calm and prepared for almost anything.   But this was different.  I traveled no further than 8 blocks and traveled up a dead end street to the north.  All lights in the neighborhood dimmed, my truck lost power, and I was mesmerized as this Red Light became a shape. It descended even closer to me and literally came to within 100 Meters from my vehicle.  I pulled out my cell phone and began filming it.  The video details far more than what I saw... I saw a Red Craft maneuver from at least 15K feet altitude to 100 meters in front of me in 3-5 seconds!  I found myself face to face with something that looked like it had retro-rockets on it, and then an EXTREMELY bright light that it shined into my face, causing nausea, mild confusion and a severe headache.  I've seen at least 100 unexplained objects in my life, but based upon my background, training and desire to not jump to conclusions, I've never reported one before.  This one is different.  It sent a message.  I feel ill right now and have what appear to be radiation burns on my fingers and symptoms of radiation sickness. The video when viewed  frame by frame, along with my narration, details a few seconds when the craft seemed to generate a ""plasma-like Orb"" and then swirled it around and shot a beam at me. Close analysis by my Dad and I found at the same moment, the glass of my vehicle warped, and I stopped talking, lost my bearing and then regained focus again. It wasn't so much that the object seemed malevolent, but rather that it was aware of my presence and allowing me to film it, yet at the same time, it felt like it was telling me to leave.

The cabin is in a tiny town located in the Mt Baker Snoqualmie National Forest (outside the town of Granite Falls) in the western cascade mountains of Washington. The lights were very bright and were shining through my window at an angle that would indicate it was coming from the sky and lit up the second floor deck. I got up and went to the window and looked outside and then realized that the entire cabin was being lit up by some kind of a giant spot light. This is very strange as this area is very remote and there is no electricity. The other strange thing is that there was no noise at all, as I first assumed that the lights were coming from a helicopter or plane I listened to see if I could hear anything and I could only hear the creek running outside. I can quickly dismiss the lights coming from a helicopter, plane, or any type of nearby machinery because of the remote location of my cabin in this little town. The lights disappeared just after I got up to look out the window. When I got up, the first thing I thought about was that there was a search helicopter hovering around, but as I said there was no noise or rumbling at all.

I had been outside about 15-20 minutes and then at approximately 1:AM, still facing south, I spotted, at an altitude of about 45 degrees up, and just slightly to the west, two separate lights, side by side, traveling directly from north to south. I ended up following one of the lights with a pair of 10x 50 binoculars, south, to an altitude of about 5 deg, just above the trees down the block. By this time it was far off and very dim. The sighting, from beginning to end, lasted around 35-45 seconds. The objects made no sounds,  jet, prop etc., completely silent. No blinking, or flashing  lights. Magnitude was 2.0, to 1.0 approximately. Looking through binoculars, the colors were a dim orange glow with no distinct lines and the shapes of the glows were rectangular with rounded over corners. Through binoculars they were approx 0.25"" inches wide and the position of the “rectangles” were symmetric to one another. My first impression when viewing  when viewing through binoculars was that they looked like sky lanterns when they start to burn low, and all you see is the glow from the lower part of the paper sack, without the flicker of the flame. It was hard to tell, but the shapes looked like they were the bottoms of something as opposed to being the entire object. I could see (with binoculars), a very faint reflection or distortion out in front of the orange glows. This was dark in color and not really a reflection of the orange light but seemed more of a reflection or dist! ortion of the night sky. These ""reflections or distortions"" were extremely faint to the point of fading in and out of view. Height of the lights could have been satellite altitude or as low as passenger jet altitude, but I couldn't be sure. I do believe the lights were much higher than local air traffic height. Speed appeared slightly faster than satellite speed. Distance between the two objects, when I first spotted them, ( extending my arm up, in front of me at a 45 deg angle and spreading two fingers apart ) was about 3"".  I like watching satellite / Iridium pass overs so initially I thought I was seeing two satellites. Movement of the objects appeared powered and was very fluid and constant. They stayed perfectly fixed, traveling in a straight line, side by side like two fighter jets in formation.  They were definitely not something being blown by the wind. There were stars between them so I know they weren't attached. I watched them like this, with naked eye, for a few seconds, but the lights looked different than satellites, not pin point reflections, but more of a dull glow, so I switched to my binoculars.  After a few seconds I began watching just one of the lights (the other light was outside the field of view of my binoculars ) until It dimmed out of sight, so I don't know if the other object stayed beside it the entire time.  As far down on the horizon as it traveled, about 5 deg, I would think the other object would've come into the FOV but I didn't see it.  The ""dull glow"" of these o! bjects was dim enough that had they been the smaller size of the pin-point of reflected light given off from a satellite passover, I probably wouldn't have spotted them.  Night was clear, moonless, little or no breeze.  I would be curious to know what these lights are, and someone else may be able to easily explain them, but in all my years of looking up, I'm at a loss.  I thought possibly a couple of Stealth fighters, but then they wouldn't be very stealthy with the orange glow part.  Forbes Field, (Previously Forbes Airbase) is a few miles to the south, so maybe it had something to do with that.  I'm not an expert, but I would think aircraft running lights would be required when flying over a city.  Background; 48 year old male, some college education.

I am currently a student in the medical field and I had to be at the hospital by 5:30 am that morning.  It was still sort of dark out, enough that I had to turn my headlights on.  There was no wind. The sky was clear, no clouds were in site.  I got in my car around 4:50am, started it and waited for it to warm up. I live in a normal neighborhood in the south east part of the city.  As I was backing out of my driveway I happened to look up in the sky out of the driver’s side window, which would have been towards the west.  I saw a fairly small whitish light about 45-55 degrees above the horizon in the sky.  It almost looked like a star.  When I first saw it I did a double take, when I fixed my eyes on the object it looked like it was moving around very fast and then it stopped and hovered for a few seconds.   After that I started driving west down my street still looking at it through the front windshield of the car.! It was moving very slowly.  There were no flashing lights, or blinking lights like those on an airplane or any other man-made aerial craft.  As soon as I got to the end of the street at the stop sign I stopped and got out of my car and was watching the light slowly travel north north east at a fairly slow rate, slower than any airplane could fly without crashing.  When I got out of my car and looked up at the object it was pretty far away, but it almost looked like there were 3 lights in the shape of a triangle.  They appeared to be kind of close together, like it was a single object, not 3 flying objects in close proximity.   For a few seconds I was pondering driving back to my house to grab my video camera, but I didn’t want to lose sight of it as it was traveling away from me.  (Later that evening I checked to see if my video camera was even charged and it wasn’t.  I am always going to make sure it is from now on at all times.)  I was parked in front of a neighbor’s house long e! nough for someone to turn on their front porch light.  I don’t ! know if they saw me and was wondering what I was doing.  I didn't want them to call the cops thinking I was a prowler or anything so I got back in my car and watched the object moving away from me slightly increasing in speed. I backed the car up back towards my house so I could try to see it as there were trees blocking my field of view and I gradually lost it in the sky due to the sun starting to rise over the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range.   Like I said I know what I saw, and I saw something that wasn’t man made. It looked like it had 3 small lights in the shape of a triangle and they were white. I am not a liar.  I consider myself very credible.  I teach at a local high school, and I am also a student in the medical field.  I have also seen several other unknown objects in the sky over my lifetime.  Hopefully someone else saw the same thing I did, but it’s highly unlikely that anyone will report it.  Thanks. I hope this has been helpful and I hope someone will believe me.",2010-06-23T00:00:00,36.356650127226466,-119.34793664122137

On the night of March 20, 2009 in Seattle, Washington I sat with my husband smoking a cigarette on our porch looking up at the sky. I noticed a bright light moving fairly quick, flying much higher than an airplane. I told my husband to take a look at it and he mentioned that it was probably a satellite, although it was much too low and moving much too fast to be a satellite. We watched it move east, and my husband then decided it was a high flying airplane, but then we noticed it move in front of a low altitude cloud. Meanwhile a descending airplane flew south above us and when the strange light intersected the path of the airplane it stopped and then quickly shot off to the west. When we came back out an hour later, the temperature had dropped significantly and I had become nauseous and my husband began to shake. We noticed that there was a lot of movement up above, lights flying past quickly, as well as several much brighter shifting lights in triangular formations. There were multiple sets of these formations. These were not stars because the lights that seemed to be hovering were not covered by passing clouds. My husband describes witnessing several lights emitting other, lesser lights. They did this in such a way that it seemed they were arching out of the bright light in symmetry. This seemed to be happening around, inside, and above faint clouds. We both thought these clouds were strange. The clouds seemed teaming with activity. Some lights just hovered in one spot, some would rock back and forth, other would rise softly and drop dramatically, sweeping away into the horizon, much like the very first light we saw. All these lights moved gracefully and moved at incredibly fast rates. We also noticed that some of these lights seemed to shake softly, in the way a pen would move across paper while writing. We kept watching this, and the activity never seemed to let up. We became colder and more nauseated and had to go back inside. Once inside, we felt drained of our energy and fell asleep quickly in all our clothes, and slept uninterrupted for the next 10 hours.",2009-04-14T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

(For orientation and topographical purposes a description follows :   The lot is about 3 acres in size roughly triangular in shape with the broadest part toward the road.  The front of the house faces NE.  The entire lot is surrounded by woods with tall pines and hardwoods.  Elevation is 345 ft. , topography is low rolling hills.)   We noticed two bright lights traveling low through the trees and to the south west.  We thought it might be a helicopter but there was no sound.  The object continued on and became more visible as it approached the house while line of travel was to the west of our house.  The object was traveling from SW to NE.  The estimated time of observation from first sight to last sight was about a minute to a minute and a half. Object description based on full observation period: triangle shape, about 50 to 60 feet wide, 3 large round lights each located at the points of the triangle and underneath and visible at all points of observation, green flashing light above and centered over bottom light and red flashing light at rear.  (90 degree side view and at closest point of observation) : 3 large lights visible underneath,  green light on front , red light on  rear, toward the front of the object and well above the under side was a row of about six very bright lights that appeared to be windows They were shaped  like vertical  rectangles with slightly rounded corners and side by side, these lights being toward the front of the object.  The only sound  was that of a large object passing through the air.  The sound could only be heard shortly before the object reached the 90 degree observation point and shortly after it passed this point,  otherwise there was no sound. The following are estimates based on knowledge of the terrain, distance at 90 degree observation and prior training and experience:  SPEED between 30 and 40 mph; ALTITUDE between 300 to 400 feet; DISTANCE AT 90 DEGREE OBSERVATION POINT 150 to 175 yards (land measurement).

I guess my peripheral vision detected a slight movement so I continued to look at the 2 stars.  Soon I realized that the right light was actually moving east very slowly.  Its light was a distinct muted red, definitely a different red from Mars.  If I were to measure the distance of travel at arm’s length it moved about 8-9 inches in the night sky.  It moved to the east for about 2 minutes and then stopped, soon after it just stayed in one position and after 30 seconds or so it began to slowly and steadily fade away until it was completely gone as if it were leaving Earth’s atmosphere.

Every once in a while, some clouds would roll in, but at the time of the sighting, the sky was clear.  We were facing the West and off to the SW I noticed an aircraft traveling West to East.  I pointed it out to my nephew.  From the lights and sound, I could easily tell it was a jet.  A few seconds later, right overhead (North of the jet), we see this bright, yellow light moving about the same speed as the jet, moving along with it, West to East, about the same speed as the jet.  It seemed like it might have had two very faint red lights on the rear, but no lights on any wings.  You could barely make out red lights because the yellow light was so bright.  We heard the jet briefly, but didn't notice any sound from the yellow light object.  Maybe it got drowned out from the jet noise.  I've sat out on my deck lots of nights and see lots of aircraft flying overhead and am used to the light configurations on them, but I haven't seen anything really like this before.  I don't believe it was a meteor, or any kind of space debris, or satellite because it was moving too slow and didn't seem to ""burn up"".  It was too bright to be a satellite.  The yellow light was a lot brighter than I'm used to and no lights at all on the craft were flashing.  They just stayed on and were consistent in color and brightness the entire time.  Whatever it was I think it was flying around the same altitude as the jet, or maybe higher, because even though it was at night, I've seen low flying planes and helicopters at night and can usually make out their outline.  I couldn't make out any outline on this.  Even low flying planes with their landing lights don't seem as bright as this thing was. At first I thought it might be ISS, but I've seen it before and it seemed a bit too slow to be ISS, and brighter from what I remember, plus there were the two faint, red lights to the rear of it that didn't seem consistent with ISS.  I thought maybe this might be! some ki nd of new aircraft I'm not used to seeing, maybe military since the jet was near.

Yesterday morning I woke up early to catch the ferry.  It was about 5:00 am and still pitch dark with a clear sky.  A very brilliant white light just above my tree line caught my eye from a small second storey window looking north.  It is hard to judge size, but I'd guess it spanned two or three tree tops from my vantage point, which would make it very large projecting outward. I have to stress that I did not have my glasses on, so I could not dicern shape, but that made the experience no less strange.  The light moved slowly from east (Eastsound, Orcas Island) to west along the tree line.  There was a slow pulsing light seemingly attached under the primary light of smaller size, but also bright white.  The light was bright enough to send rays through the trees, as you will sometimes see when the morning sun shines through on a misty morning. I cranked open a window to try to hear what this was.  It was virtually silent except for an almost imperceptible reverbant humm.  Velocity was constant, I'd guess it passed out of view well inside of thirty seconds.  This is the first time I have experienced anything like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2009-03-19T00:00:00,48.6576,-122.8119

The other object moved very fast to the west and headed toward us. As it past over it made no sound. Soon after we went inside we came back to find 3 other bright multicolored lights in about the same place as the others.   This time the objects turned the same colors but one stayed white.  They were in a triangular shape while flying and soon broke off quickly into different directions.  As they broke off one went to the side and stopped turning colors then vanished for 10 seconds and came back.  The next one went the opposite way that it started and stayed turning colors.  The one that stayed all white went to the south side for a couple minutes then started heading toward us again.  All of these made no noise and soon dimmed into the night.

There were 6 to 7 total. They were ascending and descending and moving left to right for the first couple of minutes.  I was able to capture a small video clip on my phone.  I do not know if the quality is any good yet.  I stopped a man to verify my sighting, and he agreed it to be a UFO of some kind (I did not get his name).  We watched them ascend out of site by 1710.  The formation was much more scattered toward the end. On the way out of the park I noticed a lone UFO craft that was speeding toward the direction the other craft had gone (1713). I swear and affirm this story to be true. I even studied the local bird patterns to verify it was a UFO of some sort.  I have tried repeatedly to find a reason these were not UFO’s and I cannot find any.  My 10 year old daughter also witnessed the entire event from start to finish.

I didn’t want time seem weird but it stood out more so, but I thought it was just maybe Venus because it was normal to see Venus kind of big during this time of year.  It was brighter then Venus though and looked like it had three lights from it since it was giving off a very bright glow.  It still has my attention though and I keep my eyes on it, since it looked out of the ordinary and I was just trying to reason with myself. When we got up to the piece of property, my fiancé got out of the car to get to the trailer.  I was still watching this object trying to figure out why it was so bright. Then it started to move side to side, up and down, even looked like circles. I was alarmed since I was trying to figure out if I was out of my mind. I tried to debunk it too, but I was seeing planes in the distance flying and I could tell it was a plane too. But I could not tell this was a plane, it started to get closer then further away and it looked like it was flying at an angle to the left and tilted. It was weird. I told my fiancé when he came back to the car to sit in the driver passenger seat and look at this. He asked me, “Look at what?” and I replied, “Just come look.” He sits down and I point at the object and tell him to look. I asked him if I was the only one seeing this and he told me, “No, you are not. I can see it moving weirdly.” He left for a second trip and I told him to hurry since I was still alarmed. The object was still moving in a weird fashion and went out further in distance. It was still in the far distance and looked like it was searching for something.

My friend is a twenty year old Army Spc. stationed at Ft. Bliss as well.  My fiance and I were at this friends apartment in central El Paso between the hours of 1830 and 0200.   The electricity in El Paso was disrupted due to a vehicle collision with a power transformer approximately around 0015.  Clear skies with stars brightly visible with a low smoggy haze in the south western end of El Paso.  We stepped outside to determine if other neighboring apartments had lost power along with my friends apartment when my friend noticed an unknown number of white/yellow lights traveling across the Franklin Mountain range above the western end of El Paso.  Pointing our attention to the western skies of El Paso, my fiance and he both witnessed the cluster of lights disappearing over the mountain traveling east.  I did not witness the lights due to a highway sign obstructing my exact view.  Not able to see the lights in the western skies I turned my attention directly to the skies above me and on an angle looking towards the east.  I then witnessed four dull blue/white balls of lights in a diamond shape pattern approximately two to three miles above me traveling east to west at an unknown high rate of speed.  The pattern of lights then slowed and came to a stop directly above me.  At that time I grabbed my fiance's arm and pointed directly to the lights above us. She witnessed the formation as well.  The four lights then seemingly holding its pattern turned directly straight to the ground the forward light now at the bottom of the diamond (creating the pattern of an upside down diamond), this all taking maybe two to three seconds. It within seconds of repositioning itself continued moving towards the west at a high rate of speed. As the pattern was heading west, the far left light darted directly out of the formation to a dis! tance ap proximately a half of one mile to the north east and then snapped back into formation within one second. The formation continued to the west until it was no longer visible. My friend did not witness these lights as he was still scanning for the lights that travelled across the Franklin Mountains. Five to ten minutes passed while we continued watching the sky above us as well as the skies above the mountain range. My friend then witnessed and called our attention to a dull dark orange ball that was only noticeable due to the street and parking lights below it. It was approximately the size of a seventy five centimeter exercise ball hovering one hundred yards above the ground, two hundred yards to the west of where we were standing, above a one story building. The ball darted slowly one or two feet to the left, then up one or two feet, then right one or two feet, it then slowly traveled away from us moving west at an very slow speed, possibly three to five miles an hour, until it was no longer visible due to the smoggy haze or beyond the street lights that were illuminating it.

I watched it for a few minutes to see whether or not it was a plane, helicopter, bird, etc.  It had none of these obvious characteristics.  It just hovered.  It was difficult to determine exactly how far away it was, but I would guess between 2 and 5 miles, based on the geography of the hills. When I saw the object rise, I would guesstimate a few hundred feet, I alerted my friend Phil.  He immediately wrote it off as a bird or plane. I told him to keep watching it, it was stationary and would move slowly up and down, then horizontally some distance.  We measured the movement and it’s position by the distance between the telephone poles that are about 3 to 4 blocks away. We continued watching it for about ½ hour as planes flew by it and we then realized it was not an aircraft, plane or helicopter.  My next-door neighbor ""Elli"" had stepped out of her front door when I pointed it out to her. She was as mystified as we were. The only explanation I had is that it might have been a kite.  The only problem with that explanation was there was little or no wind, plus the altitude of this object was at least 1000 to 1200 ft high and it would not swing from side to side as a kite would naturally do.

At around 21:00 on 01/03/09 while driving up Ramshead Drive from Northpark way Leeds 14 with my partner and our daughter, I observed to the west a very bright stationary object, which immediately drew my attention as being ""not normal"" and so I pulled over in the road to observe it. From where we stopped we had a very clear view over the city center to the south west, and just over to the west was this stationary bright white object hovering around I would say 1000 feet or less. It was what looked to be pulsating in size and changing colour from brilliant white to red over in cycles. My partner being very skepticle about these kinds of things, struck me as unusual as she was very excited at what we were observing. Both myself and my father have a very keen interest in the UFO abduction phenomenon and so at this point I phoned my father to tell him about what I was observing. Only to have the phone answered by a very excited tone saying how he had too seen the objects and was observing ""them"" with my mother and brother in the sky to the west. At this point being very confused about them seeing more than one object, a red object of slightly smaller size appeared in the sky at a much lower altitude to the first, but pulsating hovering around i would say 500 feet. I am training to be a pilot and so I feel I have an accurate knowlege on jusging this height. At this point around 21:10 an airliner approaching from the south decending into Leeds Bradford Airport (at which may I point out was a Jet2 boeing 737 LS348 from Dusseldorf, and must have also viewed these objects) passed between them on its decent into Leeds. This was a very spectacular sight, as just as the airliner passed the lower red object, it ascended virtically at a very high rate of speed before winking out and disapearing. At which point the larger higher bright white and red object that had remained fairly stationary, although seemed to change in size and shape in cycles, now from what I could see began to move to the west, con! stantly pulsating red and white light, until it too winked out and disappeared into the distance at a very fast rate to the west. At which point I made the journey back home to talk to my family about what I had seen, who also had exact same accounts to what I had just witnessed. Now these objects were fairly stationary in the sky for at least around 10 minutes before making movement and departing sight. In that time not only did the previous airliner above pass through the airspace but another Jet2.com from paris CDG also on approach into Leeds. Both of these must have also seen the objects, as must have Leeds air traffic control. Thank you.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

After about 5 minutes passed I realized that the object had not moved and we were getting closer to it.  As we got near, the one light from the distance became two distinct lights with a couple red lights in between.  Again reminding me of a plane, however, this object was still stationary.  We actually passed the object at around mile marker 129 (it was to the east of the interstate) and at this point we could make out the three bright white lights in a triangle shape.  The object NEVER moved.  I also noticed some blinking coming from on top of the craft, I could make out two brighter white lights that would blink up high and one of the red lights blink below.  The craft made no sound and continued to hover as it got smaller in the distance of us driving away.  In total, I watched the object for about 15 to 20 minutes.  This length of time rules out the possibility of it being a low flying airplane because that would have come and gone in minutes.  The helicopter is the only logical explanation, but that doesn’t explain the silence nor the triangle shape of the lights (and I could be wrong, but I thought they could not hover in one spot for too long of a time).   Furthermore, I have seen many helicopters growing up in Colorado next to all the airports and air force base and I’ve never seen one stay perfectly still for as long as this did.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,38.861478298238076,-104.78039776536313

We are all professionals between 35 and 56 years old.  We were watching fireworks around the lake from the dock.  We saw 3 separate sightings of similar UFO objects about 15 minutes apart-they were NOT an aircraft that anyone could identify-no flashing lights typical of aircraft, movements were not typical of planes, and no airplane noises were heard. The objects sight came from the horizon at the south-west (the first object came from a point furthest to the west compared to the other two) and traveled northerly up the lake pulsating a orangish/red glow. Their sizes at their largest point was about twice that of Venus, which was visible just above the western horizon and at least as bright if not brighter.  Each time, their altitudes were at least a few thousand feet (guessing-based on the height of the surrounding hills from the water). Most of their movements were similar in character to each other with erratic speed (fast then slow) and motions -veering off to one side or the other, sometimes instantly reversing their direction - sometimes appearing to stop or hover along their mainly northern route before continuing. None of the movements were super-fast. All three sightings ended similarly in that they appeared to stop in about the same location to our south (distance unknown and very difficult to even guess) although their routes to get to that area were slightly different.   After being stationary a few seconds-they got brighter and brighter then began to move south and upward slowly (in relation to our position) as their light dimmed and then vanished.  The second object re-appeared briefly (and dully) after a second or so of turning south disappearing, remaining visible for one or two more seconds again - which helped to verify that it was still moving after we lost sight of it before it then vanished.

I live in Laconia.  Last Saturday night, my boyfriend D came up to see me and we went out.  When we got to Fun Spot, in Laconia, we parked in the back in the separate parking lot.  We turned off the car and it was totally silent.  We were just sitting there and I looked up at the moon.  I saw this weird black-shaped object.  And then, I said to my boyfriend,  “What was that?” He looked up at it and he said, ”If it gets any closer, we need to leave.”  I kept staring at the moon to see if it was just a plane or something.  It moved back across the moon.  It was huge and it looked like it was zig-zagging or changing shape.   I couldn’t tell. He said, “I think it’s coming closer.” It flew so fast over the trees getting closer to where we were. It felt like it was zeroing in on us.  It blocked the moon. And then, we started panicking and driving away.  I thought were were going to hit the Bingo building.  We turned left but it felt like we went off of a jump – you know that feeling? like we were on a rollercoaster?   And we were in the air.  I was trying to pay attention to everything that was going on but it felt like I couldn’t.  When I looked up, everything was black.  The smell was not nice but it was like something you could stand.  It was an odor I’ve never smelled before.  I heard absolutely nothing – it was silent.  I felt immobilized like I had no control over what I was doing or over my body.  I could see nothing.  It was like opening your eyes in a pitch black room. I felt really nervous and scared.  I don’t remember crying or screaming.  I held on to the center console because I felt like I was lifted.  I was holding on so tight that my thumbprint is imprinted on the center console.  And then, when I finally realized what was happening, I was so close to the windshield that my body was going forward with my arms behind me.  Everything was black.  I heard a loud noise like a horn.  Once.   And then, the car just dropped.  I hit my eye on the dashboard and the airbags came out.  I couldn’t believe what had just happened.   I held my face and I looked over at my boyfriend.  I saw that his left arm had blood. I said, “Are you OK?” I looked at the windshield and it was cracked, totally, but only on the passenger side.  I could see D but I couldn’t see anything outside.  The only thing that made the car drop was the sound of the loud horn.  When the car dropped,  there was a loud boom.  After that, we just drove so fast out of there. The smell went away after we drove away.   And I started crying.  And  I said, “What the h—l  just happened?”  My boyfriend  said, “I don’t know, I don’t know.”  I didn’t feel like they were following us. When we got home, my Mom said that she could hear me from the outside while I was freaking out.  I couldn’t stop crying.  My Mom said, “Calm down and tell me what happened.” I said, “You’re never going to believe me.” “Is it my car?”  she asked. And I said, “Let me explain,” because I felt that if I didn’t explain it fast enough, it was just going to go away from my mind.  At about 12:15 am, a cop arrived.  I told him what had happened while I was sitting down at the dinner table.   My boyfriend was sitting next to me – it was then that I noticed that there was no more blood on his arm or his clothing.  The cop didn’t believe me at first until he finished looking at the car.  He told my Mom that there was no reason for the air bags to come out because nothing else on the car was damaged.  He didn’t check underneath the car but we found out later that the underside was totaled.  The cop said that he was going to the place where we had been. I just felt thankful that we’d gotten out of there.  But I couldn’t stop crying for more than 2 hours afterwards.  My Mom said, “You should go take a shower and get the airbag dust off of you.”  But I didn’t want to be alone at all.  I felt lucky.   And there were no scratches or anything anywhere on my body. The first night, my dream was that I was a little girl, maybe 6 or 7 years old, in an Elementary School classroom.  I was looking at myself as a little girl.  And then it was like the teacher called me up and I couldn’t talk or say anything - but everybody else seemed to say something for me.  Like everything I wanted to say, everybody else was saying it except for me.  They were saying exactly what I wanted say.  I have never had a dream like this before – where I am a little girl and see anything about the past.  I did not feel right at all. I am better now. I still worry about seeing this thing again and I pay attention to the sky at night.  I really don’t go out at night, anymore, because I’m scared. “",2010-04-13T00:00:00,43.564069411764706,-71.48186235294118

I stared at it in silence, and disbelief  for a few minuets when my dogs got worse.  It looked like a round disked, circle shape, with a rounded hump, or top, on the surface of the aircraft.

Only helicopters could get to where the lights were located. Description: I could not see the craft itself, but the light coming from it was extremely bright. In order for human technology to reproduce how bright it was, it would need to be a large collection of flood lights in one place. I could just see the very edge of the light source, before the shape of the light changed and appeared to actually be two craft crossing paths over and over again. As the lights moved around, it would cast a lingering haze on the clouds nearby that would resemble a lightning strike in the sky (the light did not flutter though like lightning does, it was constant). The color was pure white, this never changed about it. There was no blinking lights that would suggest man made craft. I live nearby an airport, and have become very used to identifying different craft in the dark. None of our craft can produce such a bright light that far away.

Other long contrails were visible in other areas of the sky, particularly to the south.  The altitude of the three contrails seemed to be similar to typical jet contrails. The three contrails seemed unusual to me.  The contrail lengths were relatively short compared to others in different areas of the same sky.  The two most westward contrails were relatively close and in parallel.  A third contrail was close behind.  After observing these objects for about 20 to 30 seconds, it then appeared that there were actually four contrails.  The fourth contrail seemed to be close to the forward two.  The flight paths were apparently straight and the movement seemed to be consistent with high altitude aircraft speed which I have routinely observed. These contrails apparently were evaporating rather quickly.  After about 60 to 90 seconds after the initial observation, the contrails disappeared, one by one.  The last one observed was the trailing contrail. At this point, my initial impression was this phenomena could have been some type of debris entering the earth’s atmosphere and breaking into three or four relatively large pieces.  I was not able to determine if the contrails were actually due to aircraft.  I did not have access to any type of optical devices or cameras.  There was no observed points of light associated with the contrails. There was one other observer besides myself.  My background is in chemistry and radiological safety.

The sky was blue, no clouds in the sky, very sunny. She said she had seen this object  flying to her right, about 200 feet up.  She said she watched it for about a minute before she realized she didn’t know what it was and told me to look at it.  It was hard to see at first because it was sliver and was like a flat egg, it blended in so easily to the sky but I did finally see it and we watched it accelerate to a very fast pace and then slow down again, at this point it was in front of us, over the freeway.  Then it continued a steady pace to our left, and landed.  It went straight down to land, not like an airplane.   I wanted to exit and look for it but my wife did not want to. So we drove on.  It was not a helicopter and it was not an airplane.  We did not see any markings on it.  We did not take any pictures with our phones, when it was happening we were in such disbelief that we didn’t even think of takings pictures of it.  This happened before the 281 highway exit on 1604, it landed behind a Shopping center.

The object was witnessed aboard a McDonnell Douglass MD-82 twin jet aircraft traveling eastbound at 33,000 feet and 497 knots. At the time of the sighting the aircraft was at latitude 37.87 and longitude -79.79, placing the aircraft between Covington and Lexington, VA. The aircraft was in radio contact with the Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), and traveling between the waypoints ASBUR and DENNY on jet airway 42 (J42). The object was witnessed off of the left side of the aircraft traveling north (right to left) at an extremely high velocity. The object appeared spherical in shape and bright white and glowing in color. The object appeared to leave some sort of contrail, which may have been a distortion of light due to speed. The object contained no other sources of light typically found on civilian aircraft. The object disappeared from horizontal view within 2-3 seconds, moving at a speed much greater that that of an approaching opposite direction jet aircraft. The object had an apparent size of 1/4 the circumference of a full moon, and looked similar to a shooting star or meteorite. Size relative to the aircraft could not be determined. The object appeared to be between 35,000 and 38,000 feet, 2,000-5,000 feet above the aircraft. The trajectory of the object resembled an ascending arch.

Date: Sunday 27th July 2008. Time: 10.20 pm. Location: Warrington, Cheshire, UK. Just to set the scene:  This Sunday had been particularly warm (at least by UK weather standards) and quite humid.  It had been like this for a couple of days. We have a 3 year old daughter, who was getting a cold and had a bit of a temperature.  Combined with the heat, she wasn't particularly happy.  My wife was upstairs with her and I was in the living room downstairs.  The lights were all off, and I was sitting in my recliner listening to a podcast on my laptop.  The windows were open at the other end of the room, and next to me the patio doors were also open, in order to let a breeze blow through. The patio doors lead out to decking in our back yard.  I can also see the front of the garage, which has a motion activated light on it.  (This tends to go off when people walk past, or sometimes when cars go by.  It's quite sensitive.)  Just as my wife came back into the room at 10.20pm, there was an extremely loud roaring noise outside.  The garage light came on (which may have been coincidental) and I saw the object flash over the garage, from the direction of the house (ie from 'above' me), and disappear. I went out to the decking as quickly as I could but it was nowhere to be seen. I will give the best description I can.  Imagine a dumbbell (two balls joined by a cylinder).  Imagine that the two balls were flattened discs, with black centres.  The bar joining the two discs had a bright white light on it.  The two discs reminded me of turbojet fans, but this may have been suggestion caused by the noise.  From the light in the middle the object seemed to be made of a shiny metal. I only saw it for about 1-2 seconds, it moved very fast.  It looked about the size of a small car, but I have no way of judging how high up it was.  My wife heard the roar but didn't see the object, as she was too far away from the patio doors. I have seen several UFO's before.  These have been a silver disc flying next to Concorde (at age 12, an din broad daylight), a blue light hovering over some woods at night (age 13-14) and a rotating triangle with a light at each corner at night from a car (also at appx age 13-14).

My daughter & I had errans to run that day so we jumped into our Jeep (I had the roof off fully open) as we got to the traffic light a mile from our home, I looked left out to the ocean and noticed the craziest thing, I saw what I call contrails in this instance, not chemtrails.  The trail were in the weireds shapes in the sky, I estimate the 2 craft making the contrails were traveling over mach 3 or faster.  Whe I zoomed in on my compter you cant see the “Jets” in front of the contrail, explain that one? The when I was analyzing one of the photographs I noticed a black cylindracal craft hovering very high above a cumulus cloud that craft could move at the speed of light, in the blink of an eye it would be 10 miles away!

I was sitting in my yard watching the sky for the Perseid meteor shower, when I noticed what I first thought was a dim star moving very slowly and, seemingly, erratically.  Sometimes it would move from side to side and then make a full stop for a few seconds before continuing.  I watched it for about ten minutes (trying to comprehend what I was seeing) then ran in to call my brother outside. He looked up and could see it right away.  He confirmed that it didn't look or act like any plane or helicopter he'd ever seen, either.  It was very difficult to determine the shape of the object, but to us it seemed either circular or spherical. From what we could see it didn't have lights in the usual sense, but seemed that the object itself was lit.  However, it could be that we were unable to see the whole object. At one point the light was vibrating or dimming and brightening very quickly; my brother said he thought it was changing colors, but I was unable to detect a color change.  But we both agreed that it was clearly pulsating. It moved around in a random pattern, almost aimlessly, but always remained within clear view. After about 40 minutes my brother went back inside and I watched it for a bit longer.  I noticed that it moved back and forth several times, as though someone repeatedly driving a car forward and reversing.  It began pulsating heavily (the light seemed to be making patterns, but I can't be sure my eyes weren't playing tricks on me). After that it moved into a cloudy area and it became far too overcast to be able to spot it anymore. Just a note:   Afterward I thought it might just have been a man-made satellite, some of which are visible to the naked-eye in certain conditions.  I read through a lot of information online, but from what I've gathered a satellite's orbit does not match the behavior of this object.

My family and I were sitting on the beach at Salter Path, North Carolina. I noticed what I thought was a very bright star, but it was moving and appeared to be blinking. It was followed for about 15 seconds by a smaller looking red dot, which disappeared. The first star-like object was making very erratic movements, which appeared to be twirling.  It came close enough to shore that I could make out the outline of a disc shaped object which was clearly spinning, with red and white lights around the edges of the middle section of the disc. The UFO then flew further away, but we could still see the light from it which seemed to blink from the rotation of the craft. A second one joined it, and began to follow it very erratically. The second one then began to ascend to the upper part of the sky very rapidly. After a few minutes, two military planes tore across the sky in pursuit of the craft, which took off. At this point both crafts disappeared.  By now, we had all been following the crafts for 45 minutes. When the two planes (clearly planes, as the flight pattern was very straight and had no inexplicable, rapid fluctuations unlike the other two lights) came in pursuit the two discs took off. A very low flying plane closely followed the two jets.  About 20 minutes later, we witnessed something hovering stationary over the water for roughly 30 seconds, then slowly move forward towards the beach. Once it reached the shore, it flew sideways, and then began to move forward again. It had two red lights, one on the left and right sides of the front of the craft, and a white light in the middle of the two red ones. There was also a white or orange light possibly on the underside of the craft flashing downwards.  My family and I have been going to this same part of Salter Path for 19 years. Never before have we seen anything like it. All of us are used to seeing planes and helicopters flying at night, as there is a military base in the vicinity (Johnson Air Force Base). The motions of the lights were such that it would be impossible for a plane or a helicopter. Furthermore, we identified a disc shaped object to be the source of the lights.",2009-08-27T00:00:00,,

The lights stayed in perfect unison and did not appear to be very high up (maybe 1000 feet or less on a guess). The odd thing was that although it seemed to be a perfectly clear night the 3 lights appeared to have a large haze around them and it also seemed that there was a slight glow in the middle of the triangle. I can't really judge the speed but it was comparable to a slow and low flying jet except for the fact that there was no noise what so ever (but this also depends on the true size of the suspected object).  I was an Electronics Technician in the US Navy from 00-05. Stationed on an aircraft carrier from 01-05 and have never seen anything like this.  My brother was there also and saw the same thing.

I initially believed it to be a satellite since I often see satellites at this time of evening, however. I immediately realized that there was an area of solid cloud cover obscuring the stars at approximately 2,000 ft. AGL. The object was below the cloud cover. I estimated its speed to be 50-60 mph.  The object made no discernable sound, and had no apparent shape or nagivation, wingtip or landing lights.  After observing the object for approximately one minute, the object entered a cloud for approximately 10 seconds. When it emerged, it had changed color from white to solid red and had changed heading to north-northeast, about 060 degrees. At that time, I called my wife to come see it. By the time she came outside, the object was some distance away, but she was able to see the object's color and direction of travel.

It had 3 dots on it in each corner where it looked like lights should of been but they were off. It had no lights on it which made it more strange. Right away we started freaking out cause it was unbelievable and we both were saying ""We werent just seeing things"". It was scary and unlike anything we both have ever seen. It was like it appeared out of no where n flew slow above us for a second and it started to go faster and then we don't know where it went. It must of been silver but it looked like a brownish color and was lighter than the night sky. It was so crazy that tears just started rolling down my face. Me and my friend both were freaking out and got scared. We both are not the type of people to lie . Right after it happened I calle! d my boyfriend and he came with 7 people and we went back to the parking ramp because we were scared to go alone and we were even scared to look at the sky after that.  After we got there and told them about it we felt like they didnt believe us except for my boyfriend because he is into UFO stuff. A little later we saw this sphere that looking things that looked like it was turning in the sky. There was no lights on it or anything and most of us saw it. It was moving fast and then disapeared it was also the same color as the triangle ufo. We didn't know what that was because again we never saw anything like that. A few minutes later we saw this worm looking things. Everybody saw that one. It would move like a caterpillar and shrivel up then stretch out. Each time it would shrivel up different though. It was long maybe 30 feet, thats just an estimate. I thought it was something falling out of the sky or a shriveled up blimp but as we kept looking we realized it wasn't anyth! ing like that. It was moving kind of slow and it disappeared a! fter abo ut 4-5 seconds. I couldn't believe it because that was the third strange thing we saw that night. After that everyone believed me and my friend that we saw  that triangle object. The triangle object was the most weirdest  thing out of all of those. SO was the worm like thing because none of us have ever seen anything like that and the next day I tried to look it up and couldn't figure out what it was. None of these objects had lights on it. The triangle ufo looked like the lights were just off. That experience opened my mind up .

We could not detect the shape of the craft, all we could focus on were the lights.  It was hovering to the south-east of us.  The lights were lit up, then they went out one by one, in a sequence pattern from left to right.  They lit up again, then went out again. The light sequence happened about 6 or 7 times.  It was hovering, but moving towards the west, in what seemed to be in spurts, always lighting up in sequence.  Suddenly, it started moving south, then it disappeared within seconds in the distance.

I was sitting on the front porch steps of my sister's house smoking a cigarette and staring up at the constellation Orion; that's probably the only reason why I noticed it.  I looked down and it appeared just beneath Orion as if it just winked into existence.  It was just above the tree lines and very large, I can not judge distance and size very well, so this is just as close as I can figure... Above the tree tops but way too low to be at helicopter height or airplane height.  It was just above a 12 story tall building.  I hope you understand this, I'm still really shaken by it.  Freaked.   All of the above, I've never ever seen anything like this before. Anyways, it was a perfect triangular shape (the lights from the street illuminated it slightly and it was darker than the night sky behind it), black in color, with three very large lights on each tip of the triangle.  It moved at a very steady pace that I could easily follow with my eyes, above the tree line, and for about two-three blocks down  the street.  The lights were very, very dimmed... like they were on the lowest they could go without being turned completely out but they were illuminating absolutely nothing. the lights looked like they were slightly bulbous and not streamlined with the rest of the .. craft?   It flew straight down the street, didn't spin, nor did the lights come on and the entire thing, during the entire time it was completely and utterly silent.  I could hear the highway in the background, cars a few streets over but it was like someone pushed a mute button on this thing. I watched it fly down the couple of blocks and then it just went completely black again.  Just gone. Also, about 3-4 minutes later, both my sister and I witnessed two helicopters in the vicinity; one flying toward where the object disappeared and one that was circling around the area.  It was too dark to tell what kind of helicopters they were.  I did not see them again. Both my sister and brother-in-law have seen this same object.  One just the other night on highway 85 from Denver, Colorado and my sister saw the same thing on the same occasion. I'm going to go out tomorrow and sketch the area from the point of view where I was sitting and draw in the object how I saw it from that point.  Maybe that will help determine the size. My background?  I do paranormal investigations.  I can handle ghosts, intelligent and residual, nature spirits, poltergeist activity and even the nastier things that go bump in the night... but I was always afraid of 2 things that get lumped into the paranormal category and one of them is UFOs so I never study them.  I was much happier when I was in denial, thank you very much. Directly afterward I called my friend, who is a paranormal investigator and reporter and left him a voice mail message on his cellphone (freaking out) telling him to call me right away.  About 15 minutes later he called me and told me that he thinks I saw ""what the British call a Silent Vulcan"" and to go to this website and file a report with Peter Davenport.  And since he's into the UFO side of things and I'm not, I listened to him.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,40.42028898809524,-104.75199613095239

At these heights I would guess they could have been the size of a commercial airliner if not smaller.  Obviously they were not, nor exibited typical flying aeronautics of Earthly aircraft.  Considerly the earth rotates along with the moon moving, these craft were observed at different heights as well as different locations throughout the evening. The closet craft exhibited the well known ""wobbling"" effect.  I've read numerous books on UFO sitings from Britain. Ireland,  The United States and around the world.  I consider myself well versed on the subject from Dr. Mackey and other physicists who believe in the fact that craft are indeed originating from other worlds.

At 6:05pm I was driving west on SW Taylors Ferry Rd. toward SW Washington Drive when I saw a strange set of lights fly overhead.  These lights fit almost perfectly the description of a ""Black Triangle"", three white lights creating an equilateral triangle with a single red light in the middle of the other three.  I could not make out any structures on the object. I slowed down and almost stopped my car as I watched it go behind the trees.  I felt the urge to follow it but the speed was too great to match in a residential area and it was traveling in a direction I could not easily follow.  In all I saw the object for about 10 seconds before it went out of view.  I immediately drove to my brother's house a few blocks away and told him what happened.  We went outside to look but did not see anything else. My Thought Process:  At first I thought it was a low flying plane and thought nothing of it.  Then as it flew overhead I thought, Hey, that looks like the general description of a black-triangle UFO,  I should figure out what type of plane has those light patterns so I can debunk it, and began consciously trying to make out a conventional aircraft shape and patterns.  As I failed to make out any familiar aircraft to go with this light pattern I began to realize I might be looking at something much more unique. Object Description:  Four lights total; three white lights creating an equilateral triangle and a fourth red light at the center of all three.  All the lights were steady with no flashes or pulsation, constant brightness.  They did not move in relation to another.  These lights were pointed down toward the ground, they were not pointed forward (as might be typical of an aircraft flying at night). The white lights appeared around the same color temperature and appearance of a typical halogen bulb.  The red light appeared to be white light that had been filtered to red.  Although vivid, it was not monochromatic (such as a red LED or laser light), it looked more like a red-filtered stage light.  There were no strobe or marker lights. I cannot say for certain what the body/structure of the object looked like.  It was dark with little ambient light surrounding it and none of the light emitted was self-illuminating.  I would like to say I saw a black triangular structure but I cannot be certain.  However, I was consciously trying to match a airplane shapes and patterns to what I saw and failed. Size was approximately 30 ft between each white light. Object Flight: 10-15 degrees West of North traveling with constant speed, direction, and elevation. Approximately double the tree height, so around 200 ft above ground.  I would estimate speed between 60-80 MPH. It seemed to keep perfect alignment with the horizon with no visible rolling.  Object was leading with an edge of the equilateral triangle created by the white lights, while the final ""point"" of the triangle was pointing in the direction opposite of travel. Other Notes: I was in the car with the music on and windows up.  I did not hear anything unusual as it went overhead.  I have a Camaro with T-Tops, so I could watch it fly overhead through the t-tops. There were no electrical or any other disturbances as it flew overhead. My Background: I am a 23 year old male.

On the night of December 29th 2008 around 6:40 pm my boyfriend and I noticed 4 to 5 extremely bright lights in the sky during a drive to our friends home. The sighting originally took place as we were driving down Ocean Avenue in Northport,Suffolk County Long Island. Whenever we drive down that road, which is practically every night, I always look out at the view because it overlooks the water and is very scenic and beautiful. I was startled immediately by it because it was very unusual and there isn't a huge amount of plane traffic especially in that area. It appeared to be very very bright shining lights in the sky. I was unsure at first whether or not they were some kind of man made lights on some kind of building because of how bright they are but I know the location and there are only residential homes in the area beneath the road by the water and the lights were clearly not a part of anything. I pointed them out to my fiance who was driving and he couldn't tell what they were either. It did not look as if they were in any precise formation. They all seemed very close up, way to big and bright to be stars and definitely not planes. They seemed to hover or stay in one place. They were at all different heights in the sky, some lower some higher but in the immediate vicinity of one another. As we continued to drive I could continue to see one in the sky. We drove from Ocean Avenue to 25A and when we stopped at a light at the corner of Waterside and 25A there was that one huge bright light still visible in the sky. I frequently look up at the night sky and admire the stars and watch planes, it is something that has always stunned me. This was definitely NOT a plane. In fact there seemed to be quite a few planes in the sky which added to my suspicion that it was something unexplainable. Seeing the light in comparison to the planes really showed me how distinctly different it was. When we stopped at the light I wanted to make sure it wasn't moving, that it was hovering or stationary. I wa! tched it for about 30 seconds between two tree branches to see if it was moving even slightly. It seemed to stay in place perfectly and maybe move very very slightly to either side. It was shining like nothing I have ever seen in the sky almost like it was a light that was rotating or oscillating. I then called my sister and parents who live right up the road in Fort Salonga. They kept asking me to take a picture of it but whenever I would try to with my cellphone the quality was so poor that it did not look like anything significant. I was able to take a video of it on my phone but again it looked barely visible and it was very frustrating. As we continued to drive I lost sight of it but then it was visible again when we were driving down the Sunken Meadow state parkway. We pulled into our friends neighborhood in Commack Ny and the one bright light was STILL visible outside of his home. We told him to take a look at it and he said that he has noticed it before but couldn't tell us what it was. When we went inside I could see it through his bedroom window and I noticed an extremely low flying plane in the sky while we were looking at it. ( Maybe trying to also see what it was?). I did not look out the window for about 15 minutes or so because my fiance was having a panic attack or feeling really anxious for no apparent reason. When I looked out again it was totally absent from the night sky. My mother called my Grandmother who lives in Ridge Ny which is about 20-30 miles East of where we were and she also spotted it in the sky. The whole experience/sighting lasted about an hour and it was visible from a pretty impressive radius throughout Long Island. There are six witnesses I know of who have seen this particular light in the sky. I wanted to report this to see if possibly anyone else had noticed anything bizarre or strange. I have a very poor quality video of it on my cell phone but it is not distinctive and it looks so small on tape when it was so massive in real life. I am guessing this is due to the quality! of the lens and camera on the phone. I wish I could have gotten better recorded proof but 6 people throughout four different towns saw it so I am at least glad I wasn't alone in seeing it. It did not seem to be descending or moving around at all. When I originally saw the 4 to 5 other lights I lost track of them behind the trees and only the one light was visible the duration of the sighting. My fiance does suffer from anxiety but we were fine the entire way there and I thought maybe there could be a correlation between him feeling that way and what was in the sky. We had no car troubles and I only saw a white light. My mother claims that while she was watching it it was changing colors but I did not notice that. Since there were more than one maybe it is possible that she was looking at something different than I was. She said she thought it could maybe be a star dying but that wouldn't explain how many I originally saw and the light was so bright.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,40.914,-73.3207

The object got my attention due to its odd attitude (vertical and slightly tilted to one side, illuminated, and just odd and non-aircraft looking)as well as the number of aircraft moving with it.  Object and aircraft continued west and seemed to pause near Limerick Nuclear power station, and I passed them at this point.  After exiting at PA Route 100 south I regained sight of object and followed it. The object came to rest over wooded area between French Creek State Park (which lies in both Berks and Chester Counties) and Camp Nueva Esperanza area in North Coventry Township, Chester County. Remained brightly lit and stationary for at least 25 minutes. Meanwhile, a series of 3-4 jets (probably military, seemed to have dual horizontal tail fins and lights )alternately made slow wide turns around the object's location during the entire time (I had first mistaken these jets for commercial aircraft on approach to Philadelphia International Airport, and in fact spotted at least one commercial aircraft heading that way).  One of the aircraft made a closer approach to the object than the others.  Eventually the object moved slowly westward toward the French Creek park area, as did the aircraft circling it. I lost sight because it got further west and I do not know the back roads in the Northern Chester / Berks area. Was still brightly lit when I departed. Object's shape looked like a helicopter hanging from its front end , i.e. cockpit at top and tail at bottom. Light was much brighter and a bit yellower than the surrounding stars. Although the aircraft engines were audible as they circled the object had no discernable sound at all.

This light was in approximation 33 degrees north and 117 degrees west from my location (used Google Earth to approximate degrees). The object did not move the first couple of minutes and I had the chance to get my binocular and look at it. The binocular is just a regular binocular; but looking at the light or ""object"", it was a bright and luminating yellow light (which it looked as a single connecting object without the binoculars but with them it looked like four slightly separated lights in a shape of four equal sized small circles with the gaps pulsating with light). I was only able to take cell phone photo and images (did not have my digital camera with me) but the cell phone footage along with a drawing and other material is included. Upon looking at the first light for a couple of minutes, on the opposite side of the sky (east to the visible location of the 1st object) I saw another light that was pulsating yellow that seemed to be even closer (as it looked bigger) slightly moving before moving at fast speeds. While spending only a few seconds with the binocular on the 2nd object, it too seemed to be four small luminating circles which looked as one total piece when viewed by the naked eye. The first object seemed to be in Irvine as the Irvine Spectrum is completely visible by my location (and based by my perspective was hovering above Irvine Spectrum). The second object being to the other side of the sky was clearly in a different location and in a different city. After the second light was moving slowly, I saw the 1st light ""accelerate"" slowly and became barely visible (even with the binocular). The 2nd object while visible, seemed to be moving more rapidly back and forth (appearing huge, then smaller, then huge, then barely visible and faint)th! an the 1st one. Thinking the 1st object was gone, it came to v! iew agai n (about 70-75% of the size appearance) from the earlier appearance & the 2nd object also came back to view. In observing the sky after my girlfriend pointed it out to me, the sky seemed very crowded and busy like never before. I am unsure what the objects were, but they certainly of no similarity to the other objects as the other objects were much smaller and of white colored light. If I had to guess, I would guess helicopters and possibly a jet for the faster moving object. There were other faint objects I could not identify clearly. After this and during the whole commotion, a 3rd light was clearly visible (to the west appearance of the 1st object for a brief time) but no more than two objects or lights were clearly seen and visible at any given time. As stated, the entire event was about 10-15 minutes but as quickly it all seemed to happen, the objects disappeared and did not come back (according to what we saw as we waited 10-15 minutes or so after) and the other lights! and possibly helicopters quickly after that (within 2-5 minutes after).  After the 1st light, I assumed it was some sort of projection light from the Irvine Spectrum; but after seeing the 2nd (and what seemed identical) light, I knew that was not possible. I don't know what the objects were that I saw, but they clearly were not an airplane, jet, or any other similar objects as the objects even stood to what it appeared completely still at times but also seemed to ""accelerate"" at extreme speeds but surely were the most unusual object(s) that I have seen my entire life. I have attached a drawing as well along with other footage so include it at your discretion. Thank you.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,33.6451193877551,-117.67865204081633

No, this was not a meteor, balloon, or sattelite changing the angle and reflecting sunlite. The apparent diameter was almost a quarter the size of a full moon. The question is HOW CAN AN OBJECT APPEAR, CHANGE ANGLE AND DISSAPEAR..ALMOST AS IF IT WAS IN BETWEEN SOME SORT OF SHIELD...UNFORTUNATELY , THIS SEEMS IT WAS FOR MY EYES ONLY...VERY PECULIAR..",2009-06-09T00:00:00,,

At approximately 10:13pm on May 19, 2010 I looked out the back window of my house and saw four red lights lined up horizontally, they were stationary at this point.  They had an LED look to them, very bright and focused points of light, not beams.  I immediately told the two friends I had at my house with me to come outside and see it.  When we came out it was gone, but there were many helicopters in the air circling (at least three).  Then the four red lights came back into view as they quickly moved straight upwards from behind the buildings directly to my West until they were approximately 20 degrees above the horizon, at this moment the object transformed instantly from four red lights into one slightly larger blue light and headed in the exact oppos! ite direction straight down.  The change in color, direction and number of objects seen happened simultaneously and it appeared to move sharply with no acceleration or deceleration and did not seems to make any noise.  The four red lights from end to end were approximately two to three times as wide as the moon was from my vantage point and the blue light was about a third as wide as the moon.  I was located at Nutmeg Avenue and Lexington Street in Sarasota, FL facing between W and WNW.  My friends who called me were standing at Superior Avenue and Gulf Gate Drive in Sarasota facing directly North, it was about 15 degrees above the horizon from their point of view.  The helicopters that were in the sky circled this area for about twenty to thirty minutes after we last saw the lights.  Afterwards, I called every news station in town and they all confirmed that they either did not own a helicopter or it was grounded at the time.  I also contacted the County Sheriff’s Departme! nt and they confirmed that they did not have their helicopter ! in the a ir.  I called everyone again the next day (5/20/10) and asked if they would confirm that they had no helicopters in the air at that time.  They all confirmed.  Next I called Air Traffic Control at the Sarasota International Airport, they said that they knew of nothing, but gave me the FAA Flight Standards contact information.  After asking about the helicopters, I explained my story to them.  About an hour later I received a call back from the FAA, the gentleman I spoke with was very friendly and helpful but could not give me any answers.  He suggested I contact NUFORC at that point.

I say this because they came into view as I was looking toward the back fence which runs parallel with a street that runs in an East/west direction. One light was in front of the other but not in a straight line like single file, they were slightly offset from one another. They stayed the same distance apart. The speed remained steady. They did not zigzag or bounce around, or waver. I heard no sound from the lights as they passed overhead. I couldn't decipher any definate shape to the objects. The edges . They were diffused or hazy; the same way street lights or headlights appear to me, with a kind of halo effect. They seemed to be going slow but in reality they had to be going fast as they disappeared out of sight within seconds. Because we live on the outskirts of the flight path of an international airport and airplanes pass over all the time I'd say they were considerably faster than any airplanes I've seen. It's kind of hard to judge the size of the objects as there was nothing relative to compare the size with, but I'd say they were at least as large as a commercial airplane, maybe larger.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,33.42126454293629,-111.772797322253

I kept driving down the road until the trees to my left ended and I came to an intersection where the traffic light was red. I stopped at the intersection and rolled down my driver side window and I could see the lights traveling horizontally from west to east across the horizon. There were about 20 - 30 lights in the sky traveling in pairs one on top of the other. As they moved across the sky, the pairs would switch spots within the formation (the one on the bottom would move to the top).  When the light turned green, I pulled into a parking lot of a restaurant, which was closed for the night, and continued to watch them move across the sky. I was in the parking lot for about 3 minutes and I decided to keep traveling east on McGregor. As I pulled out of the parking lot, I kept followin! g the lights with my eyes. I came to another intersection and took a left to turn around (to go west on McGregor). While I was waiting for the light to turn green I noticed 7 lights identical to the ones that were traveling across the horizon and saw that they were stationary and in a tight formation. The formation was 3 lines. One line was at a 90 degree angle, and the other 2 at a 45 degree angle, with one on the right and left and they all met in the middle with the other light in the formation. At this point, I called my wife and told her about what I saw. She told me to go pick her up from home because she wanted to see the lights. I picked her up, but once we got there the lights were gone. Traveling home and back took about 20 minutes.

What I saw was at approx. 350 degrees in the north sky and at about a 45 degree angle. At first I thought it was a blimp because the size was about that along with the shape, longer body with a shorter height; like one of the super large Goodyear blimps you see at sporting events. Then I realized it wasn’t moving at all and my visibility got better to where I could tell the height wasn’t much at all. Along the bottom it had white lights that were circling it. The reason I know the lights were moving and not a blinking sequence is because there was a small obvious break in the lights. At the top it appeared to have two smaller lights one red and one white. I decided to keep driving and try to get a closer look to figure out what exactly I was seeing. As I approached the bottom lights turned off and all I could see vaguely were the top lights. It still seemed a distance away at that point. I made a turn on a side street to continue trying to get closer and after passing a tree I could no longer see anything there, no red light nothing at all. It seemed to have disappeared after about a 4 minute show. I kept asking my son if he was seeing what I was seeing and he was.

Cowichan more precisely, during sunny weather with only a few clouds and maybe a high haze, while I was driving down Kingsview Rd from 'The Properties' on the W slope of Mt Tzuhalem, as I approached the bottom where it comes to a T with Maple Bay Rd, I spotted something small in the air somewhere over Quamichan Lake, maybe 1km away I estimate. It was reflecting the sun (to the upper left) and had some sort of dark attachment, either above or below it - I'm sorry I can't remember clearly as I only saw it for a few secs.. but it was rising quickly.  As you would expect, my mind was racing thru the various possibilities as to ID - small helicopter/plane or model of such.. mylar balloon, etc - none seemed to fit. (If it were a plane, model or real, I think I would have seen wings.) I could not pull over to watch it as there was traffic behind me and no room to pull over, not to mention going down steep hill, so as I descended toward the main Rd I lost sight of it behind the trees along that road.  But just seconds later, after turning onto that rd in the short merge lane I found I had a clear view out over the lake, and there were no longer any vehicles behind me, so I could pull over and try to relocate it. The only trees were now to my far left, but pretty open view otherwise. There was nothing to be seen in the sky.  It had to have hightailed it out of there pretty fast to disappear like that. When I saw it I could see it against Mt Prevost in the background (beyond the lake and on the other side of Hwy 1), which provided good contrast to see the obj. Some of its rapid upward motion could have been caused by my decent, but I'm sure that effect only added to its real motion. I could not figure out why I could no longer see it anywhere around, after only a few seconds. I wondered if the power line crossing the main rd over to Kingsview had been reflecting the sun as I came down, viewing it almost end-on.  So I got back in my car and spun around to go back up the hill and down again to recreate the effect, but the power line was too low to have caused it. There goes that theory..  I'm quite certain it was out over the lake, maybe 1km from me, almost level with my line of sight and the Mtn in the background, but quickly rising.  It had to be very shiny to reflect the sun like that, but couldn't have been very large - no bigger than a small helicopter. So it still could have been something mundane like that but even with choppers you can usually see them flying away in 1 direction or other, they can't move that fast! Hope this is detailed enough considering the banality of the sighting as compared with others, but it was actually my first sighting in 34yrs of life and felt I should report it. Wish it could be less vague.",2010-05-12T00:00:00,48.7829,-123.7027

I thought they were flares with the usual red color distorted by smoke traveling horizontally dues to a light wind we had.  After reading some of the other area sighting, however, I am having second thoughts. The lights resembled the video of the Phoenix lights I have seen in luminosity and color.  The traveled though the air, one following the next, at the same velocity and same altitude.  I only saw them briefly and didn’t think much of it at the time and went back to blowing stuff up.  We shot off and watched a lot of fireworks that night but these lights definitely caught my eye due to how unusual and out of place they were. Later that night on our way back home to Bellingham I saw a single light, just like the two I saw about an hour earlier in Bothell , in the Marysville area while driving on I-5.  Identical in every way except that it was alone and appeared to be stationary.  I, again, wrote it off as a flare, even commenting to my wife how thick the firework smoke must be to distort the color so much.

On the ride down I stopped first in a place called “Area 101” where I spoke with a number of UFO enthusiasts about the contact movement’s program of interacting with the intelligence (presumably ET) behind the UFO phenomenon. From there I headed south and met with a young man who described his having positive interactions with what he identified as ETs throughout his life with numerous sightings that he claimed had an interactive component. After I explained to him a term that I have coined called “prime contactee (reserved for individuals who can request a sighting and actually have one occur)  he thought that he definitely was a “prime.”   At my Mom’s house in Koreatown I brought my luggage up to the second floor and looked out through a screen window. It was 1:45 AM. The lights of the city reflecting off the overcast skies lit up the neighborhood. The silhouettes of palm trees graced the horizon. I gazed out to the west and immediately noticed a blinking stationary red light about ten degrees above the rooftops of the surrounding two story homes.  For many years I have looked through that window on visits to LA and can never recall seeing such a light in the sky before. It was difficult to judge its distance as there were no landmarks behind it. It was relatively large, about a finger breaths wide at arms full length. In trying to figure our what it was my first thought was of  flashing red lights on a radio antennae array some 3 miles to the west.  They are not visible from my Mom’s house and besides this light was solitary and far too large. As I had this thought the light began to slowly move horizontally to the north. This was no stationary aircraft beacon sitting on an antenna. Police helicopters routinely patrol this part of central LA and the light was not part of any fixed or rotating wing aircraft. At this late hours all was quiet in  this heavily residential neighborhood. The red pulsating object, circular in shape moved behind a tree. I waited for it to emerge into view on the other side. It did not. I wait! ed and scanned the sky and listened intently for the sound of aircraft. None  could be was heard. Was this just another ""random sighting?"" Or could it have been a consciousness mediated show of support for my networking efforts among the UFO experiencers that I like to call ""the contact underground?"" My guess is that it was a show of support because the next day I got a call from a contact team leader who told me that her skywatch team had a sighting of a round red UFO at midnight the previous night. It was less than two hours before my sighting. Coincidence? Perhaps but I don't think so!

Each individual object looked identical to a faded star and but there were four all together that moved in a somewhat V-Formation.  3 moved in a straight line while one moved to the back left of the leading object, creating the V-shape perception.  The lights remained constant, created no sound nor trail, held a constant shape and the lights were spaced out similar to the stars in O'Ryan's belt.

In any case, we have never told anyone about it, partly because we did not see it flying, but more so that we could not really describe the shape .... in this Filers files  is a report fron Baton Rouge LA, and the decription is perfect! It was a saucer shape but made of rectangle shaped panels all around the sides flashing bright colors, as they described white, blue, yellow , red and green. While basically round, it had a 'jointed' look to it. This was in the winter on a clear, moonlit night, and it had snowed recently, so the colors and craft were highly visible. In this area we have long tree rows which divide fields, and some of them are miles long. The object was sitting on the north side of one of those. I have always had the feeling that it is odd that we did not stop, but it was almost like something was telling us to 'move along'.... very strange behavior for me. But we had a fairly long time to view it as the field it was in was in our direct view for several miles, with no obstructions to the view. Anyway, just wanted to share that!

It's a relief to tell someone! Hello, I know you have a lot of pranks and false reports that are turned into you all the time.  I worked for the Utah power and light company out of Salt Lake Utah around 1981-82 time frame and I was on a small crew near Jensen, Utah, erecting power line towers.  We had just finished one of the towers at around 6:00 pm and began loading all of the equipment into the trucks getting ready to end the shift and go back to the warehouse. One of the guys spoke up and said look at that!  The object looked like a silver cigar holder and I would say it was approx. 40-60 ft. long, and approx. 10-15 ft. wide, and rounded at both ends, with a gold light on the front and a blue light in the middle.  I also estimate that the object was about a mile away from us at the time we first saw it.  As best as I can remember it had no signs of trailing gas and was silent.  We saw it coming from the northern horizon and it only took probably 10 seconds to go out of sight in the southwestern horizon.  I know that it was not a satellite, jet, or anything I have ever seen before, it was in our inner atmosphere, in other words it was very close to us.  My opinion the SR-71 Blackbird or the X-15 wouldn’t have had a chance.  I have been seeing a lot of reports on the net and on TV about sightings lately and am very reluctant to let anyone know about this. This event happened years ago and it is as though it happened a few minutes ago.  It has been bothering me for a long time and I am just now getting the courage to tell someone, it is a relief!  I mentioned this to my wife once and she said, are you sure you weren’t smoking pot, drinking or something?  I replied to her that all that I was doing was drinking a jug of iced tea I had in my lunch.   She didn’t take me serious at the time but she has since then changed her mind.   I work for a government defense contractor now and am aware of the many false reports that people make and some that are very real.  I know what I saw was real and in my knowledge of air travel and planes, jets, drones and similar aircraft, we have nothing! like what I saw.  This was in the 1981-82 time frame.  I hope if the government does have craft such as this that they let everyone know about it soon to stop all the speculation.   I do believe in our lord Jesus and hope all of this comes to light soon, for every one's sake.",2010-07-29T00:00:00,,

The second, is that I was watching some sort of burning balloon.  I had this notion in my mind tonight and then saw some you tube videos on Chinese lanterns.  If that is what I saw, it was quite large and was either on fire entirely, or was supporting an enormous flame before burning out.

I’m on the top-floor of a 4 story building; the object appeared below the elevation of the Space Needle, and appeared to be centered over the Elliott Bay area, due west of downtown Seattle….approx. 10-15 degrees west of the Space Needle. I watched it for a few minutes, still not sure what I was seeing.  I thought maybe it was a plastic bag…caught in a thermal…but the movement was different:  it appeared to undulate….“wobble”…..and moving slightly in a slip/sliding motion.

I grabbed my camera and tripod, and photographed several shots from my apt. window area.  Despite the camera being secure, some of the imagery showed a blur…indicating that the object was moving; it wasn’t camera shake, etc. I then ran over to the top of the Seattle Center parking garage for a better vantage point.  The garage rooftop has an elevation approx. the same as my own apt’s, but the object appeared to be lower in the horizon, still appearing to be over the Elliott Bay area, west downtown Seattle. I took an additional 10 or so shots from this vantage point.  The object finally dipped below a tree-line, obscuring my viewpoint and was no longer observable. I returned home, downloaded the digital files for review.  Successive frames showed movement from the object, because of the blurring it induced.  Again, the camera was on a tripod with a timer being used; there wasn’t camera shake induced.  2-3 shots are relatively crisp…and show the pentagon-shaped body; in others it appears to be almost an “upside down hat“, with more mass below the “brim“.  The camera I was using, a Nikon Coolpix 8400 only has a limited zoom range, 24-85mm + tele-zoom, but I was still able to reveal a distinctive body shape.   Given the limited optics, and the relative crispness of a few of the images, I felt I could guesstimate the approximate area of it’s hover…which appeared to again, be over Elliott Bay.

We both at the time just kind of blew it off a bit,joked about it being a UFO we lit a cigarette, and looked up and it was gone.  This is when we began to freak out and get real serious about it, realizing that we where talking about it and observing it for at least 10 minutes without it moving, and then it just disappeared. We continued to scan the sky when I noticed the same looking object to the west of us.  Appearing about 5 minutes after the other one dissapeared.  It had the same blinking colors, only the distance seemed closer, and lower than before.  We kept watching it hover in place, shift to the left and right real fast, and then at moments it would stop flashing colors and turn a yellow-orange color.  It also would get distant and then come closer.   My husband then noticed to the north another one, by this time I am really freaking out, and almost in tears because I cant believe my eyes.  My husband on the other hand excited about what he is seeing.  My husband watched the one towards the north as I watched the one to the west.  We would report back and forth to eachother what they where doing as we watched.  My UFO then shifts right then zooms left leaving a trail of light behind it then dissapears in a split second.  If i would have blinked I would have missed it! Im still not sure where it d! issapeared to. Since the UFO I was staring at had disappeared we both continued to watch my husbands, which was not moving at all.  It was just flashing red, orange, green, blue, and yellow.  I looked over in the direction where the one I was observing disappeared, and it reappeared!  They where both there in the sky again, one to the north, and one to the west.  The one that I was watching seemed as if it would get distant, and then come closer, contunuing to shift right to left and up to down.  My husbands seemed to stay in the same spot not getting closer or farther.  As we observed them seperately we would continue to report back and forth to eachother what they where doing. This all came to an end at about 2:40 p.m. when all the sudden mine turned yellow-orange, then his did too.  Then mine started blinking colors, then his did too.  Then all the sudden both of them began to get distant and higher extremely fast together(still in their seperate directions of west and north), then they both just disappeared.   We stayed until 3:00 to see if they would come back, but they didnt, so we walked to our apartment. From what we collected and witnessed, it seemed as if the two crafts where comunicating back and forth with their lights because one would blink lots of colors then turn to a yellow-orange color, then the other would do the same.   And it also seemed as if the one I was watching was on a mission, as the other one was on the lookout.   We collected this because mine was doing all the moving and his was just still. I had a very hard time getting to sleep after having experienced this.  My husband was very excited about our experience, and was releived that he now knows life on other planets exist.  He seemed pretty calm about it, but still said that he was a little freaked out.   I have never been a believer in aliens and UFOs, but I now honestly have to say, that after experiencing this, I am a believer.  Nothing could explain or justify what we saw.

We also noticed a red blink, which led us to initially believe it might be a VERY high flying plane.  Again, the light zig zagged from its path, then fell back into line. From the time we began watching it from about the middle of the dome of the sky to our left horizon, the light took less than a minute to cross the sky (much, much more quickly than other planes in the sky at much lower altitudes.)

The object was bright and was flashing red and green lights along with an almost L.E.D. white light. These lights were clearly visible to all three of us using just our eyes and later confirmed with binoculars and telescope. The object almost appeared to be rotating at high speeds which could explain to alternation of lights which had no apparent pattern. This object was relatively fixed in the same portion of the night sky compared to other celestial objects. The object would move in irrative movements, suddenly going to the left and right really fast and then in circular movements. Then, it stopped moving and the green and red lights settled down. I flashed a bright HID light at it in sequences of 3. It was like the object was reacting to my flashes by beginning to move again and flashing back once again.

I have seen this phenomenon 5 times by myself over the past two months.  It does not occur every night. It always seems to be around 11:15 pm.  I called my husband and my eldest daughter to see it one other night.  The one time there was only one in the sky my daughter said she thought it was a geo satellite.  Each other time there have been only one or two of these lights in the sky.  They flash red, green, and white and are very high up in the sky.  They do not look like stars because the stars stay white and these flash the colors.  I have driven the area where I have often seen them looking for cell phone towers or RCMP communication towers and there are none in the area where they appear.  The objects are also too high in the sky to be on a tower.  They are too far apart and appeared in the NE part of the sky, SW part and the due W part of the sky.  So it can't be kids playing with balloons or anything l! ike that.  Besides balloons float upward and these stay stationary and only once have I saw one move. Tonight I saw the one very bright one and thought, it's back.  I smiled.  I noticed another one.  Then I saw a white light appear and flash very bright it appeared to be three times bigger than the stars nearby and then just disappear just near that bright one that had the flashing lights.  I called my husband.  He came out to see.  We counted eight of them in the sky in various areas.  My husband watched one move very fast and then seemingly disappear. He IS NOT a believer in UFO's.  I asked him if he thought small time Regina was so exciting that ANY government in their right mind would place 8 satellites overhead this often to observe US.  The google earth image stays daylight and had summer images in the winter time.  See I don't think we are THAT big of a priority here.  We do not have any special industries.  I just feel that we are NOT a likely target of any sort of massive government interest.  I called my mother in law and asked her to step out onto her balcony from! her place.  She did and she saw them too.  I said alright so it is now confirmed by some people other than me.  I am the only believer and both of you have seen them.  My youngest daughter and her cousin went outside to see what we were up to and they saw them too. Still in the sky at 12:39 pm.  The one that flashed the bright light has not reappeared and there are NO stars where it was when it flashed.  Regina does not typically have more than two commercial passenger airplanes at the airport at one time.  WE ONLY HAVE FOUR GATES IN our AIRPORT and only two luggage conveyors.  So it does not make sense that we would have 8 objects flashing red, green and white lights in our skies that sort of sit stationary for the most part and then move really rapidly once in a while. One night I tried to take a video or a picture of the brightest object assuming it was the closest to me but it did not show up on my camera as it must be too far away.  Perhaps my camera is just not good enough. The lights have now disappeared.  ALL OF THEM.   It is now 1:03am.",2010-07-19T00:00:00,50.44846994609164,-104.61783369272237

Then moving away slowly, over NW Los Angeles County In the 9 pm hour noticed a particularly bright white light in western sky.  It was strange because it was a hazy night, and no stars or planets were visible, as it was not a clear enough evening.  Not only was this visible, but it was exceptionally bright. The object was stationary, and high in the sky.  I showed my wife who also thought it was strange, because no stars could be seen, but this could.  I decided to stand on my porch with binoculars and look closer. It was difficult to make out any discernible shape, because the white light was too bright.  But it was just sitting still in the sky.  No aviation lights blinking of any kind.  No detectable movement.  It was definitely not a helicopter, or plane.  I watched commercial planes fly by it, and sometimes under it, on their approach to LAX and Burbank airports. I mad sure not to move my position on my porch, so that I could keep the lights position in perspective against the visual landmarks I was comparing its position too.  It remained still, lined up in the same spot and  not moving. I judged this by relating it's position to a palm tree, and telephone lines in my line of view. It was hard to judge how far away it was, because I don't know how big it was.  It definitely wasn't close by.  I would guess hovering somewhere between Woodland Hills and Malibu, CA, both due west of my location. After about 30 mins I was ready to give up, having decided it simply must be a very bright viewing of Venus or something, when it suddenly (albeit slowly) started moving to the north and further away (out towards the ocean, maybe near Thousand Oaks, CA). I watched closely, and had my wife join me.  She had been checking it's location from time to time, during the half hour.  She completely agreed that it had moved significantly off the spot it had hovered, completely still in, and was moving away. I felt that it also seemed less bright, and possibly even a slightly orange hue, during its exiting the area. Eventually it was out of our view.  Too far gone. We have no explanation.

While driving into town on a back road I noticed a low flying object about 80ft in front of me about 60ft up so it caught my eye and when i looked directly at it I hesitated thinking it was some strange plane but then instantly knew it was something else. The ""UFO"" was triangular in shape with somewhere between 40-60 lights on the underside of it all with the same brightness and standard yellowish color. I stopped on the side of the road, got out of the car and starred at the object for at least a minute, watching it hover around over the tree tops. I tried as hard as possible to absorb as much info as I could about this object because it would be so hard to tell someone what I saw later on. I was able to conclude that if it was on the ground it would have been about 10-15ft across with about 50 lights tightly packed together taking up the entire area of the underside of the object. The lights stayed on as rows consecutively turned off and then back on as th! e next row did. After about 15 seconds some of the lights turned off to create an arrow shape on the underside of the object with the rows turning on and off the same way; the arrow was pointing in the direction it was moving. The object made no sound whatsoever and made erratic movements back and forth on either side of the road going only a few miles per hour as if the wind was pushing it along back and forth. After staring at it for a minute the object started going down the street in the direction I was heading. I immediately got back into the car and started chasing after it. I never lost sight of it while chasing it and it started going faster than I could keep up with it. I looked at the speedometer and I was going in excess of 60 MPH and still accelerating for another quarter mile until the road came to an intersection where the road i was on ended and the object continued straight in the direction it was going over the tree line due east. I could not get a photo be! cause it was dark and the quality of my camera phone was poor.! The wea ther was clear and it was at 7:00 pm so it was dark. About my self, I have never believed in UFO's and I never had an interest in it before in fact I would laugh about it when people on tv claimed they saw something. I was going from my house to my job as a firefighter so there was no drug/alcohol involved. I am currently a college student. This is the first time I have ever seen something like this and have done research to see if this was a military object and could not find anything close to what I saw except for other similar triangular UFO's but they usually only have three lights as opposed to my blinking 50 or so lights.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,40.6726,-74.7474

The light was coming from the oject and not a reflection of the moon or stars.  I ran to the window but it was out of sight being too late to get another look.

The aircraft was going in a north to south direction, very high and I followed it for a few seconds with my binoculars.  My first thought was that a piece of the aircraft had come off and was falling to earth.  I dismissed this notion as the two objects were seemingly not related.  I tried to find the white object but was not successful.  I then ran back into the house for my silva compass and plotted the direction of decent as South 84 degrees East (declination of 20 degrees).

The sky was clear and the stars were out (34 degrees F), with no wind nor clouds.  The 1/4-1/5th moon (a sliver of light) was in the west, the direction to the object was to the east.  The object is not the moon and is too large to be stars.  I dismiss the object as a meteroite (previously seen meteroites) as the rate of decent was too slow.

It came straight down and looked like it touched the ground and then disappeared. No noise could be heard...nothing...it appeared out of no where and disappeared as quickly as it appeared. About 21:00 I went out to look and see if there was anything in the sky or in the pasture as our outside dogs were barking. I noticed off in the distance what appeared as some sort of a sparkling blueish-green, yellow, red shape hovering over our town. I called my daughter and we both stood there in the window watching the almost star like looking object (same color my daughter reported seeing) flicker in color as if the colors were going around the shape and twinkling. It was very noticeable to the naked eye that they were colors and what ever it was was stationary. Over to the right and out and up from our past! ure in the sky was a amber/redish looking glowing object as well. This one did not flicker or change colors. It remained a redish glow. Both objects are above our town...not as far out as a star....but distinguishable with the naked eye. Not really sure what it could be other than a UFO possibly. I would love to know if anyone else reported it.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,45.8629,-112.2454

Saw to SE (over neighbor's house) object, about 30 degrees elevation, first thought it was aircraft with landing lights. Single bright light, orange/red similar to color of sodium lights moving slowly toward me (moving to the north west). Light was flickering irregularly but not blinking in a pattern, no other color lights seen. No sound from object, closing from ~ 4nm to 2nm (estimated based on ceiling and elevation, ""2nm"" being about 11,000' directly overhead). Single-engine propeller aircraft heard to the northwest, apparently over water, but not correlated to the object. Based on altitude of 11,000' (reported ceiling) speed credible for either jet or turboprop aircraft, not credible for balloon (too fast) or meteor (too slow). Also based on observation that object entered cloud cover from below and did not emerge from it, object assumed to be gaining in altitude throughout observation. Went inside to get binoculars (just inside front door) and 10-y/o daughter. Went back out, object still visible, now moving ""faster"" (probably same speed but closer), now clearly having turned perhaps 45 degrees to the left and moving toward the west. Nearly overhead, observed with binoculars, slowly disappeared into clouds. Still no sound. Not seen again. Flight path not consistent with Boeing Field or Seatac. McChord AFB possible but unlikely. Note: Both Weather Underground site (copied below) and Boeing Field report clear skies, but actually heavily overcast, altostratus. Weather Underground also reports light northerly wind, but actual observation was southerly at 5 knots. Daughter (10 years old), also had binoculars but was unable to get them out of case in time and only saw it with unaided eyes, descibes as ""a fireball in the sky, like a very very furry animal's tail, while the animal's tail was poofed up, like a very angry cat's tail"". Note: Daughter did not see object (she had been inside) until it was entering the clouds, I think this is what she means. Prior to that the object was a very distinct single source of light. Other than the fact that the object was not in a typical flight path, nothing about it's movement or speed seemed irregular for a conventional jet or turboprop aircraft. What was striking was it's coloration, and the fact that it was clearly flickering or flaring, but not ""blinking"" in any regular pattern. Also substantially brighter than conventional aircraft. Personal Background: Ex-Navy (navigation), captain US Merchant Marine, celestial navigation instructor, astronomy major in college (i.e., no, it wasn't Venus, a meteor or the ISS). Daughter is a typical ten-year-old, but has been stargazing with me since she was a toddler. Note: Your form asks for shape and number of ""craft"". I do not presume to know if this is a ""craft"" or a natural phenomenon or something else entirely.

I was taking my daughter home after work on this evening.  It was about 11:00 at night and we were sitting by her mailbox when we noticed lights down the road towards the rental property she lives in on a farm here.  The lights were small, much like backup lights on a car, so we just thought that it was her landlords working on a farm truck.  We sat by the mailbox and waited a minute or so for them to come out of the road.   When after a few minutes, the lights were still there, I pulled my car up closer to the lights.  As we approached them, they backed up into the hayfield.  I had my car window rolled down to listen, as the neighbors entrance, the first on the road  is where the lights were first-on the ground and their dogs were barking and crying and howling!   We didn’t hear any motor noises from the “farm truck” and wondered why it backed all the way to the back of the hayfield!   Then the two lights got bigger and brighter, though there was no beam.  As ! soon as we saw them rise up into the air, we knew it wasn’t our friends in any farm truck.  I speed up to catch up and the faster I went, the fast it went.  The , bigger now, lights went up and over the fence of the hayfield, across the farmers road, across the fence to the cow pasture and went along about 15 feet above the ground.  I was speeding at this point, faster than I would have ever driven down the road , maybe 25 mph, but couldn’t catch up.  It flew under some power lines and straight up into the air and behind  my daughter’s house where it “hung” there until we got into the lot in front of  her house. We sat in front of her house and looked up at the lights for about a minute, when they just “poof” went out, or the thing sped away.  We had both  front windows  of the car open by now and can verify that there was not a single sound  of any motor or of any power plant within the UFO.  And again, there was no beam of light coming in our direction or any other.  The lights were just there!  We found out the next day that our friend, the landlady of the farm had seen the lights when she came home, about 30 minutes before we did.  She saw it in the area, above the river, behind the house in about the same location that we had last seen it.  So we know that it had been hanging around for a much longer time than we saw it.

The lights were approx 500-1,000 feet above the ground.  This guess is based on my own personal experiences with flight lessons in which I was a pilot who flew under VFR only. What made me watch the lights was the fact that there were no navigational blinking lights as well as literally NO SOUND.  The craft flew over my house and it was at this time that I noticed it was not two but three white lights in a triangular shape. I wanted to run in and get my wife but did not want to miss out on what I was seeing.  This craft was very low and while directly overhead emitted a sort of haze around the lights.  I really believe that this object was not a conventional aircraft despite it heading in the direction of the Moline, IL airport. There has to be other people in the vicinity to have seen this.

Nothing was there, there was no sound, absolutely nothing was visible or could be heard. I scanned the flashlight beam all around and the horses were resting and did not appear disturbed.

I ran out of the tower with my NVG (night vision goggles).  As I got to the outside of the tower the object was gone.  I stared in the area and noticed that the object was coming out of a left bank turn heading towards me.  The mountains are about 2 miles away, and it floated over our Forward Observation Base (F.O.B.) in Afghanistan.   It stopped over our base and it spun around pointing north again it drifted west over a small village.  Just past the village, it stopped then it just shot over the northern mountains in a split second.  The object was 5 large lights in a V shape formation.  I could not see the object, due to the cloud cover, but you can tell that it was one solid object with 5 lights.  It was also very large as it hovered over the base, I can see that it was larger then the base!  In a war zone no military air craft are to fly with lights on, and I know all of our aircrafts.  Also, as the U.F.O was hovering over the base it was a windy night with gust of 30 miles.  It had stopped and it started again as it passed.

The best sightings I had were when I lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  My boyfriend and I were walking into the mall on night and I noticed an unusual light in the sky and we decided when we left the mall if it was still there we would go look for it.  When we came out it was still there but had moved slightly.  So we drove up to Hyde Park where the lookout spot is and could see a disk like object hovering above Santa Fe. The sightings I am reporting now are above Taneytown, MD.  I have not lived here long but since I have moved here I have been noticing different things.  Last winter I saw a falling object over a local park, it was too large to be a falling star.  I have noticed an object that travels parallel with a main road- the lighted object moves so slow it is almost not noticeable it is moving unless you are actually watching it. I have also noticed that around 9pm there is a light in the sky behind where we live.  To give an idea of the diameter; stars vs. ""the light""   it is like the stars are pin-heads and “the light” is a pencil eraser.  The light is not directly above me when I see it; it is off in the distance a bit. To show attempt to express the distance it travels within an amount of time; if you were to go on my back porch with a ruler and hold it up, the bottom of the ruler lined up with the roof top of the house-- the light starts out about 12 inches above the house diagonally behind us, then by 10pm the light is level with the chimney top of the same house.  Not sure how else to explain it.  The light is not directly above the house it is off in a distance.  Just using perspective to explain how it moves.  Also it does not move in a straight line – it slowly zigzags as it moves forward.  My friend and I went looking for it the other night but it was slightly cloudy out and lost it.  We a! re going to attempt it again on another night.  This light is out there every night – but I have not noticed it on rainy nights because I don’t go out there when it is raining. Earlier tonight I saw something in my peripheral vision above me out front.  It was a very large green glow shooting across the sky.  It was round in the front and it definitely was not a shooting star, if I would have held my fist in the air it would have been bigger than my fist.

March 21, 2009.  Approx. 8:30 pm EST in McMurray, PA 15317.  Overcast. Drove out of driveway and noticed 4 lights in the sky that were revolving in a large circle.  Initially thought someone was having a party with strobe lights, but the temp was only about 50 degrees F.  and there was no party outside.   The four lights were revolving in a circular pattern parallel to the ground, but not obviously attached to one another.  Sometimes two would join and revolve together while the other two continued the revolutions.  They were rarely perfectly symmetrical from one another revolving in a circle like shape.   Each orb was approximately 4’ in diameter. As I continued to drive slowly down our road the lights remained and moved ahead of me on the left side of the road over the houses and were approx. 5-6 stories high.  Before I got to the main road I wanted to find out what would happen if I stopped.  I turned off the car and radio and lights after opening the window to determine if I could hear anything.  The four lights/orbs remained in place circling above the houses near the end of my street – where I had stopped.  A few cars entered our subdivision and left it during the approx. 15 minutes I sat watching the lights, but the lights never varied or went away. I had to go to CVS to get medication for my husband and decided that I couldn’t wait any longer.  Started the car, went to the stop light and crossed to go south on Rt. 19.  The lights crossed ahead of me and were now on the right side of the road.  Due to lots of streetlights and business lights on Rt. 19 I was unable to see where the lights were and thought they might have disappeared.  When I arrived at CVS about  1 mile from home, the four orbs now were circling over the rear of CVS. I went inside, made my purchase and returned to my car – the orbs were still there circling.  I was tempted to call someone from CVS out to see the lights, but wanted to keep it to myself because it was so fascinating.  I returned home and could not see the lights on the return drive until I got to our subdivision again.  Again the lights were on the right side of the street (where they originally were when I went out).  When I pulled in my driveway I called my husband outside.  All I did was point to the sky and ask him what he saw.  He saw lights spinning and there were four. By now it was about 8:55 pm/20:55 and I wanted to find out if I could get any closer to the lights so walked toward my neighbors’ houses where the lights were.  They revolved in a clockwise messy circle (not attached to anything and not particularly round) and retained a constant speed.  I could not determine the exact color, but they weren’t bright enough to be white so I thought perhaps bright blue or green.  As I watched them and the clouds started to clear, I noticed that as a light/orb passed through clear sky, it virtually disappeared and reappeared once behind cloud cover.  There was no light on the ground (no flashlight effect) from them.  The color may have been blue since disappeared when passing through dark blue evening sky. As I moved forward down our street toward the lights, they moved forward as well and appeared to keep a distance of two house lots between me and them.  The clouds were breaking up and the lights disappeared more frequently with clear sky.  I went inside at about 9:05 to check on my husband and when I came back out at 9:15, the sky was clear and there was no sign of the lights.  Unfortunately I never thought to get my camera.

I noticed 2 objects in the sky to my right which were clearly NOT a natural phenomenon.  They looked so strange that I pulled over straight away to have a better look. The objects were spherical in shape and glowing a deep orange colour.  They were both in close proximity to each other but one looked to be higher than the other one as though they were flying in formation.  They weren't too high up - defiantly a lot lower than aeroplanes fly.  They looked to be travelling at helicopter speed, not as fast as planes usually fly. The objects passed over the top of my position.  As they came into view on my left side, they instantly sped up and quickly went out of sight. I had tried to get my mobile phone out to record the objects but by the time I thought about doing it the objects had sped up so I wouldn't have caught them in time. Due to the time it was a dark sky but quite clear.  There weren't many clouds in the sky though the objects would still have been visible in thick cloud as they were well below cloud level. If you look on Google Earth, the exact location I was parked watching this was: M60 motorway, Manchester 53°32'25.23""N 2°12'57.70""W The objects were travelling from the direction of ""Middleton"" - a nearby town. They were travelling in a South Westerly direction towards ""Prestwitch."" I was travelling northwards hence the object passing from my right to my left.

Last night, March 2, 2009 between 1900 hours and 1920 hours, I observed a white flashing light in the south eastern sky about 45 degrees above the mountain.  I had left work late.  I first noticed the bright shining object as I started home on US Route 12.  I gave a casual glance at the sky, as I often do. The stars were visible.  When I first noticed the flashing object, I thought it was an airplane. As I continued driving south on Route 12, I continued to watch the object.  I noticed that it was not moving.  I then thought it might be a cell tower, but quickly realized that it was too high in the sky to be a tower. I lost track of the object as the road curved through the valley.  I spotted it once again as I turned onto Route 122.  It was still in the same spot. I was able to monitor its position in the sky by the other star formations present. I again lost sight of the object as I went down the mountain toward my home. As I turn onto the road to my house, I again spotted the object.  I had a good view, so I stopped my car and sat about 5 minutes observing the bright flashing object. It had not moved from its position in the sky from my first sighting about 20 minutes previous. As I watched, I glanced down at my clock.  When I looked up it was gone.  I searched the sky.  It was gone.  It disappeared in the flash. I am reporting this because I believe it is note worthy.  I often take time to observe the night sky.  I have observed the Sky Lab as it transverses the sky.  I have seen shooting stars.  I have observed many airplanes in the night sky.  This object was different than any thing I have observed. It was as bright as the brightest star in the sky.  It was as large as Mars or Venus in the winter sky.  It appeared more oblong than round.  It was flashing very fast.  It was stationary.  It disappeared in an instant. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I looked to the South toward the Oregon City area. I then spotted 4 small silver objects in the sky, they were moving fast from the South to the North, above the 205 freeway. Estimated altitude was 2500 to 3000 ft. They were flying together, but not in straight and level flight. They were moving up and down and weaving in and around each other. The objects were flying at the bottom of some low clouds, sometimes visible and sometimes hidden in the clouds. After viewing them for 15 seconds I grabbed my Nikon 12 x 50 binoculars from just inside the patio door. I was able to view them again for another 30 seconds before they were out of view. I was able now to see more detail. They were round circular flat objects, which appeared to taper down from the center to a fine sharp edge. I was not able to see any lights or windows, because of my distance from the objects. The diameter of the objects is difficult to determine but I think they probably were less than 50 ft in size.

The darker image was a tall row of trees that sit to the west of the house, about a quarter mile away.  The object was a considerable distance away, yet visible. I didn’t think anything of it because I thought it was a star at first.  I was watching a movie with my son, and my peripheral vision caught it yet again, minutes later. It was now hovering slightly lower. I thought again that I was making this up, when I would glance at the television, and minutes later I noticed it was now only visible through the tree limbs.  I asked my son to take a look, noting where to look and asked him to tell me what he saw. He said he saw a silver light, sometimes flashing and sometimes not.  There was no sunlight at this time, so it could not have been a reflection of light off of some craft like a plane, or blimp, etc. We went outside and looked with the binoculars to get a closer look. This was now some 20 minutes from the 1st notice of this object.  As we looked with our own eyes, and then with the binoculars, we noticed it wasn’t a star. Now, we had a few stars out so that we could make a comparison. The object was probably 10+miles off to the west, near the city of Tampico.  The object disappeared behind some dark clouds. It was gone out of sight about 715pm. I went onto the internet to see if there had been any UFO sightings in Yakima.  I was amazed to see how many there were. This is another to add.

The blimp then slowly halted and remained stationary for 30-40 seconds.Then in awe I observed the blimp roll on its side and slowly 'peel off' over school/college/office buildings. I beleive that at this point the blimp climbed at 15-20m/s perfectly vertically and disappeared into the cloud covered sky. I had drunk two pints of lager, but I believe that what I saw was not imaginary.  I was within 400 meters of the blimp and although I was in a poorly lit street, the internal illumination made it look just like a blimp with a thin non-metal skin.

I tried to get closer, but as I got closer they started to fly further and further away. I had my video camera with me and I tried my hardest to at least get some video, but I could not. I drove after them but I lost them. About 15 minutes, I saw a single light pulsating like crazy. I pulled out my camcorder that was turned on, but it some how turned off by itself so I had to turn it back on. As I drove toward that UFO, it flew away as well.

On the night of March 3, 2009 at 8:45pm I witnessed something unexplainable along with a friend.  I first witnessed the light while I was on the way to a friend’s house from the coffee shop that is about 1 mile away.  To get to and from the two location I generally take the back roads cutting through the neighborhoods and this time while I was looking into the northern sky I saw a light that I dismissed to be a planet that must have been visible in the night sky and I had the intention of looking up what planet it could have been.  As I was driving through the neighborhood I was constantly losing and regaining sight of the light and after about 15 seconds it was gone which I thought was weird because it previously appeared to be in a constant position in the sky.  About a half mile down the road I proceeded to turn to the south and the object or at least an identical one appeared in the southwest region of the sky, this time the object was high enough that I didn’t lose sight of it all the way to my friends house another fourth of a mile down the road.  Once I pulled into to the street he lives on I proceeded to get out of the car and look up at the object which now was directly south of me at this point.  I stared at the object for 10 seconds trying to imagine what it could be but I had no idea then another friend pulled up and got out of his car asking me what I was doing just standing out in the cold so I told him to look up at the light.  We both gazed at it for 15 seconds then it started to move towards us at a fairly fast pace and once it was about halfway to us the light turned off and the object whatever it may have been was gone, there was no sound the entire time just the light.  We both stood there completely in awe at what had happened scanning the sky trying to find the object assuming it would reappear and after a minute or so we went inside not knowing what we had just saw. 	On the same night three hours later at 11:45pm there were three of us in the car coming from the Wendy’s which is right next to the coffee shop that we were at before the previous incident and when we first headed there I looked into the sky hoping to see something but of course there wasn’t anything but the stars.  But on the way back all three of us saw the object again in almost the same place as before only a couple miles further south and maybe 1,000ft higher in the sky.  We watched it wondering what it was for about 20 seconds then it proceeded to move to the west for 5 seconds and suddenly changed direction and headed to the south east at an incredible rate of speed.  It was gone from sight in less than a minute and now all three of us were amazing at what we had seen but still no explanation. 	The object was larger and brighter than anything in the sky, the moon wasn’t visible during either sighting.  The object itself was easily 10 to 15 times bigger than planes that fly at that altitude and distance away if not larger.  And it was going 10 times faster than any other planes in the sky.  This was something that I cannot explain and would have never have imagined seeing with my own eyes.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,42.3738,-87.944

I want to share this with you. Yesterday, 03/04/2009, Wednesday, I was on my way to work. I was east of Neosho, MO, between Netonia, MO, and the MO hwy 86 and US 60 and MO 59 junctions. The exact time was 3:10 a.m.  The sky was clear and I could see stars.   As I passed East Newton High School on hwy 86 I looked in my review mirror and noticed two amber lights approaching me fron behind.  The lights approached me at a steady pace and then back off to keep distance between me and the amber lights. At first I thought someone was coming up on me without head lights on and just had their parking lights on.  As I had this thought, the amber lights came up behind me again this time very fast, I then tapped my breaks and slowed some.  I watched in my review mirror as I did this. My tail lights then illuminated the outline of what appeared to be a wedge shaped object behind me and the two amber lights where in the bottom front of it and the bottom front was wedge shaped like the front of a snow plow. I then sped up to 90 mph to get away and the object then dropped back about 10 car leangths. As I approached the intersection of MO rt H and hwy 86 the object was once again on my rear bumpper , with the amber lights glowing.The speed at wich it approached me was AMAZING. It was right behind me and a amber hugh then engulfed the car on the inside. As I looked in my review mirror I observed the amber lights on the front of the object look as if they shuddered. I could feel heat on my neck, arms,face, and back.I could also hear a very distinct humming sound. I continued to drive 80 and 90 mph until I approached a curve in the highway. when I hit my brakes hard and slowed for this curve.The craft then dropped back again and the amber hugh then left my car. As I went around the curve I observed the craft leave the road behind me and travel diagonal to the southwest from my position across a vast open field, but the amber lights were still facing my direction. The object was now about 150 yards to my left. It was now about treetop high.  The craft then continued facing my direction with the amber lights facing me and started moving to the southeast and climbing slowly as it did.  The craft then paused in mid air, turned were the amber lights now faced the northeast and shot up at an angle to the northweast horizon.  When the craft went to the northeast it was a very bright flash of amber light and a silver streak.  If I would have blinked I would have missed it.  That is how fast it left.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,36.8541,-94.399

I first saw a strange light in the sky that very much looked like an approaching helicopter.  It caught my attention because it was orange, where usual helicopters have a white glow.  I stared at it for a few seconds and then it started dropping smaller white lights, and my first reaction was that it was dropping bombs.  I didn;t think it was a UFO at this point, I thought it was an army helicopter or other army aircraft.  I left my room to go get my mom;s camera and returned with her and the camera only to find that the mysterious orange light was gone.  I looked throughout all the windows in the house, it was nowhere in sight.  I thought about it and brushed it off as a helicopter dropping flares because it was the only logical explanation I could come up with.  This was at approximately midnight on March 27, 2010. About an hour later, I woke up and my window was still open.  It was then I saw that the smaller crafts that were dropped were all clustered and flying around in unusual patterns in the North West sky out of my window.  I looked at them for four hours and couldn't figure it out.  I'm positive that they were what came out of the orange glowing craft.  They would fly diagonally, horizontally, vertically, and make turns that couldn't possibly be made by any aircraft here on Earth.  I seen them appear from point A to point B.  There was no trace of light as they flew because it was so fast.  They, like the orange UFO, were silent.  I watched them from 1:00 AM to about 5:00 AM then I thought I had enough and shut the blinds and tried to sleep.  I didn't see when, or if, they left, but I did hear a loud and unusually low jet fly by a little before sunset that woke me up.  I checked, and didn't see them anymore after that. The orange UFO was high in the open sky, and the white smaller ones were unusually lower than the mountain range that is outside my window.  Both the crafts looked like simple circular lights.  It was an extremely windy night so the sky was clear. I don't see how I could be the only one to see this, I'm sure others seen it as well.  It lasted for hours.

This object was observed while driving in residential area north of the University of Notre Dame. Weather was overcast and object was below the cloud deck. What at first appeared (and was assumed to be) a very large commercial aircraft took on a very different appearance upon closer inspection. An impressive display of flashing lights is what caught my eye. Green and red lights similar to standard aviation craft were seen...however these were arrayed in larger numbers, particularly the red lights. A deep fluorescent violet light began to shimmer at one point along at least one edge of the object. As the object passed more overhead I could then see the bottom of it. On this aspect I could see a large bank of white lights (these were not bright white but had a somewhat warmer and yellow/orange tone) in a rectangular pattern. These somewhat shimmered and sparkled. The object was traveling due east at a steady but undetermined speed. My guess was that it was traveling at approximately 300 to 600 MPH (depending on the actual height of it). The object appeared to be quite large in that as it got further away, it did not really seem to diminish in size too much. On the other hand, it was below the cloud deck (the altitude of which I do not know), so sizing the object in that regard was not possible. I was driving alone and simply could not pull over in traffic to get a better look. There was a solid black background slightly visible behind these lights...so it was almost assuredly a solid structure that I was looking at. If I had to guess, my general impression was that the object had a somewhat triangular shape. The size of the object by pure general impression, would have been approximately the size 1 to 4 times the size of a Boeing 747. I lost sight of the object behind trees. The type of lights on the object were shimmering (violet), flashing (red and green), steady (red and green) as well as the steady yellow white rectangular lights which had a shimmering to sparkling aspect to them as well. The object, while in my view, did not behave any differently than that of an aircraft except that I have never seen an aircraft which was lit up in this spectacular fashion.  Very interesting.

It did not have the symmetrical shape of a hot air balloon, nor did it seem like a parasail craft. It was about 1/4 the ""size of a full moon."" It looked to be dark blue, perhaps with some “cardboard brown” coloring—and no discernable markings. It had a cobbled-together appearance and if I was told it was a home-made craft, designed out of about a hundred card board boxes, and filled with helium I would think that was a viable possibility.

I don't know exactly how many there were at one time, because as the one on the end would fade out one on the opposite side would fade in at the same rate.  Last fall, if I remember correctly, my brother-in-law had seen this same thing and reported it the night he saw it.  He was contacted by someone about his report,  So he told me to report this right away.  My brother-in-law reported what he saw as very small and that he could hold his fist out in front of him and completely cover the lights.  However, what we saw was very large.  I could tell this because we have a large hill on our property and the lights spanned further then our hill did, if that makes sense.   It didn't seem to be moving in any particular direction, but the way that one light would fade and another would appear at the opposite end leads me to believe that it was spinning or rotating.

Just before pulling into my sister's driveway in rural area in southern Oregon, we spotted 3 distinctly ""pumpkin orange"" roundish lights hovering, and thinking at first, that they may have been glowing ash from a pile of burning leaves, we realized as soon as my car was stopped that was not the case.  We simultaneously asked each other what the heck they were?  At first I thought they were well-lit hot air balloons, but hot air ballons don't maneuver like these objects did.  I parked my car about 50 yards from the house, asked her to go get someone to see this--she went next door, two other women joined us-also wondering what was happening.  The objects were moving in a kind of ""chase me"" pattern (in a circle) pretty much above our heads (hard to tell how high), there was absolutely no sound.  The objects seemed to occasionally give off a thin beam, first one, then another--no pattern to it at all.  They moved slowly, then sped up, turning effortlessly.  They appeared to be roundish, somewhat ""glowing"", and sometimes stood perfectly still,  sometimes gliding for a short distance, then coming back around to where the four of us stood.  After about 12 minutes, one of the objects went south, very very slowly...the other two went in a northwesterly direction, sometimes stopping and dropping what appeared to be large sparks from either the top or bottom.   The object that was headed south, kind of pulsated for about 7 minutes, then was simply gone.  The two headed NW would stop, start, ascend, descend, appear to come back, then go NW again.  The way they maneuvered was not like anything I had seen before.  After they ""dropped"" the sparks, they moved farther away at a very slow rate, then one blinked completely out, and about a minute later, so did the last one.  I had not ever experienced any sighting this close, this clear in my life.  I enjoy watching tv shows about UFO's but never really saw something I could not explain.  My sister, who is very down to earth (excuse the pun) and rational,! was als o mystified.  I was a bit scared, most likely due to the unknown nature of whatever it was.  The other two ladies that saw these objects were good, solid citizens, not taken to drinking (none of us had anything stronger than lemonade prior to this sighting), and pretty reliable.

There was next to no daylight left at this time, just a dusky orange in the west horizon.  Just before entering the park, I observed two jets high overhead, I always have a look at jets when I hear them just because they interest me.

About twenty to thirty yards after I strolled into the park I looked to the south sky about 40 degrees up and I saw a very bright, white light.  I would say its size was 3 to 4 times the size of Venus (of which I could compare as it was in the sky that night also).   The light reminded me of magnesium burning, that king of intensity, but not so much that it would hurt your eyes.  It appeared to me to move in my general direction (northwards) with a slight turning motion, again very bright and very white.  This lasted for maybe 5 seconds before it looks that it turned sharply westward, once it did that its light lost all intensity and appeared then to be a very faint white light.   It was not long (again maybe 5 seconds) before I could not see it at all.  Its motion throughout this observation struck me as craft like.   I have observed stars, planets, aircraft, meteors and comets in the skies before.  This object was truly unique. On a side note, my brother is camping at a nearby lake (40-50 miles away).

The light could only be described as brighter than a star, white, constant (not flashing) there was no noise from it, the sky was clear as we could see other star’s behind it, it was bright in the dark night sky and it moved in a straight line at a constant speed, then it reduced in brightness at the same speed it fell. This all happened in approx 10mins at 22.10approx, it seemed to disappear over the Cannock/Walsall area. It wasn’t a plane or helicopter because I have been interested in aviation from a young child, and know the characteristics of them. Thank you for taking the time to read this",2008-08-12T00:00:00,,

Last night at approximately 1:30am, I was lying in bed, looking out the window. I saw a small flashing white light in the sky. It was a white dot and appeared to be quite small &/or far away. At first I just assumed it was an airplane...we live on a US military base and seeing planes is very common. However, after a few minutes I realized the light wasn’t moving. It was just hovering in one place, flashing. About 20 minutes from my house there is another military base. That base is a major US Air Force base and has a huge flight line. From my bedroom window I can clearly see the glow of the lights on that flight line. The object I saw appeared to be hovering directly above the flight line. The dot of light mainly stayed white, but occasionally it would change to white at the bottom and red at the top. It flashed the entire time I watched it. About three or four times, it changed shape from a dot into a short straight vertical line. After about 20 or 30 minutes of watching it, it started flashing slower and 3 very tiny white flashing lights came out from it. They came out one at a time and sped off. They each came out of the “light” in a different place (the first on the left, the next on the right, and the last at the top) and they each went off in a different direction (they shot quickly in a straight line from where they came out). My husband witnessed the object also, but he did not witness the 3 small ones. I kept watching the object for an hour or so, whereas he lost interest and stopped watching after only about ten minutes. My husband and I are both very level-headed, educated people. I am a housewife and mother, a former CNA, and am currently a mortuary student. My husband is an active duty military service member. We do not have a fascination with UFO’s and have never claimed to see anything like this before. Apparently other people witnessed it as well though, because I got online today looking for answers about what it was and found a video posted online by someone in a nearby area that was recorded last night.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,,

It wasn't too hot so I decided to sit out there and enjoy the sky, trees, garden, birds etc.  I had the rocker reclined a little bit and I had true polarized $20.00 pair of sunglasses on.  It was ten minutes after 6:00 pm this evening.  The Sun was up where the big tree is behind the storage barn and the tree was almost blocking the Sun which was partially behind the leaves and high clouds which enabled me to be able to look at the sky without the glare of the hot Sun drilling down this time of year.  This is when I saw it.  The UFO was very high at least 5 miles high,  the same height that the higher passenger jets fly.  It was arrow shaped and black and it was slightly larger than this carrot character     `    .  It traveled slowly threw the sky and it wasn't a bird or a jet.  It flew steady and slow and was shaped like an arrow head.  It traveled from west-southwest to the east-northwest.  I ran in the basement up the steps to grab my 12+ zoom Panasonic zoom camera in the dining room.  I ran back down to the patio and realized I needed my reading glasses so that I could see the settings on the dial on the camera.  I ran back up to the kitchen and grabbed them and then ran back down to the patio.  When I looked up I realized that I had left my polarized sunglasses on the kitchen table.  Without the polarized sunglasses the glare from the Sun was too great and I could not look up.  I ran back up to the kitchen and grab my polarized sunglasses and then ran back down to the patio again.  Sat back down in the chair put on my reading glasses so that I could see the icons on the camera dial.  Then I took the reading glasses off and placed my sunglasses back on and there it was.  As soon as looked back up where I saw the UFO to aim the camera it had vanished.  Damn, I saw it and it was there and I was going to zoom in on it and take photos.  I think it was a government type of aircraft and not an alien UFO.  I think the way the Sun was behind the high thin clouds and the tree leaves partially blocking the Sun and the polarized sunglasses that somehow had enabled me to see it.  Think they have discovered a way to bend light waves or absorb them it such a way that the aircraft can be rendered invisible to the human eye for the most part, at least that is the impression I got from the perspective that I was able to see it.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,,

I would like to report some unusual sightings I and my family had on July 30 and 31 in Marshfield MA. Both sightings occurred near a beach house we had rented which was directly on the beach. The objects sighted were identical. The first sighting occurred perhaps one hour after dark, around 9:00 or 10:00 p.m. My wife and I were lying in bed when I happened to get up and look out the window. What I saw was passing the house heading out toward the water at a right angle to the wind. I brought my wife’s attention to it, my stepson who was outside at the time also saw it. It was moving rather slowly and was about 75 feet above the ground. The best way to describe its appearance was that it looked something like the tea candles people place on their driveways for decoration, when they take and place a candle inside a brown paper bag. It was glowing orange and seemed like it was flickering like a fire would, it made no sound, and moved slowly. I don’t remember if we watched it till it disappeared or just went back to bed, but we watched it for some minutes. The next night I was curious as to whether or not it would re-appear and so I went out about the same time. I again saw the same phenomenon out over the ocean, once again it was a flickering orange glow. I went into the house and informed my wife, stepson, and stepdaughter that it was back, they all came out to watch it. We couldn’t tell if it was moving or not, this time it was some distance from us, and so was perhaps brighter than the previous nights object. After a few minutes it faded from view. The next night I again went outside about the same time to see if it would re-appear. It didn’t, but I saw airplanes from the near Boston airport, fireworks that people were setting off, campfires on the shore, and distant lightning from a storm. None of these were what we saw, but what the objects most closely resembled were the campfires, except, of course, the objects we sighted were in the sky. I have never seen anything like this before, nor have I ever had an interest in ‘ufos”, since seeing these objects I spoke to locals who couldn’t tell me what they were, and I also searched on internet to identify them. I was surprised to see numerous reportings of  similar objects, including the report here from Mackey on July 4th in Indiana, I have also seen videos of similar objects. I had never heard of such objects prior to our sightings.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,42.0918,-70.7056

But the strange movement caught both of our eyes.  All of a sudden, it turned and moved very slowly in our direction and flew directly over us.  As we looked up, it didn't appear to resemble the shape of a helicopter, but almost like a giant oblong boat.  Although it was night and we couldn't see it clearly, there didn't appear to be any helicopter-like propellers.  I would have to say that the lights were probably consistent with that of a helicopter.  Nonetheless, it scared the be-jesus out of the both of us.

As we stood there watching the object, it would repeat the pattern I had seen previously, and would also move from left to right and then right to left in a! matter of seconds.  He was amazed also and said he could not figure out what it was.  I then said we were looking at a ufo. Since it was hovering in the sky about 5 – 10 miles away, we decided to go about a mile down the road where there is open land and observe the object. As we sat there watching, we noticed over a period of 30 minutes, 3 other aircraft moving across the sky and I pointed out to my husband the difference between those aircraft and the object we were observing. The object started moving to our right slowly and was descending slightly as it was moving.  We noticed the lights were only white then. From the pattern of the moving lights before when it was somewhat stationary, we concluded the object was circular in shape. Whenever the object stopped and moved in a zig-zag pattern, I noticed what look like exhaust coming from it. It was hard to tell because it was, we concluded around 5-10 miles away from us.
