It was around 8:00 PM and the sky was a dark blue, but not yet completely black.  I was lying on the couch watching TV when I heard an eerie sound coming from outside.  The sound was similar to the hydraulic sound made by a garbage truck when it is compacting garbage.  My mother who was in the room with me walked over to the backyard deck to investigate the sound.  Her voice sounded frightened as she yelled, ""Come here quick!  Triangle!  Triangle"";  I was a bit confused, but I got up and looked into the south sky where she was pointing.  There I saw an object in the sky that I have never seen before.  The object was a large, black, equilateral triangle with rounded corners flying horizontal in the sky.  The best analogy of its shape would be to take a sheet of black Styrofoam two inches thick and cut it out like a cookie cutter using a rack from a billiard table.  On each of the three rounded corners, there was a red, glowing light.  Unlike an electric light, this red light had a larger diameter and a uniform glow- like a glowing ball of gas.  On the underside of the vehicle, there was a very large diameter (about 20ft) white light, which appeared to be recessed.  The light was very bright, but did not illuminate what appeared to be the matte black finish of the object itself.  I witnessed no flashing lights of any kind on the object.  .  Based on my proximity to the object, I would estimate that each of the three sides on this object was 90 to 100 ft. long.  The object was flying north and coming straight toward our house.  At no point was the object more than 40 ft. above the tree line.  Approximately 100 ft. before reaching our house, the vehicle made a sharp left turn without banking (staying perfectly horizontal) and proceeded west.  The object then began to descend slightly and disappeared from view over the tree line.  The noise it created faded away second! s later. 	 	     After the object disappeared from sight, we stayed out for about five minutes to see if we could get another glimpse of it, but it did not return.  We called the non-emergency number for our municipality but all we got was a recorded message.  We considered calling the police, but my father insisted that we don't because of all the paperwork that would be involved and for fear of ill gossip and public opinions in our community.  I know that if the situation were reversed, I would probably think that a person who claimed to see such an unusual object were either crazy or they misinterpreted what they saw.   For eighteen years I lived very close to Chicago's Midway Airport and for the last three years I have spent countless hours at the airport as limousine driver.  I have seen every type of flying machine imaginable.  The object I witnessed that night was unlike any object I have ever seen or heard.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,,

A distance of about 4 miles of country road.  We saw what appeared to be a chinook type helicopter hovering about 3-400 feet over a swampy area about 1-200 yards off the road.  An area I was quiet familiar with from hunting game in many times since my grandparents farm bordered this area on the North.  I remarked to my wife that this was indeed strange to see this sight and couldn't imagine what it could possibly be doing hovering there.  We got up opposite the craft on the highway, a somewhat remote country road and came to a halt.  We could clearly see what appeared to be rows of window lights and some colored lights like aircraft normally have at night (red etc).  I shut off the engine and lights and asked my wife to lower the window.  She complied and then the hair stood up on my neck because there was absolutely NO noise from this hovering craft 200 yards away.  I was shocked.  My military familiariety with helicopters told me that what we were seeing was definately real, and not a helicopter.  We were scared at what the craft might be, thinking UFO all the time.  I started the truck, peeled out, all the time my wife keept an eye on the craft.  We were only about 1/2 mile from our house and had a clear view even as we got out and into the house. I looked out of the East window of the kitchen, still viewing the craft and  I immediately called my parents who would be in direct line if the craft moved Easterly which it began doing. My parents ran outside of their house to see it but saw nothing.  It moved slowly Easterly for a few seconds then disappeared and was not seen again.

Essentially, a three month summer camping trip turned into a year and a half camping trip. Anyway...I'll be brief in describing what I saw. I was about eight years old at the time. My father, mother, a coworker, and I were standing around my father's truck. My mother noticed an object traveling at a high altitude moving from east to west. She pointed it out to the rest of us because we normally didn't see many planes flying out in that area. However, confusion set in when the object stopped in mid-flight and held its postion for what seemed like two or three minutes. Then, without warning, it shot straight-up and disappeared from view. As that occured...several obvious military jets appeared on the horizon (east and west) and converged on that point where the object left from and circled around. The military jets then left as quickly as they came. The sense that we all got was that the jets were chasing this object, whatever it was. The next day, my mother called the nearest airforce base (I believe it was Luke). They basically told her that they didn't have any aircraft in the area. I saw two other objects during my stay near Prescott...please refer to cigar shaped and fireball. NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Man and son are approached on the highway by a cigar-shaped craft with windows along its side.,Barstow,CA,1977-06-15T01:00:00,,,"Occurred : 6/15/1977 9:40:26 AM 01:00 Reported: 10/29/2001 10:56 Posted: 11/20/2001 Location: Barstow, CA Shape:  Duration:",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20003.html,"     I am a 55-year-old male with no ambitions of notoriety and certainly not a prankster of any kind.  I simply feel the story I have to tell should be discovered by those who study such things (in a scientific way). You see I feel it might be important because ""it's different "".  What I saw and the way I saw it, seems not to bear any similarity to all the other things I've ever heard about sightings in the general media.  It's not a subject I study; moreover, what I know is not material. WHAT HAPPENED WAS REAL!       It happened over twenty years ago in 1977 as my son (then about 10) and I were traveling by car from Alabama to California.  I'm sure I might have been tired, for I had made that 2,000 mile trip many times over the years, but never without getting tired somewhat.  No, I wasn't "" dreaming "" or "" hallucinating "" or anything likes that.  With the experience I had making that trip, I knew when to rest and never to push myself to such a dangerous degree of instability; remember I HAD MY SON WITH ME.         It must have been after midnight, as we were fifteen miles north of Barstow.  I was driving a moderate speed of 50-55.  It was one of those beautiful nights of perfect weather.  The stars were bright without a single visible cloud in the sky, unlike the soon to be Los Angeles.  Being more reminiscent of my birth home in Alabama, I was particularly alert with my surroundings.  Enjoying it all with my driver's side window down; not knowing if I might ever see such a perfect night again.  The silhouette of the far off mountain range was very visible against the sky.  Even the nearer hillsides were visible with the outlines of trees and shrubbery.  THEN IT HAPPENED!       To my left I noticed the frontal approach light of an airplane.  Advancing from a ninety-degree angle, the light was pretty bright.  I know the distance of approach lights can be very deceiving in the night sky, but this light was near.  I had worked on the flight line and runway while in the Air Force and I had observed this very distinctive look many times at night.  It was much the same kind of light anyone might see around an airport except this one seemed to be heading straight for us.  The stars shone bright under and all around "" it "" as there wasn't a single cloud for reflection.  "" The light "" was definitely airborne.  I could see it was descending, as the space between “it” and the mountain range grew narrower.  Was it a private plane landing at a private runway? Was it a helicopter? Is there an airport near? Where are the ground approach lights? It seemed to quietly get nearer and nearer as I could detect no sound while it continued to descend.  With the relation of "" it's "" speed to mine plus perceived distance, whether illusion or not, "" the light "" appeared to be on A COLLISION COURSE WITH ME!       Not acting irrational, but with an instinct of self-preservation, I began to rapidly slow down.  Glancing down at the speedometer, it was showing 20- 25 miles per hour.  Looking back to my left, "" the light "" appeared as though it had slowed down its descent.  My perception was that “the light” and I were about to reach the same place at the same time!  I shifted and gave it the gas! The fuel-injected sports car I was driving was fast. As I glanced down again, I saw I was doing 80.  When I looked back at "" the Light "", I was shocked.  "" The Light "" had sped up! Definitely on the same collision course as if it was  ""locked-in"" or using me in some way.  In the next moment, ""the light"" dropped below the outline of the horizon and reached ground zero.  In the rough terrain approximately fifty yards from me, just over the other side of the road, "" the Light "" made a ninety degree left turn while traveling exactly 80 miles per hour.  It was now moving parallel to me at the exact same speed.  "" The light "" illuminated forward no more than about twenty feet, while lighting up the closest shrubbery in front of the it.  There was now the outline of an object behind  ""the Light "".  The rounded cigar shaped object could have been anywhere from twenty to fifty feet in height, for I could not determine how far the terrain might dip below the adjoining roadside.  There were six to eight small square windows visible down the near side with even spacing.  Each window had an off-white lightning, much the same as you might see from your own house while outside at night.  Toward the front of the craft, there were two obstruction type lights, one red and one blue/green.  I was unable to see any outline of the rear of the craft; but what I could see, covered about fifty linear feet.  The object now made a distinctive sound like I've heard before.  It was the sound of a turbine.  A turbine and jet engine may sound similar to some but as I have been around both many times, there is a distinct difference.  After it traveled along side of me about a half mile, it began to slow.  It appeared to be stopping as I KEPT DOING 80!        After traveling another five miles down the road, I felt I must have been nearing the outskirts of Barstow.  I could see an industrial plant or factory up ahead.  The lit blaze of a tower or smokestack was very evident yet over a mile away.  It looked no different than what most people may have seen around such factories.  I believe I've heard it referred to as a"" Burn-off "".  As I drove nearer, I could see there was more than one stack or tower.  Behind one blaze was another blaze. Closer to the blazes it started to become apparent that something seemed strange.  There were no stacks or towers beneath the blazes. The stars and sky were the only things between the blazes and the hillside.  Even closer now, the blazes began to take on a definite shape.  They were round; they were perfectly round, like "" fireballs "".  After arriving parallel to the "" fireballs "".  I decided to stop and observe.  There was a convenient clearing to the right of the road.  The clearing was large enough to allow me to back in and observe comfortably. Seemingly five hundred yards or so off the road and perhaps one to two hundred yards above the ground, still shining and flickering above the horizon outline with stars beneath them, were three "" fireballs "" of the same diameter, at equal spacing from each other, appearing to be of equal distance from the ground.  One would extinguish or go out and then come back on.  Then another would do the same, but with no apparent pattern to length of time for staying off or on; never knowing which one would one would go out next.  Could these be flares of some kind? Was this some kind of military exercise? After all, some kind of craft just landed back up the road.  But what kind of craft could make a ninety-degree turn at 80 miles per hour? Especially not straight at someone like that thing did to me, right? We could have been killed! The strangest thing about these "" fireballs "" to me was the way they would always be in the same place when they came back on.  Never changing in height above the ground or distance apart, they always maintained the same diameter and perfect round shape.  They certainly couldn't be swamp gas.  They had to be controlled by an intelligence of some kind.  What kind of technology would it take to control these things the way THEY WERE BEING CONTROLLED?        After observing almost an hour, I believed I wasn't going to see anything any different.  Leaving the strange lights, I drove on to our destination without further incidents, except for one thought----right before seeing "" the light "", I remember seeing the headlights of another automobile in my rearview mirror about three-quarters of a mile behind me.  From then until I stopped to observe the "" fireballs "", I saw no turn-off on that road.  You know, that car never did catch up to me. . . . .",2001-11-20T00:00:00,34.9688,-116.99344363636364

It was late afternoon to early evening.  The object drifted over the city from the SW to NE.  It had the shape of a cigar box. or a shoe box. It looked metalic.  I recall thinking that it looked like a large floating heat duct and could not reconcile what I was seeing. It had no lights, no sound (but it was at a distance), and no apparent propulsion.  It drifted over a bank of clouds that I would estimate to be higher than two or  three thousand feet.  It may have had a ""X"" marking faintly visible on its underside. This did not fit the flying saucer image. It must have been quite large, perhaps twice as large as a box car or larger. I was an Air Force Pilot at the time and did not report it for fear of some form of reprisials or ridicule. I saw it from the ground one evening while I was at home  I later asked quietly if there was someone who took such reports.  I was directed to a Lt. Col. who was quite open about other reports that he had been given but he said he had not heard of one of my description.  He said that none of the reports that he had heard amounted to anything other than unprovable observations and usually just lights.   His role on base was informal apparently.  I asked quietly among the other pilots over coffee etc. whether anyone was seeing anything and most said no. One said that they had been ""paced"" by a light once and one reported seeing a ""sacucer"" over a lake at home.  The pilots/aircrew were interested but apparently not seeing anything. I report this now years later as I am surprised that rectangles have been seen by others.  This was large. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) ... On the other hand, the sighting was real and just so odd.  I would have truely rathered to have seen  a conventional flying saucer.  What in the world did I see? Why was there not other reports?  This thing has to be big. Had my wife been 30 seconds sooner tothe door she would have seen it too.  One would think the shapes would be more consistent.

At this time I don't recall who actually saw it first; however, what I saw was basically triangular or ""an arrow"" in shape. It was heading in a Northerly direction. It had a series of lights on both sides (window shaped?)in two rows, over and under. They were somewhat rectangular. When it passed over (not directly over) I noticed the back had what appeared to be a series of lights moving towards the center from the outer ends. This was continuous. The underside (if memory serves) had I believe three lights. equally spaced. I also recall that it made no audible sound. At least non that we or I could hear. At first we thought it was some kind of a plane; however, once it got closer it became obvious that it was no plane that any of us had ever seen. We were also no where near an Air Force Base. The closest was Pease which was about a two hour drive east. I hope that this is of interest. I never gave it mush thought after that until recently. I read a few articles on the internet and it reminded me of the occurance. All the best. Regards ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate in 1977))",2001-11-20T00:00:00,,

I observed it for two nights through a small telescope. My neighbor inquired about what I was doing. I pointed out the object. We then used his more powerful binoculars. The object was a single color (as like just plain metal, no lights, etc.). The third night we were again observing it when several small flashes appeared underneath it. About 5 minutes later, a silver ball shaped object dropped straight down through the broken clouds, executed a right angle turn and moved off to the east. The second ball moved to the north-east, the third and fourth to the south. It is interesting to note that I was able to train the binoculars on one of the balls. It looked like a ball bearing or a pinball machine ball, chrome-like, no lights, window or other variations on the surface. I observed it going through clouds, leaving a trail of water vapor. The ground was covered with snow and the night was clear, so observation was about as perfect as it could be. My guess is around mach 1 with no sound or sonic boom. My neighbor said he would contact the Air Force. He was in his 40s, I in my late teens, so that seemed logical. I didn't see him for a few days.

Being fully awake, I lay looking out the window and noticed a REALLY bright star in the sky to the left of the church steeple. I then realized this was too far north to be a planet. I waited awhile thinking it could be a plane but after 5 minutes it hadn't move. I then woke up my husband and we got out our Canon Binoculars and what we saw gave us both wicked goosebumps! The easiest way to describe it is that it looked like a wedding ring - there was one bright white light in the middle with dimmer lights on each side. There was a definite distinctive dark band separating the lights. IT NEVER moved for the 25 minutes we watched it - we don't know how long it was there before 3:40 AM. During this time the light intensity varied. At 4:07 AM - it just got dimmer and dimmer and ""went Out"" - still having never moved in relation to the steeple.

The object should have been visible over east-central Alabama and west-central Georgia as it continued its course. The eight adults who were present discussed the object for a while.  We decided that if the object were a meteor, then it would have disintegrated to some degree while visible to us.  Other logical explanations include the re-entry of a decaying satellite, booster rocket or some large mass of space junk coming back into our atmosphere. Weather conditions at the time: 72 degrees F, humidity 72 percent, dewpoint 68 degrees, wind calm, visibility 10 miles, skies were clear.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,33.2507,-86.9211

Was it an experiment? I had all but forgotten about it until one evening when I saw a woman on a UFO special.  She described a ship and showed a rough sketch of it.  It shocked me!  I got excited and began to jump around the room shouting, ""That's mine! That's mine! I saw that!""  My companion didn't know what to think of me and was quite incredulous. September, 1971 I was two months from my twentieth birthday.  I was in the habit of taking rather long walks, especially on mild and pretty autumn days as this one was.  I found myself walking along Main Street in Buffalo, in front of the State University of New York at Buffalo.  In those days, there was not yet a northern campus.  I was walking north on Main Street, nearing the front of Hayes Hall.  The sight of it is remeniscent of days when a stately appearance inspired respect in the viewer.  I was busy thinking to myself that there was no one anywhere to be seen.  A thing came flying west over Hayes Hall at a very low altitude, from the direction of Bailey Avenue on the opposite side of the campus.  What was it doing there?  This was not the airspace I would normally see aircraft use.  Was this an experiment of the University?  Was this a military experiment?  This was Sunday.  Niagara Falls was the direction the craft was flying, but why was it so low and who could be flying it?  There were no windows.  As I watched this thing in wonder, I was greatly surprised that there was NO SOUND!  This thing was just above the trees and there was absolutely no sound.  I saw a heat signature at the back of the craft, that somehow gave me a kind of reassurance that I might be watching something I could relate to ; something within my experience.  But there was no Sound.  None.  There was no audible competion on the street.  No traffic. No people.  Just me watching that thing fly fly low over the University, the trees, me, the street and the houses.  It flew directly over me.  It was shaped like an arrowhead without a stem.  It's color was green, like an Army jeep; a new, clean one.  This was why I thought it might have been a military experiment.  But it had no markings on it.  Not on its side, not on its bottom.  Just the green of a new jeep.  And no sound.  I got so freaked out I still don't remember how I got home that day.  I know it didn't take me long, even though I residence at that time was five to six ! miles aw ay on the corner of Eagle and Madison.  I was so excited relating this sighting to my mother that she had a rough time trying to calm me down.  It was a very disturbing experience.  It is still disturbing repeating it here.

The object moved very, very quickly, and silently. Upon reaching the southern shore of the lake, the object paused.

The object then retreated, due north, and vanished into the far reaces of the sky, perhaps outside the atmosphere. ast glimpses were of an object resembling a ""shooting star"".

One oserver phoed the base, was told no aircraft had landed or taken off from that AFB in three weeks, and, no, they hadn't seen any bright ight in the sky, but they'd let us know if they did.

Such launches are not necessarily announced either ahead of time, or even after the fact.  One of the first possibilities that should be ruled out is a test launch of a ballistic missile.  The Poseiden missiles, scheduled for deployment on the Trident submarines, may have been under testing during the mid-'70's, although this is just a guess.  PD))",2002-01-11T00:00:00,26.8595,-80.6362

I was facing north looking for the northern lights when I sensed movement behind me. There was a cigar shaped object traveling west to east and slightly downward. It dissapeared behind the treeline. I thought it was a falling star at first but then I realized it was moving much too slow and was not brightly lit. The more I thought about it the more I thought it must have been an UFO.

My sister and I were driving down Martindale Rd. between Canton, OH and Kent State University(Kent was our detination)That area at the time was sparsely poulated and was mostly farm land.  I remember looking up and seeing a bright light in the sky and saying to my sister that I did'nt remember that light. (It looked like it could have been the top of a tower but I had'nt recalled seeing a tower.) I don't know if what we saw next had any relationship to what I saw later. In the next minute or so and when we were a few miles just before rt.43 the encounter began.  A silent flying craft(disk shaped) with lights around the circumference began to follow the path of our car along the road and just above the telephone or electric lines to the left. I was driving and a little nervous.  My sister excitedly told me to stop the car.  But I was scared and refused.  When we arrived at rt.43 we had to stop and choose to turn left or right. As I prepared to turn right the craft went at an angle up and over the wooded area that was directly on the other side of rt.43. and disappeared behind the trees. I don't know if the object landed but the downward course of the direction it was going suggested that it was going to land.   Then I got brave, and decided to turn at the first side street off of rt.43. We waited briefly to see if it would go up again but it was starting to get dark and I wanted to get back home.  So our encounter with the object ended there.  I have never stopped thinking about the object and when I found this website I was hoping I would find other reports made in that area at the same time.  People tell us we must have seen a helicopter or an illusion etc. but nothing I have ever heard of fits the description of what we saw except for UFO's. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It moved so incredibly fast, without any sound, that it left a light trail in the sky for a few seconds.

I'm not positive of date, but know it was after the holidays, dead middle of winter, no moon but lots of bright stars against the black night sky.  I was taking a ""back road"" (i.e. proverbial dirt road, maybe 2 old cowboy jalopies and lots of cattle had used that week) to see my boyfriend; probably not the smartest thing for a young woman to do.   I was traveling north, on my right was a ridge about 100 ft. high that ran parallel to the road for about 1/2 mile, ending just past the road's sharp left turn to the west. (ridge was 1/4 mile away from road) This corner was known to be dangerous:  cattleguard, deep gravel, slightly on sloped angle, and narrow.   As I was slowing down for this corner, the radio started losing the signal (bunch of static) and car started sputtering, trying to die, then did.  (no previous car problems, just serviced, gas tank full).  Momentary panic, put my head down on steering wheel (who's going to find me & when?).   As I looked back up, I saw something coming over ridge.  I just sat there as it slid over the top coming closer to me, confused image of what I thought of as carnival lights - red, gold, white, bluish-green - all along outside edge of what seemed to be a triangle shape, lights running in fast ""chaser"" pattern (like popular Christmas lights 5-7 yrs. ago).   Also, just long enough for me to realize it was happening (and probably had been for a few seconds) there was a ""spotlight"" beam of bluish-white light traveling next to the passenger side of the car.  Beam went out; a few more ticks of what seemed suspended, unreal time with edge lights still blinking; shape rotated up about 30 degrees.  (that's when I realized it was chevron shaped, not triangular - I could see the stars between swept-back ""wings"")   It starting drawing away still on an angle until it was about 250 ft. up, then *poof* it was gone.   No sound through *any* of this - and believe me, a deserted dirt road at night in winter in western Nebraska is about a quiet as it gets.  I even had window down an inch or so since I was smoking a cigarette.   I must have sat there at least another 15 minutes before I attempted to start my car (it started fine) because when I got to my boyfriend's he was about to come looking for me - I should have been there around 8:30, it was now 9:15.  I know I drove much more slowly than usual, but wasn't thinking about what happened (how odd!) and didn't even discuss it with my boyfriend, just said something about being behind a slow truck and what bad shape the road was in, blah blah blah.   It's a relief to finally get this off my chest.  Whenever I hear of UFO sightings, it all comes back to me in a flood - like I'm there watching it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness holds very responsible position today.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport, Thank you for your response.  I expected nothing beyond, as I said, getting the story off my chest in a forum where I could be reasonably certain folks wouldn't laugh... and if they did, at least I couldn't hear it!  (The good people of western Neb. are nothing if not pragmatic and have no time for ""that kind of foolishness."")  However, I'm leary of hypnosis and don't really think I *want* to know more.  That may change someday, but for now I'm blissful in my ignorance.  Also, I've read a great deal on the subject  since that time (as you may imagine!) and have probably clouded things to the point it might very well not be successful anyway. I would like to share two further things.  First, I realized I never specified the size of... whatever it was.  It was on the smallish side, not more than 50 yds. across at the widest point (where the ""wings"" swept back).    That's probably why I got an impression of Christmas lights.  As it slid over the hill, my mind desperately wanted me to believe it was some kind of decoration turning on from the bottom up.  And it was that time of year, if a little late. Secondly, and probably the real reason I'm resisting hypnosis, is that since I was a very small child my biggest fear has been looking out a dark window and seeing a white face look back in at me.  When the original ""Halloween""  movie was released, some friends visiting me drug me with them to see it  (talk about unwilling, I must have left heel indentations in the parking lot cement).  I literally did not sleep for a week after that.  The first two nights were the worst even with people sleeping in the same room - I laid there in a cold sweat, paralyzed, thinking every sound and shadow was something evil & bad coming to get me.  (that sounds so babyish, and I was 23 at the time)  I've never liked that kind of movie to begin with; I've never gone to another even at the risk of offending friends/guests.  I've also read that owls are often used as memory ""screens.""  From the time I was 6 (my parents moved me to the attic room when my baby brother came along) I've been haunted by owls.  I swore for years that an owl on-and-off sat on the peak of the roof on the end where my bed was.  No one believed me.  We  moved to a huge new ranch-style house 2 miles away when I was almost 13 - one night later, an owl was now sitting & hooting on the corner of the house where my bedroom was!  Finally about 6 mos. later the teasing quit when my Dad said he'd found bird droppings of some kind on the cement sidewalk under the corner where I'd sworn the owl sat.  That didn't really change things,  but Mr. Owl didn't seem to visit so often after that. Reading this over, I hope you don't think I've rambled too much (kinda seems that way to me).  But thinking about this has triggered one more memory of something that happened about 5 yrs. ago that I even went to the doctor about.  This happened at the far western edge of Arvada (Denver suburb)  about 2 a.m.  I suddenly woke up and heard a kind of ""swoosh"" sound.  The first thing I thought was that someone was in the bushes below my window (it was 1 1/2 stories up on the back side of a split-level home).  No sooner had I thought that but what seemed to be a bright spotlight shown through the  shade at the window.  My next thought was ""oh no, the cops are chasing some criminal with a helicopter & spotlight"" although I couldn't hear rotor blades.  I glanced at the clock to see what time it was and that was the last move I was able to make.  The light intensified for a few seconds, I heard a roaring, and I thought I should get out of bed to look out the window, but I *could not move*!  I struggled mightily, but was immobile.  I could feel the sweat break out on my body and heard a roaring in my head and felt it in my body (it was steady, not like a heart beat), and still couldn't twitch a finger.  I'd estimate this went on for 2-3 minutes.  I thought I was having a heart attach or more likely a stroke.  I cast around my mind for another explanation but always came back to physical problem.  During this time I was aware the light at the window was fading away - I couldn't look, my eyes weren't responding to the ""move"" command either.  The feeling passed all at once; it didn't ""ease up"" but was just gone - like when a blood pressure cuff releases.  The next day I tried to explain it to a coworker; she didn't know what to think but advised me to see the Dr. anyway.  I did at 2 p.m.  They found nothing wrong with me and *strongly* suggested it was a dream.  (Why do male Dr.s seem to assume women are all  hypochondriacs or hysterical?  I was truly concerned!)  And I know it wasn't a dream - I'm neither Dickens nor his pal Scrooge.  I believe in being open-minded, but not so open your brains fall out! Okay, enough.  Again, thank you for both your response and your time. Sincerely,  ((name deleted))",2002-01-11T00:00:00,,

I can't think of any other way to explain it because we never saw anything like it before.  There was absolutely no sound, we rolled down our window to try to hear anything.  It was very scary because we could not believe what we were seeing.  We kept trying to figure out what it was.  We wondered if anyone else saw it and what they thought.  Though we were scared we kept following it so we could get an answer, but even when we got close we could not figure it out.  We just looked at each other and said it had to be an alien.  It was not a natural phenomena. We just went home puzzled.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,,

During the middle of the summer, 2000, visiting father in law's farm in NW Ohio. While outside watching birds with my wife, I was scanning the sky when I noticed what I at first took to be the bird we were looking for. Then I thought it was a small plane circling high overhead. It wasn't a bird. No movement of wings, it was a distinctive plane shape, rigid. That's what I used the ""cross"" shape; it's the closest description. I took a second look because several things bothered me: the object did not appear to be that high for its size. It wasn't a private plane. I can't explain that well. It just felt wrong. It seemed too small, and I started thinking it was a remote controlled device. But it seemed too high for that. There was no one near us however, and there was no sound at all, not the sound of a plane in the distance or that distinctive whine of a remote controlled toy plane. This is a quiet summer day in the country, and the object was over a empty field. You can hear planes all the time, from jets to smaller craft. I saw a private plane fly overhead during this time, and the difference was obvious. If this is all that happened, I would assume it was only one of the above: a high flying small plane, or a remote controlled plane. I wouldn't have thought much about it at all. But what it did next was very strange. I noted that it was flying lazy circles, like a bird, but a very rigid flight. That's why I could observe it for so long. Suddenly, the object ""took off"" shooting toward the northwest in a straight line. It disappeared from sight well down the road to the highway, OH route 66. It went very fast, gone in a second, and again, it was a perfectly straight flight path. Not the swooping movement of a bird. It shot off, like a gun fired it. It did not descend or make any bird-like movements. No noise, and it went too far for it to be a remote controlled toy. It astounded me. I don't claim that it's a UFO, but well, I can't explain it away, and it did not act anything like I expected it. It flew very fast and did not deviate from the direct line. My wife did not observe this part of it, and in fact focused on another object that was a bird, so she had stopped observing my object a few minutes before.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,41.3606,-84.3701

The object was sighted while camping with 2 friends.  It was quite high up, and appeared to be a bright star.  But, the object darted back and forth, keeping in the same general area of the sky.  It being July 4th, we initially dismissed it as some sort of fireworks, but the object remained, nearly straight above us for at least an hour and a half.  It continued it's behavior of darting back and forth for the duration of the sighting.  It appeared to make some subtle color changes (orangish to reddish to purplish) but we can't be sure.  We could have been staring at it for a long time causing our eyes to play tricks on us (I'm a natural skeptic) but if I was forced to answer; I say it did.  The sky was cloudless and there was no wind, and no sound emitted.  I recorded it on my video camera but with the absence of background stars it gives almost no evidence of it's behavior.  It only shows a light in the sky.  Also, after an hour of observing, we heard the sound of jet aircraft but none were sighted.  They (or it)were probably under the treeline (we were in a heavily wooded campground) out of our line of sight.  My campmate claims he saw something eject from the object, but I did not witness that. ((NUFORC Note:  The report is reminiscent of the sighting of a celestial body, but that is only a guess.

We were sitting on the edge of a lake, looking across the water in complete silence.  There was no wind, no moon, and the sky was crystal clear.  (we were both completely sober)  An aircraft suddenly approached us from the left at subsonic speed (we heard it approach) and trailed off to the left at high speed.  It was loud and distinct.  We tracked the movement of the sound with our heads, but saw nothing.  It passed by right in front of us without a visual blemish on the starlit sky.  Most unusual was the noise: Two noises actually.  One was the sound of a spinning rotor with a gentle swoosh of a ceiling fan, not a chopping or clapping helicopter-type noise.  The other, more subtle noise was that of polished metal grinding against metal with only slight friction.  But that was it, no sound of a engine, powerplant, propwash, or any sound usually associated with known aircraft. My friend and I were stunned, both of us had the same reaction to and recollection of the event.  We are both atheists, do not believe in ghosts, superstitions, or ET's.  I believe that we witnessed a man-made aircraft of unknown origin using unknown technology.  There may not have been other people within miles of our location, but there is a hope others in the area had a similar experience. ((NUFORC Note:  The sound reported is not dissimilar to sounds reported to us that appear to be associated with bona fide sightings of UFO's.  However, the sound could also have emanated from a military aircraft, designed for almost silent flight.  Military units dedicated to ""Special Operations"" are thought to possess helicopters, for example, that are much quieter in flight than typical helicopters.  PD))",2001-02-18T00:00:00,,

I do not bruise whatsoever even if I take a good solid punch on the arm lets say so I was to say the least shocked to see this. I went to my Doctor that same morning and showed him and he said the only possible reason he could think of  that I could have bruises appear like that might be if I had a low platelet count so I walked next door and had my blood tested. 2 days later he told me everything was normal. The bruise stayed with me for about 3 days or so. My  question is though have other people ever woke up that you have heard from and seen a bruise or mark like this on thier body. I swear it looked like I had been givin a shot with a needle in the arm because of the small red dot in the center. Very wierd, scared the hell outta me .......... Sorry Peter I did not take a picture of it although it did cross my mind.

I fist saw these lights about 1 1/2 years ago. They were no more than 500 feet above my house. I immediately got out the binoculars and the 'lights' proved to be nothing more that road flares suspended under baloons. The flare was too bright to be seen itself but it clearly showed the five or six baloons above it. Both my kids and the wife were able to see the object for what it was. Due to the height of these objects I would guess that they are being launched within 1/4 mile of the house. They generally drift eastward, but I have seen one headed west. We look forward to these launches because for the 20 minutes or so that the flares burn they will travel two to three miles away and up to a height of over 2000 feet. The only issue I have with these pranks is that the winds usually take these object into the northbound landing flight zones of the Phoenix airport. Dull as it sounds, that's all there is.

Attendance of 9000 people. There are two incidents of interest witnessed by meself and some others. On friday the 14th of July 2000, at aproximately 23:00 I was standing aproximately 500 meters away from the main airplane hangar that contained a major portion of the production. The evening was overcastbut earlier there was some light rain and some summer lightning,but no stars were visible and cloud cover was at 100-150 meters above ground level. At this time I witness a red flash of lightning come out of the clouds and strike the main hanger containing the majority of people but what struck me as odd was there was no sonic resonance to the lightning, for those who don't know what that is there was no thunder present even though I was standing only 500 meters away. I shook my head not believing what i had seen and went about the evening as if nothing had happened. Later in the morning i was talking with my friend and I happened to remember the flash and I thought I would tell him what I saw. To my astonishment after relaying the story he told me he was relieving himself on the other side of the hanger at aproximatelly 100 meters away at the same time as my observation when he said he saw red lightning hit the main hanger. I did not know what to think at the time. Later that weekend on the early morning of the 16th of july 2000 at aproximately 03:00. The sky was clear and stars were visible. I was standing outside the back of the main hanger in the sound workers camping area talking with the urinator and another friend when all of a sudden another man i had met earlier in the weekend comes running up to us and says ""Can you help me with a problem?"". To my observation it looked like he had seen a ghost or something. So I said ""What's the matter?"". He replies ""Why the F**K are the stars moving?"", at this point he pointed to one of th! e bright est stars direcly over head. I asked him what kind of drugs he was on and he replied in a tone that can only be described as the most truthful in the world that I have ever experienced, that he was totally sober. Then he said look and pointed again at the star. So my friends and I look up. To my complete shock and bewilderment an object which looked like a star at first on closer observation was moving around rapidly within a small vector of space, not alot but enought that you could see tracers where the object was moving from and going to, like a fly around an invisible light. It looked unbeleiveable. I immediatly expressed my disbelief at what I saw. My pale faced friend then pointed out a second bright star not to far from the first light and this light was a bit different than the fist. This one had blue and red lights on the bottom of the bright light and they were pulsing on and off slowly. My friend then pointed out the third and final anomlous light and this one seemed to have a spot light that was scaning the horizontal airspace around it as it was in the air. As well there seemed to be a haze around and behind the lights kind of like a really really faint aroura borealis around each one. I dont know how long they were there for before 03:00 but i observed them for 1 half of an hour, before i went and did something else. Later in the morning just before the sun was coming up I looked for the anomilous stars or lights and they had moved on or i could not see them because it was getting brighter.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,,

I had never seen anything interesting in the night sky until the night of July 25, 2000. After this event I immediately typed up what I saw and sent a fax right off to Mike Seigal at Coast to Coast AM. As far as I know he never covered it ...and I don't know of anyone but the 3 of us who were present who saw this event. However, I thought you might like to add it to your records and perhaps someone else has sent an account of it to you as well. Here is the text that I typed: Attn: Mike It is now 10:25 pm (July 25, 2000) Pacific. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada and just less than an hour ago I was on the very south end of the valley looking north towards the Stratosphere Tower (a distance of 10-15 miles if I had to guess) ...showing a guest of mine from the East Coast a nice view of the Strip from a high elevation. There were three of us present and we noticed extremely bright glowing lights at approximately the level of the Tower, but well beyond it. You could see the lights of aircraft crossing the Las Vegas Valley, but these lights were 20-30 times brighter and stationary with a slight drift to the right (East). One of these lights dropped suddenly to the valley floor and disappeared. After several minutes the others flickered and faded as well. As soon as they were gone another set appeared at a much higher elevation ...in relation to the tower, almost twice as high. These kept fading after about five minutes and reappearing in sets of two and three ...only a single time was there only one light in the sky. I called a local television station, KLAS channel 8 and asked them if anyone else had reported this ...they said no, but said they'd train their stationary cameras on it (in retrospect, I don't think they took what I was saying seriously). All the while the Vegas.com blimp, a tourist airship here in Las Vegas was in the sky and provided a good point of reference. They took off from the North Las Vegas airport, about 25 miles from where I was in the valley, but they were much smaller (the airship is lit from the interior and the size of the Goodyear Blimp) in relation to the size and brightness of the lights. The best analogy I can draw is to the Phoenix Lights incident of '97 that I've seen time and again on TV. Unfortunately I didn't have a camera, but this incident was far and away more interesting than the Phoenix one. I understand that some explanations there include military flares, and this could have been what I witnessed. However, some of the lights dropped all the way to the! Valley floor and I wouldn't have expected that to happen if military excercises were being conducted on the Nellis Range over the other side of the mountain range in the north part of the Valley. However, as I mentioned, these lights did not all descend in elevation ...what one would expect if they were flares attached to parachutes. I hope that someone captured this on video ...there must have been many eyewitnesses, including those in the blimp, in the airport tower, and elsewhere.

The car was travelling on I-295 from Richmond, VA towards Petersburg, VA between 8:30 and 9:30 p.m.  It was extremely dark because of a storm.  I noted heat lightning.  The green ball followed a path that was parallel to I-295, parallel to our direction of travel (towards Petersburg), and parallel to the ground surface.  We could see about 2/3rds of the object behind the treetops adjacent to the highway.  I am a 46 year old female with a PhD in geology.  My passenger was a 10 year old Japanese American boy who shouted, ""Look, Godzilla"", when we both saw the object.  My first impression was that it was a meteor, and looked like a speeding planet.

On the evening of July 31, 2000 I was travelling south on I295 between Richmond, VA and Petersburg, VA, with 1 passenger.  It was very dark and stormy and about 9 p.m..  The two of us observed what appeared to be a very large, neon-green fireball travelling south parallel to I295 at what appeared to be treetop level.  It was travelling faster than the highway traffic, probably at 200 miles per hour or so.  The lower third of it was hidden by the treetops.  It did not have a long tail, but could have had a very short tail.  Its surface appeared to have a lot of clear-colored small bubbles associated with it.  Its size was comparable to a lemon held at arm's length.  I thought it was a meteor at first.  After thinking about it for several months, I considered the possibility that it might be a UFO.  The reasons for this are as follows: 1) it was travelling parallel to the ground, not arcing down; 2) it did not have a well-defined tail; 3) it appeared very large, and appeared to be at a very low altitude.  I am a geologist (PhD) and I knew that if a bolide of this size and scale hit the earth, it would cause a catastrophic event.  I figured that astronomers would have noticed it and reported on it. I heard nothing reported. The alternative explanation is that we were looking at the base or side of a UFO.  Since I do not know if you received my last report, please notify me when you  receive this.  My passenger was a 10 year old boy.  If the object was a meteor, it was gargantuan in scale, and looked like a planet speeding past.  Near Richmond airport.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,37.2737,-77.2197

I had just laid down when I heard a high pitched whirring sound.Then a extremely bright light came through my window. I can remember grabbing my bed and trying to hold on because it felt like I was being absorbed into the light. The next thing I remember I was lying on a bed or table. The feel and look of the table was cold and had a gray porcelan look to it. It did not have legs but the base came from the floor. I was covered with a thin silver blanket it did not feel as if were made from cloth. There were several beings standing beside the table I believe 2 on one side and 3 on the other. On the side with 3 one stood by my head and tried to calm me as the others performed the procedures. He seemed to communicate to me telepathically I do not remember him speaking to me directly. I'm not sure of the color but they were medium hieght. With two elongated eyes and a slit for a mouth.  He informed me that I would not remember this, that I would not be harmed and they would try not to hurt me. I remember this light above my head, it started at my head and slowly and extremely painfully moved down my body. It felt like I was being rolled by a rolling pin. When it got to my feet it stopped I was in alot of pain. I remember feeling like I was going tp puke as I was being told that they were going to make one more pass back up to my head. At that point I began pleading to be let go that it was to painful I could not take it. The being at my head then said something to the being that I took to be in charge thay seemed to have a little heated arguement. He turned to me and told me that I had years earlier ask them to come and that I would not resist. Then I remembered yelling into the sky years earlier with a friend that I wanted to meet and would be willing to be examined by a UFO. Now that they were doing it he said I was whining about it. A few more words were exchanged with his boss and the light began its trip back up. The one comforting me said ""We are sorry if we harmed you and scared you"" I lost it. I remember feeling  the beam place me in my bed and as I looked up the light left my room. I was scared ((word deleted)) I ran to my parents room crying and then I went to some of the windows in the house to look outside. My parents dismissed it. A few days later on the news a UFO was reported to have been seen in a city close to where I live. I have told only a few people but we joke about it. However I am tired of joking about it because it did happen. I remember it and I have tried to avoid reading or watching anything that might embellish my abduction.

I was coming through the trees between two houses to get to my back yard, when I looked up toward our house. The mountains can be seen directly over our roof from that position, about 3-4 miles away. Above the house, but between me and the mountainside were two blue halo-shaped phenomena that rose from about 20 degrees, straight up to about 75 or 80 degrees before winking/fading out. The closest comparison I can come up with is that of the paired exhaust ports on an F-4 Phantom. Two blue flame-like halos trailing to cones as they ascended. They were much larger than jet exhaust ports in scale though, from that distance. They rose above the level of the mountains, from my perspective, and still all I could see were the halos. No shape blocked out the stars where one would think a fuselage would have been. There was no sound whatsoever, and we were very used to the sounds of military aircraft, as Davis Monthan AFB in town is one of the largest AF bases in the SW. This was no jet.

We always used to cut behind the old Kmart that went out of business to get home, when my buddy says to wait up that he needs to stop and tie his shoe.  So we stopped and he went over to the loading ramp and started to tie his shoes and I just stared up at the night sky looking northward I could see the local TV stations antenna tower.  Still looking out that way I caught out of my peripheral vision a streaking pastel green shooting star.  But as I focused in I could make out an out line it was football shaped and the object pulsed red, green, and blue (all pastel in color) up and down the length of the object in controlled rhythm.  The object was traveling west to east as I yell over to my best friend to look up. We were only able to see it for a few moments as it was traveling at an awesome rate of speed, as it dipped below the trees and house line.  We were dumbfounded by what we saw. I went home and immediately drew a picture of what I saw.  But that was not the end of my story.  I went to school the next day to my electrical trades class and low and behold the was my teacher drawing on the white board the exact object I had seen the night before.  But not only was there the same drawing I had but in a story board fashion there were other drawings of it hovering with the same pulsing red, blue and green pastel lights, but another one next to it that included a star shaped little ball.  I showed my teacher my picture and we talked about what each of us had seen.  He saw everything I saw but from his house he could see the object level off hover for a bit, then spit out the object that looked like a floating star.  He then went on to say the floating ball moved around the other object then he said it kinda exploded into about 20 to 30 tiny objects that speed off into as many directions.   Then the main original object sped off at an even faster speed straight up into the night's sky.  I still have the picture I drew that night and that night is as fresh in my mind now as it was happening so many years ago.

The sphere followed the ridge silently in the tree tops, sometimes in front of the trees, sometimes a little above, and sometimes it was behind them. The trees here are oaks, bl. walnut, standing 50-60 ft. tall on the adverage.  As the sphere traveled it would stop, back up, and procede forward again. We had our father come outside as well, he was somewhat of a sceptic on such matters, he watched with us and stated, ""well I know what it's not, it's not an airplane, or a helicoptor"" so he did decide it was unidentified.  We watched it for app. 20 min. About 1 & 1/2 hours later I went outside again, and it had returned, following the same path as it had previously taken, doing the exact same thing, following the same ridge, very slowly, this time taking about 35 min.  We called a neighbor, about 1 mile away in that direction, and he had seen it the first time, but it was low for him and he thought it was a cars single brake light. He watched it as well the second time, only it was higher this time. He told his wife, who had been traveling that night home from the same general direction of the light, and she stated that while traveling home she had observed several times, a light coming down from the sky onto the hills beside her, no sound, very fast, like a white search light going on and off. She could not see where it was coming from but saw it 4 times very fast.",2001-11-20T00:00:00,,

However being that we didn't like baseball at the time we decided to turn the t.v. off. As soon as I turned the t.v. off everything went dark and we both heard a noise loud enough to shake the whole house. It sounded like a helicoptor that was trying to turn blades that were way too big for it. Like woosh, woosh, woosh, kind of slowly. Well the sound enough scared us so bad that we ran outside. About a hundred yards above us was a ""craft"" shaped like a big black kite with red ""chaser"" lights like on a christmas tree in a cross pattern.this object was about 2 acres big and ascending rapidly when it was about the size of a quarter it took off west very quickly and dissappeared.

I was late, I was supposed to be home at 21:00 and since I was at his house and had to walk home. I asked him to walk me halfway and he said no.

We used to walk around the city late at night in the summer months...or go out into the woods...essentially, we were trying to sneak around the city without anyone seeing us.  We were on our way home one night in July, and through the trees that lined the street, we saw somthing that scared us both to death, and that we did not talk about untill just recently.  Through the trees, we saw three bright white lights in the shape of a very large triangle.  It was easily 150 long and at least 50 feet wide.  It was floating very slowly, heading west.  There was a noise coming from the craft...a very low humming sound.  It was almost undetectable - as a matter of fact, if we wouldn't have been looking right at the craft, we probably wouldn't have noticed any noise at all.  It traveled slowly, maybe 10 miles an hour.  Neither one of us could believe our eyes, and we continued to chase it all the way down the street.  The most incredible thing about the craft was how low it was flying.  At most, it was 50 feet off the ground.  The white lights on the corners of the craft did not illuminate the craft so much as the street, so we couldn't really see what color the craft was, or what kind of material it was made of.  As we reached the end of the street, we were almost directly underneath the craft.  It then started to bank to it's left (south, tward the woods).  It traveled a bit further, at the same pace, and then we lost view of it because of the trees.  We could still see the white lights through the leaves, and then, abruptley, their was a huge flash of purple light from the center of the white lights (and if I remember correctly, the humming got more irritating...the pitch didn't change, it just got more intense), and then it was gone.  Neither one of us saw any of the lights lift up into the sky, they were just gone after the explosion of purple light.  I also remember a few seconds after it dissapeared, when the two of us were virtually shouting at ! each oth er ""Did you see that?"", I heard a boom - or a loud quick rumble in the sky - but very far away...in the distance.  He and I both ran to his house, which was only a few houses down from where we were watching, and told our parents what had happened.  They didn't believe us, or thought we were imagining it.  We didn't talk about it after that night until just recently, but both of our stories are still the same.  It was a terrifying and incredible experiance. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There were no lights on this object.  It appeared as a shadow within a shadow.  I wouldn't call it triangle-shaped.  It had even sides, which flared out, and the backend portion was much wider than the front end.  It appeared to be heading northeast.  At some point it became harder to locate and I turned around hoping to catch it again but in this direction the sky was much darker as this is an area in which there are fewer city lights.

These lights continued to come on and off for 3-5 seconds at a time for about 18 minutes. They ended promptly at 9:50 pm. With me was my wife and teenage son. My wife had binoculars in the car, and with them I could see very faint strobes literally swarming in the area where the lights appeared and disappeared. As many as three bright orange lights might appear at once, but there were probably as many as five different sources.  Attempting to follow or count very faint strobes in binoculars is not easy, but it appeared that as many as five different strobe sources were present as well. The brightness difference between the stobes and the orange flares was extreme enough that I couldn't tell if it was the strobing crafts that became brilliant or if the source was just very close by.  I enjoy stargazing as a hobby and am familiar with varied phenomenon of the night sky. The appearance of the bright orange lights was in color like that of Mars, which was close by this evening for comparison, but with the brightness of Venus, about 1 to -1 magnitude in range.

I put on my sunglasses and billed cap and scanned the sky just East of the suns corona where the main part of the sun was above the bill on the cap. The area of the sky observed from this position was approximately the Zenith. This beach area is approximately 1 mile North of LAX. My head was toward the water so the runways and departing flights were to my right. After noticing several high altitude jets that had made their cruising altitudes after take off and were now proceeding East, an object suddenly appeared near the Zenith about 10 degrees East of the sun's corona. Focusing on the object which was moving at a moderate clip at about 40K feet in a  N-NW  direction, I noticed it was a configuration of three bright spots, maybe lights, two in front and one in back. There seemed to be a blurry darker area surrounding this config. The sky was powder blue with only a minimum of high altitude vapor making very faint almost transparent clouds. I continued to follow it in its path and noticed that it was now looking like a sharply defined very bright, white in appearnce, angular bomerang shape with an equally bright spot in the rear. After this point it disappeared into the distance. The altitude estimate here is based on the size of a standard 747. still on a straight route.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,33.9454,-118.4398

The ones that look like F5's) flew nearly overhead  of my location in East Mesa. Unusual but I've never seen trainers here before. They flew in a tight formation, north to south, at an estimated altitude of 5000 ft, disappearing from view in approx. 2 minutes. Although the speed must have been nearly supersonic, at the capacity of military power(without afterburner) the engine noise was really quiet...less than a Lear jet cruising. Falcon Field airport is a few miles away, I've seen plenty company jets. Williams Gateway airport is a few miles south, and Chandler Municipal Airport a bit south of that...I believe all have radar. As the aircraft diminished to a dot on the southern horizon I noticed what at first I thought was a vulture riding the thermal air currents just to my south, between the jets and my location. We see that all the time out here. My assumption was short lived. What I witnessed behind the trio of trainers I thought to be a large bird in the distance playing in the thermals--a thick, short horizontal line moving back and forth, then in lazy circles, above the clouds then below, behind a tree then behind a house then vertical. The object moved like a balloon on the wind but had the flat appearance of the thicker edge of a matchbook held at about 15 feet. The object vanished into a cloud bank about 90 seconds after the jets faded from view, south of my location, slightly east of the trainer formation. From the time I lit a cigarette and the jets flew over to the end of the sighting was less than the time it took for me to finish my cigarette. There was no metalic reflection, just flat black.

He was one of the eyewitnesses who saw the UFO and was also the radar operator who actually tracked it.   He explained the situation as follows:  The Sebago was conducting an Ocean Station Patrol in an area near Bermuda.  As was common practice during the late night hours, the ship's engines were stopped but still on-line and the vessel was merely drifting in the open ocean.  Around 2 or 3am a lighted object was spotted low in the sky off the starboard beam at a distance of only a mile or so.  It also showed up on the air search radar as being stationary.   At this time there were several watch personnel on the bridge, including the Officer of the Deck.  They watched the object for several minutes before it started moving slowly in a circular pattern around the ship.  When it reached the starting point it suddenly headed away from the ship at a rate of speed which was beyond the capability of the radar to measure.  The details above are approximations as I remember them and I am not not implying that they are totally accurate.

One Sunday morning about 2:30am after henging out with our buddies in Brighton Michigan a friend of mine and me were walking home after hitching a ride part of the way home near Howell Michigan. We were neighbors and good friends and we both lived about nine miles from Brighton. Neither one of us owned a car so we would hichhike home every time we went into town. Anyway, as we were walking down Euler road and small talking about what we had done that evening we heard a low growning or sort of rumbling noise just over the tree tops to our right. We were just passing the Boys Camp when this occured. We became startled and could'nt walk or talk, it stoped us dead in our tracks! We became scared as the noise drew closer. The ground was covered with snow and the moon was full, so it was easy to see. Suddenly a large object about the size of a small house apeared and seemed to ""glid"" over our heads from right to left. The noise had stopped and it glided over the road and across the lake. It was coming down by the boys camp and it looked as though it was landing. It was ""gliding"" but had no wings or propellars and it was'nt a helicopter or airplane. We were close enough to see clearly and it was neither. The object looked as though the outer skin was glowing, kind of like ""glow in the dark"" toys we all had as kids. It was luminated from the inside but you could'nt see inside it. We didn't see any signs of life. I was trying to remember everything that I saw but it was hard to see exactly what I was looking at because it was so low and close to us. It would have been easier to describe had it been a little further away. I did notice however as it passed overhead, small burts of ""fire""  that seemed to come from what looked like ""seams"" near the rear of the object. It disapeared in an orchard across Kellogg road and the other side of the lake by the Boys Camp.

This is a testimony I wrote and sent to another UFO site a while back.  I thought you may be interested. This is not about moving lights, or fireballs, it is not about an encounter with people from another world!  It is just the plain truth about a craft that made a lasting impression in my mind as I looked it over. Just call me ((deleted)).  I’m fifty-((deleted)) years old, and I’d like to share an experience I had, when I was seventeen or eighteen years old, with you.   This happened in the late summer of 1963 or 1964.  I do not remember the exact date, because I tried for a while to try to forget it.  Things like I’m about to talk about were taboo in the home of a southern Baptist preacher at that time!  It was best to keep your mouth shut and try to pretend it didn’t happen!   The following event took place in upstate SC.  Within 30 miles of Spartanburg-Greenville airport.  The reason I mention this is, the airport had very good radar at that time, and the Air Force Base at Sumter is less than then fifteen minutes away for an interceptor.  None showed up. My brother {who is two years younger than me) and I usually sat out on the front porch each week night after school started back in late summer, and talked for an hour or so before we went to bed around 11 o’clock.  Our front porch faced about 10-20 deg. northeast.  There was a wooded area directly across the street in front of us, that had a lot of trees in it that were 50 or 60 feet high, so our view of the sky was limited down to about 1 o’clock.  This night the moon was very bright and probably within a few days of being full, which made the porch dark where we were sitting.  We heard a strange sound coming from across the street in the sky and out of our sight.  It sounded like a multi-engine aircraft that was straining real hard.  We sat there and listened at it for a couple of minutes as the sound got closed and the noise changed to more of a whine, almost like a locomotive without the rail noise.  In a minute or so we could see some lights through the trees and a huge shape moving slowly toward us.  My brother said it was ""one of those flying wings"" speaking of some multi-engine aircraft at that time that looked like wings.  As it cleared the trees we realized it was a ""flying saucer"" and the sound had changed to a high pitched hum.  We watched in awe as it came slowly over the road and over the house beside us on our left or west side.  It was very low and not moving much faster than a person can walk.  We jumped up and jumped off the porch and walked beside the house watching it as it moved over that house and than just stopped and hovered over the back yard of that house.  The hum changed to a hum like an electric motor, as I remember standing there in our back yard and staring up at the huge craft.  It was a round thick disk with three or four little blue lights on the side I could see.  It had a big dome on top of the disk and it had a few amber lights around it about a third of the way up.  It looked to be about a hundred feet across the disk, and maybe fifty feet high. It was about five hundred feet up an! d maybe a hundred feet west of us. (The reason I can describe the size so accurately is, I went back there several years ago and stood in the same place and looked the same way I did that night, and it was almost as if I was reliving that night. And I figured out the size and altitude than.) It was a dull gray color and the moon made it look very dark underneath. The odd thing was, the moon didn’t reflect off the dome in any way that I could see. The craft just sat there motionless, as we stood there looking it over. I wasn’t afraid of it at all, I was fascinated as I watched it. There was something about it that seemed to make a weird sensation in my body. After what seemed an eternity, which in reality was probably around a minute, the sound changed to a high pitched hum and than it seemed to get out of the sounds that a human can hear. The craft started to move up and back a little to the northwest at a very steep angle, slowly at first and that it left so fast that it was gone in about two seconds. I remember as it was going out of sight I saw a red light blink somewhere on it. I can remember the feelings that I had as it disappeared; I felt as if I’d just lost my best friend! I was excited, but I had a empty feeling! Now the weird part is, my brother and I have talked this over several times during our lives, and we remember the same things until the craft stopped. His version is quite different than mine up until it started to leave. Well anyhow, that changed my life! I knew that everything that I’d been taught in church and history was wrong. Whenever I mentioned the damn thing to one of my friends, they thought I was crazy! So I quit talking about it. My brother and I didn’t even talk about it! That experience did something to me, I have thought about it daily all my life! It has caused me a lot of problems! I’m going to cut here as I don’t think the rest of this testimony has any information on the craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,34.91997275204359,-81.92884277929156

The water depth averaged between 6,000-12,000 feet deep there, with undersea mountains in the 4,000-10,000 ft. range, I remember (fathometer readings).  On the second night of searching, an object was reflected in the searchlight (24"" mercury arc light) I was on.  (I was a signalman and my duty station was on the signal bridge running the light).  As the ship turned toward the object, it went out of the ""beam,"" and was lost due to darkness (it was a cloudy night with no moon or stars, pitch black).  The next day we were relieved on station by the rescue ships and continued on our way to the Sixth Fleet in the Med.  A few years later, I read about the aforementioned incident and that the object (which was lost in the beam) mysteriously lifted off the water and disappeared in the sky.  Also, the sinking of the Scorpion has been attributed to the ""Bermuda Triangle"" curse.  Does anyone have any info regarding these allegations?  I was involved in the actual incident and would like to hear any about any info suppossedly existing about this. I realize the time factor involved here, but it is something that has been of interest to me for many years and I have decided now to see if I could get any info it. Thank you.

I would like to report a UFO sighting that I experienced back in the month of August 1968. I know that this is long time ago, but I was so impressed with this incident that I still have a vivid memory of it. So there it is: On evening around 7 :00 P.M. during the month of August 1968 (I can’t remember the exact date), I was sitting on the porch of one of my friend’s house located on Decelles Street in St-Laurent, Quebec, which is a suburb of Montreal. We were three persons there: myself, this friend who lived at this house and another friend. We were 16-17 year old teenagers at the time and we were just talking. The porch of the house faced west and the sun was setting, but the sky was perfectly clear and it was still quite bright. All of a sudden, something caught the corner of my eye, in the Southwestern sky, at about an elevation of about 45 degrees. There was a cluster of at least a dozen disc-shaped and dark-colored objects that were moving to the north. As they crossed the sky, they assembled in a perfect V-shape and vanished somewhere in the darker part of the northern sky. The discs were about the size of pinky fingernail held at arms length and it took them about 5 seconds to cross the sky. I would say that their altitude was above 20,000 feet and they seemed to travel very fast. There was no sound. Less than a minute later, another similar group of objects that seemed to just materialize in the same southwest location of the sky, crossed the sky, while assembling in a V-shape formation, and then vanished towards the north. At first, not believing what I was seeing, I did not say a word to either one of my friends, but then I noticed that one of them was also looking at the sky in disbelief. We looked at each other exclaiming something like « what the hell is that??? ». We pointed out the discs to our third friend, who also saw them. This continued for at least another five minutes. We observed at least ten other groups of discs that would always perform the same maneuver: they would appear in a “bunch” and move to the north while lining-up in a perfect V-formation. All in all, we must have seen more than 100 of these discs cross the sky. These were definitely not aircraft or birds. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in August 1968 is approximate.  PD))",,,

We were all camped out in the middle of the night, looking at the stars, laying back in our sleeping bags. I was seventeen at the time and didn't care about anything but the blonde in the bag next to me. We watched a point of light go east to west high up in the sky. I thought it was a satillite; we saw them all the time. This particular one cruised across the night, stopped dead cold, a second point of light seperated from it, went due east, and the first light sped off north and disappeared. The other light sped off east rapidly and disappeared over the horizen. I knew these two objects were not in the atmosphere. Go figure. Not much, I agree, but enough for me to look at things a bit different. Maybe other folks have seen something similiar; I'd be curious to know. ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time may be approximate.

If I recall correctly, there were some kind of lighting systems on the under side as well. I don't recall any sound that the craft made, I believe it was silent. It flew in a N/NW direction. There is no way to determine its speed or altitude given there was nothing to match it against. Once it was close to overhead, it changed direction and moved West. We lost sight of it when it passed the back side of Mt. Monadnock. I hope that this is of interest. Currently, I work for a bioteck company in Greenwich CT. I have a MA from Boston University. My classmates who were with me are all professionals (two other boys and three girls, yes, you can guess why we were on the Upper Field). Even with the opposite sex distractions, we all became immensly intreagued with the craft. We thought it was some sort of experimental aircraft; however, Pease Air Force Base was quite a distance away, and our aircraft in the late 70's didn't look much like this.

This occurred approximately middle September 1980. I was camping in a very rural, secluded area with my girlfriend and her little boy, who was five, and two cats.  We were camping in an ""authentic"" canvas tipi, which was 18' in diameter.  The tipi has a smoke hole in the top, which allows one to build a fire inside.  The area where we were made camp was heavily wooded and situated on the flat top of a hill. Since it was cool in the evenings that time of year, we had built a good fire before bedding down for the night.  My girlfriend and I were on one side of the fire in a double sleeping bag and her son was on the other side of the fire in his sleeping bag.  One of the cats had curled up next to me in the crook of my arm.  My girlfriend, lying to my left, was closest to the fire and I was near the outer wall of the tipi.  As we settled down to sleep, the sounds of innumerable crickets nad a multitude of other night insects filled the air.  The gurgle of a creek located about ten yards from the campsite contributed to the cacophony. Around midnight(the time is approximate), I woke up suddenly. I was lying on my back and when I opened my eyes I was looking up at the smoke hole. The fire was out and the opening was unobscured.  A bright, white, light was shining straight down into my eyes.  Simultaneously, I realized several things...I could not move a muscle, there was a feeling of electricity in the air, and there was absolute silence.  I could feel the bulk and warmth of my girlfriend next to me on one side and the small, furry presence of the cat on the other side.  I could smell the lingering wood smoke and feel the coolness of the night air on my face.  I could feel the hardness of the ground under my back. All my senses were intact. As I looked up into the light it grew brighter and larger, until the top third of the tipi glowed and then suddenly, abruptly, winked out.  At the same time I heard a rushing sound and the sudden, loud hoot of an owl that seemed to come from just outside the tipi wall on my right side.  Instantly I was able to move and raised up.  I looked around and saw nothing amiss. I quietly spoke my girlfriend's name to wake her.  She mumbled something at me, but didn't stir. The cat next to me stretched and lay back down.  I lay back down, as well, and went to sleep almost immediately. I probably wouldn't have given this episode a second thought, except for something that occurred about a week and a half later. On the morning after this episode, I was washing up in the stream nearby. As I washed behind my left ear, about 1 1/2"" straight back from my earlobe, there was a raised place. It itched a little, and thought it was probably just a bug bite, as there were lots of noseeums in the woods. This ""bite"" didn't go away, however, and continued to itch. Over the course of a week, it changed in character from a slightly red, raised area to a black, molelike thing with well defined edges. I thought maybe I had been bitten by a spider. But, there was no surrounding redness or swelling and no pus or other evidence of infection. There was no pain at the site. It never stopped itching, though. A few days later, I reached up and touched the spot, as I had done many times since it appeared. As i felt it with my thumb and forefinger, it just came off. I looked at it in my hand. It was like a small, round, black disk approximately 1mm diameter. I felt my neck where it had been and there was a small opening in my skin. There was no bleeding or discharge. The edges of the ""hole"" were smooth and did not appear to be healing, but, intact, as if the skin had had no damage. Except of course, for the fact that there was now a tiny hole there. I tried to look at the little, black ""disk"", but it was so small that I had a hard time keeping hold of it and eventually dropped it and was unable to find it. This event occurred over 21 years ago, but I still have the small hole in my skin, right behind my left ear. Even though I can't remember the exact date, every detail of that night is still as clear to me as when it happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2002-01-11T00:00:00,36.259,-83.8065

I was active duty military and was stationed in Korea at the time.  My unit was out on a training excersise with our helicopters situated in a valley.  At 0630 I was standing in line to recieve breakfast and looked over into the valley.  I saw a cone shaped flying object move up the valley.  It had circling lights around it that were mult-colored and rotating in opposite directions.  It had no propellers, or rotor blades or any external engines that I could see.  It was also quite soundless and moved as if it was on a string being pulled through the valley.  That particular morning it was very foggy but as the craft approached the fog parted and the craft moved through our area.  Myself and one other person saw this UFO and he looked right at me and told me to keep my mouth shut and never mention a word about what we just saw.  Being in the military and having someone that outranks me to tell me to keep my mouth shut was to me an order.  I kept my mouth shut, but was amazed that I actually saw what I believe to be a UFO.  Again, this vehicle made no noises, no sense of motion except for it's flight and was NOT a military reconnisance aircraft.  I know the difference, believe me.",2002-01-11T00:00:00,,

It was late saturday night ..A girl that iam seeing and I were sitting in the hottub in the back yard of a house that iam renting.. We were facing east.. We noticed a few shooting stars that night.. There was a bright star in the eastern horizon ..I am guessig that it was venus.. As i lay back in the tubb chatting i saw a section of sky that seemed to be blurred.. This section was just north of that bright star... I tried to clear my eyes,figuring that i had gotten somthing in them.As i did this ,,my friend said what the heck is that!! and pointed to the area just right of the bright star... I clearly saw a boomerang shaped,triangular something.. It was as large as jumbo jet ,,or slightly larger.. There was definately ,more surface area than a jumbo jet.. It was camoflagued in to the sky.. What iam trying to say ,,is that it tookon the darkness of the sky,,with little bright spots to resemble the background of the surrounding stars.. The only other way to describe this is using the movie Predator as an example... I took on its surroundings but the area inside was blurred of fuzzy in respect to the surroundigs.The outer edge was illuminated due to the moon being toward the west behind us..The moon was almost full and the sky was clear .. The glare of the moon illuminated the edges of this thing and showed the boomerang shape clearly... If the moon was not shining in that direction we feel that the object would have been very hard to detect... The object crossed the sky from the northeast moving to the southwest... It was traveling sideways with the point of the triangle pointing to the west... It crossed quickly with out any trace of sound..The time was 1:10 EST ,,the ground wind was out of the west at about 5-8 mph.. Skys were clear ,, visability i would estimate over 20 miles..  The altitude of the object seemed to be around 15000 feet in my estimation.Based upon my experieces in traveling in comercial airplanes ,and skiing large mountains.. I would also estimate that it covered a distance in the sky of approximately 50 miles in that 10 to 12 second of time.. There were no traces of propulsion,,smoke,,vapor,,sound,,or any accompaning objects..The outline was whiteish,,as that of the glare from the moon.. The object was seen clearly without mistake of an aircraft ..It had no ligh! ts..Abou t ten minutes later a commercial aircraft passed in the area traveling north ..I wonder if the pilot saw anything..I told my observation to my friend and she said she saw the same thing exactely.. In no way is this a hoax ,,I found this extremly interesting ,,and hope others saw it also..

My step-son went for a pair of binoculars and returned with the only pair he could find which were a children's pair which did us no good at all.

The seven that were left formed into a triangle, a vertical row of three and a vertical row of two and stayed stationary for a few minutes.

You can easily see the lights from Los Alamos, NM  which is approximately 30 miles away on any clear night.  All of a sudden, I noticed what I thought was a shooting star light up over the Los Alamos area.  It looked like a spark from a sparkler.  The spark shot straight across the sky approximately 3000ft(?) in the air and when it got to where it appeared to be over the Villa Linda Mall area(which would have been about 10 miles from me), there was a number(5?) of what looked like huge flash bulb explosions and they initially were round flashes, but as they grew in size, they were apparently enclosed in something square shaped and the entire square was filled with the bright looking flashes until it looked like one big square flash... Then it went out.  The whole thing took no more than 5 to 10 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2001-02-18T00:00:00,35.661082683982684,-105.95390714285715

I was late, as usual, so I was driving fast to get there.  I was whipping around the back roads of Malvern, PA. The road in particular is called Providence Rd.  People in the area know it as a short cut, but it is very hilly and out of the way.  I remember it was Sunday night, about 9:00 PM.  Noone on the road and as I came over this one hill I noticed three white lights in the distance (20 miles).  I was a clear night, and not that dark.  The sun had gone down not that long ago.  I thought this is cool, must be some sort of military jets or something because it looked like they were in formation.  But the more I looked they weren't that close together. Separated from each other by more than 10 miles or so, but they looked similar...three bright white lights.  I was heading north on Providence so two of the objects were heading east, the ones farther away from me, and then I realized one of them was heading in my direction, heading south southeast!  Once again, I was excited because I just thought this thing was like a F-15 or something.  It kept getting closer and closer.  So I slowed down because noone was around and it looked like it was going to pass right over me so then once I realized that I came to a complete stop.  I opened my moonroof to get a good look, thinking I would see afterburners etc. Instead, I was shocked.  First there was no noise...nothing. The car was stopped and this was a desolate road. The only thing I heard were crickets.  The white light was on its front, but then it started to pass over.  I would say it was about 300-500 ft. up, actually very low for a flying object.  The speed was also slow, almost like it was giving me a show or something.  I could make out that it was a triangular shaped object.  Not a perfect triangle though.  It had a point in the front(where the white light was) then two straight lines/edges down the back and then two triangular shaped wings.  It really did look like a plane kind of, but trust me it was no plane because what I saw on the underbelly of this thing was like nothing I have ever seen, unless our military is way more advanced then I give them credit for.  Near the front of the craft on the bottom there was something I cannot even put into words.  It was a ball shaped object which almost looked suspended from the craft, and the thing that always sticks out and why I feel it was extraterrestrial was the color of this object.  The simple fact was, there was no one color.  It constantly changed color, and not like blue one second and then red. Not like that at all.  The only way I can describe it, it was like ""mother of pearl"".  The white would form with other colors...mixing..blues greens reds and yellows.....then swirl to another color, but the white was always the background.  It just kept changing as it passed over.  Then behind it were 6 green square lights three on a side in a row.  To the right and left of the last green lights was where the wings were.  I was so in shock and so stunned, I just stared as it passed.  I mean I am an intelligent guy, I believe that there could be life out there.  I guess I never thought I would see it.  Of course I didnt have a camera or anything.  After it passed I just sat there for about five minutes in shock.  Not thinking I should follow.  Then it dawned on me that I should and talk to someone about it! or reco rd it.  I started the car and kept going north looking for a place to turn around, and I saw the two other white lights again...still heading east.  I started to chase them but I realized they were too far and I couldnt gain ground on them...moving to fast. I am not sure if those were jets following it or other UFO's, but the thing that passed over me was definitely a UFO.  By the time I turned around to find that one, it was gone too.",2001-11-20T00:00:00,40.0402,-75.5332

Had to report to work that morning (long day!!). About 20 to 30 mintues into the ride, I was going around one of hills where you can see out over a valley. I first noticed a bright light to the left of me. It's size and shape was like a spotlight on an aircraft, or about the size of the end of a pencil. At this time I didn't give it much more thought. Do to the curving roads I lost sight of it, til I hit a nother open valley view. There was now two of them same brightness,shape. This time I had a fairly straight shot on this part of the road, so I slowed way down just to get a longer look at them. This was when the one in the front (I'll say) just shot straight to the west at unearthly speed. The other one seemed to start changing shape from round to elongated to diamond back to round. I had a curve coming up so I had to stop watching. When the trees opened up again on that side of the road. It was now closer to me larger in size, bright white with a lite blue edge. Needless to say I put the hammer down. As the speed increased I did pull out in front for I could now see it in the side mirror. Now at a 110+mph It was back along side of me, it now had a slight orange glow to the front edge, still changing shape. I slowed down to 85mph to go through some little town running all signs and signals. After going through there I did not see it for 10 mintues. After calming down mother nature began calling. I stopped in a wide open area to answer her call, and here it comes again from the area of that town just as I finished. This object chased me, or raced me I say this because it always stayed either behind me or beside me. It did at one time get closer to me, It looked like a very bright flying soda can at this time.

Two orange-red dots flying at very high altitude and exhibiting great speed and unusual manueverability.,Hampton,VA,1995-08-15T21:00:00,other,3-4 secs.,"Occurred : 8/15/1995 21:00  (Entered as : 8/95? 21:00pm) Reported: 10/13/2001 11:24:23 PM 23:24 Posted: 11/20/2001 Location: Hampton, VA Shape: Other Duration:3-4 secs.",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19846.html,"Two orange-red dots flying at very high altitude and exhibiting great speed and unusual manueverability. I am unsure of the exact time period when I observed these objects, but I believe it may have been around the time of the Hyakutake? comet event. I was standing on my back porch looking at a small area directly above when I observed 2 orange-red ""dots"" that in my best estimation were traveling several hundred yards or more apart and at great speed and altitude. Suddenly, one object turned toward the other object, and with amazing precision and speed came along side the other at now less than 50 yards away. Then they disappeared behind trees across the street from my house. I am now 34 years old and have been fascinated with aircraft(identified and unidentified)since I was about 8 years old. I am somewhat familiar with many commercial and military aircraft. I find myself compelled to look at them any time I happen to hear or see them in flight. In my judgement, these objects were easily at an altitude twice that of a commercial aircraft at cruising. I believe my perception of altitude was enhanced by my witnessing a meteor around 1987 while standing on the rooftop of a local 10 story building. The meteor's trajectory was virtually straight in from my vantage point. I was very fortunate to be in the right place and time to witness it from beginning to end. Furthermore, regarding the U.F.O.'s, what truly amazed me was the movement of the one object that veered closer to the other was that it didn't fall into a position slightly behind the one that stayed on a straight path. It seems as though it turned , accelerated and then matched speed again with the other all in less than 1 sec. over the previosly mentioned distance of separation. In my opinion, these were not f-15's from L.A.F.B. or any other aircraft from anywhere around the Hampton Roads area. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I had to guess a bit on the exact date and time of the event, as it was several years ago, and it is something I really don't go around telling alot of people about. I had just left a friend's home, who lived in the small town of Morris. I always enjoyed riding around and listening to music, and after driving a bit, I headed back towards his home, becuase the road he lived on was, at the time, somewhat secluded, and great for star-gazing(since it was away from city lights). I pulled off the road, rolled down the window, and had the radio softly playing. I was digging around for some cassettes to listen to, and something caught my eye. It was up to the left, just over the treeline. It seemed quite large, and was moving very slowly. The lights on it were glowing softly, and not flashing in quick succession, as aircraft usually have. I am a UFO buff, but didn't think that was what it was at first; my guess was it was a helicopter. It was way too slow for a plane. I turned down the radio and listened. However, I heard nothing. Now, at the time, I was unaware that some UFO sightings were marked by the lack of noise accompanying the craft, so it was a shock to see this thing hovering so low above the treeline, and not hearing a sound. I was totally scared. It dawned on me that it was not anything recognizable to ordinary citizens. I tried to convince myself that it was a sort of experimental thing maybe, that the military was working on. If so, they were pretty far from any bases. Then as I sat and watched, I noticed the colors around it seemed to melt into each other, much the way the Mars looks on a good night-- it went from orange to green to red, softly and slowly changing as it moved slowly above the trees, as if it were looking for something. I had determined in my mind that if this thing headed my way, I was going to speed up the street to my friends house, who was only about a 1/4 mile away. My heart was pounding. It was hard to really make out the exact shape, but it seemed roundish, with lights all around the base. As I said, time and secrecy has dimmed my memory a bit. Though I know if I saw it again, I would KNOW what it was!(And I have, but that is going ahead of myself.) Then it did what I hoped it wouldn't-- it stopped in mid-air. I froze. My hand was on the key getting ready to crank the car and take off. I watched it as it began slowly rotating in a circle. Then after a few rotations, it began moving off behind the trees, back towards town. Since it only seemed to be about 2 miles away, I decided to chase it. I was scared, but I hoped to find someone who mihg tbe stopped on the road who also saw it. I sped off in the direction it went, but the whole way back to town, I never passed a single car! Typical. It was a long time before I told anyone, except my friend, and I swore him to secrecy. He said he believed me because he could tell by the sincerity and seriousness in my voice that I was not playing around. As a sidenote: a year or two later, NBC ran a UFO special one night, and they showed a re-enactment of some policemen in a small town who had seen three UFOs. They described what they saw, and in the video re-enactment the UFOs looked exactly like what I saw that night! My mouth hit the floor, and my heart raced as I was suddenly taken back to that night. It was a Wednesday night, and my wife wasn't home(she had gone to church). So it was frustrating once again not to have something tangible to show someone that would help validate my experience. I keep hoping to see that special again, or that maybe I will find photos resembling what I saw, but I have yet to come even close.

Then that's when I also noticed there was another object below the helicopter. The object seemed to be moving in a very fast circular motion making a whipping sound. The object appeared to be thin, small and white colored about the size of a small compact car with a red light on top.  The FWPD helicopter appeared to be observing this one object with curiousity at a close distance. As I watched in amazement I noticed that this object moved within a 3 block radius at the speed of a few seconds. This went on for about an hour and a half. As I left my friend's apartment headed southbound for home, object still in motion, after about 4 blocks distance the strangest thing that I noticed was after all that time no one else seemed to have noticed the event other than myself and 2 other friends.  Oddly enough, a month later in November I was at home with my son asleep in bed when I was waking up from my sleep I heard soft whispers that sounded like ""He is waking up"", when suddenly I was struck by a jolt of electricity on the right side of my ear and as I opened my eyes I saw a bright flash and I heard an electrifying, popping sound.  After this I must have passed out for about 30 minutes and I woke up feeling very nauseated and weak as if my energy had been sucked out of me. A few days later I discovered on the back of my ear a red mark which looked like a spider bite. Whenever I would touch the mark it was sensitive to the touch and it felt like to me that my head would explode!

The closer it got, the louder it became. I felt a sense of fear as it seemed to pass over the top of our home. I felt that it might crash as it was so close. I immediately got off my computer and turned off the loghts, to see if I could see anything out the window. It was a very skies and stars were very bright, buti could only hear and not see any plane. I saw a huge bright light cross from one side of the lake to another, and then the noise completely ceased for a few brief moments, only to return again, coming closer back over our home once again. I knew that this could NOT be a jet, as it would not have had enough time to turn around so soon, and this is something that jets do not do as a rule anyway. The noise continued to get louder and closer,and disappeared again just as it had done the first time it passed. This time it did not return again and no more bright lights were tobe seen. My husband at the time was on the phone downstairs, but said he had heard the loud and low flying object, he too thinking it was an extremely low flying jet. The very next day in the Lewiston Sun Journal, was a write up of the hundreds of people who had called the Lewiston police, to report the same exact thing as we had heard. Lewiston police called the FAA, and they said there had been NO jets on radar in our area at this time.

I continued to observe the object in the sky, and he continued to drive the car as we were heading back to our home in Surrey, B.C.  We turned right onto a main road (called Willingdon Avenue) this road would lead us to the freeway back to our hometown.  The journey down ""Willingdon Avenue"" would probably take us about 7 minutes to get us onto the freeway. I kept my eyes on this object in the sky, as we travelled down Willingdon Avenue. I could see the object the whole time, aside from the occasional tree, in the way.  My husband glanced over many times to confirm for himself that it was still there.  So, for about the next several minutes, I observed the object sit there in the sky and not move at all.  As we now came in sight of the freeway sign to take us Eastbound back to Surrey, I looked behind me to get a fix on the object.  It was still stationary for a few more moments.  Then the object moved across the sky at an increadible speed towards the North West. I told my husband ""oh my god"" it's just moved over.  He said ""where, where""?  I asked my husband to pull over and check this out.  We were on the left side of the HOV Lane (2 or more person freeway lane) we slowed down and stopped the car. (Not a particularly safe place to stop) but we both wanted to check this object out.  I told my husband ""look up there"" as I had been keeping very close tabs on where the object went.  The object now appeared as a dark dot in the sky.  The size of the object at this new location (North Western sky) was about the size at the end of a ballpoint pen.  The colour of the object now was black and the shape of this object from this distance appeared to be a circle.  The object was definately a lot further away than when originally spotted. My husband and I watched the black dot in the sky on the side the freeway. We were running out of time, as we had an engagement that evening downtown Vancouver,so we left from that location, and headed home. We could not believe what we had seen.  My husband said he had never seen an object move with that speed and could not imagine any man made engineered object with propulsion capabilities such as would move a great object of that size at the speed we witnessed. About 1 1/2 hours after we got home to Surrey, my husband and I, had to get back onto the freeway to go to our engagement with family members in downtown Vancouver.  I was again the passenger in the car, and we were now travelling West towards downtown Vancouver.  I was observant of the skys, and I was talking to my husband about the object the entire journey into Vancouver.  We were near the border of Burnaby and Vancouver (but still in Burnaby at this point), I noticed a black object, stationary in the sky again.  I said to my husband ""honey, If I told you I can see it again right now would you believe me""!??.  He said ""what""?  I told him ""pull over again and get a look at this"".  He then looked up into the sky, it must have been around 7:30 - 7:45 pm and he couldn't believe his eyes. It was the object again, oval shaped and very dark black background, no light or colours eminating from it, just a large oblong/shaped thing in the sky.  We watched for a few minutes.  Again, we were very pressed for time, so we took off heading for the downtown part of Vancouver. All the way driving into downtown Vancouver , I was fixed on the object which didn't move location for a long time. I observed it for a least 10 minutes more, but after that, it seemed to be getting smaller (probably either moving away (such as going south or it was moving upwards towards the atmosphere), but it definately was going somewhere.  I lost complete sight of the object when we got to the location of 1st and Main Street in Vancouver.

The color of the tail or plume changed from dark yellow in #5 to a darker yellow orange now. 7) Changing again: now the object is a bright orange streak surrounded by a bright gray cloud. 8) At this point, after 4 to 5 minutes of observation, the image dims.  We see or hear no object leave the viewing area.  A very large, faint cloud lingers for 15 minutes in the in the deepening twilight.  A sketch sequence is available.

June 25th 2001 my wife and I walked outside to see a friend off, and looked toward the east and at what I would estimate to be about 25,000 ft., there was an intense white light similar to an aircraft landing light, but more brilliant and appeared to me surrounded by a mist.  This object lit up the entire cloud of mist, and appeared to also be shining downward, lighting the entire area below it. We watched as the object appeared to be moving to the west, when it suddenly shot vertically at about 45 degrees to an almost indeterminate altitude and moved at great speed to the southeast and disappeared from sight. The cloud which extended vertically and appeared to be several thousand feet high continued to glow white for several minutes after the object departed and drifted directly overhead, having moved from east to west. From our home here we often watch the Space Shuttle launch, and this object was way too far south to have come from the Kennedy Space Center, and we saw no indication that this object came from ground level. I am a former Police officer and pilot, and can judge altitude and speed pretty well, but this object, accelerated from almost zero to what had to be 3 or 4 thousand MPH in a burstand was gone. My wife and I are ardent sky watchers and frequently spot sattelites and the ISS, and can tell you that this was neither, and the intensity of the very WHITE light is inconsistent with the orange-yellow glow of a rocket, and I am familiar with just about every OTHER kind of conventional aircraft there is.....I have been involved with Warbirds, and almost every thing that flies,  and this doesn't fit ANY type of aircraft I know of. The event was of too short a duration for me to get to a camera, so regrettably, I missed this one.

It caught my attention because of its brightness.  I had only been looking at it for a few seconds to try and figure out what it was when it started to grow dim.  Within about 2 seconds it had grown dim to the brightness of a star and not a second after that it was completely gone.  I looked at my brother and he confirmed what i saw.  About 10 minutes after the sighting was over I met up with my other younger brother and he told me he had seen the same light, he described to me the same light I had seen.  At first I thought it might of been a plane and the angle of the plane made the bright light, but in this case the light would have been a yellow or white color.  The light I saw was a distinct blue light on top and red light underneath the blue light.  It did not move to the left, right, up or down.  It keep the same position and only grew dim in a very short amount of time and then completely disappeared.  Also there were no other planes around the light and very few in the sky.

My son and I were on our way home from work about 9:35pm, we both work in the ""rent to own"" industry. We were traveling south on Nova rd.,in Daytona Beach, Florida when all of a sudden my son, who was looking out the driver side window towards the east,said ""what the hell is THAT'? I began to look out the windshield in the direction that he was and what I saw is VERY DIFFICULT to describe. I saw what appeared to be a single ""cloud"", almost due east from our position. At what is best described as the top of the cloud was a single bright white light. My first thought was that it was an aircraft of some sort with it's landing light on, only the light was NOT moving, IT was stationary and there were NO other lights. As I watched, the cloud began to loose it's density, almost like it was fading away and it seemed to diviide down the middle, the light however, remained at the top of this divison and continued to stay stationary. I took my eyes off of it to check out the road ahead of us as my son was focused on on the phenomena and was not entirely focused on the road. I did NOT see this next part, as it happened when I took my eyes off IT to examine the traffic ahead of us. He (my son) claims that a part of IT OR a second light seperated from it and fell towards the earth. The location of the light was due east of Daytona and would have been over the ocean. MY second thought was that it was a rocket that had been fired from the ""Cape"", but the light was WHITE and NO orange to be seen, besides it was too far north by position to have come from the Cape (due east, NOT south east). It was about this time that the ""cloud"" disappeared completely along with the light itself. The moon at this time was located to the west of us an played NO part of what we saw. As i reflected back, IT reminded me of how the moon sometimes ""peeks"" through clouds with just partial light being seen, but the moon as stated was no where near the phenomena. In MY 47 years, I have NEVER seen anything such as this. I only hope I get the opportunity AGAIN sometime.

The valley was surrounded by a eucalypt forest. The distance to the dam would be approximately 250 metres. I was in the laundry doing washing.  The laundry building was detached from the house - and there was about a 10 metre walk to get back to the front door. I was walking back to the house and turned around to face west and looked down towards the dam, over the cleared field. From the tops of the trees at the left of the dam a silver-grey shape appeared.  It was in line with the treetops and slowly moved over the dam. It was in full view for about 60 - 90 seconds. It was travelling northwards very slowly over the dam - and then went behind the treetops on the northern side of the dam. It was a solid object, very clearly ly the work of an intelligence and definitely not a weather phenomena or a trick of the light etc. - but I had the distinct impression it could change 'dimensions' if you like.  It had a very distinct pink/light mauve 'halo' or field around it.  I remember noticing how this 'field' finished abruptly a metre or 1.5 metres away from this craft. I also remember thinking how wonderful this thing looked and realised I was looking at something that was way beyond any technology I had read about exisiting at that time. As you know - there is no way you can explain that these craft actually exist to people who have not seen one.  Generally you are greeted with mild scepticism - and you can generally sense their rationalisations about your experience.  I have told very few people about this encounter - because basically , what's the point? I have had a couple of sightings since then but none so close where you could actually see the object clearly and make out its actual shape. The 2nd last sighting was in company of another person.

When I went to my ten year reunion....I spoke to my friend who had been in the car with us...He also stated that the encounter was something that he never forgot. I want to say that what is so amazing is that none of us can remember what happened after...Did we go roller skating...did we go home....None of us remember....We never checked to see if there was any time loss(as there was not as much information back then about what can happen if such an event occurs.....Several years later there were numerous cow mutilations on local farms.......nothing was investigated , and the police had nothing to say...They treated us like we were all crazy(only saying that they probably had been killed by animals)......I have often thought about going under hypnosis to see if I can remember anything else about what happened or didn't happen....Was it a UFO?  I can't answer the question and may never remem! ber anym ore detail.....But this is my story, of what happened that night, that had such a huge impact on all of us.

"Red, saucer shaped aerial phenomenon of unconventional configuration with no audible propulsion.",Pennsville,NJ,1975-09-15T21:30:00,disk,5 min.,"Occurred : 9/15/1975 21:30  (Entered as : 09/15/75 21:30) Reported: 3/8/2002 3:17:52 AM 03:17 Posted: 3/19/2002 Location: Pennsville, NJ Shape: Disk Duration:5 min.",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22145.html,"Red, saucer shaped aerial phenomenon of unconventional configuration with no audible propulsion. Occurred on Lighthouse Road near Fort Mott State Park. Object was red, with no visible lighting or running lights, discernable ""deck"" lights, or other indications of being a multi-leveled ""craft."" Its shape was that of two plates, one atop the other; wide in the center and tapering to ends; which appeared to be a consistant trait in its construction (angle/position to/of object did not change appearence). At first it approached low  (-300') and silently from SW (?-directions aren't my thing!). While manuevering, there was no apparent change in the objects relationship to the observer (it was as though It was ""facing"" us even as it changed direction... perhaps- likely, the effect of no identifiable markings from which to ascertain its true orientation. Though there were no ""visible"" indications of an aura or haze that I readily remember- it seemed pretty clear too Me!... I reckon' one may have existed: that would explain the lack of definition and inability to denote any change in orientation during course changes/manuevers. We were at the bend of Lighthouse Road near Fort Mott Road, facing field (lighthouse to left)away from developement. It was coming  (slight angle to right- 1 or 2 degrees relative, travelling left and closing, toward Zero relative)  directly towards us and those with me were quite concerned. I at the time was 14 and quite curious, and got out of the car (a VW) to ""see it!"". I was pulled into the car and in the excitement (panic) to get away, my cousin nearly ran off the road and into a ditch. I observed the object as it gradually turned 180 degrees from us (to the right and away from our original observation point) and headed to the actual park area (app. relative bearing from original ob. point: 045). It then proceeded (North?) from park area and while over the dike began to accelerate (acceleration was smooth and rapid- in a ""up-river"" direction towards Wilmington, DE... North?). Then it was gone! Not a streak as seen in (say) a rapidly moving light... just a clean, crisp light which increased in speed and disappeared. Note: The object did not diminish in mass or change shape indicating a turning/arching motion, nor did it fade or in any respect give the impression of a light being turned off! Never did I hear noise, nor did it behave in a manner consistant with any aircraft of my knowledge, before or after the event. Other than to say it appeared considerably close, I can only speculate on its size, distance, and altitude [2 inches- 1/2 the spread of one's fingers if taking bow readings on a ship (Ex: four points off the Starboard bow), at a distance of approximately 1000 yds., and altitude of app. 200 feet. Closest approximate distance was 150 yds. I would estimate the object itself to have been the length of a medium-sized house: 40 feet? ]... this account is from memory, and except for it being ""somehow strange and out of place,"" I didn't think to correlate the incident with known landmarks for size, altitude, or distance. Quite honestly, I was 14 and fearless... more interested in determining what! it was than how big, high, or where, it was! The conditions of incident: Clear evening. Stars bright. Farmland, swamp, and open ground, which I was relatively familiar with, and no unusual activity of any kind. (Note: Aircraft activity was light, visible, and easily recognizable as aircraft, though distant; Delaware side of Delaware River- refinery and Wilmington area, with some air traffic in the vicinity of the Nuclear Power Plant). Events prior to incident/event: My sister and two friends had come home obviously distressed- literally crying because they saw a UFO. My cousin and I, for laughs and kicks decided to go back with them so they could ""show us""... they were after a lapse of app. a 1/2 hour, still distressed. Niether of us were expecting anything- we thought they were stoned to be quite honest! Anyhow, what occured is pretty much that as stated herein, and to, the best of my memory. Since then I've been in the Navy, at Sea, and have seen various types of Aircraft under varying conditions. None of which would fit into the category of unidentifiable or unexplainable! I was a FT (Fire Control Technician-Missiles). I am somewhat imaginative and creative, but not predisposed to irrational thought or fantasy; however, to this day I cannot explain what that object was! It continues to defy any attempt at my rationalizing what it may have been! It truely was uncharacteristic of any aircraft or aerial phenomenon of which I am familiar. A friend that lived in that area said she too saw wierd things, but I mention that in passing! Interesting Note: None of the other four People involved- my sister and cousin specifically, will discuss this incident/event; which really aggrevated me for some time! They acknowledge its occurence, but will not discuss it... which is behavior I find rather strange in and of itself! NUFORC: As stated, this account is from memory and occured some 27 years ago! This is the first I've bothered to report it since it was so long ago and without willing witnesses or supportive evidence seemingly a waste of time. But, why not? It's an incident that too this day, baffles me! I will answer any questions (via E-mail) you may care to ask; though certainly being this far removed from the present, it is of no consequence.

We had been invited to have chicken gumbo at their home. After finishing supper my Dad had fallen asleep while watching T.V. It was around 2:00 a.m. before we finally left for home. We were traveling east on Pineville Rd. when all of a sudden the entire inside of our vehicle lit up a bright blueish/white. We had no idea what was going on and were scared half to death. The light seemed to extend to either side of us. There were fenced fields to our left and right near the road and the light touched just beyond the fences to the best of my recolection. There was no sound and no other vehicles in the area. I remember my Dad stopping the car. My Mom said...""What's that...where is it coming from""? I was sitting in the middle of the back seat and couldn't figure out what was happening. My first instinct was to look up because I thought the overhead car light had turned on, but then quickly remembered it was busted out. I believe Dad had stepped out of the car, crossed the ditch to the right of us, looked out in the field, came back and said...""It's not coming from out there"". The next thing I remember is riding the rest of the way home and entering the house, looking at the digital clock on the dining table (can't remember what time it read) and going to bed.The next morning while Mom and I sat at the table sipping on a cup of tea she remarked...""I wonder what that was...it seemed to come from above and behind us. I was too scared to turn around"". Well we were all terrified...of what I don't know. It seemed almost 'taboo' to discuss the subject. We all felt violated for some reason. Nothing made sense to any of us. We felt like silence was an 'instruction' and we wern't suppose to talk about this occurance. It still haunts me today because I can't remember just what this was that invaded our lives. Both my parents are deceased now and I can only hope one day I'll find the a! nswers.

My step brother and myself were sitting on a barn roof looking into a big field where they would make hay. There is a tree line in the distance. Looking at the tree line I noticed two, what I thought were planes coming strait at us but they made no sound at all. As they got closer I could see, they were what I would call thimble shaped. The only way to discribe the color of them is, like polished bronze. They were at about tree top level and they just kept coming, and still not a sound. These things were in a formation, as like a lead ship or whatever and the other, alittle behind and off to the side. They got over head and that was to close for me .I jumped off the roof and ran as fast as I could to the house with my step-brother in tow. I know it sounds insane but none the less, a true story.

One was amber and the other was green.  They were moving very fast from the east to the west, from one horizon to the other.  From my vantage point they looked as though they were spheres many miles up and to the north.  They were taking turns passing each other in ""leap-frog"" formations.  The green light would stop and the amber light would zip past it.  Then the amber light would stop and the green light would zip past it.  They went from the East horizon to the West horizon in approximately 3-4 seconds.  I ran the remainder of the way home scared.  Out of breath, I immediately told my parents about my experience.   Due to my insistence they eventually believed me, called information and were given a phone number to call to report UFO sightings.  My Dad called the number (I don't remember the name of the organization that they called) and reported my sighting.

(This is an edited version of of a report that I posted on May 24, 1999). At the time of the sighting I was a senior in high school. I was visiting my grandparent's farm in a valley of the Blue Ridge mountains on a perfectly clear and moonless winter night. I arrived just before 9 pm. As I was going up the steps into the house I noticed a very large and bright object fly over the mountain ridge to the west. The object was unlike anything that I had ever seen. It was roughly the size of the full moon and nearly as bright. It gave off a steady, brilliant blue-white light (it was white in the center and became blue towards the edges). The object originally had a fuzzy, or indistinct outline. During the time I observed the object (about 5-6 minutes), it made no sound whatsoever, and it flew in a straight west-to-east line. After observing the object for a couple of minutes it flew ""behind"" a tall pine tree atop a small hill next to the farmhouse, and it was so bright that you could easily see it shining through the tree branches. Since it was dark I am not sure of the height of the object, however, it did appear to be at least several hundred feet in the air. I asked my grandfather (who was 75 at the time) to come outside, and after putting on a coat he did so. He watched the object for about a minute and commented that he had never seen anything like it - he didn't know what it was. The cold air forced him to go back inside the house, but I kept watching. About 4-5 minutes into the sighting the UFO suddenly changed both its' shape and color. In a split second it went from being a very bright, circular-shaped object to a teardrop or cone shape with a dull orange color. When the object changed its' shape and color it did so from the bottom up - like someone pulling up a windowshade, which I thought was very odd. The object continued on its' straight west-to-east path until it passed behind the mountain ridge to the east and was out of sight. I did not see it again, nor in the years since have I seen anythin! g that r esembles it. I currently live near a busy airport, and I have seen and heard many airplanes at night, and NONE of them have borne any similarity with this object. Also, at the time of the sighting I practiced astronomy as a hobby, and I had spent many summer evenings in the back of my grandparent's home with a telescope. As a result I did have some familiarity with the night sky, and this object was far brighter and slower than any meteor I had ever seen (and this includes fireballs). The object was also much larger and brighter than any star, planet, or satellite I had ever observed. In short, I have never seen any other object which has resembled this ""peculiar"" craft. The next day I told my parents about the sighting but they laughed it off, as a result I have not told anyone until now about this object. I do remember that a few weeks later our local newspaper ran a story about some ""strange lights"" which were being seen in nearby communities, but I have never had the chance to investigate and find the article in question. I hold a master's degree and I am currently a teacher at a private high school in North Carolina. ((NUFORC Note:  We have replaced the original report with this edited version.

I stoped there to light a cigarette. When I turned to follw my friend she was no where in sight. I sped up to catch her. She was no where. I went strait to the bar to get my other friend and she was very upset. It turned out that I had been gone for over 2 hrs. I'm not sure what I believe as far as sightings. I always assumed it was military or other goverment projects. I bought a book on the subject just a week ago and alot of the things I have read apply to symptoms I have had in the years sence. That is how I found your sight. Just trying to get more info. I see here there haven't been any reports of abductions. Do you think this is crazy or am I reading to much into things that can easily be explained? I see on your sight there are a few reports from the neighborhood I grew up in. I don't know if this could be connected. Please keep in mind the dates and times here are very apx. as it was such a long time ago it is hard to remember. I just wanted to see if anyone here might be able to answer some of this for me. I don't care if you put this accou! nt on th e sight or not. My only reason for righting was in hopes to contact someone who knows more on the subject. I am a 3x year old, female ((deleted))l Officer.(ie..have passed West Virginias ((deleted)) test in the process)*grin* Married with four children. I live in a very small town and am not trying to call attintion to myself in any was. Expecialy because of my profession. I would like for this information to be on a need to know basis. I haven't even told my husband for fear he would think I was going over the deep end. Thanks so much for you time. Even thou I havent told him it is still ok to contact me.

My husband and I were driving west on I-80 from Nebraska into Wyoming at sunset.  We saw a number of vapor trails from planes in the sky in front of us, but there was one large bright white light that didn't seem to have a trail -- or had a very small one, making it a bit teardrop-shaped, with the thin part of the drop to the left of the main light.  A bit like:   <O   It wasn't too far above the horizon and at first we thought it might be a planet, but it seemed so large and bright.  We thought it might be Venus because it looked like it might be in a crescent, but decided that it wasn't.  We then realized that the light was starting brighter on the right and then dimming towards the left -- like it was sliding repeatedly in that direction or like a lighthouse beacon rotating.  It didn't appear to be moving otherwise, unless it was coming very slowly towards us.  I tried to grab the binoculars, but got our inferior pair and the vibration of the car made it too hard to see well.  When I took the binoculars away from my eyes, I saw there were now 2 objects.  I asked my husband where that other white spot had come from and he didn't know, but it looked like it had split off of the first.  That second light DID move and it stayed around the first.  As I recall, it came from the right and swerved around in front and down.  And then suddenly they were both gone!  We think it lasted all of 5 to 8 minutes. A little later on, further south and a bit higher (I can't recall the time or place -- Wyoming, near Cheyenne?).  I think it wasn't too long after the first two lights disappeared.  We thought it was a star, but seemed (again) quite big and bright.  It, too, was white.  I thought it might be a plane, but it didn't move like any I'd seen.  It seemed to be moving towards us and it seemed like we might pass it soon, but we never caught up to it.  We couldn't tell in what direction it was traveling; it might have been just back and forth, very slowly.  It, too, didn't appear totally round, but was a bit more teardrop-shaped, but the thin part was to the right this time.  This light we saw for about 15 minutes (?) and it eventually disappeared.  We weren't watching it non-stop, but we certainly didn't pass it or see it fade in size or brightness as if it went off somewhere.  Any ideas anyone?  A very odd thing, to be sure.

It hung in the air and several people witnessed. It was about 7:30 this December night. Not particularly cold outside. Directly north of my house, I looked up to see a mysterious, glowing cloud. It was eerie because it was cloudy that evening, slightly foggy. I was leaving the house to go to our bookmobile as we do almost every Thursday night. When I saw it, I couldn't believe that this glowing formation was real. It made no sound. The air was crisp and it carried no sound. I went running back in to call my boys to come and see, that took at least 30 seconds and it was still there when we came outside to see it. We gazed at it for at least two minutes. It looked quite close, close enough to see the shape of the light emitted from within the formation. It was oval, a long oval that wasn't defined. It was almost like, being close enough behind a curtain, that the people on the other side can see your shape, but not you. If I held me arm out at shoulder length, I would say it was the length of my thumb. Up high in the sky at about 45% angle. Low enough to see that it's close, but not so close. It looked like it could've been 1/2 away, but because of the formation and the play of light, it could be much farther away. We couldn't see what made the light. We started walking and I saw a beam come out from the top,  it stopped for a split second. Then the beam went to the 10 0'clock position. Again, paused for a slit second and then went to 8 0'clock. It paused there and moved to six o'clock. It then retraced it's steps and the beam at midnight shot back into the cloud from whence it came. It then just melted away. It was gone quickly. The beam was perpendicular all the way along. It did not seem to start out as a slit and then become a circle which becomes wider as the beam lengthened. The end of the beam being much wider than the spot from which it originates. Of course, when we got to the bus, I told at least three people what I had seen and about four of us were talking about the glow, ""oh you saw it too!"".

It was about 9:00pm and very cold out (on the verge of freezing). I happened to look up and to my surprize a flare-like object shot throught the sky as if it had been fired out of a gun. It was faster than anything I have ever seen before.  My initial thought was that of a bottle Rocket, but no bottle rocket travels at the speed that this thing was moving.  The most interesting part of this is that the object fired off from a central point in the sky. Its as if the object was floating and then just suddenly blasted off. The object immediately formed a vapor trail.  This was the strangest vapor trail I have ever seen in that it had a vibrant white glow and it sort of looked like a dark blueish outline formed around the edges of the trail.  I am possitive that it wasnt a space shuttle landing, because I have seen the trail that forms from a space shuttle and this was far bigger and brighter.  Once again, nothing has ever passed my eyes at the speed that this thing was traveling.  I also noticed that although it seemed like it was only 200 or so feet above me at the start, as I drove into a clearing over Lake Travis (right by Mansfeild Dam) the trail looked like it was 5 miles high.

I was facing east-(the Bay) when out of the corner of my eye,-I saw a quick streak from just slightly front and left to behind me(though it's entire path was visual perifially). It was in every respect, like a shooting star-(I had seen so many during my time there-and it was EXACTLY like a shooting star in every regaurd-Speed Path and duration. It was only as an-""Aww-too bad...I missed it!"" after thought,that I looked up in the direction it had-(or should have) disappeared in that I turned and looked up to that point,- I was instantly perplexed by what appeared to be a jumbling or illuminated disturbance in the clear night sky-and I must admit, that it seemed like an attraction spotlight-(only with no ""beam from the ground"" attached to it). AND- it had no clear or concentrated form or direction and encompassed a much larger portion of the sky than an attraction spotlight would.

The ""Rolands"" Grocery Store Shopping Center with the McDonalds and (nearby)-the ""Rod and Reel"" Resturant.

I was walking to work in the evening at approximately 9:20 pm, CST.  There was no wind at all, and the sky was completely clear.  The temperature was around 80-82 degrees Fahrenheit. I was east bound and had looked up to enjoy the night sky.  When I scanned northward, (around 45-50 degrees up from the horizon)  I noticed what I originally thought to be three large birds heading towards the south.  I was in motion when I formed this initial impression. As they drew closer to my position, I couldn't help but notice that something was ""wrong with this picture.""  It was then that I decided to stop.  I had been walking that particular route for years, at the same time in the evening and had seen all manner of birds.  This collection of objects was not behaving as birds do. As the objects came closer, it became easier to discern what distinguished these objects from, say, the ducks I was accustomed to seeing.  The formation of the three objects was utterly ridged.  Birds maintain a basic formation, but even in the evening--at such a low altitude--one can see a modicum of relative motion between the individual members.  This formation had no such relative movement.  It was rock solid. I had stopped perhaps a yard west of an intersection that was illuminated by a mercury-vapor sort of light.  The formation, at their closest point, passed directly over this intersection.  I estimate that their height from the ground to have been approximately one and a half telephone poles.  I judged them to be just under a meter in length. At this point the physical details of the objects became most evident.  They had nothing in the way of wings on them.  All three of them were shaped like bowling pins, and they moved with their longest axes parallel to the ground and with their heads defining the forward most point in the ""flight path."" When the lead pin passed over the street light, I could tell that the body of the pin was smooth, and it appeared to be pewter in color.  They made no sound at all.  In fact, it seemed that they had suppressed ambient noise in some measure. Once over the lamp, the three pins continued their perfectly straight trajectory to the SSE (passing the local university) until I simply couldn't discern the bodies from the night sky.

And I'll do my best to provide you with an illustration of some sort. While I did in fact stipulate that the date of my sighting was approximate, I'm certain that I'm off by no more than one day.

It's been a little over a year since I've been there, but I do know that in addition to being a cryptological training center, the base is now the national center for instruction in all manner of fire suppresion/containment.  Yes, summers can be unmerciful in San Angelo; but that's Texas in general, too. I have you to thank, Mr. Davenport, for my having submitted any report at all.  I had the opportunity to listen to your most recent interview on the Dr. Lauralee program.  Your presentation was very impressive:  you were factual, professional, and even-handed in your delivery.  If UFO matters are  ever to be taken seriously (whether by skeptics, fanatics, or both), a voice of reason and equanimity HAS to be present in laying the groundwork for its consideration.

At approximately 0445Z Joshua Approach requested Raider 77 to turn to a heading of 150 degrees to investigate unidentified aircraft maneuvering close to airway J110. Since Raider 77 was transmitting on UHF, we could only hear radio transmissions from Joshua. We perceived from the Joshua transmissions that the unidentified traffic was following a ((Boeing-built a/c--type deleted)). Shortly, we were given traffic advisories for two targets at our 3 o'clock position and 8 miles and  moving at a rate equal to three times our speed. The next report was at 2 o'clock and 8 miles. At nearly the same time another target was reported at our 11 o'clock position and less than 2 miles. These reports were followed with the advisory, ""traffic no factor"". We were then switched to Los Angeles Center. LA Center informed us that Joshua had told  them of the incident, and we had no observed traffic in our area. At no time did we make visual contact with the reported traffic. Apparently, Raider 77 did not  see the traffic visually, but they did have them in radar contact. Joshua stated that the targets were primary and did not return a transponder or IFF code. Flight ((flight # deleted)) continued the flight to Las Vegas without further incident. Note: If Raider 77 had the on-board technology to identify our aircraft by its radar signature, why was he unable to identify the other targets?

My dog woke me up whining and jumping trying to get up onto the bed.  The dog then looked up at the sky, yelped and ran for her dog box on the porch and jumped inside. I looked up to see what had bothered the dog and there was a huge craft that at first I thought was a dirigible. The sun was just coming up to the east over the Sierra Nevada's and I was facing west where the object was. The first rays of the sun were being reflected by the shiny metal skin. The object was about very low---probably no more than 1,000 feet high. It looked like an old dirigible without the basket under it. The craft appeared to have five tail 'fins', again no basket under it and no markings. It made a low, grumbling noise like a jet plane sounds at some distance away--but steady, no undulations or variations in the sounds.  I would estimate the length at about 400 feet, and the diameter about 100 feet. Anyway, my brother and I are just gaping at this huge object that is gliding ever so slowly over the next door neighbors pasture. I decide to run in to wake up my parents-- who refuse to believe what I'm telling them is outside. I run back outside and just get out the back door and my brother is telling me 'hurry up---it's starting to really move!'.  I run out in time to see the thing accelerate at an incredible rate (without any change in the sound) going west, and just wink out of sight. I thought then, and I still do, that the object behaved as if it were lost.  It acted as though it popped into existence to check its' bearings and then took off again.

Kanata Ontario, Canada. There was a clear and nice blue sky. I always observe the sky. I was in my car and my wife was driving north. We were going to the movies. I first saw a jet plane flying high going west at an altitude of 45 degrees. I could clearly saw the white trail the plane was leaving behind. I watched the plane until it disappeared in the distance. One minute after, I look southwest and I saw what I first believe to be another plane at an altitude of 30-35 degrees.  It looked to be closer than the commercial jet plane, but you could tell it was very high. It was moving northeast at a steady speed. The first thing I noticed is that there was no white trail, and it was moving just too fast and high to be a glider or small airplane. It looked like a metallic object (commercial jet plane like) but perfectly cylindrical. Looking with more attention, I noticed a quasi-transparent dome shape attached to the top of the object (similar in texture to what you can see when the moon is barely visible during the day)and what appeared to be like a variable haze sorrounding the object. I immediately told my wife to look. Even though she was driving, she could see it too. I though then that it was high altitude balloon, but again the payload seemed just too big and it was moving way too fast. As the object became closer (altitude of 60-70 degrees) I had to stick my head out of the sunroof to look at it. I laugh to myself because the shape of the object was just like a UFO portrayed in a bad cartoon or B movie; transparent dome like with metallic base. As we were moving north, I saw one person walking at the street looking at it puzzled. Once we reached the AMC parking lot, I saw a helicopter flying at ~500m above, this gave me a point of reference. The apparent size was of a big commercial jet plane flaying high.

The ""swarm"" of lights, each of apparently equal brightness and being similar in color and brightness to the star Arcturus, initially subtended a fairly small angle comparable to the apparent angular diameter of the moon. Over the course of approximately fifteen minutes, the ""swarm"" moved toward the northeast while simultaneously dispersing and becoming dimmer. By the time the lights were directly overhead they had dispersed enough for the swarm to subtend an angle comparable to at least ten times the apparent angular diameter of the moon, and each had become so dim as to be barely visible. The total number of lights is estimated at between thirty and fifty. At least five other people witness this event. The organization of the ""swarm"" of lights did not appear to be in any geometric pattern, however  they did remain roughly equally spaced even as they dispersed.

I was just leaving a friend's house about 10:20 PM and she was walking me to my car.  We had been standing there talking in her driveway for about 2 minutes when something caught my eye.  I turned and looked at a LARGE reddish light, directly south of us, about 40-50 degrees above the horizon. The light appeared to be at least the size of my thumb nail when my arm was outstretched. I've been observing Mars for quite a while now, and I read that it was supposed to be at it's nearest distance from earth last week. I said ""Wow!  Look at Mars.  It is HUGE tonight!"" As I said that, I made about a 45 degree turn to my left and looked at my friend,and there, way up in the S.E. sky at about 70-80- degrees, was the REAL Mars, looking sort of pink, and maybe less than half the size of my little thumb nail.  It was a clear night and the moon was out in the S. Western part of sky.  (The light was smaller than the moon.) I personally witnessed the yellow light formations that have been seen repeatedly over Rockford in the last 2 years, plus I've got 2 videos of the same phenomena, taken by a friend who saw the lights at other times. (Peter,I sent you his 1st video, and if he ever copyrights the second one, as you suggested, we'll send it to you.)This new light was alone, at least we only saw one. The color was reddish brown, with maybe a yellow haze around it.  We both thought it looked more oval than round,and to me the light shone out from top, bottom and sides the way the ""Star of Bethlehem"" is depicted, but that could be my eyes.  I thought the yellow lights looked that way, too, but in the videos they are round.) We watched the light for about 10 more minutes, and I believe I saw it blink several times, and then it started to move slighty to the west. Within a minute or two, it went behind a large stand of trees. My friend lives 1.3 miles N. of East State street. (The lights are often seen by witnesses near State St.) Judging by the size of the light, it seemed relatively close, and we could still see the light glowing through the trees, so I got in my car and went to look for it, but by the time I got out to the main road it was gone.  I did see 2 airplanes flying in the direction of the light--one while we were still looking at the light, and the other when I reached the main road. The airport is in the same direction, though, so the planes may have been a coincidence.  I drove back to her house about the same time 2 nights later and stood in the same spot and looked for a long time to see if we could have seen a street light from E. State Street, or somewhere in between.  There was nothing. I saw a stand of trees about 4 blocks south. I think they were the same ones. My friend and I are both teachers with masters degrees, aged 45 and 53. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might be observing Mars, currently visible in the southeast sky.  We will attempt to look at the video.  PD))",2001-08-05T00:00:00,42.27738134206219,-89.04477790507364

I noticed a usual commercial jetliner turning to make its approach to LAX, but I also saw an object that seemed to be high in the sky and nearly straight up.  I curiously kept looking at it to try to identify what kind of object it might be.  I got off my bike to look more intensely at it.  By that time it was directly overhead.  I could not tell if it was circular or slightly oblong at that time.  When I first saw it I thought it might be a blimp. But it seemed to be much to high to be a blimp, but it seemed to be elongated at first.

I made my way to the bank to conduct a transaction.  Upon leaving the bank, I thought I would scan the sky for the object again. Nearing my destination, I spotted it again.  It was east of me, behind me as I traveled westerly.  I would glance back at it here and there to see if it was sill there.  Then at one point I clearly saw the white bright object as very distinctly cigar shaped and closer than ever (the length being about five times the height and horizontal).  I raced home which then was about a block away to view it through my binoculars. By the time I got to see it through my binoculars it was drifting northeasterly and still seemed to be quite high.  It was a bright white color with a red hue along the bottom (this hue could have been cause by refraction of the binoculars). It was fading in the distance and no longer horizontal.  It faded into the distance looking again as a star and then no longer visible. I called my three sons to view the object, but by that time it was to far for them to see. I do have very acute vision as compared to them. The whole experience could have lasted! 30 to 4 0 minutes, most of my time being spent in the bank.

It was then that I noticed each cluster consisted of four thin disks connected to one another in a cloverleaf type pattern.  They were moving at a high rate of speed, faster than a jetliner would travel, from out of the thunderstorm to the northwest (the direction of Yakima)and into the blue sky to the southeast(toward Pendleton).  They were flying at the same level the clouds were sitting, I'd say 20,000 ft and apeared to fly aerodynamically, banking side to side and turning (not rotating) but continuing on the same flight path.  The three were in a staggered trailing formation, maybe a couple miles of separation but not a uniformed distance from one to the other.  They were traveling the same speed however.  I went inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars, when I came back out the first three were out of visual range but there were two more just coming out of the storm.  I was able to focus in on one and got a good look.  It kept banking back and forth in a side to side motion, it almost appeared like it was having fun doing whatever it was doing.

It followed us either in front of us or to the left of us.  As we reached our destination and pulled into the parking lot it continued to follow us.  We sat in the car looking at it once we turned off the car and got out it disappeared behind some trees.  We did not see it again. Both myself and the driver are educated individuals and have never seen anything like that before.  WE have told a couple of people but no one believes us. My father and another friend were following us in two different cars the girl that was following us did not see anything.  My father on the other hand says he did not see anything but I think that he did because as soon as we got out of the car and into our meeting place he asked us what we saw. I think he saw it and is just scared to admit it.,2001-08-05T00:00:00,41.66651057471264,-83.59862988505748

Becaue of the close experience, I conclude that persons seriously interested in subject matter may gain from our report. It was a warm Friday evening at around 09:00 PM in Valencia California (Old Orchard II). I was cleaning swimming pool because our children would swim the next day. To clean the pool I used a long pole with an attached brush. As I moved my arm up the pole I turned my head to the rear and saw a craft headed in my direction at a low altitude and with lights on the front. What caught my attention was the width and pancake layout of the lights. As I stared at it for about 8-10 seconds, I realized it was not a helicopter (I have group propulsion systems background and aeronautical engineering studies). I ran toward the back patio door (about 20 feet away) and called to my wife and children to come out and see it. My wife was the only one who did. As I turned with her to look, the craft was now directly over our house and stationery. Perhaps, the swimming pool lights attracted it. It was about 75 feet above us for 40 seconds. It made no sound, had circular windows in the lower portion of the upper dome, it had no visible connections and appeared as it were one solid piece, the skin was metallic, silver and shiny. We noticed a rectangular window about 8-10 feet long and 4 feet wide in the frontal leading edge but just beneath the front circular edge. There was an orange, redish light emanating from inside but could not see any occupants. The craft moved as if it were caught in a slight breeze but made no sound. It angled forward and downward for a few seconds. We could see rectangular shapes (2) that ran the diameter of the craft under the concave bottom. We also saw two ski like devices in the front lower side that seemed as hanging or docking devices rather than skis because they were to far in front of what I considered a center of gravity of the craft. The craft had a diameter of at least 75-100 feet with a height of at least a 1.5 story house. My wife kept repeating ""oh my god"" over and over again while I kept thinking take me with you! We decided not to discuss it but to draw what we each saw and then discuss it. I know this craft did not apply earthly technology. We will never forget the experience and continue to search the skies. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1980 is approximate.  Minor typos corrected at request of witness.

A roommate(I will refer to as R1) and I were waiting for our other roommate(R2) to get off work as we had her car when we decided to drive the four or five miles down to the local pond around midnight.The moon was full and we often went here to fish and swim so it was not unusual for us to be there. R1 was a single working mother who had known R2 for many years.R2 was a single hardworking girl and the three of us lived together and helped care for R1's two children and basically helped to support each other.I had recently separated from my wife and had originally went west to visit and old friend of mine. when we rounded the corner on the gravel road we immediately noticed something out of the ordinary.The pond had a slight rolling mist on it.I had been there many times at all hours and never seen that before.It was a beautifully clear and warm evening so we pulled up to the waters edge and turned the car off.As is usual in the upper foothills there is very little sound to be heard during the evening hours and this night was no different.The pond is roughly fifty yards across and perhaps 100 yards long and we were parked facing crossways to the pond-the other bank fifty yards away. We weren't there but a few minutes when the mist began to thicken and swirl abit which seemed odd as there was no wind.Suddenly just off the far shore some faint lights could be seen just below the mist.These lights soon became more eradic and pronounced and as they became stronger the mist on the pond got thicker and swirled more.Eventually the lights reached above the surrounding mist and appeared to be sparks of some sort generating from an origin then spewing outward as sparks tend to do as if someone was welding underwater.Clearly there were some things that just did not make sense however. The sparks all were shaped the same-an inverted ""V""-all of them,no random shapes as one would have expected to see.There was absolutely no sound whatsoever and at fifty yards on a mountain lake surrounded by pine trees you can normally hear a pin drop.Also the mist got to about two feet thick on the water but never spilled over the bank which was only 8 inches above the water.The sparks would then slowly decrease in intensity,the mist would become lighter just a thin layer swirling on the surface as it was when we arrived and it would become less aggitated as well.This whole cycle lasted maybe a few minutes at most. I think R1 and I watched the first cycle in complete silence not sure at all of what it was we had seen.We verified with each other that we had both seen it and got out of the car just as another exact same cycle began again and through it all we heard not one sound at all.R1 became silent at this point and it would be quite awhile before I would hear her speak again. Maybe it was the third or fourth cycle when I wanted to get a good look at what was going on and since we were facing the far bank I decided to reach back in the car and shine the headlights on it while it was in full swing.We recieved an immediate response and for the first time since we arrived I was afraid.The sparks immediately died away but the mist began to thicken to as much as seven or eight feet but it still did not spill over the bank.It began to swirl wildly and spotlights moved back and forth aross the edge of the mist.I say ""spotlights"" only to give some idea of there action because in actuality they were black box shapes moving back and forth as though searching the area.I mean black,everywhere they passed went black as coal.I can't explain it but thats what I was seeing. We quickly got back in the car and started it up no problem.R1 would not speak to me only stare out at the pond so I told her to watch the pond and I would carefully back out up the  road.I think I saw some color on her face because I stopped backing up and looked forward and realized something large and dark was rising above the mist and it had a red light on top of it.This light seemed fixed,not moving freely like the dark lights were.It's shape reminded me of a submarine but it was nearly as long as the whole pond and it was rising way to far from the water-I think I was seeing 2/3 of it and that was above the 8 foot wall of mist.The red light was facing forward on the vehicle(shining to our right) and slowly turned our direction as the whole thing began to turn towards us.I returned to the job at hand and carefully resumed my backing when something hit my side of the car hard enough to push us into the steep ditch I was trying to avoid.A return the following day to get the car out of the ditch revealed tire tracks that were proceding up the middle of the road then abruptly made a 90 degree slide sideways into the ditch some two feet or so yet there was no damage to the car. We were stuck in a steep ditch,no way to open the passenger door yet the next thing I remember was R1 standing outside the car reaching her hand to help me out.We were bathed in the red light.There was no sound.The object was no longer moving but was fully facing us some 20 yards away and I was petrified.When R1 helped me out of the vehicle I actually stopped to relieve myself before beating feet out of there.R1 is a large,strong woman and as hard as she was pulling I kept fighting to look back and the last I saw of it it was sitting on top of the mist staring directly at us. We moved up the main road back to our house as swiftly as we could but it became apparent that something was following us along the side of the road just inside the treeline and fear began to rise again. I remember nothing after that until we rounded the corner into our driveway on foot.We had arrived at the pond around midnight, watched three or four cycles and covered four or five miles it should not have been more than two or three am at most.It was in fact 7:30 am and the sun was up and the birds were chirping and R1 wasn't speaking to anyone not even to R2 who was impatiently waiting for us to return with her car.I explained what you just read and R1 only nodded at appropriate times to verify what I was telling her. R1 and I returned with a friend to pull the car out of the ditch (R1 would not again return to that place or let her kids swim there  for quite some time) and found the car as I stated and there was no sign of anything out of the ordinary.We searched the whole perimeter of the pond and saw not one thing that would help explain the happenings of the night before. R2 and I returned the next several nights to see many strange things,thankfully nothing to compare to the first in fact each night was completely different.What I can tell you is that we brought others there as witnesses that knew what had happened and on other nights we brought poeple that had no idea.R2 and I and one other person saw many strange events while all the others did not-some things going on within feet of us all.Each night before dark we swept the trails clean and set trip wires around the entire pond in hopes of foiling a hoax only to be denied the following morning.Some of the later events even had some audible traits-it really seemed to us that we were being toyed with and were completely helpless. I can't explain it,it is simply what I saw.It dramatically changed my life and I wish I could say it was entirely for the better but that would be untrue.You learn alot about your friends in situations like this.Some poeple simply cannot deal with things like this and that's a shame because that is when you need them most.You learn quickly to keep it to yourself.The most bizarre,the most overwhelming and unexplainable event in your life and you can't let it out.There is some tragedy in that as many of you know I'm sure.

While laying in bed watching the ""Honeymooners"" I began to hear a low-pitched humming noise that gradually grew louder. It was late, probably around 2200 hours. I sat up and opened the blinds to take a look.  Hovering outside at a height of around 10 meters was a saucer shaped craft of metallic construction. The total distance waway from my window was only about 50 feet. Encircling the outer edges of the craft were a series of lights, red, green, and blue. The lights created a soft glow about the craft, which was approximately 30 feet or so in diameter and rotated slowly as it hovered in place. The craft's hull seemed to have a bluish hue with a silver base color. The height of the craft was approximately 8-10 feet at the center, possibly a touch more. We lived on an old one-block dead end with only a few other homes on the street. Behind the craft was simply our next door neighbor's one story house, with a large pine tree off to the right and our garage off to the left. No other major lights were present (a couple street lights were on) and the sky was clear. The humming noise given off by the craft continued to pulsate throughout the encounter. I watched for 1-2 minutes and then ran to my mothers room to get a camera, almost falling over the kitchen table. She told me it must be a helicopter or something and I persisted to tell her that it was no helicopter. I couldn't find a camera so I sprinted back to get another look, but the craft had already begun to fly away. The last I could see of it was as it flew at a good distance behind the large pine tree in our yard (it faded behind it). ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I had noticed a bright star that seemed to very slowly be moving downward and toward us.  I told the others to look at the start that was moving toward us.  We had just stopped at an intersection. All was dark with the exception of the bright white light that was moving toward us. We were all frozen and the man driving the station wagon was also mesmerized at what we were seeing.  He comented ""It is probably a helicopter."" I told him "" But there is no sound."" As it got closer we could make a shape. It was a saucer like shape.  Finally, it was almost directly over us. Actually toward my side of the station wagon.  It was about as high as a two story house so we could see many details of this thing that was above us.  On the lower part of the UFO there was a bright light and it was surrounded by what seemed about a ten foot section area which all of a sudden started emiting different lights.  It almost seemed as if there was a pattern to the lights as they went in one direction then in another.  The lights emited were changing fast from white to yellow to blue to red and many other colors.  Then they stopped.  It almost seemed as if they were trying to communicate to us.  Above the area where the lights were being emited there were what seemed to be glass windows and I could make out things moving in there.  The shape of those things were exactly like a human being except the arms seemed to be very thin and long.  The man who was driving the station wagon got very anxious and said ""Let's get out of here.""  His mother agreed.  This UFO followed us for what seemed to be about five to ten minutes and as we were getting closer to the city lights it suddenly took off in the oposite direction.  It disappeared in what seemed to be an eyeblink.  I looked behind and noticed three military helicopters headed toward th! e genera l area where the UFO went.  We were silent all the way home.  We dropped off another of the students and then my boyfriend and I were dropped off at my mother's house.  We ran in and told her all about it.

Lights scanning our town,"Chard Town, Somerset",,1986-06-15T19:00:00,formation,2 hours,"Occurred : 6/15/1986 19:00  (Entered as : 06/00/86 19:00) Reported: 3/1/2002 4:42:29 PM 16:42 Posted: 3/19/2002 Location: Chard Town, Somerset,  Shape: Formation Duration:2 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22069.html,"Lights scanning our town Sorry for not knowing the exact date of my report as it happened so long ago but thought that you could add it to your files to see if anything matches. Firstly I have no reason to lie and I have 8 witness's. On this completely clear night, with all the stars on show my friends and I were playing in the local school fields. We were all about 15 to 16 years old. As the night started to draw in. We were looking at the stars now and then and when the light was fading rapidly we noticed a ball of light moving incredibly fast around the sky. It was clearly not a satellite as we all know what they look like nor was it standard aircraft. It was moving too fast and in all directions but for some reason not up or down just on the same plane. The object was basically 4 or 5 times brighter than the brightest star on view and would very roughly guess that it was anything from 5 to 7 miles up, based on the background of stars and the objects movements. We were all gob smacked at the site of this object and it's slow to fast and curved movements it was making. One witness I hasten to add ran home crying not wanting to accept or appreciate this thing, but the rest of us stayed. My Father was not there at this point but on another day, which I will get to. So on this night while watching this light dance about the sky we had a rabbiting lamp and proceed to flash at it for all it was worth. About 1/2 an hour passed by then this light became static and just hung there like any normal but bright star. This is the point where we knew we were seeing intelligent life elsewhere as what happened was an incredible sight. From this one bright light a second light shot out of it to the end of our towns edge and back at magnificent speed. A second light went to the other edge of our town, then a third, forth, fifth, etc, etc. In a minute or two we were seeing between 30 to 50 lights shoot out from this one main light covering the entire span of our town(roughly 18,000 population). The smaller lights coming from the main static light were the same brightness as a normal star but did not flicker like stars do, proving that they were roughly 5 to 7 miles away. The speeds of the smaller lights varied in speed but all were moving the same when they turned back to merge with the bright static light. The only way I can describe it is this way. Imagine a dart board and the bullseye the Bright light. From the Bullseye smaller lights shot out from it to the edge of the dart board and back again, sometimes 10, sometimes as many as 50 lights. After a while we all began to get neck ache through looking up for so long. After a while the 50 lights were going down to 40 then 30 and so on and I will never forget that one last light returning back to the bright light speeding up almost as if it didn't want to get left behind. This is silly I know, but that's how I felt about it. Once all the lights were back to the main bright light it just faded away. We all walked home feeling differnet things, but I for one felt privelleged. The only way I could describe what we saw is that it was scanning our town, whatever it was. But it was truely not from this earth due the speeds involved. 2nd part. the following night I had 2 witness's but will explain later what they saw. Directly outside my house I was looking up in the sky for more activity. This time I saw a large round sphere. It was like seeing an up turned hot air balloon but much too high up for one to be there, way too high. This round balloon had numerous coloured lights flashing different colours. I ran into my house to alert my Father and to grab my binoculars. Ballancing them on a fence post I got a much better view and could quite clearly see form and space between the lights which were square, hexagonal, octagonal, etc, but not round, all of which were attached to this sphere/balloon shaped craft. All the lights were changing colours many different colours. This event lasted roughly 10mins and the object I would guess was about 2 miles up above my house. Now here is the strangest part of this sighting. Like I said before I have no reason to lie and sit here writing all this for the fun of it that happened many years ago for me but this sighting my two friends with me could not see the object. I kept persistently pointing at it and it was clear as ever for me and to this day I have no explanation as to why they were unable to see what I could see.. My Father a total non believer in anything like this would never discuss or talk about it even now he will not talk about it and would niether admit seeing it or not. This has totaly confused me.

ATTN: Peter Davenport On or about 16 years ago, during the summer, my husband and I had returned home at 11 p.m.(maybe even a little later).  We noticed that our home lit up in this lime green light (like fllod lights were on in the house), in our living room we had a fish tank, and the air stone surged in power and was throwing the water as high as 2 ft. out of the tank.  Then when the light stopped the air stone went back to normal.  We had thought the high lines might have been struck, but when we asked the electric company, they said no.  I asked different people, line men, supervisors, etc...and they all said it had nothing to do with the lines.  This happened outside Gary Indiana in a single dwelling, inside was my husband and I, my 30 year old daughter who was taking care of a 2 1/2 year old boy, and my 16 year old daughter.

I don't remember the exact date, but it was a weekend sometime back in the spring of 1992 or 1993.  It was early afternoon, and I was driving with my girl-friend (now wife) northeast on Fitzwatertown Road in Willow Grove.  A fairly large, gray, metallic object, cone-shaped with a flat, circular bottom was moving at a slow pace (approx 30 mph) in a north-westerly direction, towards Willow Grove Naval Air Station.  I can only assume the object was solid, as the flat, circular bottom was dark, possibly cast in shadow.  There were no discernable markings at all. The sky was somewhat overcast and cloudy gray.  I saw it out of the driver's side front windshield for approximately 5 seconds, as it passed from right to left across my path.  It was flying rather low over the trees (possibly 200 ft high). Its altitude never varied, nor did its speed. It made no sudden movement, did not display any lights, nor did it make any discernable sound.  It seemed to be moving with purpose and direction.  My wife did not see it as she was reading something in the car at the time.  I didn't point it out to her either, as I wasn't sure what I was seeing, and had to keep an eye on the road as well, since I was still driving.  I can recognize most military aircraft in the US armed forces, from an A-10 Warthog to a P-3 Orion (both of which fly out of the Willow Grove Air Station).  I can say with certainty, that this was not a fixed-wing, nor rotor aircraft.  It did not look like a balloon or blimp of any sort I've seen in my lifetime.  I can only give you an idea of its size, by saying at arm's length it was about the size of a quarter.  I've never seen anything like it before or since.",2002-03-19T00:00:00,40.144,-75.1157

It was so large I couldn't quite believe what I saw, but kept driving unsafely, until I was another mile south. I was at an intersection near Ajo Way when this object seemed just as large as before. I stopped in the right lane of that intersection and a woman in a vehicle to my left seemed to see the object in the sky also, and we made eye contact. We both stopped and I pulled over to the shoulder. The object was a gigantic triangular shaped form. It was very dark gray in color with no lights or printing/insignias on it. This was a very brilliant day, with no clouds, so this object was clearly visible, and it was not a ""mirage"" or a cloud. I stayed parked at the roadside fore at least 3 minutes watching this object hover motionless over the Tucson International Airport and the Davis/Monthan Air Force Base area. It did ""hover motionless"" for that time, because I became very hot and thirsty, and also stunned at this sight. I can't recall anyone else stopping to view it, except that one woman I made eye contact with. She was gone. The large gray object ""dipped"" its wing, so I could see a dimension of how large it really was. It was like a city block long. Very suddenly, it disappearred. I was thinking I had a dream or a day-dream, but I know certainly I didn't. I was very sobor and I don't do any drugs, so I was very afraid to tell anyone about this. I told one person, but he said that I saw a new US ""secret bomber"". Nope. This object had a very definite triangular shape, made no sound, stood still in the sky for too long and would certainly have made great news, if reported to the authorities.

Soon it separated into 3 distinct lights, & I realized it was approaching. As it got closer I saw there were 3 lights, one at each corner of an aircraft. I stopped my truck in the middle of the road, & got out to watch. The craft flew directly overhead, was maybe 40 feet across, and made no sound of note. It seemed to be just above the tops of the trees, & I was puzzled that there would be no discernible engine noise. I don't recall being able to distinguish the surface of the craft, just seeing the three lights, & the triangular shape as it passed overhead. I assumed it was something headed to the Little Rock Air Force Base, though as I said, it was so quiet, & so low to the ground, that I was in awe.

The lights were directly ahead of us.  They were two objects, both identical, a good distance apart.  Each object had two distinct red triangular lights, and no noticable frame or body. The two lights on each craft alternated luminescence.  The object looked a little like this: <>, with each of the carats being a red light. The objects moved toward each other VERY slowly, blinking out of synch with each other.  After about seven minutes or so, the two objects met each other, and actually appeared to COMBINE, forming an object closer to a disc (of the same size) with four rotating red lights: <||>.  At this point, the object moved much faster, and dissappeared to the right of our view.  We got into our car and drove to the exit 56 onramp of I-95 in the hopes of catching up with it, but had no luck.  The craft dissappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was a reddish/pink colored light, that seemed to fade and brighten. Not Blink! at first the light stayed stationary at about 11 o'clock high. I then went and retrieved my Binoculars to get a clearer look at the object. Sure enough, it was the exact same light that I had seen before. It had 4 seperate bright points. Such as 4 engines would look, positioned at 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock and 9 o'clock.  The object then began to move eastward, VERY SLOWLY and it was at this time that I called 911 to see if anyone else had reported it. They informed me that I was not the only one to see it. They had a number of calls about it, and suggested that I call Gateway International Airport. I explained to the operator that if I were to go get my phone book, look up the number to the airport, and call them. The object would surely be gone.  This is what happened to me previously. So, instead, I just kept watching it. I then got a phone call from a friend out in east mesa, she wanted to know if I was also aware of the light in the sky. I said yes. We then kept in contact via the phone all the way through the total sighting. It finally disappeared at about 7:20pm after moving as far east as i60 and Gilbert road. It got real bright, real dim, real bright, etc., etc. Then all of a sudden, It was gone. I truly hope that someone will find out what it is that I have had the luck to view 2 times now.

I have watched the sky for most of my life and have never seen anything like this.  I have seen the comets in recent time - Hale Bopp and Halley's - but they looked nothing like this. More importantly, I have been seeing lights in the southeastern sky from where I live in northeastern VT for a few weeks.  They are clearly visible on a clear night.  I don't think that these lights are the normal star/planet sightings eventhough they are visible in the sky at dusk when the sky gets dark.  They seem to be suspended in the night sky at the tail of a constellation, which I cannot name since I don't know them that well.  They only move in the sky as the night goes on and as the constellation moves in the night sky.  The reason I feel they are different is that they appear to be flashing red, green and white lights.  This is visible clearly with binoculars.  They are much further out in the sky than any aircraft, because I have seen aircraft fly in the sky at altitudes that are are very high at the same time I am observing the flashing lights and the aircraft is far below these lights.  As the night progresses I can see other lights (not stars, I don't think) appear over the horizon from the northeast.  They seem to form a very large triangle in their positon in the night sky with this lower brighter object.  The two additional light points in the sky (also flashing colors) appear to be much further away than the one I can clearly see at dusk and thereafter. Can you tell me anything about them or has anyone else seen them?",2001-02-18T00:00:00,,

Let me give you some background information as to my location....I live in a rather remote area, 15 miles from the nearest town.  The few neighbors that i have were asleep at the time of the sighting, as was my husband.  I was awake at 0100 hours to ""let my dog out"" to defecate...I have a back wood deck and behind the deck is a partially wooded area (Oak trees)and a very remote/unpopulated area that stretches on for approximately one half mile to the large foothills (1/2 mile away).  I stood on my back deck as my dog walked the remote area behind my deck (as aforementioned above)...I looked out at the night sky, as I often do, and was immediately drawn (my eye caught sight of) a VERY bright light that was directly over the nearest foothill to me  (this area would be to the west)...The object, as mentioned, would change colors (MUCH more dramatically than the twinkling i have seen of a ""star"", and I could directly visualize in the very clear night sky, the silhouette of the foothill-top with large trees/etc as ""points of reference"".  It was in using these ""points of reference"" that I was able to watch the object move (what i would term 'gently float' left to right then up and down....I estimate that it would move within 1/4 - 1/2 mile of its original place in the sky, as it moved right-left and up and down....At no time did i see it land on the hill, but at times it appeared to be no more than perhaps 100 feet or so from the hilltop.  I watched the object for about 5-10 minutes outside, and then returned inside to inform my husband.  My husband was asleep, and thereby I COULD not inform him at the time (Needless to say i ! did try to wake him up..but my attempt was futile).  I went into my daughters room and watched the object through her levolor blinds for about an hour more...It was still continuing with the same readily apparent movements and color changes.....

I did NOT see the light at this time, however it was 2230 hours, and I had visualized the phenomena at 0100 hours on the 29th.... However, as I scanned the night sky, almost directly overhead i observed what i immediately thought to be a ""satellite""..I am familiar with satellites, in that I have witnessed them as a very small, non-blinking white light that moves in a straight path across the sky... It is my opinion that it is almost HARD to actually get the chance to SEE a satellite, as they are small and are not always in your area of the sky... However, I witnessed this small, white, non-blinking or color changing light fly overhead north-east to a south-west.  I verified that it was flying east-west via (3) methods:  #1.  The foothills I have spoken of seperate my region from the coast and the San Simeon/Hearst Castle area of California..The foothills are thereby to the west of me.   #2.  I have an online map program that verified MY address and located San Simeon to be (as the map verified)to my exact West...The object flew overhead and to the south-west slightly....Within about 20 seconds I saw a second, identical object fly in the same trajectory as the first (as if following it)...and within about 30 seconds, a third, also identical object passed along that same path/trajectory... I immediately thought that this was unusual because satellites do not tend to be so close together....For the next few seconds I did not watch the objects, but then when i looked above to approximately the same area i had first observed the first object, I noticed that there were now (3) objects (I believe them to be th! e same a s the objects I just mentioned), that at first came together (As if they might collide) then they began to do what i call 'dance"" around one another in a figure eight type or elyptical pattern... I watched the objects about another 30 seconds (I had already been out watching them several minutes TOTAL by then), but I began to become a bit frightened, as I had NEVER seen any planes, etc. perform circling/figure-eight type movements around one another...I went back inside and tried to inform my husband, who, again, was unable/unwilling to confirm my sighting.  I made an immediate call to your report line, and this written follow-up is consequent to that.

I am not reporting what I saw but rather what I didn’t see. Cloudless afternoon, north bound on the 55 fwy between the Katella and Lincoln turnoffs. The fwy in front of me is a very shallow bowl so you can see a lot of the fwy coming up. A large shadow passed (moving north) on my left side, I’d say approx. 150 mph. I instinctively looked up to see what it was. I saw nothing. I looked back at the fwy and watched the shadow move from the left side of the fwy to the right (the distance north, covering approx. 1 mile). Alternately watching the shadow and looking up to see what it was, I never saw anything. At one point, the shadow covered the entire fwy, both sides, plus what I’d estimate to be the width of two extra lanes on either side. The fwy, counting the emergency lanes and diamond lanes is 10 lanes. That would put the shadow somewhere between 125 and 140 feet wide. The reason I’m recording this now is I saw something on TV last week about a new camouflage being used with tanks, how they can transmit a picture of something on one side of an object to the other side, rendering it virtually invisible. When I saw the program, it seemed plausible this is what I’d observed. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2001-11-20T00:00:00,33.805629234338745,-117.8263324825986

My wife and I were driving west on Pleasant Grove Blvd., Roseville, CA, approaching Washington Blvd., when she sighted some objects coming toward us from behind and above a Chevron station located on the NW corner of the intersection.  At first, I thought the objects might be large birds, but as they neared, I could see no wings, nor did they seem to act like birds.  They were in a close group.  I turned left (south) on Washington Blvd., went one block, u-turned, and parked the car at Diamond Oaks Blvd. and Washington Blvd.  We both got out of the car and continued to observe the objects. There were six objects, all oval-shaped, no sound, and were maneuvering in various patterns, close to each other.  At the nearest point to us, they were approximately 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon, i.e., not directly overhead.  These objects moved under their own power and performed fascinating maneuvers.  For example, they formed three pairs in a loose triangular shape, they would move into straight lines, into a semi-circle, into two groups of three forming a 'delta wing', then move into a curve, etc.  Two or three times, the objects moved away from us, but then they would move in an arc, change from white to bright silver, and come back near us.  At one point, they reversed direction, but without performing a turn.  It was difficult to determine the size of the objects or their distance from us, but I had a strong feeling that binoculars would have been the perfect tool for studying these things, i.e., they were just slightly beyond my ability to see exact detail. As an experiment, my wife removed her sunglasses for a moment, and said that the objects could barely be discerned, as they matched the sky's background nearly perfectly.  But with sunglasses on, they were very discernable.  After five to ten minutes, the objects again formed into two groups of three in a delta shape, and I watched them as they rapidly moved in a north-east direction and vanished into the sky.

I have friends that invited me up to view the annual event.  The streets of the high mountain community were crowded with thousands of people. The fire works started a little after 9:00.  At about 9:20 a bright steady light was observed moving at a rate that could not be explained.  There were no flashing lights that could be observed on the object.  It moved in form the west toward the east.  It then came back around to complete a circle around which the Fireworks where at the center.  As the fireworks were going off it made 3 or 4 more circles.  The first time it took about 1 min to complete the circle.  The circle it made was at least 10 mile across.  Which I figured it would have to be moving at about 1800 miles an hour to make the loop in 1 min.  It moved slower on the other times around taking about 1 ½ min to make the trip.  As it completed the last circle it split into 2 objects and it looked like it dropped straight down without slowing.  At the bottom of the drop it merged back into 1 object.  It then moved off back in the direction it came from over the mountains. With as many people at this event someone must have video taped it.,2001-08-05T00:00:00,34.2557,-117.304

Wife and I were returning from a cinema in Tempe.  We live near Mobile and drive this route to and from the valley daily.  We were westbound, approaching the Queen Creek Road overpass at I-10E at approximately 1/4 mile.  At that  point, the road curves to the southwest as it crosses the interstate. As we were comming out of the curve, and at the same moment, we both saw a bright orange fireball traversing the sky originating from the south and moving in a direction toward the northwest.  This object was situated approximately 20 degrees off of the horizion and moving apparently parallel with the horizion.  It did have a long tail, approximately 10 times its diameter which was also bright orange.  We live 20 miles southwest of the valley (by way of the crow flys) separated from the valley by South Mountain and the Sierra Estrella range.  Thus,we experience very little reflective light from the metro, so viewing the night sky is a nightly occurrance. We routinely observe shooting stars, civilian and military aircraft and even military arial flares lighting the Barry Goldwater Bombing Range 20 miles to the southwest of our home. This object was in the wrong part of the sky, and not moving like an arial flair.  For the past 10 days or so, Mars has been very bright in the southern sky.  By comparison, this orange fireball was at least 12 times the diameter of our view of Mars.  I phoned Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, AZ within moments of the sighting from my celphone and later in the week.  They have no record of such a sighting.  If it was a meteor, it was a large one.  I thought it might have been a satelite comming out of orbit, but then again, it was so large.  Has the military reported anything missing that night?",2001-08-05T00:00:00,,

I've seen UFO's three times in my life.  Once during the daytime when I was twelve, and two more night-time sightings as an adult.  This isn't counting strange lights or something you're just not sure of, these are actual craft that I could see clearly.   Anyway, my most memorable encounter happened on the night of February 4, 1996 at about 11:00 at night.  At the time I was living in Brandon, Manitoba but the man I was seeing (now my husband) lived in Winnipeg, which is where I live now.  As he had two small children from a previous relationship that were with him every weekend, it was much easier for me to make the trip in by myself than for him to come out to see me and bring the kids with him (they were two and three at the time).  So every Friday night I would drive into Winnipeg and return home Sunday night, usually leaving around 9:00.  I would invariably be tired and anxious to get home, so the lights at the Carberry intersection at Highway 5 on the #1 was always a real landmark that I watched for because it meant I only had half an hour left before I was home.  I was always glad to see the lights at that intersection as I approached it. On this particular night it was quite cold and I had left Winnipeg a little later than usual.  After checking my watch and doing some calculations I was thinking that by the time I hit the intersection it would be pretty much exactly 11:00 which meant I would be home by 11:30.  Having driven this stretch of highway so often I knew exactly when to expect to see the Carberry lights.  As they came into view, I noticed that there were two other lights hovering just above the streetlights.  I kept watching these lights as I drove and they didn't move at all, up or down or side to side.  From the time I first saw the lights to the time I reached the intersection was about 7 km.  As I got closer and closer I could tell that these lights were hovering immediately above the streetlights, I'd say 10-15 feet above them.  Let's say that the poles are 60 feet and the UFO was 15 feet above that, that would make it about 75 feet off the ground - pretty darn close! As I approached the intersection, I could see the thing that was making the lights was on the other side of the streetlights, so I couldn't really see anything more than a dark saucer sharp as I drove through the intersection because I couldn't see past the glare of the streetlights.  It wasn't until I was completely through could I look up and clearly see the UFO.  I was driving in the passing lane because as I was coming up to the intersection there was a white van in the right hand lane that wasn't travelling quite as fast as I was, so I was in the left lane going around it.  We were travelling pretty close together as we passed through the intersection, so I know someone else had to have seen this. I was looking at this thing the entire time as I got closer to it.  As I got past the glare, it suddenly came into very sharp view.  I was driving directly underneath it, it was right above me!  I couldn't believe what I was seeing!  It was round and flat.  I couldn't really see the top of it, but the bottom was very clear.  The two lights that I had seen were different colours, but I honestly can't remember what they were now, it's been too long.  Blue and white, maybe.  Anyway, there was a third light as well on the bottom of this thing (this one was red, I think), which is where the first two were - on the bottom of the craft.  I remember thinking at the time that the thing must have been tilted towards the west and that was why I hadn't seen the third light until then.  I saw two other vehicles on the other side of the highway headed east towards Winnipeg and thought that they must have seen three lights as they approached from the other direction instead of two as I had.  It was hovering over the left side of the highway, not in the middle, so my car drove directly underneath.  I looked up at it and thought how it looked just like something out of a movie.  It was metallic, dark but shiny, reflecting the lights from below.  It was covered with what looked like machinery of some sort, all curvy tubes and pipes, all over the bottom of it except around the edge.  It was somewhere around 35 feet across and I did not hear any noise emanating from it at all (over the road noise, of course).  It was only about 75 feet off the ground so I got a really good, close look at it. I have wished heartily ever since that I had pulled over for a better look, but I didn't.  First, it was late and I was tired and I had to be at work at 7:00 the next day so I really wanted to get home to bed.  Secondly, it was the middle of winter and it was, as I mentioned earlier, fairly cold.  Also, I was by myself.  If I had been with someone else I probably would have been braver.  And I was in the passing lane - you can't stop on the shoulder of the passing lane. Anyway, that's what I saw that night.  I did arrive home at 11:30, so there was no weird time loss or anything like that.  I'd be interested to know if anyone else reported seeing anything there that night.",2002-03-19T00:00:00,,

Me and two of my friends were standing at the four corners of Killawog at about dusk. I really don't know the exact date, but I know it was in May of 95'. We saw three sphere like lights come over a hill from the north. The first one we saw was yellow. When it first came into my view it was about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile away. It looked to be about the size of a car. After about 30 seconds it disappeard from our view by going over a hill to our north-east. About 10 seconds later the second light appeared. This one was much larger (about the size of a medium size house)and was glowing bright red. It took the same exact path that the first one did. About ten seconds after that, the third on appeared over the same hill and took the same exact route. This one was the exact size and color as the first one. They were all moving very slow. Too slow to be planes. No sound either, so they couldn't have been helicopters. Plus there were no blinking lights. Only a glowing sphere. We could not make out any shape either, just light. I do remember that it was a thursday though, because the following thursday I had a different friend with me and I got to see one more. This time I was about 300 yards further up the road, in my yard. There is a hill about 50 yards behind my old house(north) that is about 80-100 feet high and very steep. The light that I saw that night was coming over that hill. It appeared to be the same exact size and color as the yellow ones that I had seen a week before. Just as soon as I pointed and yelled to my friend, ""Look! I told you I wasn't lying!"", the object seemed to spin 180 degrees and disappear from our sight back over the hill. Sorry no pictures. To tell you the truth, I didn't even think of it. I don't think I could have gotten to a camera fast enough. Plus I might have missed something! ((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from same source.

I was traveling east exiting the city of Woodlake (a rural community, population about 6000, at the edge of the foothills) headed for Lake kaweah which is a small lake with apprx. 22 miles of shoreline when full. Where I made the sighting is about one or two miles west of the lake, as the crow flies, and about five miles east of the Woodlake city limits. It was dusk, about 8:30pm as I rounded a bend that led to the winding road through the foothills. There are two peaks about 500ft+ tall with a small valley between them. As I drove by I glanced up and noticed what looked to be a large water tank setting in the valley between the two peaks with red and green lights, alternated around the upper most rim. They were lit. I could see the curvature of the upper rim. I noticed what appeared to be the seams between the panels used to make the wall of the tank. In retrospect, it must have been huge because it filled over 50% of the space between the two peaks. I could not see the bottom of it as it was hidden behind the crest of the hill between the peaks. As I drove I said to myself, "" Hum! I've been through here hundreds of times and have never seen that tank before"", then it hit me there can't be any tank up there. I was meeting people at the lake and was in a hurry so didn't turn back to investigate. I purposed to come back the next day on the way home and sure enough it was gone; I have never seen it since. No one else from the area that I have talked to has seen anythig like it before but I am told there is an old Indian grave yard up there in the same vicinity. One lady from Woodlake told me she has seen a cigar shapped UFO in the area before. As far as I know there are no access roads up thereh except a few dirt fire roads.

To the best of our knowledge, the event had no special Biblical significance, although the Bible is not our specialty here.  PD)) The Book of Yahweh On Oct 13, 2000 we were keeping the first day of Tabernacles... in fact it was just a very few min. after sundown which begins the day and we looked up in the sky not too high and a vessel traveling at a great speed but putting out a lot of smoke from behind it was spotted.  Within moments it passed almost directly overhead traveling to the North and all of a sudden split up into 4 different parts... almost like an explosion.  One of the Abilene, Texas News crews actually had some footage on this thing but it seems as though it got hushed up pretty quickly.  I know that I would like to know more about it, and in a biblical sense think it's splitting up into four parts has to do with a prophesy of these end times. In fact the date given may actually be Oct 12th as it was actually the 13th after sundown, but following the Roman Catholic thing... it would have been the 12th until midnight.  The 13th was actually 7 years exactly from the time that the Peace Agreement for Israel was ratified and went into effect... exactly 7 years to the date of this sighting from the time the Peace Agreement was ratified!  Looking at the Peace Treaty... it was active exactly 3 1/2 years, and went out of effect for exactly 3 1/2 years when the sighting occoured!  A time, times and the dividing of a time... found in Revelations and also spoken of by the prophets.  October 13th was the date of the sealing of the Servants of Yahweh and in Revelations it speaks about the four Malakim (known to all the world as angels.. but angels are messangers of Satan and follow Her every command) that are holding back the winds of war so it doesn't hurt the earth, sea nor any tree... Revelations 7:1-8.  October 13th the servants were sealed and the Malakim were only holding the winds of war back until this sealing. I know this sounds far fetched and like I've fallen off my rocker... maybe I have given you too much information that you feel is not relevant?  None the less, all these gods are doing is tresspassing on the earth under the Devil's control and She has only a short time to bring utter destruction to all mankind.  Her angels are what you find flying around in these space vessels.  The neandrethal man they found and did DNA testing on and found it to have no human DNA was one of these gods... one of the children of Yahweh... at least he created them too.  The vessel we saw that evening that broke up into four parts... right after the sealing of the remenant of the 144,000 the winds of war may have been released. Can you give me further information on what this vessel did after it split apart and where the other parts ended up?  I would not be supprized to hear that one landed at the Vatican to talk with the pope to hurry up and get the destruction under way as soon as possible.  We believe that Satan Herself is a guest in the Vatacan.. delivered by one of the vessels that come out of the comet that came forth from Jupiter somewhere around the exact time that the Peace Treaty went out of effect... 3 1/2 years after it went into effect 7 years ago on October 13th.  One of the vessels went over NM from what I understand and the other over the Vatacan... the city that sits on 7 hills... you can read about this place in Revelations 17:1-18, read it for yourself... remember in verse 9 it talks about this woman who has on her head written:  MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.... verse 9 says, ""And here is the mind which has wisdom:  The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.  We believe this woman..Satan the Devil now sits there in the Vatacan that sits on seven mountains... Rome is her new home.  She was cast down.. Revelations 12:9 says, ""And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, who DECEIVES THE WHOLE WORLD.  She was cast out into the earth, and her angels were cast out with her.""  Has to do with the dates!  Remember when we had said that transmissions of S.O.S. were comming from Jupiter, and then all of a sudden this comet called....""LEVI"" comes out of almost nowhere and bombards Jupiter for 6 days but stopped on Friday before Sundown... which begins the Sabbath.  Hit it with 21 big old rocks and then all of a sudden this other ""comet"" comes out from ...""behind""  Jupiter and heads directly toward the earth?????  Then this big old block of so called ""Ice"" explodes a short way out from earth... into two seperate chunks of ""ice""????  When's the last time you saw a chunck of ""Exploding Ice????""  Satan is here! my frie nds and sits with the pope who is about to take over the Holy Land.. as prophesied that it would be given to the gentiles. Now then please let us know what ocoured to those four parts of that one vessel that came to earth?  Can, or will you tell me where they ended up... United Nations building, Vatican, Moscow, White House.....????  Where???  Your help would be greatly appreceiated.  Thanks!",2000-12-02T00:00:00,32.266,-99.5342

I live in Jenks OK, which is about 10 miles south of downtown Tulsa. I work as an overnight television broadcast engineer.  I had slept most of the day since I worked the previous overnight. It was 7:20pm CDT.  It was pretty cloudy everywhere except to the southwest, to the horizon.  I could also see Venus clearly.  I had just stepped outside when I saw a moving light to the southwest.  It was about a fist at arms lenghth above the horizon moving north.  There seemed to be a bright spot/point or two on the front of the object and it was leaving a very distinct trail that had a sort of shimmer to it.  I watched the object for about 30 seconds and it probably moved 90 degrees across the sky.  It went behind some clouds, so after the first 10 seconds I would see it, then lose it... until it disappeared for good behind heavy cloud cover to the northwest and north. Maybe because of the trail, I figured that it must have been a plane, (I live near a small airport so I see lots of lights in the sky) but it just didn't seem right for a plane.  I really thought that it looked like some fireballs that I have seen in the sky and on tv/videos.  I thought that it would start to break up at any moment, but it just never did. This is the best part.  The trail that it left stayed in the sky for another 10-15 minutes.  It must have been high enough to catch the last glint of sunlight because as the sky got darker, the trail went from a shimmer to a glow!  It was like a beam of light, as bright as the full moon, across the southwesten sky.  It really was a sight.  I took some 35mm photos but we'll see how they turn out. I ain't Ansel Adams. My wife said it was just ""the conditions"" that caused it.  OK.  But what is it about ""the conditions"" that are so different that I keep seeing things in the sky that I have never seen before?

It was just after 8pm on Friday night, the 13th of October, 2000.  I was out in the Elsea Unit of Oregon settling in for dinner in my vehicle after a day of hunting.  The area I was in is west of Eugene.  I parked at the very top of one of the highest mountains in the area, right at the edge of a clear-cut. I could see for miles over the tops of many surrounding mountains.  The sunset was at 6:33pm that night.  There was a bank of clouds flowing filling the valleys and another wave of clouds floating over the mountain tops.  I looked up at the horizon and saw some small lights in the distance.  I figure that they are maybe 5 miles away.  The lights are white for the most part and changed in intensity. The color would sometimes be yellow or red.  The group consisted of four lights that would ""dance""; or ""play"" around in a relatively tight grouping.  About the area of a dime at arms length. My first thought was that they were other hunters traversing the mountains. From my vantage point however, I could see they were above the other mountains and moving much too fast for a car or truck viewed from this distance.  A couple times one of the lights would dip down into a valley, but never low enough to go out of sight.  The light dipping into the valley meant that it couldn't be lights of a distant town flickering through the clouds.  After a couple minutes, I noticed another group to the right of the first. It was more of a line of 5-6 light closer together.  The way they flickered made me believe that they were flames of a large fire.  That was until one from the first group moved over to join the line. A few seconds later, it or another one returned to the first group.  Roughly five minutes had elapsed before I realized I had the digital camcorder.  I climbed outside to get a better shot.  It took several tries to get anything to show up on tape due to the distance in the dark. I switched it to infrared.  Nothing. I turned up the gain. It worked.  The lights and tree tops were present although fairly grainy.  I managed to get one minute recorded to tape before the clouds became too thick.

It was moving in a straight line from North to South but much faster than a cloud and did not change shape until it disappeared beyond other houses.  There was no noise, no distinguising lights.  It appeared the size of my thumb and forefinger extended at arms length and would have traveled from horizon to horizon in less than 15 seconds.

I saw what I believe to be one and or several UFO's while at our cottage, located on the NE Shoreline of Anvil Lake(approx 8 miles East of Eagle River )in Wisconsin.Our lake is approx 390 acres, and most of the residents there are seasonal(as are we)therefore, there are very few residents on the lake in the winter.What I saw occured on 12/31 @ approx 1145pm(and no, I had had nothing stonger than diet-pepsi to drink,despite the fact that it was New Years Eve).I was the only person in our cottage, as everyone else was out celebrating NY Eve, and I had decided to stay there and read a book.I was sitting in a lazyboy chair.The view from this chair overlooks the lake(the shoreline is 75 ft from our cottage),with an 8 ft glass patio door facing the lake.I have vertical blinds covering the glass,and the blinds were almost completely closed.As I was sitting down,reading,I saw a bright neon green stream of light shoot by(I could see this through the sm openings that remained on the blinds).I then saw a bright red stream of light go by, and it looked to me like it was a short distance from the shoreline over the lake.I got up from the chair and approached the patio door, fully expecting that someone who was staying on the lake was shooting off fireworks in anticipation of celebrating NY eve at midnight.I peeked out of the blinds(I didn't actually open them up)and saw what was approx 6 bright balls of light, that looked to be about a foot in diameter.Some of these were a very bright red, and the others were a bright neon green.They were moving rapidly and seemed to be leaving trails of light behind them.(The most accurate comparison I can make to this is that they looked like when a child plays with a sparkler on the 4th of July, where one can see the trail of where the tip of the sparkler has been).These balls of light were traveling very fast,but staying in one general area directly in front of our cottage.They were approx 300 ft away from me,over the lake,and approx 150 ft high.They were moving in that one are! a,changi ng directions rapidly, making loops, etc,but never left that one area,They never actually descended down to the ice, nor traveled away from there(to me they almost seemed  to be electrically charged or something).A second or two after I first observed all the balls of light,I looked directly above them and saw 2 large stationary lights.These lights were directly above all the moving balls of light, and were about 3 ft in diameter/2 feet high each. The stationary lights were the same color red and green as the things below them, but were flashing or pulsating.They looked identical to one another in size and were at the exact same height(there was about 75 ft distance inbetween these large lights).It was very difficult to see an exact shape, as it's very dark on the lake, and because of the brightness of the larger lights it was almost like looking at headlights on bright, where it's difficult to distinguish what's around the lights, but I thought I saw a rim of dark grey metal along the backside of the large lights.The metal appeared to have multiple slats along the edge, as though they were vents of some sort, and I got the impression that it was the outer edge of something, and that the 2 large lights were connected/part of this metal thing.The balls of light continued to travel in the same area directly below the stationary lights,never going above the big lights,nor any further than about 30 ft to the left or right of the big lights(I got the impression that they were shooting along the outside of some larger thing connected to the 2 large pulsating lights).Once I noticed the metal along the back edge,I became frightened,believing at that point that I was looking at something not of this earth.I distinctly remember thinking it was going to shoot down a ray of light to the ice, so I looked beneath it and could clearly see the ice below all of this.I would guess that I probably initially looked at all of this for approx 2 minutes, before seeing the metal part and moving away from the window.We also have! a large picture window overlooking the lake with the drapes wide open and a chandalier type light lighting up this room which was on.I pulled the plug on this light, as I would have had to walk in front of this window to turn off the light at the switch and didn't want to be seen by anyone/anything(As I was alone and stunned by what I was seeing,I didn't know what to do, and had no phone or believe me I would have dialed 911 at that point)!After I pulled the plug to turn off the light, I went to the picture window to close the drapes, and the view from this window prior to closing the drapes was the same as what I have described from the other window.I then went to the room furthest away from the lake,which is by our backdoor, as I wanted to be as far away from whatever was out there as I could be.I stood by the back door for I would guess about 10 minutes, before going back to peek out the patio door,and everything I had described earlier was gone.I never saw any of the lights leave and was deliberately not looking anywhere near those windows as I was afraid, I guess, of what else I might see.After I got over the shock of what I had seen, and was sure that whatever I had seen was gone, I looked more closely out over the lake, and saw a small triangle shape of light(red,green and white lights) all the way across the lake almost to the shoreline directly opposite ours.I have no idea what this was, nor if it was related to what I had seen earlier(although other than the colors being similiar it didn't seem to be related).However, there is no house over there and I have no idea what this could have been.I looked with a pair of binoculars and could clearly make out the lights, but it was very small, even with the binoculars.I didn't see this triangular thing move at all.I looked at it  periodically, and it remained there for several hours, as I recall it was still there at 2am and was gone when I looked again about 230am before going to bed.I should also note that we have a dog(3 yr old siberian huskey/yellow lab)w! ho alert s at any type of movement/noise around the cottage, and he did not move at all during this event.I also heard absolutely no noise,nor saw any blowing snow around the lights, which one would expect with any kind of hovering type craft like a helicopter.We had to leave the cottage early the next day to return to our home, and I have not talked with anyone else on the lake to see if they may have seen anything that night.If anyone else did see anything,I will certainly inform you of this.

On August 18, 2001 my brother-in-law and I were camping under the stars at Stone Coral, which is located in the remote northern regions of Washoe County, Nevada. Shortly after settling into our sleeping bags, my brother-in-law directed my attention to a moving triangle in the sky directly above us, passing from North to South. It actually appeared to be three satellites, but at the moment I wasn't certain. I grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look and I could see stars passing between the points, satisfying my curiosity that these were indeed three independent objects, rather than one solid object. What was unusual was that they were moving in a perfect triangular formation. From my perspective, their distance apart from each other was about two finger-widths at arm's length. I looked at my watch to note the time. It was 10:51 p.m. After about a minute or two, the lead object faded out followed by the trailing objects seconds later.  Due to the late hour, and the location at which they faded, and the fact that they were moving slower than the average satellite, I concluded that they were much higher than the garden-variety low-Earth orbit satellites. After arriving home a few days later, I checked several of the satellite tracking web sites on the Internet in an attempt to identify what we saw. According to those databases, there were no satellites passing over that location at that particular moment. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the report may address a sighting of military/intelligence satellites, launched and orbitting in formation, but which do not appear in any publicly posted tables of orbitting objects.  The description above by the witness seems to us consistent with a sighting of orbitting satellites.  Similar reports should appear in future postings, if these objects are satellites, and if they continue orbitting for an extended period of time.    We include below a recent missive from Mr. Ed Cannon, noted ""amateur"" satellite watcher and space ""buff"" from Texas, who has been kind enough to keep us apprised of those events that seem to have a bearing on some of our reports posted here.  Mr. Cannon can be reached at:  Ed Cannon [ecannon@mail.utexas.edu].

I don't get anywhere near the e-mail that you do -- and I have trouble keeping up with mine -- so I know what you mean about  accumulated e-mail. You may certainly use my name and e-mail address with my notes.  (Regarding the NOSS triangles or trios or triplets, a suspected fourth set was launched a few weeks ago, but so far as I've heard, to date only two objects [not counting the launch vehicle] have appeared.  If this does prove to be another of the new-type NOSS triangles, we can expect a 33% increase in sightings of them.)

I was travelling back from the Santa Barbara area over Highway 154 (Northeast, towards the Santa Ynez Valley) when both my mother (the driver of our vehicle) and myself (seated in the passenger seat) witnessed a very low flying, extremely large, ""boomerang"" shaped craft fly over the mountain top.  We witnessed it approximately 1 mile or 1-1/2 miles ahead and above us. Highway 154 is a curvaceous road that has been cut into the contours of the Los Padres Forest mountains overlooking Santa Barbara, California.  At the top of the pass there is a sort of ""gouge"" or small cleft in the mountain tops, where the pass reaches its summit before descending into the Santa Ynez Valley. It was my mother who first pointed the craft out to me.  We had our car windows rolled up.  Therefore, we were unable to discern at to whether or not the craft made any noise.  It caught my attention for a number or reasons.  Some of which I outline below. 1.  It was larger than any conventional aircraft that I know of, including the huge military personel and equipment carrier planes that occassionally are seen flying from the vicinity of Vandenberg Airforce Base (Lompoc, California = approximately 35-45 miles from the Los Padres Forest witness site). 2.  It was ""boomerang"" or chevron shaped, much the same as pictures I have seen of stealth bombers.  I could roughly make out its shape because of the time of day in which it was seen.  The event took place during dusk/sunset.  I watched it fly and then bank near the summit of the Santa Barbara side of Hwy. 154.  I watched it on this side of the mountain for approximately 30-40 seconds. 3.  I have never seen anything, other than a rare helicopter, fly so close to the summit/mountain top.  The craft was witnessed by us to be heading over the summit of the 154 pass, towards the Santa Ynez Valley.  It was approximately 200-300 feet from the summit/mountain top.  This placed it very close to the cleft in the mountain pass when it banked to the right.  This banking maneuver struck me as unusual for something so large.  I brought this to the attention of my mother. 4.  It had 3 white lights at each point of its chevron shape.  This also struck me as unusual because I am under the awareness that all conventional aircraft must use red and green lights.  As the craft made the banking maneuver it ""turned on"" some red lights which seemed to ""pulse"" more than to blink.  These were only on a few seconds.  My mother witnessed these also.  Thereafter, on the Santa Ynez side of the mountains, at a distance of about 3+ miles, I witnessed the object for a short time  (approximately 20-30 more seconds) to be flying very close to the ridge tops of some neighboring foothills.  I pointed out to my mother that I thought that the object was SO large still, even though it was getting further away from us.  Its sheer size is and was a mystery to me.  When I viewed it after it had ""banked"" it no longer had any red lights on (only the aforementioned white).  Total sighting time (including Santa Barbara and Santa Ynez sides of the mountains) = 1+ minutes. FYI:  I am almost 30 years old, college educated and employed in the medical field.",2001-11-20T00:00:00,34.317038103448276,-119.72054137931035

I guess I scrwed up the last time I tried to send this 3 days after sighting happend. Was driving North bound on I-15 with girl friend on the way to Vegas, about 5 miles past the Silverwood Lake turn off and about one and a half miles befor Oak hill RD. exit at the top of grade. Was only doing 55 mph. because this is the steepest part of that strech of Fwy. All of a sudden, droping out below  the celing(appx. 6000 ft. that nite) from the north was a dull orange glowing ball of light that lit up the clouds as it passsed through them. Allmost at the same time we see a bright blue pinpoint of light come UP from the west and in a zig zag manner head for the orange ball that now had become brighter. The blue pinpoint then wildly flew around the bigger orange ball that was getting closer to us so that we could see somr kind of structur to it. Then in a big blue orange flash thay joined together into a bright multi colored ball of light that lasted only a few seconds and then thay separated again. At this time this is all happening right above us less than 1500ft. away just below the clouds that would light up with the bigger flashes. Awsum huh? Any way the blue pinpoint slowly started back the way it came only this time flying straght and true and did a slow fade away/out right befor our eyes! At this time the other thing was getting brighter and brighter and brighter and small thin orange thread like stuff was hanging from the bottom of it and then the F--king thing disapeared! I guess you guys call it a ""blink out"" well anyway it was gone and we were both left with our mouth's hanging open wide. I've been to many air shows and we've seen lots of different aircraft flying around the local mountains and deserts while camping and four wheeling and never seen anything like this befor. I am shure other cars and trucks saw what we saw because 4259ft. is the summit at Cajon Pass and that dont leave much room below the clouds and above the ground. The whole thing lasted about 35 to 45 seconds. I will never forget this ever and dont think she will to soon also.

This all being said, I was scanning through the data base for this month to see if anyone witnessed a similar event to what my husband and I both saw when I came upon several reports from the same day that sounded too intriguing.  I feel that I must now break my silence and report what I saw... March 30th, approximately 1030 p.m... TOWN/AREA PROFILE:  I live approximately 4-5 miles southeast of the Pacific ocean in a small town.  Our town is relatively unpopulated in some areas, including where I walk my dog at night.  There are no overly bright lights on our street, the houses around our development or within the surrounding area.  I have never noticed any red outdoor lighting before. WEATHER CONDITIONS: We can usually see the entire night sky (stars, etc.) unless their is fog.  There was no fog this night.  It was about 50 degrees out. REPORT:  I had just leashed-up my dog and headed out our back door to take her for her nightly walk around the neighborhood when I noticed a very strange ""glow"" of red in the night sky.  This ""glow"" was pure red and looked somewhat like what was described in the movie ""A Fire in the Sky.""  I know that sounds silly, but the glow spanned for quite a distance on the horizon.  Its strength and color intrigued me.  It appeared to move somewhat, but was mainly stationary.  There were many dogs howling/barking within the neighborhood at the time.  The ""glow"" lasted an unspecifed length of time.  I know that it was there at least through when my husband got back from walking the dog.  -I decided not to walk the dog after I saw the glow!   I repeat..this was NOT caused by any outdoor lighting and there was NO fog that a light could cast a reflective quality upon. WITNESS DATA:  My husband and I both witnessed the phenomenon.  He is usually not ""spooked"" by anything; even he, though, said that he thought that the event was weird and that the dogs barking in the area was strange.  We are both college-educated professionals.  I am 29 and my husband is 30. ((NUFORC Note:  A major coronal mass ejection from the Sun was predicted to strike the earth's magnetic field on this date.  NUFORC received reports from Utah, Oregon, California, Texas, and New Mexico on the same night.  Everyone reported a peculiar red glow.

We will attempt to correspond with the witness in attempt to confirm this possibility.  PD)) Sphere/disc shaped object that appeared in the sky over fresno ca. Around 4:15 am pacific time I stepped outside my house to smoke a cigarette and noticed a bright light in the sky a considerable distance away. After examining the object for a few moments it hadn't changed position at all and made me start to wonder. Out of curiosity I went inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars to see what is was expecting to have just been over reacting. What I saw through the binoculars appeared to be some sort off-white/tan colored object that was sphereical/disc in shape. After studying it for a few minutes it seemed to rotate around on its horizontal axis exposing its full shape. It was a round object that appeared to be composed of an outer ring surrounding a central sphere/disc type object. Unfortunatly my binoculars wern't powerfull enough to make out the patterns on the central part of the object clearly, but there was obviously some sort of design/patterns in the central portion. It only alluminated that one color but had a orange light/orb that would come from it, move around a bit, then go back. After looking at this go on for approx 10 minutes I went inside and grabbed my digital camera and took pictures of it. Unfortunatly my camera doesnt have a zoom feature but the light/object is clearly seen in the pictures and if magnified the shape is noticable. After 30 minutes of observing this object to the west I noticed a second object to the south, orange in color and further away. It seemed to bare a resemblence in shape as the one to the west but I couldn't see it as well. I studied the object to the west from dark till sun rise (Approx 2 hours.) even after all the stars in the sky had gone the object was still very visable. Finally the sun came up in the west blinding any attept to continue looking at the object. In one of my photos the object isn't where it was and a second grey disc type object is in veiw, much closer. Although I never saw it while I was outside. After some research and photo enhancment it bares some resemblense to a water spot that the camera had poss! ibly con trasted out. I still dont 100% agree with this possibility due to the fact most of the water spots that become visable through enhancment are oval in shape and barely visable. This object is a perfect circle.

I wouldn't have even given this aircraft a second look had it not been for what I saw ABOVE it. I witnessed a definite orb/sphere shape above this aircraft.  The orb/sphere looked to be somewhere on the lines of about 500 or less feet above the conventional aircraft and was flying in PERFECT unison with the ""normal"" craft.  As both crafts moved overhead I was able to see the glint of the sun off of them at one point, and this is how I could best relate to the shape of the orb/sphere.  I am not a pilot or in-the-know about flight altitudes; however, I estimate that the conventional craft was at about an altitude of 20,000-25,000 feet and, as mentioned, the orb/sphere was about 500 or so feet above the conventional aircraft.  I have never seen two planes fly so closely above one another and in perfect unison unless, of course, I was watching an air show.  Also, as mentioned I could distinctly see that the uppermost craft was of an orb/sphere shape. This event occurred at 10:38 a.m. (Pacific) time.  Once that I observed the spherical nature of the uppermost craft, I immediately ran back inside to get my camera.  I did take a photo of the crafts as they travelled away from me, but by the time that I got back outside with my camera (about 20-25 seconds later), they were both a considerable distance away.  If the photo turns-out I will most assuredly send it to you. The day was clear with sparse clouds.  This was a daylight sighting. Note:  There is a military base (Vandenberg) about 20 miles from me.

We thought the light was going to fade out but it didn't, it kept a constant speed (a little faster than an aircraft.)  There were no sudden speed increases or change in course.  My friend suggested it might be a meteor, but from what I know I don't think it was.  It was too slow for a meteor and too fast for an airplane.  I looked for blinking lights but it had none.

What made it look different was the slower speed (most shooting stars I have seen are maybe a tenth of a second), and the illumination looked like maybe a landing light on an aircraft.  It was quite bright, as the night sky to the west of here is not that dark because of city lights, yet this meteor-like object was easily visible.

Today (8/27/01) when I stepped out my door I first looked at the eastern horizon and noticed the planet Venus.  Then I turned towards the North and noticed a very bright light high in the NW.  Odd because I knew there were no planets in that direction, and no stars that bright (about 2-3 times the brightness of Venus).  My first thought was should I go back in & get my binoculars, or just proceed towards work?  I went back in and got them.  They are Orion 9x63.  With them I expected to see only a point of light, as that is all I could see with my eyes (an apparently very bright, motionless star).  But I was suprised to see a disc.  The object had a visible diameter which immediately told me this was not a star (nova or otherwise).  I became immediately interested.  The color was pure white and very bright.  No details were visible within the bright image and for awhile no details surrounding it.  I kept watching debating whether or not to call my brother (hoping to get a triangulation) and not wishing to take my eyes off it when there was a sudden change.  I noticed the emergence of a ""puff of gray smoke"" off towards the northerly direction.  Inside this thin vaporus and expanding cloud were a number (6-12) of swimming points of light moving somewhat erratically in the same direction (generally northerly).  I then moved closer to the house and supported my arms on a step ladder to steady my view and the same event happened again, thoug the ""puff"" moved generally south and again about the same number of points of light moved off in that direction.  They did not seem to move off with any great rapidity.  The small points of light seemed to have variable brightness to them (some were brighter than others).  They did not seem to move with any purpose, but somehwat sluggishly and randomly and even seemed to slow somewhat the further they got from the bright disc, which never changed position or brightness the entire time.  Now I! really wanted to call my brother and get a triangulation, but just as I was about to do so the entire event ended with the abrupt fading of the entire scene.  Not fading, cutoff.  It just disappeared. The morning was calm, and partly cloudy.  The event was seen thru thin clouds perhaps at 10,000'.  The object was above these clouds the entire time and did not move while the clouds slowly moved in a generally ESE to WSW direction.  Knowing the two locations I stood at to view this event I later used a compass and plumb bob to find the horizon coordinates, which I estimate to be the following: Elevation: 72 deg Azimuth:  300 deg (NW) During Civil Twilight I have observed balloon flights from my house quite often.  This was not a balloon, at least not a hot air balloon.  Hot air balloon are easily identified and are usually accompanied by noise when the fuel is burned for lift.  Even at high altitued one can detect the flare event from from the burn.  If it was a weather balloon (or some reasearch balloon from the University of Alaska) then I would also expect it to have changed position somewhat during the 10 minutes I observed it.  I noticed absoultely no change in position.  There was also absolutely no noise during the entire event.  If it was a balloon venting at high altitude (accidental surface rupture, or deliberate puncture) then I do not understand why the bright central disc did not seem to change position or brightness during the ""release event"".  I also do not understand why the entire event just shut off so suddenly. Thought you might find this interesting.",2001-10-12T00:00:00,64.84527636363637,-147.8347387878788

So I kept looking on and it started to move to my left and there was no sound and it moved in such a straight line.  It started to accelerate and it disappeared leaving a green trace of light and I have seen lots of planes and this was definately not a regular plane.  When it moved to my left it moved horizantly and not on an angle.  I have seen shooting stars and they go by really quickly and they look white and they don't go by horizantly or slow enough that I could describe what it looked like.

I was fishing on the lake on the Washington County Conservation Center near Nashville Illinois with a friend.    Some time in the early afternoon probably about 1:00 PM I heard what I thought was jet noise and looked up. There was a long narrow object silver in color with what appeared to be windows.  However there appeared to be no wings or tail.  I would describe this as a long cigar shape. It seemed longer than most jet liner fuselages.  I proceeded to rationalize this away thinking that I could just not see the wings. I thought that the lighting made them blend against the sky.  For that reason I did not tell my friend about it.  I looked at it for only a few minutes.  I since have thought about it and realized that I would have seen any wings.   The sun was high in the sky and I would have seen the shaded bottom of the wings not to mention the engines. Also there are two major airports near the area. So jet noise is common.  Background: I am 67 and retired. I spent most of my life in the retail business dealing with all kinds of people.  I was also a part time photographer and avid amateur photographer.  My hobbies also include art and bird watching.   I have three previous sightings but I don’t look for UFO’s.  I also have some other history, but don’t wish to discuss that here.

Even initially, it was an exciting event.  This was a huge object.  Following a precise course and maintaining an exact altitude, this craft intercepted Scottsdale Road, made good a southerly heading until approximately Indian School road, turned over Sky Harbor Airport and eventually disappeared in the vicinity of ""South Mountain.""  As the craft approached, we began to eliminate what it wasn't.  Not airplanes, helicopters, blimps etc.  It's speed was estimated at 40--50 mph.  It was titally silent.  It featured large amber lights on the leading edge with some smaller lights underneath, some on the side (left from our vantage point) and some visible aft.   As it passed 90 degrees and aprx 1 1/2 mile, we thought we could see substance to it, i.e, blocking out lights behind it  but transparent at the same time.  I estimated it's altitude to be 10,000 feet at the iniitial contact, roughly the same altitude as inbound air traffic bound for PHX... as it passed, the lower portion of the craft was an estimated 200 feet from the ground.  Note: There was nothing to compare this machine to, so size, etc. could be quite different.  I am a retired airline pilot, have flown for 40+ years, have flown everything from the J-3 Cub to the 747.  I retired as a 727 Captain for one of the big 4. I have never seen anything like this - not even close.  The assertion that this craft was flares is a pathetic attempt at coverinvg up the truth.  I have no idea what it was, but definitely know what it was not.  Flares do not maintain altitude, nor navigate a precise course.  The sighting/s are well known at this point, and have been the subject of many TV documentaries, etc.  Yet, no word is forthcoming.  The paripherial events surrounding the sightings are nothing less than erie.  Unfortunately, this and other events are falling into obscurity because we as a society! are all owing that to happen.  I am happy to discss this with anyone.  Be advised I am NOT seeking any publicity, etc.  Since reporting this sighting, long time friends look at me with a jaundiced eye, strangers who hear the story often think I'm crazy, etc.  On this the 5th anniversary of the Phoenix Lights the image is fresh in my mind.  This did happen.  Had the comet not been in the skies that evening, I doubt we would have seen it.

We were standind on the North shore of Lake Ontario at bluffers park in scarborough Ont. our attention had been drawn up in the sky when 1 person in the group pointed out that she had seen what looked to me to be a planet had just appeared out of thin air. it was about moon level in the sky and it was a brilliant orange round object slightly larger than the largest visible star but was much brighter than any star i have ever seen. I know there is alot of air traffic in the t.o. area but i was sure no aircraft of earth origen that can zig zag back and forth up and down at the speed It was going it seemed almost to be playing in the entire sky above us. About after 10 min we saw a airplane i know this from wacthing many planes from the exact spot for many years. As the plane approached the vicinity of IT,IT stopped. Then at a very high rate of speed traveled toward the plane. One of my good friends then screamed oh my god it is gonna hit the plane. Just before IT did it proceded to do looping zig zaging motions around the plane then just as it had been playing before ITleft the plane and continued to play some more in the sky leaving the plane alone> at this point my hair was standing on the back of my head.

Cotten white in color. Came very very close. I believe I might be able to account for this story, but feel I should tell it so that others might have a comparison if they encounter the same event and yes it is very odd to witness this phenomena. This event took place on Rampart lake located just outside of Divide Colorado. I was accompanied by my brother and a cousin .  The event took place as the sun was setting but being down between two mountains you can’t see the sunset but you can notice the light of day fading.As, it grew darker and cooler the lake was cooling fast and thus causing a very thick layer of  fog to form  across the full breast of the lake. We all were standing at the lake edge chatting and waiting for our wives to arrive and pick us up after a day of fishing. I noticed a subtle white ball of light over the water and out in front of us. It appeared to be about 60 yards or so away from us. The funny thing was that the fog was really getting thick and visibility over the lake was only about 4 feet or so. But yet this light could be seen moving in an arc. The ball of light would move about in a 90 degree arc or so. At first we thought it was a light from a boat however, this was not the case. The object then moved directly at us doing about 5 miles an hour or so. It got so close at this point,I would say no more then 12 feet or so. The light was about the size of a basketball. At this point we all was getting a little concerned about our visitor. Now, this event so far has been going on for about 15 minutes or so and we have been discussing and detailing the event the whole time. As we all was very curious but trying to remain calm and for me this was a chance to really take in and understand the event.  Now, this object was about 7 or so feet away at this time and hovering above the water at about 12 feet up and 7 feet or so out. Now at 7 feet, this was a little to close. So with this being the case, I could clearly sum up that the object was indeed no boat. So I picked up a rock through it right at the object.I did this several t! imes and came very close if not hitting the light. This action had no effect on the ball of light. But not long after throwing the rocks at it and by the way keeping my cousin from shooting it with his pistol. I knew he had it the whole time. I was sure it was not man made but I didn’t want to make a bad mistake. The ball light object next slowly withdrew in the same arc as it arrived and that was that. What do I now believe it was?  Not ball lighting that I am sure of.  We came back to the lake the next day And I took a stock of the lake and noticed an aspect of the layout of the lake and roads coming into the lake. I noticed that there was a road on the other side of the lake. It was about a half mile or so directly in front of the lake and had about 45 degree turn and was about 30 yards from the lakes edge. Now, grant it that is really some distance away from where we had been standing. But I now believe that even though the fog was thick and we could not see far at all, a car turning that corner with the brights on could shine into the dense fog, it’s at this point that the phenomena occurs. The fog was able to condense the light beams and merge them together at just about right in front of us and above the lake at about the same height as the road is above the lake some half mile or so in front us.  Now, I know this does not account for the period of time in which we saw this event about, 20 minutes in all. I can say that maybe the car parked on that corner and then backed away accounting for the arc exit of the light. Or, the car had passed but the condensed fog was able to absorb the light. Which, then continued to break the light apart over and over. Next,it was then picked back up and then amplified just like the intensifier tube would do for a night vision scope.",2002-01-11T00:00:00,38.9528,-105.191

I was with my buds in Ybor, when I noticed a large craft hovering above us.  Everyone saw it some even pointed at it.  But no one else was the least bit surprised by it.  It had an inscription on the side as it hovered by... it took me a very long time to read it but it turned out it was english!  As it hovered just a few hundred feet above our heads I could make out ""Good..."" then as my eyes focused ""..Year"".  It said ""GoodYear"" on it.  I peered deeper into the craft and could make out a small figure inside running the entire craft.  How it was able to hover just above our head without wings, I do not know.  It was almost like it could fall at anytime.  I ran into a near by bar to tell everyone there, they were all excited and rushed out.  But the second they laid eyes on it they threw their arms down and went back to drinking.  There was a flashing light on the bottom of it.  I knew that had to be the reason for everyones immeadiate dismissal of the craft.  I don't know why it wasnt working on me, but every single person I went to looked at it, and almost instantaneous laughed or giggled and paid no more attention to it.  Theses ufo's are getting more sophisticated.  It was almost like everyone had seen it a thousand times... could it be that since we are having more and more encounters that the extraterrestials have resorted to mind control?  I'm not sure it was the flashing light, perhaps it was the script on the side of the vessel, perhaps the combination of the words ""Good"" and ""Year"" are some type of code words that allow extraterrestials to bypass our natural instinct of fear!  Again I am not sure as to way these words had no effect to me, but it could all go back to the creations of man, maybe we're some type of hybrid monkey that the extraterrestials used as slaves and as we developed we became more modernized and fearful so they had to implant genes into our gene pool to assure us as potential slaves for future use just in case their newly appointed slaves arent as useful as we once were.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,,

PD)) truly bizarre ""anomolous satellite-like"" observation 21:20 local time (evening) Tuesday 2nd Jan near Sydney, Australia. (ie, Roughly Monday morning in USA.) 50 miles north of Sydney. Conditions perfectly clear, warm, 70 deg F., dark country area.  Event happened roughly in Orion (roughly overhead at that time). I am an mildly experienced skywatcher, meteor-shower watcher, aircraft spotter and satellite watcher. I have a science degree major in phyics and math. I am 36 years old and own a programming company and was perfectly sober. At about 21:20 I noticed what looked exactly like a satellite moving through the sky, just as when you see a LEO satellite moving through the sky. Oddly it was moving on a North to South (approximately) track (perhaps 10 or 20 degrees west of North to 10-20 East of South, but not sure). Of course satellites generally move in east and west lines, not north and south lines. I thought to myself ""cool, that must be a polar satellite"". The point of light looked exactly as it does when you happen to see a satellite moving overhead.  Similar magnitude. The speed was somewhat faster than the typical satellite. At one point there happened to be a conventional wide-body jet also overhead (on a normal track to Kingsford-Smith airport) for comparision; in short the object looked exactly like when you see a satellite (except it was wierdly going N-S). Amazingly enough the object deccelerated, and then STOPPED (!)  I watched it clearly do this and kept concentration on it the whole time.  I notied it's position relative to some stars (near the west-south 'foot' of Orion).  Obviously I yelled in amazement, told my fiance etc. Then, maybe 10 or 15 seconds later I happened to see another identical ""satellite"", which was moving on a parallel track, but coming from SOUTH TO NORTH.  The two tracks were maybe 1 or 1.5 degrees apart. Amazingly the first satellite (or whatever) then STARTED MOVING AGAIN, but this time NORTH, ie backwards, the way it had come from. IE, the first ""satellite"" started moving again (in the reverse direction) when the other one approached it (the first one staying about 1/2 a degree ahead of the second). Both then moved at the same speed and direction, in ""formation"". Although ""unspectacular"" this was (of course) the strangest and most bizarre thing I have ever seen in my life.

The whole sighting lasted oh no more than 2 minutes and it looked just like a plane going thru the sky for about a minute of the two, blinking and moving steadily. But then all of a sudden it lit up (it stopped blinking and got visibly brighter), and then went extremely fast and went out of sight. We were all awestruck",2001-11-20T00:00:00,47.9445,-91.7717

A large fireball came across the San Luis Valley in mid to late August this year.  Astronomers from the Colorado Museum of Natural History said it was a meteor, and from the many eyewitness accounts it would have been about 2-3 tons when it entered the atmosphere and it gave off several sonic booms.  It came to earth somewhere in the La Garita mountains.  Scientists and locals flocked to the hills without finding a trace.  All local papers reported on it for a week or two, including the Denver Post. The strange thing is, that from NORAD it must have looked like a 2.5 ton object heading straight for Cheyenne Mountain as it was inbound.  I find it amazing that they did not track it, and could not give the museum a trajectory and velocity on the thing.  It makes me suspicious about the true nature of the object. No wonder we can't hit Mars. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the U. S. government has technical means to detect and track all major fireballs.  The date of the incident was Friday, August 17, 2001.

As a former Astronomy tutor at the University, I went outside almost every night this summer to have a cigarette and enjoy the night sky, My roommate and myself watched Mars move across the sky over the summer months. We were used to seeing the hororscopial constellations moved across the sky through the night and see a changing sky <P> This particular night, I went out rather late in the evening- around 1 am. My porch faces South where Sagittarius (shaped like a big teapot)  was pouring her tea and Scorpio was setting in the west.  As I looked South and about 30 degrees above the horizon, I saw clusters of stars moving though the clouds.  I had to really concentrate to figure out what I was looking at.  I counted 11 in one clustered area which made me realize that it just wasn't possible to, by fluke, have <I>That</I>  many planes in the sky (at one time) AND in such a close proximity! <P> I woke up my roommate and brought him outside to get a second opinion.  Then I realized I could try taking some digital photos. My shots showed clusters of very bright star like and cigar like lights. We both agreed it was unusual and probably unlikely that so many places could be in one area of the sky at once.  We never saw more than three planes on the sky before and this night we saw 15 to 30 of them! <P> I couldn't find my upload cable for my camera, so I just left it for months.  I told a few people, but I didn't really want to report it as UFO reporting is bit embarrassing. <P> Anyway, I happen to live in a place that would probably welcome the story.  Belleville, Wisconsin...a city that claims to be ""The UFO Capital of the World"".  Or at least they take on that claim as a motto for their fall --UFO Festival. This year I took my daughter to the parade and then to the children's games at the local school.  One of the friends I told my story to, retold it to a reporter at the festival who found me and asked for an interview.  She asked me to email her my photos, which made motivated me to find my camera cable and upload the photos.  So, it wasn't until 2 months later that I actually looked at what I photographed. <P> They are good pictures, although I wish they could have captured the numbers of lights that we saw with our eyes.",2001-11-20T00:00:00,42.8626,-89.5869

It was Thursday. I had just finnished a day of set up for the 'Molson Indy Vancouver'.    I was walking to a friend's place to drop off her work pass and shirt for the Indy weekend, as she lived only eight blocks away. The time was between 5:30pm-6:00pm, as I recall, the day was still bright and sunny. I was heading south on Main street, between 5th ave. and 6th ave., when I noticed to my left a black rectangular shape in the sky.  It had the dimensions of a doorframe although I perceived the object to be cylindrical . Like a piece of black pipe standing on end, the object floated motionless in the eastern sky. It's elevation was about 30 degrees from my vantage point on the street and perhaps 1 km. distant, (maybe 100 meters above ground). I estimated the size of the    object to be about that of a minivan. There was no perceivable sound. There were no surface features. I stood watching as I waited for the crosswalk light. Traffic was busy, as normal, but I saw no one else observing the black minivan in its time-suspended nose-dive. I am 34 years old, I am no fool, and this was unusual. I always try to maintain an acute awareness of my environment, often with suspicion and scrutiny when curcumstances warrant it. I am also a big believer in a universe teaming with life. What spooked me the most about this encounter was that I had completely forgotten what I had seen. Even when passing the same spot on my way home, not ten minutes later, I didn't look to see if it was still there. It wasn't until October 21, when I caught part of a documentary on the 'Space Channel' about U.F.O sightings, did it all come back to me. Similar reports of objects have been photographed and such an image jogged my memory. Apparently an object of the same description hovered motionless over a U.S. town for 3 days.",2001-11-20T00:00:00,49.26892572695909,-123.11223982257269

In the distance I saw a black shape moving through the air almost directly eastward. With many years of Air Force experience and familiarity with the air traffic patterns of the area, my immediate presumption was this had to be either a dark colored B1 or possibly B2 bomber heading in for a landing at Offutt AFB. Then, to my utter surprise, the object 'banked' giving me an edge on view...and what I now saw was a very long, narrow angled black triangle. Having seen number of 747s at that distance, I would estimate it at about that length. It was clearly not the shape of a B2, which I have seen in daylight and night flight configurations. It was not a B1, first, because the only time it's wings are back in a 'delta' type configuration is when it is flying at high speed (which this craft was not), and second, because the shape was way to narrow and triangular. I determined to stop and keep watching this craft, but I first looked down to my Van's clock to see the exact time...and when I looked up, the craft was gone.",2001-10-12T00:00:00,41.254851796008865,-96.06482784922395

This wasn't a big deal, untill he saw 2 fighter planes come zooming after it minutes later, their speeds were much slower.  A few days later, the newspaper had sightings of a U.F.O.

We were just talking and walking as three young boys will do, when to our surprize, the brightest light that we had ever seen came on right above us, it was cylinder in shape, it was like we were in a bright glass.  We just stood and looked up at it didn't move and we didn't either we ask each other what it was, we were not able to even make a guess.  Then we all got afraid of it, and ran into a orange grove and hid under orange trees, but the light just moved with us,it was brighter then daylight under the orange tree that I was under.  We were yelling at each other and really scared by this time.  We didn't know what to do, and then just like it came on the light went off.  We stayed under the trees and talk back and forth to each other untill we got up enought nerve to get up and run.  This was a long time before anyone ever said they had seen an UFO or little green men.  But for a long time after that event, I had what I thought were dreams. I would awake in room with subdued light, with four or five of the the little people with the big head and eyes, they always looked light blue or green or grey to me. They would be moving all around and touching me. I was never to afraid of them ,I can't ever recall being hurt in any way, and in this dream that I used to have, once in a while a door would open with a bright light, and in the doorway would be this tall man, I could never tell what he look like, all I could see was his shadow, he would say something to the little people and soon after I would awake in my bed.This was doing the great depression and we lived in a old tractor barn with very few people near us. Like I said about what I thought were dreams I'm not to sure if they were or not anymore. People have a hard time believing what you tell them you have seen, but the older I get the more I think there is more to my story then I thought, all of the people that say they have seen the same thing that I saw back in the 1937 or 1938 can't all be telling storys.I can't think of anything back then that could stop and hover above you with a tube like light and not make a sound.

Went home and got into bed with my wife. I was lying there listening to the radio when the disc jocky made a comment about a phone call of someone reporting a ufo around one of the parks that we lived close to. This stured my interest so I got out of bed and went into the front yard which faced the park in reference. At first look i only saw a light that appeared to be a bright star but of a bluewhite color. After several minutes of watching this one light which was constant, I noticed that it was moving in my direction, slowly. I would est. at this point it was about 300 to 500 ft. off the gound. Distance from the object to myself as a bullet would travel, I would say 1000 yards. It was northwest of my positon moving very slowly to the east. When it reached about 500 yards away it stoped, alt. was still the same. At this point I could make out a ""disc"" shape. Being in awh, I ran inside to wake my wife. At first she thought i had been drinking, but i was able to convince her to come and look. When we returned to the front yard I noticd that the object had begun to move in a southerly direction at a low rate of speed, estimated to be 5-10 mph. It continued to travel to the south until it's position was about 200 yards south of my front door which faced due west. It stopped again for several minutes then began to move north at the same rate of speed,  It traveled about 400 yards to the north and stopped again. It made the same trip again but stoping due west of my front yard, ""about half way of the trip it just made"". This put it directly it front of me. My wife was shouting to get back in the house because the shape of the object was deffinetly clear at this point ""disc"". It had one light on it which was on the bottom midship. It stayed at this position for quiet sometime. I had gone inside to get my deer rifle to use the scope for better vision, didnt work to good so i got my binoculars, this gave me much better vision of the ! object. I would say it was approx. 25'-30' in dia. disc shaped and appeared to have a port hole or window on the upper side of the object. What I didnt notice that it now was about 200 ft. of the ground moving straight toward me, its speed had slowed to only several mph. Its skin appeared to be metalic with a very low luster, it appeared to absorbe light rather than reflect it. There was absolutely no noise, no visual signs of proplusion,prop,engines, exhaust etc. No rotor blades, no vertical or horizonal stabelizers. To put it bluntly it was a flying saucer perfectly still 200 ft. over my house at 3:00am in the morning. At this point my wife totally lost it running back into the house. I was able to get her back out in the front yard to help me with the id so we wouldnt forget anything. After 10 min or so it began to move to the east again straight over my house, when it passed over us looking straight up at the object we felt a little sick to our stomachs and we felt like we were in a vaccuum. As it passed over our house we ran through the house into the back yard to continue watching. It continued for about 400 yards at this slow rate of speed when all of a sudden its speed went from a few mph to an unadentified speed which I can only relate to that of a meteror, tail and all. It traveled straight for a sec then started in an upward motion at about 45 deg. heading straight up then disappearing into the clouds. No noise, no light other than the one i have explained did we observe. The next day or two someone called the local newspaper and reported seeing the object at the park close to the ground.

We stopped between Cle Elum and Ellensburg at the Indian John Hill rest stop for lunch.  While having lunch I was looking north toward the Mt Stuart range.  I watched a jet airliner pass across my field of view eastbound above the mountains.  Looking upward at about 45 degrees to see if I could spot another plane I noticed a chevron-shaped formation of small silver blobs.  I was wearing polarized sunglasses and could just barely distinguish the lighter silver of the blobs from the blue of the sky.  I removed my sunglasses to see if I could see the formation better but without the sunglasses,  I could not see it at all.  Putting my sunglasses back on I could once again see the formation but it was becoming more difficult as it moved northward toward the horizon.  I guickly handed my sunglasses to my wife and asked if she could see anything.  She could not and then my daughter insisted on a look.  By the time I had my sunglasses back, I could no longer find the formation.  In all I probably only saw the formation for ten to 15 seconds at somewhere between 1:20 and 1:30 PM PDT I am unsure how may silver blobs made up the formation, I would guess either seven or nine &#8211; one at the point and then either three or four in each trailing arm.  While the chevron pointed west, the movement appeared to be to the north. At first I assumed this was a flight of geese but there was no shifting of position or movement.  The formation remained rigid.  I also thought it could be a formation of high flying military jets and cannot fully rule this out.  I was however struck by the consistent pattern of the formation, how none of the silvery blobs shifted in relation to all the others.  And of course I am intrigued that without the polarized sunglasses, the formation was essentially invisible.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,47.207300000000004,-120.9022

It was quite large, appearing to be nearly half the size of the almost-full moon.  It was extremely bright, a glaring reddish-pink in color.  It was definitely burning as it fell, not sparkling or hazy, no diminishment in size as it arced downward through the sky.  I watched it as it went behind the 3 radio towers located atop Queen Anne hill - I could clearly see the framework of the towers illuminated from behind as the fireball descended behind them.  It then fell out of sight behind Queen Anne hill itself.  There were no bits of debris of any sort that flew off the fireball as it fell, no ejecta, just a BIG red ball lazily falling through the night sky.

My sister came out of the house.  We told her what we had seen and she joined us down the street.  It had been about one minute since the first sighting when we saw the craft again.  It was the same size, shape, and color.  It was a little further south of the area in which it first appeared.  The craft stayed in the sky for about 30 seconds and then disappeared.

We were out there telling my mother what happened for about 2-3 minutes.  She then went in the house. About a minute or two later, my friend and sister and I were standing in the same spot when a second craft appeared in the place where the first sighting had occured. This craft was the same shape as the first, but it was twice as big.  It was a light silver color.  An extremely bright, white beam of light shot and of the craft and sort of beamed around the ship.  There was some kind lightning-like bolts that seemed to be coming out of the beam of light which gave of white squiggly lines and small triangular light.  The ship disappeared and we ran back to my house to get my mother again.  She was outside with us for about 5 minutes but saw nothing and went back inside. My sister and friend and I then went back down the street to see if there was anything else to see.  Our neighborhood is surrounded by canyons and my sister noticed red lights flashing around some trees in a canyon about 4 blocks south of us.  My friend and i started walking back to my house and my sister followed.  A minute or two later, I went back down the street to see these red lights.  From the distance I was at from them, the lights were about the size of the tail lights of a car.  They were flashing in a running-motion (sort of like the motion christmas lights) around the trees.  I went back home.  A few minutes later, when my sister and friend and I went back to see the red lights, they were gone.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

I stepped outside to water a plant and looked up into a clear and starlit eastern sky. Two very bright white lights appeared to be coming toward me from northeast, like landing lights but in space. Both turned in formation and headed south, apparently entering ionosphere where a bright light blue aura appeared in front and broad badminton birdie shaped cone of blue appeared behind each. I shouted to others to come outside and bring videocamera. My thoughts were that these objects looked like Hale Bopp and might be comets; but, they slowed down upon apparently entering ionosphere and maneuvered in loose formation. Four other people came outside and observed the objects as I videotaped them moving south in the eastern sky and then turn to the east and apparently depart the ionosphere again. I zoomed video out to get exact ground reference point so that celestial geometry could be figured. The next morning I calibrated videocamera clock with GPS time. I later talked with observers 21 miles away and 50 miles away who saw similar objects around same time. The videotape is digital and quite good. Today I read your web page accounts and agree with most descriptions of objects orientation and behavior, except that the objects I observed definitely came from northeast, turned south, and then apparently left ionosphere heading east. This does not seem to be typical ICBM behavior. It is of note that the brightest aspect of the objects was on the leading edge, and illumination was much less in rear view. This is also not typical ICBM illumination pattern, which is brightest in stern view. I am former US Navy pilot and have seen numerous missle launches.

It looked very much like the Hale-Bopp comet that was present in the sky last summer.  The light was bright in the end pointing north and it seemed to spread out and fade away from the object in a southern direction.  When it appeared I thought it might be an asteroid, but it remained visible in a somewhat stationary position for too long.  I quickly asked my girlfriend who was in the car with me to look up and she was immediately able to point it out.  For the next two minutes or so it remained visible and seemed to very slowly move from right to left in our field of vision.

I pointed out the object to my friend who was surprised to observe that the object suspended in the air.  We pulled to the side of the road and got out of our rented car, and continued to look at it.  We then realized there were some other people who had gotten out of their cars and were observing the object.  The object seemed to be emitting a blue beam of light from its underside.  We noticed that there was a small object in the beam of light and it looked to us like it was an animal, perhaps a small dog or cat. The animal appeared dead or asleep and slowly disappeared into the object.  After five minutes we noticed some helicopters were moving slowly towards the disk.  The disk then began tto descend and disappeared into the side of the hill.  We could hear a weird sound from the area into which the object seemed to have penetrated. The helicopters disaapeared beyond the hill but could still be heard for a few minutes after we lost sight of them.  Some people began to walk towards us, and my friend was a little fearful and told me to get back into the car, which I did not hesitate to do.

There were tiny red lights on top, none on the belly.

I pulled off to watch and noticed other vehicles behind me had also done so. There was no noise - I rolled down my window to listen - nothing. As the craft passed over my car, I got a good look at it against 'night sky light pollution' from Bloomington - it was triangle-shaped, with a white light in each of the three wing tips and appeared to be black in color. A mile or so down the road, the snow looked blown across the road like drifting. The rest of the roadway was clear. I thought ""copter"" at first, until I saw the thing. Not like any I had ever seen.

It began to move west as I approached the intersection of Routes 7 and 164. It was at this point that I got a good look at it. In the middle of the thing was a sunset-orange, horizontally oriented rectangular light. It shone relatively brightly and had a solar quality, like the sun in its setting position.

We presume he means September 30.  PD)) Saturday, January 30th ((sic??)), 2001, approximate time - 7:15PM The sun had set with only the slightest pale blue afterglow in the West horizon. The sky was perfectly clear with many stars visible. I was out on my back deck with 2 friends having dinner. I was leaning back in my chair admiring the clear night sky when I saw an extremely bright white falling star streak across the Eastern horizon moving incredibly fast toward the south. It was literally only visible for 1 second, but left a long streak across my retina. I remarked excitedly for my 2 friends to look, but it was already too late. It was only because of the falling star that we saw what happened next. For the next minute we all stood there craning our necks staring at the sky. At this time, there appeared a passenger plane at cruising altitude over to the east, moving slowly towards the NW. Literally less than a minute passed before the friend to my immediate left said ""What's that?"" and pointed straight up. I had been looking toward the East where I saw the shooting star, but I looked straight up and saw what she was talking about. The third person with us never saw anything, because the event was over in just a few seconds, and she never locked on. Basically, this is what we saw: Directly overhead there was a formation of very pale greenish dots. They appeared to be very high, but immediately looked very strange and unlike anything I had seen before. The lights didn't appear to be navigation lights, as they weren't points of light, like on a plane, but actual round shapes. Also, the light itself was very strange, because unlike stars, especially falling stars, and/or lights from a plane, they were very pale against the black sky - almost stealthy. It was as if the objects themselves were glowing, and giving off an eerie glow or haze immediately around each shape, as opposed to having lights on the surface. The shapes were arranged in a wedge formation, with a point craft, and 3 more falling back on the right side at a 45 degree angle, and 1 off the point on the left side at a matching opposed angle. 5 objects total. They were close together, and looked like a formation that fighter jets might have flown in, but nothing (in my opinion) man-made could possibly move that fast, and there was no sonic boom or any other noise from them. They flew in a perfectly straight line heading north. They were moving so fast that they literally flew across the whole sky and out of our sight in less than 4 seconds! It was amazing! To give you a reference, the commercial aircraft literally had moved maybe 3 inches across the sky from our perspective in the time it took these objects to span the entire expanse of the open sky and disappear into the horizon, and it was visible to us for several minutes after the formation vanished. Naturally, we started yelling ""Oh my God - did you see that???"" and the like, and found out that unfortunately only 2 of us had seen them. We compared what we saw, and every last detail, including the arrangement and color of the objects was identical. I racked my brain to try to figure out what it could have been, but couldn't think of anything that made sense. If a shooting star hit the atmosphere and broke apart, it is highly unlikely that the peices would have formed a perfectly spaced formation, and would have been bright white in color, like a magnesium fire, not pale green. If it was a missile, again, why the formation and the color? I am sure it wasn't a plane because of the impossible velocity. I was very curious to see if anyone else saw these objects, as it was a warm night and I'm sure there were thousands of people like us out enjoying the weather. Also, the passenger plane was in the vicinity, and flying in a trajectory that would have eventually intersected with the path the formation had flown, so I wondered if they could have seen them too. It was so strange and awesome that I literally was beside myself for a few minutes, but now I am stuck in a rut where I want to tell people that I am pretty sure I saw something unnatural, but am afraid of being ridiculed. I would love to find out what it was if there is an explanation! So there you have it.",2001-11-20T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

Around these encircled stars? there were small aircraft encircling them flying at what appeared to be leisurely pace. About 5. Everything was at a very high altitude. I tried my best to observe as I drove on, but then they were out of sight.

I quicky paid my bill and exited the building hoping to find some Anbesol in my glove box to help with the tooth ache. I got about half way to my car when I noticed that the tooth ache was subsiding. At the same time I noticed that a faint humming sound in my ear. I don't know what made me do this, but I looked up at the sky, to the northwest I believe, and noticed a tight formation of 5 aircraft. At first I dismissed them as military planes doing training maneuvers. But as I continued to watch them, they did some pretty remarkable things. The three that were closest to me (5 miles?) suddenly descended from about 25000 feet to about 500 feet.  The other 2 craft, in the rear, simply disappeared. A bright beam began to shine down from one of them. That is when I blacked out. I came to about 30 minutes later in a farm field 10 miles away. I felt refreshed. (I still had my receipt from the Waffle House in my pocket. The time on the reciept showed what time I had left the resturaunt.) What happened during that 30 minute period is beyond me. I can't remember a thing. Anyway, I found a nearby road and was luckey to find a farm house with a light on inside. The farmer gave me a ride back to my car. It was then that I noticed the my tooth was missing. The strange thing was that there was no blood. It had completely healed over as if I had never been born with a tooth there in the first place. This is what prompted me to visit your website. Looking at my arms and legs, I notice nothing unusual except that there appears to be some kind of injection mark with a lump about the size of a pea on my left bicep. It doesn't hurt and it seems hard. My vision seems a little blurred. In the back pocket of my jeans, I noticed a piece of paper that has a type of hieroglyphics. One last thing to note, the farmer said that he saw a bright light about 5 minutes before I knocked on his door. He said that it was probably lightning though. I asked him if he had heard if there was any thunder, He said no. ((NUFORC Note:  We were somewhat surprised to learn that there is, indeed, a Roswell, GA.

I observed these lights for 5 min then the lights stopped pulsating and the white light came back on and began to slowly move back to where it came from, I watched it move slowly back over the trees and disappear not to be seen again.  the object was around 50-60 feet in diameter, and was not a helicopter,plane or ballon.",2002-02-22T00:00:00,,

Suddenly, my son came running into my bedroom and shook me awake, yelling ""Mom, come look, there's something funny outside"".  I got out of bed and went to the porch and looked outside above the house.  Above us I saw, about 50 to 80ft above us three rows of lights that seemed to outline a large craft.  As I watched for about 2 minutes, the lights slowly faded out. It was so weird, not even the crickets were chirping.  It was dead silent.  I never said much to anyone, but it seems that no-one but us saw it...at least I never heard anyone talk about it.  It wasn't until much later, when I read in a book (unfortunately I can't remember the name of it,) that a woman who chased these sightings down, mentioned that they could just fade away, but that it didn't mean they were gone.  When I read that, I felt more secure in my sighting.  I was afraid to say anything about it because people tend not to believe.  To this day, my son won't talk about it because when he woke up at 3:00am, he said he was standing up, and didn't remember getting to his feet.  It scared him to talk about it because he heard that these ""people"" kidnapp people.  His friend claims not to remember, but I know he does.  I have always wondered why they are so reluctant to talk about the incident. By the way they also told me that it was very bright until I got there, that's when it became dimmer.

One darkish Winter morning, my mother and my father were walking my sister and I to school. Our school was fairly close to our old apartment building in Chicago on the Westside. To get to our school, you have to walk across a huge empty field. This field was covered with snow. Anyway, we were coming across the field,  a few other people were ahead of us. Then it happened. There was a SUPER loud crashing sound. Louder than anything I've ever heard. Later, I found out that this noise was heard all across Chicago, and some close cities. So you know it was LOUD! Then I saw a white round object that looked hard, hovering over the field. About as high as your average house. It was low enough to scare everybody on the field. There was a bright strip of light, coming from one side of the Saucer. There was a crazy beeping sound, and everybody on the field hit the ground. We covered our heads in the cold snow. We were scared. When we got back up, the object was gone, and the sky had gone back to being dark. Everybody was shaken up. Laughing about what we had just seen. We didn't know what to do, this was 1989. There was only 1 white spaceship. It never landed. But I believe that it was trying to land on our snow-covered field. But when they saw humans, they scared us, and left. I am now 22. I'm black. I'm in college. My father is now dead of a heart attack, he would be 44 in October. My mother is 44.

In the early morning hours of mid summer in 1991 I witnessed a ""Circle"" UFO.  I had gotten off of work at a local restaurant.  I walked home a block and a half away to change from my work clothes and into my running clothes.  I proceeded to run to a local Villiage Pantry for a late night snack.  I was running on West Main St on the north side of the road.  I at the time was having a conversation with ""God.""  I had asked him and her if they could show me an ""Angel of the Lord"" or what I refer to as whats described in the Christian Bible.  Almost insantaniously behind my destination spot on the North East corner of Main and Hospital Rd I noticed what appeared to be an airplane.  I was a little confused as to why this plane or object was flying so low and right over a main street in town.  I stopped running and proceeded to walk the rest of the way.  All the while watching the object come closer.  It at first appeared to be a taller vehicle in the road behind a regular size car which was stopped at a red light at the intersection of West Main and Hosptial Rd.  I thought maybe it was a ""Monster Truck.""  Living in the midwest that wouldn't have surprised me.  But then it was noticeably higher in the horizon.  And the lights in front did look very much like bright yellow headlights of a truck.  It then appeared like lights from maybe a medium sized aircraft.  I stood on the north east corner of Main and Freemont St to observe the object come closer.  I had seen a car in front of the object in question turn left off of West Main St then proceed North onto Hospital Rd.  I often wondered if the occupants in that vehicle had seen what I had seen.  Just south of me on the South East corner of Main and Freemont is a church.  And on the South West corner of the intersection there is a wood and brick home.  A home also stood on the North West corner.  On the corner that I was standing there stands a mansion.  I checked the wind around me and listened for any noise.  There was neither wind or noise.  Only the so! und of m y breathe and the sound of my shoes when I occasionally moved a foot or two.  There also was no moon visible and it was a starry night.  The object proceeded to move east over West Main St.  When the object became closer to me the ""headlights"" disappeared behind the trees and when the object was totally within view it hovered over the trees and the home on the South West corner of West Main and Freemont St.  I was in ""awe"" of what I was seeing.  We were caddy corner from each other.  I couldn't make out a body to what I was seeing only approximately ten soft circular white lights in a perfect circle.  The distance of the object or lights seemed to be within 50 feet from the ground or 30 from the top of the home it was hovering over.  It was very surreal to say the least.  I wasn't scared.  I was enthrawled if anything.  I wanted to know and experience more of what I was seeing.  I started thanking ""God"" for giving me a response to what I was only moments ago talking with him and her about.  Then I thought to myself, ""Why me?""  Some twenty-something year old from Peru, Indiana.  I was no one important at least in the eyes of anyone on Earth besides maybe my mother.  I decided to go in for a closer look by jaywalking across the street where I would be right under it or them.  In the same instance that I proceeded to walk over to the South West corner of the intersection the lights and maybe object started to move in a ""counter clock wise"" motion heading South East.  I stopped in the middle of the intersection saying in a whisper, ""Don't go.""  And, ""I want to see more.""  I was not afraid.  I watched as it or they dissappeared behind the houses and trees in town.  I ran to the river which is three blocks south of where I stood.  Which took approximately a minute.  I stood on the railroad tracks that are located on the north side of the Wabash River.  In the South Eastern part of town maybe a half a mile away all I saw was the same ""beams"" of light that I had initially seen shining toward the south.  I still ! could se e no shape to what was giving off the strange lights.  I at that moment assumed it was a plane and came to the conclusion that the object or lights that I saw had vanished.  Only now do I know that the beams of lights where of the same.  The following day I phoned Grissom Air Force Base which is located South West of town to see if there had been any night flights the night I witnessed my UFO.  I was told that there were no night flights in the area.  Which didn't surprise me because the base was due to close in a matter of a few years.  It was only until today that I decided to find out if others have witnessed similar occurrances and experiences by logging onto NUFRC.  You would think that I would have written the exact month and date of this.  But after being laughed at over and over again after telling my eye witness account the month and date didn't seem so important.  Until now.  Many people have labeled me ""crazy"" because of what I tell them.  ""I could care less.""  Now I have validation of what I had seen.  Whether it was ""God"" giving me an answer to what I was asking or something or someone else...",2002-02-22T00:00:00,40.7631,-86.0918

I was looking out my window towards the north and  noticed a bright orange light appearing to be rising from several miles away, as it broke over the shadow. The object was first thought to be a large firework, but the object did not explode, nor did it stop rising after several  seconds. I then thought that it might be an airplane taking off, as the airport is in that general direction.  The object then appeared to stop rising and track horizontally and southward after it had risen approximately three finger widths at arms length.  At that point, the odd nature of the object instilled curiosity and a desire for further investigation.  I went outside, and through my binocularts tracked the object as it approached me at somewhat an obliwue angle.  My binocular power setting was high at first, and revealed what appeared to be two orange lights seperated by a small distance.  My hands were shakey, and at that power things were hard to focus, so my thought was that it was an airplane with wing-tipped landing/takeoff lights.  However, it struck me that the object was making no sound and the typical red and green marker lights were not seen. I then reduced the power on the binoculars, making it much easier to focus the object, and the thing I saw revealed itself.  The object had a large central orange ball of light, in which a smaller orange ball of light circled at approximately one orbit per second.  Several seconds later orange debree was seen falling from the object, and slowly fading in color, as though it were cooling, and disapperaed prior to reaching the level of the trees and houses across the way.  It was then that I thought the object might be burning material caught on an updraft and prevailing winds, but there were not winds sufficient enough to move the object across the sky as fast as it was travelling, nor did the object's shape and characteristic change after the falling debree.  I continued to track the object for several more seconds until it just vanished.  Through the entire incident no sound was heard, and no other color was seen other than the orange of the two balls of light.  Whether it was one object or two is not known to me.  I wonder if others have seen this same object and can confirm what I observed.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,46.17882291666667,-119.16297812500001

I immediately noticed a red light, moving generally from west to east.  It was bright enough that I initially thought it was a low flying, small plane.  I thought it would turn, at some point and I would see a blue or white light.  When I did not, I continued to watch it move in the direction of my house.  Then, it slowed and seemed to make a very tight semi-circular turn, then stopped,and became motionless. At this point, I thought it must be a helicopter, but I continued to watch it.  It gradually became a smaller red light, like it was moving straight up.  Then it seemed to stop again.  It appeared to be slowly spinning now, because about every 20 seconds, it seemed to have a dark band, running vertically. I continued to watch it (by now about 15 minutes had elapsed), I saw what looked like a short burst of silvery threads below it (about 2 inches proportionately in the sky ).  At this point, it had the appearance of a red star, in the sky, vs the earlier appearance of a low flying plane.  It then slowly disappeared, as if it was moving straight up.

Though this event took place some years ago and I did not actually see any vehicles, it is the nature of this event that prompts me to input here.  I have rarely talked about this to anyone.  I think I've told maybe 4 other individuals. I am not a partaker of drugs and have no history of mental illness.  No history of any type of episode out of the ordinary.  I am a healthy adult male. This was a very real event.  This was a event that absolutely terrified me.  I have never, ever been in such a bad situation.  I have the chills just writing about it. I was in a remote area of the desert east of San Diego on the border with Mexico.  Jecumba was west of me by maybe 10-15 miles and Interstate 8 was north of me by maybe 5-7 miles.  I was alone in the Valley of the Moon in April/May of 1998. Before I proceed further, it is necessary to explain my usual awareness and habit when camping alone.  I always maintain a fire and sleep in about 1 hr cycles.  I wake up and stoke my fire.  It has taken me years to do this.  Force of habit and discipline.  I have a healthy respect for the wilderness and my vulerabilty despite my physical size.  I would also like to add that I consider myself ""intune"" with my surroundings.  Sight and sound.  I pay attention to the physical terrain, plants and animals that are around me.  I consider myself highy spatially aware.  You have to be.  I do some pretty hard hiking and I have to rely on my sound judgement.  I don't take risks, though I camp alone.  I'm sure of myself. I awoke to a very serious situation.  My fire was out and I had dim coals.  I was absolutely stunned.  I've never done that!  Ever! I must have been asleep for hours.  I could not see a damn thing.  Maybe a few moments later, as I busy trying to figure out what was wrong with me, the next serious situation occured to me.  There was no sound.  Nothing.  It was as if the all the sound got sucked up into nothing.  No wind and no animals.  If you have ever been alone and are used to hearing all sorts of things...hearing nothing is always a sign that something happened or is about to happen. This next part maybe a little wierd, but I get feelings.  The hairs on the back of my neck were standing on end. Let me tell you, I  got switched on. So I'm laying there in my sleeping bag next to a nearly dead fire and clutching my tire iron in one hand and my knife in the other.  I'm telling you, unknown person, that I was in serious trouble.  I felt a threat. This dawning sence of danger and threat escalated into terror.  Thats when the lights turned on. There are not words to describe to you what I felt then. I'm in a sort of cave made my rocks that have tumbled down off a small mountain.  They've piled on each other forming a shelter.  It's open in several places in the overhead and on the deck.  A powerful blue-white light was pouring in from above!  I mean it literally lit up everything.  No sound.  No sound whatsoever.  I could plainly see the angle of the light coming in at 45 deg.  It then started to orbit my little pile of rocks in a counterclockwise direction.  It was moving pretty fast. I'm an ex-Firecontrolman.  USN.  I've worked with and still work with some serious electronic equipement.  The Navy taught me a lot of math so as to appreciate how the electronics work.  Well, having done enough firecontrol problems involving range, bearing and height, I quickly had a vision of a upside down cone with me at the bottom, or pointy-end.  The source of that light was at the other end forming the circle, or orbit.  The walls of that cone formed maybe a 45 deg angle.  A best guess.  Knowing my terrain, the mountain was close to the origin, that was my present abode, was very close.  Hell, it was peppered with very large house-sized rocks.  Whatever was above me was very close.  Within a 100ft.  Maybe 75 ft.  Anymore and it would have collided with the mountain. Having been in the USN, I've been around all kinds of aircraft.  I been around a lot of machinery.  Every bit of it makes noise.  Noise from gears, turbines, transmissions, AC/DC drives/motors...it all makes a lot of noise. Whatever was at the other end of that cone making the orbit within 100ft of me did not make a sound at all.  If it was an helicopter, for me not to hear the noise of it's turbine, gearbox and transmissio,n it would have been more than a mile in the air, moving at a tremendous speed in it's orbit and somehow maintaining a beam of light at 45 deg to me through the mountain behind me when it went throught that arc. It made maybe 5 or 6 orbits and turned off and was gone. I must tell you of another quality to this event.  When I say it was gone, I could feel it.  I could actually feel it was gone.  I don't know what the hell you are going to make of all this, and this new thing regarding my sence, but I could actually feel the danger abade.  I've never felt that before.  I mean, I had a clear as a bell since that I was in very real danger, like maybe I was going to die.  I've never felt that before or since.  My life is normal.  I swear it.  I'm telling you, however, that I could feel that whatever that thing was, it was evil, bad, malevolent, whatever.  ""It"" did not have good intentions for me.  I wasn't ready either.  I'd like to tell you that I was standing on my feet with my weapons, but it's like I felt I was paralyzed by fear.  It's like I couldn't move.  I was frozen and terrified. I'd like to add that I've seen helicopters doing patrol through this area.  I suppose they were Boarder Patrol choppers.  You can hear them from a mile off.  They make a lot of noise. That thing did not make a sound. That's all I can tell you.  I didn't see ""It.""  I'm not trying to sound proud, or something like that, but I'm a pretty intelligent person.  I know what ""It"" wasn't.  Humans can't make machines like what ""It"" was yet.  I can't say what it was either.  Sherlock Holmes said that if you have eliminated the obvious, whatever is left, however preposterous, must be the answer.  ""It"" was not human.  No one can tell me otherwise.  I'm 100% sure. Maybe five minutes later, I felt like I could move again.  The danger was gone.  I got my fire up and didn't sleep the rest of the night. Investigation of the area the next day before I left revealed nothing out of the ordinary that I could see. I've been fine since then. Like I said before, I don't have a history of drugs or mental illness.  This is the only time in my life where I was unable to explain what was happening to me.  Definitely, it's the only time I've ever been in fear of my life.  I mean, actual fear of my life. You can't have much more of an intence sensation than that. I'll never forget it.  It's not ""all in my head.""  This happened to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Please see similar report from Fontana, CA, from late 1930's.

I am going to write word for word from my journal entry of that day: 4:37am, Stateline Road.  That's the time and place I was when I seen it.  I was heading north, so it was in the western sky that  I spotted ""it"".  I don't know exactly what ""it"" was, but I can describe the scene. I was heading from Milton-Freewater to Walla Walla, going to work.  Usually, when I drive, I like to glance around, especially early mornings, because of all the different hues of color in the sky from the moon.  Well, anyway, shen I was about to cross the Oregon-Washington Stateline Road, I glanced to the left of me.  I seen a bright, green flash, followed by an object that appeared to be on fire, decending at an approximently 35 degree angle, parallel to the course I was traveling.  The whole scene occured in a short timespan of maybe a few seconds.  After watching too much television, I remembered to document the time by my car's clock-radio. Now, I couldn't tell you exactly what the object was, or if it was even an object or maybe a fireworks display. But, given the angle of decent, my best guess it that it was a solid object.  I could anything from a meterorite to space garbage or even something extravagant like a UFO.  I just hope that I'm not the only one who has seen it.

I may have heard a buzzing sound but I am not even certain of this as I was half asleep and confused by the intensity of the light. I looked at the clock and remember thinking that it was still early and I couldn't have been sleeping all that long. I believe it was a little before midnight. I kept thinking that this must be a huge spotlight and couldn't figure where it came from. I still thought that it was police or something. What didn't make sense then or now, was that the light was shining down into my second story room, not up. It definitely was from above and I continued to listen for helicopter sounds.

In the second half of the game I noticed a few individuals seated a couple rows in front of us were looking upward and pointing. When I looked up I saw nothing initially and then spotted a gray boomerang or chevron shaped object high above our heads. The object spun horizontally on the axis of it's left ""wing"" for a some seconds and then became stationary. It remained motionless for a time and then slowly turned vertically with it's edge facing downward, front or back edge I couldn't discern. The object took the form of a straight line showing a flat profile with no apparent fuselage or cockpit. These maneuvers took place over a three minute period and the motions were very slow but deliberate. I was raised in a neighborhood that is in the flight path of NAS Jax and that has afforded me the opportunity to observe various types of military and civilian aircraft from blimps and balloons to C130 transports and P-3s. Given my familiarity with aircraft this object was utterly foreign to me. The skies were cloudy that day and the color of the object was somewhat darker than the gray clouds. There were no features that could be seen with the naked eye or with binoculars and no external or internal light sources. Since it was overcast it couldn't be determined if the object had any reflective properties. There was a breeze in the stadium but whether there was any upper level winds I couldn't say. I couldn't judge with any accuracy the altitude of the object but the banner planes and the helicopter circling the stadium at approximately 700 feet didn't seem to notice the object. For some reason I had the impression that the object was slowly rising and thought it may have been debris from the banner planes, perhaps a letter L that had detached and was caught in an updraft. However the seemingly rigid structure it displayed when turning and spinning discounted that idea. I should mention that my brother was also observing the object with the naked eye and with binoculars and he perceived that the object was ribbon-like and pliant. This was completely counter to what I saw and I suspect that he wanted me to dismiss the object just as everyone around us had. Most of the fans in our area had not noticed the object and those who had spotted it initially now ignored it and were caught up in the game. I continued to observe the object for a full fifteen minutes during which time the object resumed a horizontal stationary position over the stadium with the chevron pointed north. After several minutes it slowly began to move in a northerly direction. As it progressed I noticed a commercial jet heading northwest, presumably departing from JIA. I guessed that the jet was still climbing and had not yet reached a cruising altitude of 32,000 feet. I guesstimated that it may have been at perhaps 26,000 to 28,000 feet and tried to determine the altitude of the object in relation to the plane. At one point I lost the object in the gray clouds and I believe it entered the clouds rather than was camouflaged against them. The plane however remained in view and didn't pass into any cloud cover. If the object did go into a cloud bank that would seem to indicate that it was at a higher altitude than the plane. The two were many miles apart and didn't pass very close to one another but I could determine that at their respective positions that the object was larger than the commercial plane passing nearby. I can't begin to imagine the dimensions of the object if my interpretation was correct. The object held it's course and eventually I lost it in the clouds. There was no mention of it in any evening newscasts. ((NUFORC Note:  There must have been many witnesses to this event.  We would welcome reports from any other witnesses to this event.

In my situation, I had just come off of the Mt.Rose Hwy and were headed south on 395. Looking south I was startled by the intensity of an object floating over the foothills (between Steamboat and Washoe). It produced a very bright, equally radiating white light and moved slowly over the hills until it seemed to simply fall from the sky, in the same manner in which an object might roll off a ledge then drop. That's it. Short lived yet spectacular. The other incident was posted 08/18/00 from a gentleman in Gerlach in which he describes 3 seperated objects flying in a triangular pattern, north to south. I'm not sure of the exact dates, but on a couple of occasions in July and August of 2000 I observed 2 individual objects from my home in Steamboat (just south of Gerlach) that paralleled each other and traveled north to south. In checking several websites I found that what I probably saw at the time were the Space Shuttle and the MIR Space Station.

Planes are not unusual in our neighborhood because we live within a couple of miles of Salt Lake Intl and also the national guard has an airport nearby.  Also, Hill Field is just a few miles north of here.  Anyway, what was UNUSUAL about these planes was that each plane had three (3) spheres that were flying in the same airspace.

I was facing south, when I looked up into the sky and noticed an object moving west to east.  It was very bright compared to the stars, but had the twinkling light quality of a star.  I thought that it probably was a satellite (or perhaps the space shuttle). It moved quite fast across the sky and disappeared within 15 - 30 seconds.  Then from behind my son and I (from the north) a triangular formation of six or more objects moved at a very fast speed toward the south (observable for only 2 - 3 seconds).  There were no lights on these ojbects.  They were a beige color and did not contrast very well with the dark sky.  They struck me as looking like a formation of geese, except  they moved way too fast and were very high in the sky.  In my memory, the object at the head of the formation was a degree or two out of line with the other objects following behind it.  I didn't see them long enough to make out their individual shape, but they were uniform.   At first, I thought I was seeing a spot light from the ground and so I was expecting the pattern to sweep back across the sky to the north, but the objects disappeared into the south.  It was then that I noticed a wispy vertical column moving at a comparable speed to the triangular objects, track across the sky in the same north to south movement.  There was no sound and and no light emanating from either the objects or the wispy column that followed them.  I watched the sky for a couple of minutes after the column disappeared into the south, and tried to figure out what it was I had seen.  I also was hoping that there would be more activity, but no other unusual effects or objects appeared. The pipeline right-of-way is located within 1/2 mile of the Strathcona Industrial Park where several large refineries create a considerable amount of light pollution, as do the housing developments that border the right-of-way on the east side.  Still, the sky was cloudless and dark enough that the big dipper was clearly visible when I was facing north in the right-of-way, as were the stars to the south.  It was also very easy to track the movement of the ""satellite"", that I describe above, as it moved from west to east. I am curious if I saw a natural phenomenon, a light effect or a formation of military planes on a manouever?  What do you think?  My son saw all of these things as well, although when I asked him a few minutes afterward he couldn't describe any details.  He has the opinion that the objects may not be so easily explained as I think they probably are.  Thank you for providing this wonderful service.  I didn't realize the skies above Sherwood Park could be so exciting! Interestingly, the Canadian military base in Edmonton seemed uninterested.  They told me to call the RCMP.  The RCMP weren't able to help either  - ""What do they want us to do?  Chase it?"" was the response I got from them.  Hopefully, this is interesting to you.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,53.52539557823129,-113.27725952380953

I showed my dad what I saw. He looked for a minute and simply  went, ""Huh!"". He then continued to set the telescope. I really don't think he paid any mind. He had always said that he and his brothers use to see thins all the time out on the farm. He knew damn well that ufos existed, but simply thought that people were naive to think otherwise. I continued staring upward, only to see te thing take off at a speed which (I'm assuming) human kind cannot produce at this time.

As I was getting out of bed to get her something to drink, I heard what seemed like a strong gust of wind banging the shutters against the house very loudly. As I approached the window to see if it had been raining, a light of some sort, so blinding, appeared out of the darkness. The windows then violently thrashed open and I went completely paralyzed. All I could hear was what sounded like a thousand sirens ringing and my wife screaming in the background. All of a sudden I began to levitate. My wife had also been paralyzed and was floating, in midair right next to me. I cant remember what happened from that point on but when I came to, I found me and my wife outside, in the middle of our yard. When I looked over at my wife I could see she wsas screaming but I couldn't hear anything coming out. All of a sudden there was a complete silence, and let me tell you, I remember to this day that I have never heard a silence as silent as it was at that moment. Next thing we knew we were transported by a beam of light into what seemed like complete darkness. I couldn't see my wife, I couldn't feel my body, and I didn't know wether I was floating or strapped down. But I could feel this pressure, this invsible force, that was compressing my lungs to the point where I couldn't even breathe another breath. When I tried to scream, nothing came out, I didn't even know if I was breathing anymore. I began to hear my wife gasping for air and once I could hear her, the pressure got stronger and I tried to take a deep breath but inhaled nothing but some sort of fluid that filled my lungs so much I could feel my skin burning as if it was tearing off my body. It was then I began to hear my wife screaming the most awful, horrifying screams and I could do nothing for her. I began to weep as a sharp pain engulfed my entire body. It almost felt as if someone carved from the bottom of my legs through my spine, and up! my body with a dull knife. I have never felt pain so terrible in all my life. I passed out for what seemed like eternity. As I regained consciousness, I'm sure I saw my wife standing in front of me, and it seemed like she was reaching to embrace me, but when I tried to reach out for her, it felt like I had been thrown back and slammed into a brick wall which turned out to be the ground in my yard. I looked over and saw my wife laying next to me motionless. All the pain was gone and I looked over again to see my wife turning. I got up as if I was never even touched or moved or thrown around. I went over to help my wife up, and as I saw the expression on her face, everything inside of me burst  because I knew that they had taken her from me forever. My wife died that night and to this day everyone believes that she passed in her sleep because the coroner could find no trace of injury and no sign of trauma that could have caused her to die. I never told this story to anyone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,41.47117691601652,-81.65460330426801

I drive from Ardmore, Oklahoma to Ada, Oklahoma for work everday. On my return home is when I witnessed something I can't clearly explain. I'm not certain what it was I saw, and would love for you to respond to inform me what I saw was a series of meteorites burning up in the atmosprere or a formation of non-conventional aircraft. However, whatever it was, wasn't of the norm. I've tried to dispell what I saw as not what it appeared to be, but I can't let it go. In summation, I hope the following will help to determine what I witnessed in the western skies of Oklahoma. I was traveling generally west into the setting sun on the Chickasaw Turnpike just on the outskirts of Ada, Oklahoma. It takes roughly 15 minutes to drive from begining to end of the before mentioned roadway. I was approximately two minutes into the first part of the turnpike when I noticed three strangely shaped objects suspended in the sky. My first thought was thin clouds reflecting the setting sun. Still driving and annalyzing these objects I noticed what appeared to be in a formation. One following the other. Maybe a quarter of a mile seperating one fron the other. Further, what was once three was now four. My next guess involved some type of aircraft. I pulled the car to the side of the highway to see wether or not the objects I was seeing were moving or not. After coming to a complete stop I exited my vehicle and stood on the side of the road. Whatever these things were, they were definately moving and moving quick. Like I said, I was travelling west. These objects were moving from the northwest going to the southeast. Driving an hour both ways to work everyday, a person sees a lot of planes flying on the horizon. These looked like nothing I've ever seen. From my viewpoint, the two nearest objects were throwing what appeared to be flame hundreds of feet behind them. Also, they moved from a speck on the horizon to possibly a half-mile away to completely out of site within minutes. My last thoughts before the objects suddenly vanished from site, was they could be some type of meteorite or space debri plummeting to the Earth. This thought was a litle scary. I like to watch the Discovery Channel and have seen severel documentries showing what type of damage an object hitting the Earth can do. I attempted to find out some kind of news about just such a thing the rest of my journey home with no such luck. I then spent the weekend wondering if television would report some type of occurence. Once again the answer was no. I don't know what I saw. I'm asking you. I'm not some mental case who makes up things either. I have a steady career and a solid home life. I don't drink or do drugs. To my knowledge, neither am I insane. Please respond.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,34.80443913043478,-96.70345652173914

The area is farmland for the most part, therefore very dark beside the highway with city lights visable in the distance to the east. Two large blinking lights appeared in the blackness between the road and the city lights. The lights were blindingly brilliant with a bluish cast. We first thought they might be crop-dusting planes, as crop-dusters were still prominent in the news following the Sept. 11 attack. We then decided that they must be something else, given their brilliance and the speed at which the first light suddenly moved toward the south. The second light moved northward, turned toward us but hovered near the roadside as we passed. Shortly, a 3rd light appeared ahead and to the left the highway (same color and brilliance). It then seemed to ""jump"" to the right side, instantly. The third light rose to a higher altitude, separated into FOUR distinctly separate lights of equal brilliance and proceeded to move toward the south. Unlike the first light which also moved at what we took for ""impossible"" velocity, the third seemed to pulsate twice: i.e., it ""disappeared"" only to re-appear INSTANTANEOUSLY further south against the stars, in both cases radically changing shape. It swelled to enormous size prior to vanishing, then re-appeared in smaller mode. After doing so twice, it sped upward and southward at such tremendous speed I could not track its motion with my eye. (I was in the passenger seat, so was free to safely turn my head as it sped away). A combination of features convinced us we had seen no crop-duster, military plane or other easily explained phenomenon: that the light divided into four distinctly separate luminaries, melded into one again and ""jumped"" as it moved... then, that it altered size and shape still pulsating through the sky and finally, that it left with unnatural and amazing speed. All told, we observed the third and strangest light for an estimated period of thirty seconds (we did not calculate the length of time).",2001-11-20T00:00:00,36.78825093333334,-119.78947053333333

"Young couple witness large glowing craft streak across the night sky, as if it were ""exiting"" the Earth. Craft was followed by a trail ",Woodstock,CT,1995-10-15T22:15:00,,5 seconds,"Occurred : 10/15/1995 22:15  (Entered as : 10/15/95 22:15) Reported: 10/6/1997 03:12 Posted: 2/22/2002 Location: Woodstock, CT Shape:  Duration:5 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02694.html,"Summary:  Young couple witness large glowing craft streak across the night sky, as if it were ""exiting"" the Earth.  Craft was followed by a trail of pearlescent light, objected started in NE hor.streaked to about 1/2 way across hor.  Then apparently flew straight out of the earth! Without a trace.   It took a total of three quick ""oh my gods!"" and it was over.  Definitely not a comet! On October 15, 1995, my boyfriend and myself were on our way to meet some of our friends.  It was roughly around 10:00-10:15p.m.  We realized that we were a bit early to meet them, so we decided to just drive around for a while.  The radio in the car was on, but very quietly.   We drove around for about 10 minutes, or so, and then decided to start heading to meet our friends.  We were traveling north on Senexet Road in Woodstock, CT.  I was the passenger, my boyfriend was the driver.   My eyes were suddenly drawn to a small glowing light, seemingly the size of a street lamp, but much brighter.  Almost as quickly as I noticed it,  it started heading in a southern direction (towards us).  Its speed was phenomenal, never in all my years (26 to be exact) have I ever seen anything in the sky (day or night) travel at such an incredible speed.  The closest that this ball of light came to our location was within about 1/2 mile.  Upon reaching that point the object appeared much larger than I had originally thought, it was then that I realized that this was not a plane, helicopter, meteor or comet.  All of which I have witnessed before in the night sky.  If one were to get close enough to be able to measure the size of the object my guess would be that they find it to be probably close to a 1/4 of a mile long and about half as wide.   Once it reached the closest point that it had come to us, it came to an abrupt stop.  Then, in less than a second, it turned, as if effortlessly, 90 degrees toward the west and continued at the previous rate of speed until about half way across the horizon.  It then again stopped abruptly and turned another 90 degrees, this time to the north and as quiclky as if it had never stopped it took off, again this time it appeared as if it left the earth completely!  Once the object made its first turn towards the west we noticed that it had an incredibly long, pearlescent colored trail of light traveling behind it.  This was perhaps the most striking thing that I remember about the object.  It was the most beautiful yet strangest light we have ever witnessed.  The trail of light, judging by the distance and size from our location appeared to be atleast 15 to 20 miles long!  And as bright as the daylight!  We didn't tell that many people what we had seen, for obvious reasons.   When I finally contacted a U.F.O. investigative firm, they said there was a bright meteor in that area around that time of the month.  I told the guy he was nuts, that I know a meteor when I see one.  I said to him,""besides, meteors fall down, not up!  And they don't travel at speed in excess of thousands of miles per hour!""  He asked how I knew how fast it was going?  I told him that in order for that object to travel from one end of the horizon to the middle of the horizon and then out of the atmosphere in less than 3 ""oh, my gods!"" it had to be traveling faster than anything humans have thus far invented.  For a plane to travel the distance that this object traveled in less than 5 seconds, it would take about 20 to 25 minutes!  When the object made its first turn and we saw the trail of light for the first time, I had the most incredible tingling sensation come over my body and my eyes started to water and my muscles all felt tense, my boyfriend experienced similar sensations.  We are both in our mid-twenties have two children, good jobs and absolutely no reason to make anything like this up.  Feel free to post this event, I am no longer worried that people will think I'm crazy.  After all, maybe I am crazy, but I'm definitely not STUPID!  I know what I saw was without a doubt a U.F.O.",2002-02-22T00:00:00,41.9692,-72.0147

I was stood up, when, through the window, I saw something moving in the sky. It was about 500meters away. At first it seemed as if it was 1 object such as a large piece of plasic caught up in the wind. I could see that it was slowly moving in my direction. As it came closer it was obscured by a large tree in a neighbours garden. But a minute or 2 later it appeared from behind the tree and I could see that it was in fact 3 seperate objects moving together, but never touching each other. As they got nearer I could see that they were 3 silver triangular objects. They were flying/floating in a triangalur formation, and each was slowly turning. As they turned individually, they also turned together as a group at the same speed. They were a dull silver colour, and every so often lights would appear from the corners of the objects. The lights would come on quickly and then fade away. The light colours would change, sometimes blue, sometimes red, sometimes yellow. The 3 objects passed more or less directly over my house. At this point I was leaning out of the window looking up as they passed over the roof. As they vanished from view, I ran into the opposite room and looked out of the window. A second or 2 later I saw them re-appear over the brim of the roof. I watched them for another 10 or 15 minutes before they vanished from view. They always moved in a perfectly strait line and although they were close to each other they never touched. There was no sound, and all the time I was trying to think about getting a camera (but I had no film). My girlfriend hadn't arrived home from work (she thought I was quite mad when she returned). I never felt in danger, and just wanted someone to witness it with me. My heart was pounding, and I'll never forget it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

In July of 1997 at approx 2030 hrs.,(dusk),  my wife and I witnessed the following sighting:  I was standing on the front walk , which runs parallel to the front of the house, with a northern exposure.  I was looking across our small valley at the hills to the north.  My wife was inside, in the back bedroom.  Off in the distance, from the south, I first heard what sounded like faint rolling thunder.  This noise became increasing louder, gradually subsided and ceased altogether when the object came into view directly over my head.  My house abuts the hills directly behind.  I estimate the hills to be approx 200-250ft. high...This SAND colored triangle, flying in a NW direction was emitting a faint high-pitched ""hissing"" noise and moving slowly, (approx. 75-100mph.).  Because of it's low altitude and my physical position in relation to the craft, I was only able to observe the under-carriage.  I observed only two blinking lights, (non strobe), - round white light on left side and round red light on right side.  From my perspective they appeared to be the size of a basketball.  I estimate the width of the craft, (at it's widest point), to be around 100ft.  My guess as to it's length would be the same.  There was nothing, other than the lights, distinguishable on the under-side; no indication of landing gear, portals or even seams.  I viewed the craft for about 30 secs., until it passed from view over the next ridge, to the north.  The ground shook, as well as the house's foundation, which alerted my wife who came out only in time to see the craft starting to disappear over the horizon.  Once I regrouped, my first reaction was that if must have been a ""stealth fighter"" - we live about 60mi. NW of White Sands Missle range and are in the vicinity of two other major military installations.  I've only seen a few pictures of stealths and quite frankly don't remember too many details of same.  I'm not what you would call a military ""high-tech groupie"".  The military industrial complex is mostly repulsive, rather! than in triguing to me.  I've mentioned this sighting to a couple of ex-military types, who insist that it was not a stealth. I am a Vietnam ""Illegal Police Action"" veteran.  My background is communcations/marketing, with a degree in Radio and Television Production.  My wife attended college, raised two children and is now busy building a jewelry business.  Our children are grown and pursuing interests/careers.

I was pointing out to her where I saw what I thought to be a fire on Waterworks hill on the northside of our small town of about 60,000 people.  As we were looking a flicker of amber light appeared.  I thought this wa rather odd so I  got out my very light sensiteve binoculars and waited to see if the flicker reappeared.  I was supprised to see the light appear again only this time the light changed to a brilliant white.  I continued to watch and found that the light would change appearance.  About every 20 to 60 seconds light changed color, location and duration although the light flashes only lasted a maximum of about 10 seconds per incedent.  The light firsh was first amber, then white then amber then amber then red   then blue...  I had thought that perhaps these were left over fireworks but the short flash of most of the lights and the intesity considering that it was about 15 miles away made it seem unlikely.  As I contiunued to watch the light then moved behind the hill and projected a beem of   light upward in a ""V"" formation  so that all that was light was the air itself.  Then positioning itself back atop of the hill it flashed two short green flashes.  About a minute and a half later it then flashed a combined blue and red combination light.  As I waited there were no more light flashes for about 10 minutes then out from behind the hill a craft slowly appeared from behind west side of the hill.  This craft had a stack of three amber lights horizontally and vertically.  In the center very brilliant white lights strobed from left to right.  It then changed direction and started moving slowly north toward the small community of Saint Ignatius, Montana.  I watched it slowly drift north for about 3 to 5 minutes.  A comercial airliner then flew directly over my home and within seconds the unidentified craft made a extreamly quick turn to the east and accerlerated.

As I started to cross a wide tressle across the river I happened to look up and was suprised to see a grey/silver cylinder dead ahead at 60 degrees against the clear blue sky. The object appeared small. Its length was about 1/2 my thumb nail's width at arms length and it was about 1/2 as wide as it was long. It looked metallic but I could not discern any other distinguishing features. The sky was completely cloudless and I could see no other air traffic in the vicinity. I took about 5 careful steps while watching this stationary object which just seemed to dangle in the sky. As I was crossing a railroad tressle I was soon forced to look down to confirm my footing, and when I looked up the object was gone. I stood still looking for the object for at least a minute but saw no sign of it from horizon to horizon. As I was crossing the very wide Susquehanna there were no trees to occlude my view. The object had completely dissappeared. I am not a novice to outdoor phenomena, I hike as often as possible and watch the skys everywhere I go.

It was a Wednesday evening, approximatly 10 pm, when me and my 4 children were driving home from church services.  We live about 3 miles off the main highway, on a one lane country road, which is very curvy and hilly. As I turned off the main highway, I noticed, far away in the sky above the hills a bright light. I didn't think anything of it at that moment. As I was driving down our road home, going around curves, up and down some small hills, I still noticed this bright light. It was in the northeast sky. As I neared our home, going down this one particular straight stretch of the one lane road, I noticed this same light, brighter than ever before, right above the hill line, right above our property.  It was 10 times larger and brighter than when I had first seen it, turning off the main highway, 3 miles away. As I pulled down our driveway, our pet dogs ran in front of my van, barking, yelping and acting scared to death.  I could not see this light from the bottom of the driveway because we live down in a narrow holler, but I did see it still hovering over the trees BEFORE pulling down the long steep driveway.  When I got out of the van, I noticed no sound whatsoever. I thought maybe the light was a helicopter hovering. But, I heard no sound. It was deathly silent all around, except for our dogs. I told the kids to quickly get out of the car and run to the house. When we all hopped out, the dogs started running around and around our home, barking, looking up at the sky. When I mean running around our home, that is exactly what they were doing. They were running at breakneck speed, in circles around the home. They may have circled around our home 3 or 4 times, all the while barking and yelping. After making sure my kids were safe inside, I opened the door to look out to see if I could see anything.  The dogs were there, right against the door, and when I opened it, they ran inside. Now, my 2 dogs are outside dogs and NEVER come inside.  This was very unusual behavior for them.  I couldn't get them back out the door. They layed down in the floor and whined and cried when I tried to get them back outside. I ended up letting them stay inside for awhile till they calmed down. Whatever it was went away. But, several months later, in the local newspaper someone had wrote in the ""Vent Line"", asking if anyone else saw the bright light above the hills in the vicinity of Hurricane/Milton area on the very same night my family saw the light. So we are not the only one's to see it.… ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2002-03-19T00:00:00,38.4442,-82.1337

Bizarre magnet-like Triangular-shaped craft floating effortlessly in the evening sky of Southeast Michigan(maybe a blimp)!!!,St Clair Shores,MI,2000-03-22T20:30:00,triangle,1 minute,"Occurred : 3/22/2000 20:30  (Entered as : 03/22/00 8:30pm) Reported: 2/21/2002 10:23:26 PM 22:23 Posted: 3/19/2002 Location: St Clair Shores, MI Shape: Triangle Duration:1 minute",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21968.html,"Bizarre magnet-like Triangular-shaped craft floating effortlessly in the evening sky of Southeast Michigan(maybe a blimp)!!! I have visited this web site (very cool site, I must add) a number of times since March 2000 wondering if anyone else saw the object I did 3/22/00.  It doesn't look as if readers can make contact with other visitors to the site, which is fine, but maybe someone else will chime in or offer an explanation.  Reading the many accounts on this site over time, I'm shocked by how many people have witnessed the black triangular craft that I did, and so many stories match one another - obviously the government has a new technology that they somehow are keeping secret.  Where is it during all the recent crisis, I don't know, but it sure would be handy.   This is all very surreal to me.  It was around sundown (7pm) on Wednesday March 22 in St. Clair Shores, MI near Metropolitan Beach for anyone who is familiar with the area.   I was pulled up to a garbage can near the park entrance dumping some cups and junk from my backseat to neaten up my car.  While in my cars backseat, out of the corner of my eye I see what apears to be a blimp floating over a trees that surround the park.  I really thought it was a blimp of some kind - it was probably 300 yards away at this time, and looked about the size of a semi truck trailer.  I got out of my car to get a better look.  This thing was obviously metal.  No blimp.  It floated like a hockey puck on ice, gliding along the skyline.  Most eerily, IT WAS COMPLETELY SILENT!!!  It seemed to defy physics; it looked heavy (bowling ball like), but made no noise or showed no fire or jet propulsion.  I could only compare it to when you see a helium balloon that has been accidentally let go and it it seen floating thru the sky, but huge and and shaped sort of like the Pontiac car emblem.  It moved laterally toward where I was so it did get closer, but still far enough to where I wasn't too concerned.  I remember like it was just yesterday that you could clearly see a lone green light on the underside of this thing...green like a traffic stoplight, and this light had a cup like metal cag! ing arou nd it, very similar to that which you would see in a gymnasium basketball court around a bulb or on a factory to protect a bulb, but allow for light to shine.  The light slowly and evenly got brighter then dim over and over, pulsing, if not like breathing.   The thing also had white lights at each corner, but not at the tips. The lights were in about 2 feet from the corner, but they were dimly lit.  I wanted to shout to someone, anyone and say, ""look at this thing, what is that, what the heck.""   I wanted someone else to see it too.  It was incredible!  I didnt have a cellphone back then so I couldn't call the police, but I wanted to.  I thought I could ask them what it was.  I could kill myself for not having a camera.  The craft, which was creeping slowly in an eastern direction toward the beach then suddenly stopped, then shot sideways out of site behind trees and the horizon.  It still gives me chills typing about it now.  Part of me knows I will probably know what I saw one day soon, via CNN or FOX talking about the latest spyplane, but there's still another part of me that's wondering if this was something other worldly.  I jumped in my car and shut the door - I was weirded out!  When I got home, I watched the news, expecting to hear something about it.  Nothing.  I told two friends and my mom about it and they laughed at me and said it was a blimp.  No blimp zips like that!!! Plus this thing looked like a gun.  It just looked like hard black metal - I would compare it to a big magnet.  I never thought of it that way before now, but that's it!   One friend mentioned that Selfridge Airforce Base is very close to the Metropolitan beach (and after looking at a map, I confirmed that it is) so maybe it was something from there.  I even placed a non-emergency call to the St Clair Shores Police Dept to ask if they had any calls or knew what it was...they said that air force cargo planes often make flight paths over th area, as do the Air Force Blue Angels which often are part of airshows in the area.  Fri! ends, th is was not a known air force jet.  I don't believe it was a UFO because of the lights - much like you're used to seeing on a terrestrial plane to have placed underneath, and why would a UFO need lights anyway!!??  I imagine that soon this craft will be made public and become as everyday and ""Hollywood"" as the Stealth bomber has become, but for now, I feel priveleged to have seen one.  This site is littered with stories of craft identical to what I saw, so something new is out there.  Print this if you like, I just want to get it off my chest...I have revisited the location twice, but nothing.  I will forevermore carry a camera in my car!!!!!!",2002-03-19T00:00:00,,

Light sphere blazes through the night sky deep in the winderness of the Sacramento mountains!!,Henry Cowe Park,CA,2000-06-10T03:00:00,circle,?20 Seconds,"Occurred : 6/10/2000 03:00  (Entered as : ?6/10/00 ?3:00) Reported: 12/16/2001 6:52:08 PM 18:52 Posted: 1/11/2002 Location: Henry Cowe Park, CA Shape: Circle Duration:?20 Seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20825.html,"Light sphere blazes through the night sky deep in the winderness of the Sacramento mountains!! First of all let me say that I have always thought the existence of UFOs very possible firstly because the government would very likely lie to us if half the rumors about Rosewell and such were true and secondly because I asked around and found that many of the people in my life have actually seen a UFO or UFOs before but were afraid to report it.(Ask your parents and grand parents especially, you'd be SURPIRSED what people have seen) Anyway, my story: I was on a backpacking trip at Henry Cowe state park with my father and his best friend, who have both seen UFOs by the way but were sleeping when I saw this one. It was the middle of the night after the first day of the trip when I saw it. I have heard stories from a few people about golden or multi-colored shining spheres that hover silently and move at incredible speeds, I even met a guy who said one followed his car for 45 minutes once, so I wasn't in shock when I saw one myself. I looked up and I saw something moving very fast across the night sky, at least 20 times faster than a plane. My eyes had to struggle to follow it as it darted by. It was WAY too big to be a shooting star, and it had no tail either, plus didn't move like a shooting star. From what I could see in the 20 seconds it was there it had a white color, like a light sort of, so it was different than the spheres I heard about previously. It came from beyond the horizon and just as fast as it came it darted back into the sky. I wasn't that shocked about it really, I didn't even wake my dad and Bob. I thought to myself: ""That had to be a UFO"", and then I shrugged it off and went back to swatting misquitos and trying to sleep. I think it's obvious these things exist, it's just that most of the proof of ""sightings"" either looks like or is B.S. or a hoax so it's difficult for us to find solid evidenct that these things exist. Even if I, by some lucky chance, happened to have a video camera nearby and I was fast enough to hit record in time to see that thing, it wouldn't be considered proof! . Anyone could just say I created a special affect with Adobe Photoshop(which I could do, I'm a film maker) of a light moving at unearthly speeds across the night sky. The problem is most people are too ignorant for the truth, and they will always be until a UFO lands in their backyard and the greys come out for a cup of tea and crumpets. For whatever reason the mysterious pilots of those things wish to remain anonymous, and for GOOD REASON. Earth people in general are very very stupid, if the truth came out today and president Bush was on T.V. shaking hands with an alien, people would panic and raise so much hell that I don't want to think what would happen to us or the aliens. Some advice: get over it guys, life is short. We can't convince the world UFOs exist until the aliens decide to convince the world UFOs exist.

I droped them off over at his place and returned home. We are both within FRS communication range from our homes. I decided I was going to try to catch a nap, but prior to drifting off, he called on the radio and requested I come back over to look closer at one of the pictures I took in Wyoming. Upon arriving and inspecting this picture, I saw an object I previously considered to be a sun dog. As it turns out, this object, at around 600 percent zoom in BMP format was without a doubt, a UFO. I took the scanned photos and a CD he had tranferred them to, and returned home. I loaded the images into my hard drive and opened Adobe Photoshop 5 to edit. After only rendering x2 in PNG format, I could see an extremely detailed craft:  The craft appeared to be making a 90 degree turn at which it left me a view of the top of it. There was a short moisture contrail behind it suggesting the path and turn. There are visible short extrusions on both sides I take to be wings but these have a forward curved appearance and come to a sharp tip which seems as though the extrusions that are coming from the main body of the craft and ended up curved toward the bottom of the craft and then forward. What I feel is the top view of the craft, I note two dooms side by side but with gentle curves and a forward aft oblong doom, just shy of the nose of the craft which I took to be an intake of some sort. The craft is displaying reflection from the snow capped mountains as well as sun reflection. With the contrail of this craft, I would compare it to a flying Manta Ray.

In my situation, I had just come off of the Mt.Rose Hwy and were headed south on 395. Looking south I was startled by the intensity of an object floating over the foothills (between Steamboat and Washoe). It produced a very bright, equally radiating white light and moved slowly over the hills until it seemed to simply fall from the sky, in the same manner in which an object might roll off a ledge then drop. That's it. Short lived yet spectacular. The other incident was posted 08/18/00 from a gentleman in Gerlach in which he describes 3 seperated objects flying in a triangular pattern, north to south. I'm not sure of the exact dates, but on a couple of occasions in July and August of 2000 I observed 2 individual objects from my home in Steamboat (just south of Gerlach) that paralleled each other and traveled north to south. In checking several websites I found that what I probably saw at the time were the Space Shuttle and the MIR Space Station.

On the night in question, I was on the back deck of my house testing a new telescope mirror on the nearly full moon. I noticed a bright yellow light about a third the size of the moon travelling west to east (overhead) and apparently decending at a steep angle. The color was exactly that of a yellow traffic light, i.e. sodium yellow. There were four red lights, like navigation lights, around the rim; one on the forward side, one at the trailing side and one on the left and right. They were flashing on and off in a clockwise sequence as seen from below. As it decended toward the east it grew larger and disapeared over the roof of my house. I ran through the house, grabbing 7x50 binoculars as I went. Out on the front porch, I steadied the binoculars on the porch railing and looked at the craft, now at tree-top height and no more than a quarter of a mile away. My view-angle was no more than 5 degrees upward. The yellow light was clearly emenating from the bottom of the craft, which was flat and a bit inset. The craft was well-lit by the nearly full moon in very clear weather and appeared smooth and metallic, like new magnesium or aluminum but not polished. No seams or fasteners were visible. The over-all shape was that of a saucer with a dome on top. Over-all diameter appeared to be between 10 and 15 meters, with the dome taking up a third of that. the dome was flat on top and radiused smoothly into the sides, which were flat in cross-section, and had four keystone-shaped windows that I could see from my viewing angle. The sides of the top dome were smoothly radiused into the body of the craft, which curved continuously downward, and rapidly decreased in radius at the edge, curving under to the bottom. There was no haziness at all, and appeared as solid and real as a Cessna 172 flying along. Speed was maybe 50 kph. The interior appeared lit like an office at night, white and bright. No persons were visible, but a white column was in the center of the interior and took up perhaps a quarter to a third of the diameter of the dome, extending (apparently) floor-to-ceiling, and this could have blocked my view of someone on the forward side of the dome. Or it could have been flying on autopilot. Anyone with the technology to build one of these things would be capable of building an autonomous autopilot. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

A friend of mine and our dates were ""parked"" in the country side just to the southeast of our home town in southeast Mississippi. We were facing roughly northeast.  I happened to be looking at the horizon when the first object ascended into view. It was followed by two additional objects of the same apparent shape, size, and color. They appeared dark red when I first saw them, much as the moon does as it first starts to rise. They were in a lazy J formation and flew from northeast to southwest with their closet point at about 2 oclock . As they ascended up from the horizon their color brightened. At their closet point they appeared oval in shape. The outside rim of each object was the purest gold color you can imagine. Think of a simple gold wedding band lit from within. They were gradually brighter toward the center, with the very center being their brightest point. The center was bright white. twinkling like a very large and bright star. They appeared to be three seperate objects. They would black out stars as they flew, and you could see stars between them at the same time. They were silent. I heard no sound. One of the most interesting aspects of this experience was what you felt as you looked at these objects. A feeling of peace and serenity . Strange as it may sound, there was a level of awareness as you looked at the objects. Mutual awareness. Another outstanding charecteristic was the light they emmitted. It was intense but had no glare. It was like you were looking through polorized glasses. It is hard to judge size. If I had to guess i would say that they were at least 50 to 100 feet in diameter. They appeared to be about 80% the size of the full moon in the night sky. As they passed 2:00 oclcck they object that formed the bottom tip of the J suddenly changed directions and flew to the west.

Since the actual date of any UFO sighting is of particular interest and value in any report, is there any possibility you could remember the exact date of the incident?  For example, you mention that you were cleaning up after a party.  Would you have any record, e.g. diaries, receipts, cancelled checks for party supplies, etc., that might help you ""pin down"" the exact date. If you can, would you please take a few minutes to resubmit the report, but using the Online Report Form which is found on our website.  In that format, the report can be downloaded to our database without having to retype it, and we can post the report (anonymously) to our website for others to enjoy. Again, thank you very much for having shared the information with our Center!  We receive many past reports which are reminiscent of yours.  It sounds to me as if you witnessed something very interesting on that evening! Cordially, Peter Davenport         -- Peter B.

It was a clear cloudless night, my field of vision either way would have been at least 40 miles in Southern and Nothern directions. The light travelled from South to North direction and moved over land paralel to the coastline. The light did not blink and took 3 minutes from first seeing it, to disappearing in Notherly direction. Depending on the distance from me, speed could not be determined. Yet if it had been moving overhead, it's speed would have been 80/3 = 23 miles per minute At first I thought it was a plane or a helicopter, but because there were no flashing lights, it must have been something else. I phoned a friend who at the time was the night editor for a large newspaper. When I stated: I have seen something strange, his immediate reaction  was: ""did you see purple lights in the sky ?"" Needless to say I was astonished and asked: have you had more reports on this? He said: ""dozens of reports, but you are the only one from the West side of the country, all the other reports came from the East side close to the German border.

That would explain why it appeared to be too high and fast to be a jumbo jet.  But, then, why did the lights fade out?",2001-02-18T00:00:00,36.109455879967555,-95.93524541768045

We were researching/camping in Gray, TX.  It had been raining on and off all evening.  It was cold and miserable.  At approx. 0100 the rain stopped and the clouds cleared off.  At approx. 0130 one of our members who was facing the opposite direction from me muttered something like, ""Look at that star up there, it's moving.""  Like a chorus from a choir, the profanity from that end of the camp sang out like Bocelli.  I jumped out of my chair to tell them to be quiet but to also see what the hell they were looking at.  I looked up and sure enough, there was a ""star"" that was moving around in the sky.  It moved up, moved down, moved side to side, got bright, dimmed completely and went back to bright again.  It also pulsated.  (This light was in the east) Shortly thereafter, another light of the same nature was spotted just several degrees to the right of the original moving light.  Shortly after that another light of the same nature was spotted several degrees to the right of the last. These lights didn't seem to move great distances from their ""original position.""  I think the first light may have been an exception to this.  At first it moved around in a small area but later moved around covering greater distances than the other two but then went back to just moving around in a small area. These lights seemed to be using the backdrop of the stars as camouflage in that they A) typically only moved around in ""small"" areas and  B) moved with the stars as if to follow the earth's rotation. This got redundant after awhile.  I believe I saw a 4th moving light later in the morning but didn't say anything to anyone.  This went on for the rest of the night/morning. This was seen by all in the camp except for one person who is near sighted and doesn't wear glasses (go figure).  I'm very near sighted and have astigmatism but do wear glasses.  What's my point?  The first two lights were somewhat close to eachother.  Others seemed to be able to see more pulsating than me.  With my glasses off, these two very bright objects in the sky became very bright ""globs"" of light.  For once with my glasses off I could see something better than with them on.  The two lights were definately strobing/pulsating. I have spent a lot of time out in the woods at night but have never seen anything like this before.  For the first hour, we all stood around with our jaws hanging to our knees. After that we just got used to it and watched the ongoing show without saying much.

It almost resembled the color of a cloud.( offwhite) The object I feel was going supersonic speed because it was out of sight in no time at all, headed in a Northeast direction. When I first noticed the object, it was about the size of maybe a nickle or a quarter from my perspective. as it traveled to the Northeast, it rapidly decreased in size rapidly until I lost it over the Horizon. There were no clouds in the shy,just a beautiful evening. This is the first time that I ever noticed anything like this and I tell you that I was really taken back in awe about the event. Could it have been a Satilite, I don't know since the sighting was in daylight.",2001-11-20T00:00:00,38.43080419847328,-78.8831610687023

My friend and I were lounging around her pool and leaning up against the walls, looking up at the sky.  It was a beautiful sunny day with some clouds but mostly long expanses of cloudless sky.  Where there WERE clouds, I would estimate that the ceiling was at 1000' approx.  I happened to call her attention to this one little lone circular cloud in this big expanse of blue sky.  As soon as I did, there just appeared something in front of the cloud that started moving north to south in a fast straight line.  It was silver and round and looked about the size of a BB held at arms length.  I said ""what IS that?"".  She said ""it's not a bird"" and I said ""it's not a plane"" at the same time and just at that moment it disappeared, like it had some type of cloaking device. There were no other clouds in that part of the sky and it just disappeared from view as we watched it. I suspect that it was hidden behind the lone circular cloud because at no time did I see it enter my line of sight from north to south.  As soon as I called her attention to the cloud, it was just there in front of it. The strange thing is that I got the feeling it KNEW we had spotted it and were discussing it. It covered about 1/3 of the sky from horizon to horizon in about 10 seconds.  It was traveling faster than a jet.   The strange thing is that even though we had just seen something we had NEVER seen before, we just kind of went back to our conversation after saying something like ""wow"".

The Red Light had a duratino of approximately 3 to 10 seconds, with an elevation of approximately 400-500 feet. After the red light disappeared, there was a large bright-white ""explosion "" between 50-100 feet above the original location of the red light. The ""explosion was then accompanied by a smaller flashing blue-white light, hich appeared to be flashing in a pattern. In a rural area, this light was extreamly unusual as there are no power or cellular towers in that direction and area. After observing this for about half an hour, I confirmed with the Local Municipal Airport Radar Control(Mansfield Lahm Internation Airport) that there was indead something in the sky. According to the Controler, there were four objects in that general location that were appearing on radar, but thaey were not any form of known aircraft. They appeared to him as ghost objects on the radar, but kept re-appearing, and were moving almost due North in a straight line, and were moving at an abnormally low rate of speed. After confirmation that what I was witnessing was indeed real, I started observing the lights even closer. The lights appeared top be on a translucent structure between 400-500 foot tall. THere were four red lights forming an almost perfec geometric square. After the Red light would disppear, and before the White lights would start flashing I could see the structure, it was very narrow in appearance. Approximately 20 foot wide. While the lights were not on, I could notice a ""cloud"" at the very bottom of this structure, but there was no real substance to the structure. I could see landscape behind the object, but it appeared to be distorted, or out of focus. When either of the lights would reappear, the cloud at the bottom would be gone. Also, upon closer investigation ( I Got out the binocular) The red lights appeared to be emitting a laser of some form. You could see the beam due to! the hum idity in the air. At approximately 23:00 I witnessed nine aircraft flying over the vincinity, and appeared to be in a search pattern over the unknown object. Also, I was able to write down the flashing pattern of the lights, and it appears to repeat itself.

It was the track and intensity of the streak that gave me the impression of an incoming ballistic missile. I actually looked for a place to take cover should there be an explosion.  However, to my relief, there was no follow-up sound or explosion.  Shortly thereafter I arrived home to tune-in to the start of the Art Bell show. Mr Davenport was being interviewed about strange lights over Las Vegas within the ""last hour"" or less.  I'd say that my sighting was approximately coincident with the time frame expressed by Mr. Davenport in his report. The time coincidence motivated my original e-mail report. I have checked my maps while writing this report.  Las Vegas appears north east, and Phoenix slightly south of east of Redondo Beach. I am an aerospace engineer who has worked for more than 10 years on space programs, including support of space launch vehicles. I have a BSEE and 3 graduate degrees in Engineering, including an MS in Aeronautics & Astronautics. ((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM SAME WITNESS)) Message-- I looked at the picture of Dec 19.  The white trailing streak rang a bell. I filed a report of an evening event (6/9/99  21:58 from Redondo Beach Cal.) seen from Redondo Beach on my way home to listen to the Art Bell show.  It so happened that you were being interviewed about the same time about strange lights over Las Vegas.  I went back to again read my report on  www.ufocenter.com and it describes ""An intensely white-phosporous colored streak heading down vertically from the overhead sky..""  The event appeared SE from my observation point while Las Vegas is generally NE.  Thus the streak did not show vertical where the reported event occurred. OK.  First, for what it is worth, that white streak trailing that white ball in subject Dec. 19 photo reminds me of what I saw and reported upon that evening.  It might be that what I saw was thicker and traveling vertically.  However, the white trail is of Dec. 19 is what I meant by an ""intensely white-phosphorus colored streak"" seen against a background of a dark.   Secondly, another point now captures my detection. I consider it of second order but worthy of consideration.  In the Dec. 19 photo, the white streak and ball is approaching a ""target"" horizontally after a vertical decline.  In other words it does not descend vertically into its apparent target-the  volcano. But this too is consistent with the observation and proximate time report out of Las Vegas. I saw the vertical streak SE from Redondo Beach while the action you were reporting upon was over Las Vegas which is NE from Redondo Beach (see my account in the report of 6/9).  So to me this suggests that vertical streak sightings and somewhat distant horizontally observed arial phenomena may still be causally connected.  One other unrelated point.  In the past from time to time observers in your reports on the air refer to flying objects as being ""motionless"". Remember now, that an earth bound observer ""observes"" from a rotating reference frame (the earth).  So if an object is witnessed as being motionless, it is to say  that v=dR/dt = 0 relative to an observer on a rotating reference frame.  It is also to say, that the object has the same motion as the earth-bound observer, which is probably not zero in an absolute sense.

It stayed over our vehicle for approx 30 seconds matching our speed and then moved off to the Southwest. We had just filled our vehicle with gasoline and headed south back to our cabin we were staying in that night.  The weather was light rain with a brisk north wind (approximately 15mph)As we left Graham on HWY 16 we followed another vehicle which turned to the right on Hwy 1287 South. We stayed on State 16. Suddenly an extremely bright light was shinning on our car off to our left. The light was behind some trees but was blinding me; suddenly, it rose in the air and headed straight for our car as we traveled (at approximately 90degrees).  As all of this was occurring, we were talking about something else and were only partially aware of the event. As it got closer we ( approximately 300 yards ) focused upon it with both of us saying ""what is that?"".  Out the driver's window, I could see that there was a cockpit or something under this huge black shape.  I was screaming ""what the Hell is that?"" The cockpit was shinning this incredibly bright light with some bands of red lights.  The red lights were pulsating. The object kept approaching us until it was directly over the car. It then matched our speed (still 65mph)and my friend looked up and sort of gasped. She said that the lights are alternating. All of this time we were both asking ""what is this?"".  As it traveled Southwest off to some low hills it disappeared.  Neither one of us said anything for a while.  Then she asked what I saw and I asked her what she saw.  We both saw the same.  When we got back to the cabin, which was about 30 minutes later we took some sheets of paper and sat across the room from each other and drew what we saw.  The drawings matched! We then called the Sheriff's office in Graham and asked about aircraft or helicopters. He called the local small airport and they had nothing up. On Monday I called Carswell AFB and they had nothing out that way at that time.  I called the DFW control center and they reported no aircraft flying that low on Saturday near Graham.

At the time of this incident I was fifteen years old. The day before I had escaped from the reformatory at Gatesville,Texas. I had gone through Clifton because I had reletives that lived there and was seeking help from them. They did not aid me of course so I walked on out of town trying to keep out of sight of the law. shortly after the sun came up I came into a small fishing community not far from Lake Whitney.Ther was a car there that had the keys in it setting along side of the road in front of one of the houses. Being on the run I stole it and headed out of town. When I felt I was clear I checked out the inside of the car and noticed I had three quarters of a tank of gas. The car also had a clock which I also noticed was running and showed at that time a quarter past six. The two things I mentioned helped me to realize that there was a time lapse that I could account for but that is getting to far ahead yet. I do not know where I was exactly but I had driven for about two hours and Ihad just looked at the clock and the gas gauge. The clock read 8:30 and the gas gauge showed a little less than half a tank. When I looked up from the dash, there was this bright light that actually hurt my eyes. when my eyes focused on the road there was a model ""A"" Ford truck with wooden side rails on it in front of me. It was green and looked new. There were two people rideing in it that I could see from the back window. The truck started slowing down and the driver gave the signal to turn left by sticking his hand out of the window. I slowed down but then that flash thing happened again. I was looking out of my right window to see where the truck had turned and there was no truck. There was no road there either. The sound of the truck had gone as well but I had heard it only moments before. I checked the rearview mirror and saw nothing. I was startled by this and looked at the clock to make sure I had not fallen asleep. The clock read ten fifteen. I looked at the gas guage. It was a little past half just like befor! e. I tap ped the guage but the needle stayed where it was. I had never heard of abduction or anything like that but could not figure out what had happened back then. I still cannot. I drove that car till it ran out of gas and didn't see another car or anyone for the rest of that day along that road. I do not know what road this happened on nor the exact day.

As I walked back toward the house, I noticed a single white object high in the clear sky over my house. I stopped and watched it for about 30 seconds. It appeared somewhat balloon-like, being a very small and/or high-altitude, white colored, vaguely spherical object. It did not have a strongly defined path of travel, but seemed to drift about. It was definitely not a plane or other aircraft. The only possibility I was considering as I watched was some sort of balloon. I ran inside and got my digital camera. When I came back out, I saw that there were now several objects in the sky. Three of them were in a large equilateral triangle formation. The entire formation rotated as it moved off beyond the treeline. There were several other stray objects. After snapping a few pics, I went back inside and got binoculars. As I was walking into the house, I saw that one of the objects made a sudden controlled descent, dropping downward below the distant treeline as if tugged by a string. When I came back out with the binoculars, I saw that only one object remained. I looked at it through the binoculars and saw that it appeared to be oblong in shape, and part of it flickered as if reflecting sunlight. This object eventually rose very high until it was almost invisible, then moved beyond the treeline. It is possible that these were balloons, but their behavior seemed suspect. I have seen UFOs before, one of which I reported to NUFORC several years ago (1998, I believe). Only one of the digital photos came out with a visible object (what can I say, cheap camera). I posted that photo on a UFO message board. It can be seen at (http://www.ufoalert.com/pictures/159.html).

It was spherical and had multi-colored lights along the base that were chasing each other, and it had a red ball on the top. The body was dark, and I didn't see the underside of it because of the treeline. I realized a split second later that it couldn't be the spaceneedle because that particular building is about 15 miles away, and this  sphere was between 1/4 and 1/2 mile away. I had my windows cracked open because it was a warm night, and I don't have a radio in my car, but I didn't hear anything that sounded mechanical or electrical.

"Spotlight within its own generated haze searches around,locks onto us with the lightbeam, then blasts into deep space",West Palm Beach,FL,2001-06-25T21:15:00,light,approx 5 min,"Occurred : 6/25/2001 21:15  (Entered as : 06/25/01 21:15) Reported: 3/15/2002 6:36:38 PM 18:36 Posted: 3/19/2002 Location: West Palm Beach, FL Shape: Light Duration:approx 5 min",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22232.html,"Spotlight within its own generated haze searches around,locks onto us with the lightbeam, then blasts into deep space I have refrained from reporting my account of what we witnessed on 6-25-01 because I wanted to wait and see what others would say over a period of 6 months or so, but after almost 9 months now I won't wait any longer.We've kept it to ourselves and swallowed alot of emotions and neither one of has been the same since.         Here is my account  :  My wife and I were sitting on our patio (wich was coastal waterfront facing due East with no obstructions).Our conversation was interupted when this bright light seemingly turned on like a spotlight at a very high altitude.Like others I aggree it looked exactly like a spotlight from a helicopter-- but it was too high in altitude and it made no sense for a chopper to be using a spotlight that high up.There was NO noise at all and it was a crystal clear night without a cloud in the sky,just black sky with many sparkling stars.This light was large enough to make us feel like it was within the atmosphere--- but other characteristics proved me wrong.I knew from experience that on such a quiet clear night a chopper would have to be at 10,000 ft or higher to have NO noise audible.And I believe 10K ft is pretty much the ""useful ceiling or limit"" for the average rotorcraft.And yet a ""chopper"" is the only craft that can ""hover"" in one spot as this one did.(A Harrier jet wouldn't be goofing around hovering at this altitude). The ""light"" was indeed engulfed in a haze as most others said------ this haze seemed to be pruduced by the light source.The light looked like a flashlight searching in the dark--- it was actually searching around WITHIN it's own sphere of haze/fog and the beam stayed within the haze. As we staired in amazement we said things like ""Oh my god !!"" But we were at ease and actually had feelings of elation.   At this time the ""beam"" of light found its way to us and ""locked-on"" to us as soon as it crossed our position, and at this time began to move slowly directly towards or ""at"" us.We both had the overwhelming sensation that we were going to quite possibly ""beamed-up"" any second because we had this beam pointed directly at us and the source began to slowly move at us. Although I didn't want to miss one second of looking at this thing---- I had a realization that if I didn't make an attempt to ""record"" this event in some fashion it may very well be reduced to a fairy-tale story buried in skepticism by all we shared it with. I knew I had our camcorder literally within 2-3 feet just inside the sliding door and I made a frantic move turn around, throw the door open, reach and grab the camcorder swing back around simultaneously pounding my finger into the ""power"" button to fire it up and DIVE back out onto the patio all in 3-4 seconds. Well this ""light"" honest-to-god seemed to respond instantly as I pointed at it with the camera and just bursted into deep-space infinity all at once actually FORCING the haze that was surrounding it into a downward spiral/corkscrew fashion--- and as others have  said, this haze/fog lingered for awhile as it decended.The light was instantly gone leaving only the black night sky and stars to see. In OUR case, the story DOES NOT END HERE !!!!! As we sat in SHOCK and AWE on our patio-- we refused to leave our positions for about an hour thinking it may come back-- but it didn't. So we went inside to nervously play the tape and see what I got on tape-------- and I actually DID get the last few seconds before it took-off.And to me, the interesting thing on tape was the downward spiral it created in the haze when it accelerated out of there from a stationary position !!! This shows PROPULSION !!            Sorry guys, but NO missile can sit stationary at an outer-atmosphere altitude, then suddenly take off at an immeasurable speed into infinity with NO ""blast"" characteristics behind it, and what does a spotlight have to do with a missile anyway ???????? Something VERY strange happened with our vcr.We tried to turn it off because we were going to bed and it WOULD NOT turn off no matter what buttons we pushed ! I just left it like that and we went to bed.        The next morning we went to watch the tape again and the damn vcr began to chew up the tape !!! I tried to stop it but by the time it was through------ we had lost the EXACT length of tape to get rid of my proof of  what we saw.I thought I was going to drop dead I was so mad--- we have never had a tape get chewded in 20 years of watching videos and this ONLY chewed the ""sighting"" footage part and the rest was fine.The vcr has NEVER acted up again since this and we continue to use it today. I tried to take the tape to a specialist to try and correct the ""fold"" that resulted in he tape and he said it was not correctable.I still have the 9 foot section of tape sealed in a container and plan to hopefully find someone to restore the tape to ""watchable"" condition. The reason I know this tape is so important is not only what it shows------- but what it DOESN'T !!  Anyone seeing this tape will know it wasn't a damn missile launch. I mean C'mon guys, listen to the reports including accounts from 06/07/98----- they don't even ""sound"" like missile launches--- they lack the proper characteristics as even the people who have lived near the Cape for many years and KNOW what launches look like---- have said !! I am asking you guys now how I can ever get the chance to communicate with any of the other people who have sent in reports---- especially the pilots like the one that was flying South and caused you guys to change your explanation at the bottom of each report to state that it was an offshore submarine launch instead of the former KSC launch  ??  Can any of us ""sighters"" communicate with each other and share thoughts on this unique encounter ? Can/will you guys have something set up where someone like myself can talk-to and eventually meet others who saw this ?  Because I want to. By the way, I am a college grad,38,a military vet,former military flight officer candidate and paratrooper.                                                    I think you need to put my report on your website in its entirety with no editing.

I am reporting a different shape, but in such a close time-frame and geographic location that it tends to make me think we probably saw the same craft, about a half hour later. Date:  July 23, 2001 Location:  Del Dios, just southwest of Escondido, CA, on Lake Hodges. Weather:  Clear, starry sky. At about 10:40 PM (22:40), we (two of us) were alarmed by a loud, relatively high-pitched whine overhead outside of our house-- apparently an aircraft, on a descending path from the west.  The impression of ""descent""-- increasing volume, i.e. sound from an incoming source-- was fast enough for my friend, who is an experienced pilot, to say that it sounded like it was in trouble. I went outside and spotted the craft to the north-northwest of us, at an apparent altitude of about four thousand feet, about 1/3 mile to the north of us, moving almost due east.  The whine of the engine had stabilized, and the craft was cruising slowly to the east.  My friend put shoes on and came out too.  What was visible were four blinking red and four continuous white lights in a kite-shaped pattern (I chose ""diamond"" <> shape out of your menu choices, but it had a shorter point to the front than to the back).  The craft filled the pattern of the lights-- that is, it was not an airplane body with wings sticking out.  Stars were blocked out (and reappeared) as they crossed the ""line"" from one pair of red & white of lights to another. The span ""across"" was at least comparable to the wingspan of a 737, with the length about one and a half times what would be expected.  My impression is that it was more like 1-1/2 times that size, but size and distance are tricky to estimate at night.  The craft was moving distinctly slower than a 737 on final approach, however-- i.e. at what should have been well below ""stall speed"" for any plane of its size. It was in sight for about a minute and a half, in level or close to level flight, going almost due east, before it disappeared behind trees and a low ridge northeast of us.  That path would take it over the city of Escondido perhaps a mile north of the central downtown area.  It traversed one and a half to two miles of sky while it as visible, so its apparent speed was about 60 or 70 miles an hour. The sound it made was like the whine of a turbine, with a ""beat"" in it on about a one to two second interval.  The beat was not, however, like the beat caused by wave interference from two or more sound sources slightly out of phase.  (I'm a musician, with a decent knowledge of physics.)  I am reasonably sure the whine was from a single source, not multiple engines. It made me especially curious because of the many reports of ""triangles"", whereas this was apparently kite-shaped. I mentioned it to several friends the next day.  One of them said they had been on the coast highway around ten, and had seen something out over the ocean that they couldn't identify, but didn't pull over to get a better look.
