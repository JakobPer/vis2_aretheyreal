I was using the binoculars to watch a family of falcons near the woodline to the south of where I was sitting.  It was a hot, clear day.  Not a cloud in the sky, visibility was for miles from the sky, I'm sure.  There were also high flying aircraft in the sky that day, and from time to time I was pointing the binoculars to get a look at the aircraft and their contrails.  I've been an aviation enthusiast for my entire life and have attended countless airshows featuring both military and civilian aircraft.  There was an aircraft flying at high altitude, leaving a contrail.  I followed it with the binoculars as it traveled from south to the north.   After following it for approximately 10 seconds or so, I noticed a strange metallic glint just to what would have been the aircraft's 8 o'clock.  I remember thinking, ""wow.. that plane is close to the other one.."" but then realized that this object wasn't moving, and wasn't leaving contrails like all the other aircraft at that altitude were.  I pulled the binoculars away to see if I could see the object without the aid of the optics, but I couldn't - so I looked through them again, found the object again.  It was completely stationary.  Definitely metallic.  I remember seeing the sun glimmering off the surface.   It was far away, and I was using 7x50 power binoculars..  I could tell it was egg shaped with what appeared to be.. spikes jutting from the craft.  I looked away from the binoculars again to try again with my naked eye, but couldn't see it.  I went back to the binoculars and was unable to find it again.  I'm under the assumption that it must've left the area, as I was unable to find it again. I was unable to obtain a picture, much to my consternation.",2017-06-02T00:00:00,33.532509954751134,-83.90798959276019

It was a clear night, so I sat down on the porch and leaned back to do some star gazing. A few minutes in, I noticed that some of the stars were moving, in tandem.  I focused in on that area, and there were 5 “stars” in a V-formation.  I realized that it was a fairly large triangle-shaped craft of some sort, because I could see the dark shape blocking actual stars from view, as it passed overhead. It appeared to be quite low in the sky, was quiet, and moved slowly.  A shimmering light passed all over the bottom of the craft several times, independent of the five V-formation lights.  I watched it cross the sky until I couldn’t make it out any longer.  I’m not far from Stewart International Airport (public/military), and suppose it might have been a military plane. Of note, the street lamp on the corner went out while the craft passed over, then started glowing slightly until it reached the normal light, seemed to get brighter than usual and orange-tinted, and abruptly went out again.  The lamp remained dark afterwards.  The bulb probably burned out and the timing coincidental; but it was odd, so I thought that I’d mention it, in the case that anyone else had witnessed a similar coincidence.",2017-06-02T00:00:00,42.261535,-73.74847571428572

It was a very cloudy evening, and the sun was going down, but it was still bright.  Our kids (ages 19 and 11) started yelling to look at the UFO moving through the clouds!  The entire sky was cloud covered, so my husband, my mother and I had trouble finding it.   At first I thought the kids were just messing with me because they know I believe in UFO’s and no one else in the car did, so I didn’t look.  However, the panic and excitement in their voices along with the frantic pointing made me think this might not be a joke.   Due to the amount of heavy cloud cover, I was still unable to see it.   They took the cell phone and made a clear live picture of it moving very quickly in a straight line.  I have to say, when we looked at it, you can clearly see a perfectly round sphere moving quickly through the clouds just as they said.  Other than its shape being a perfect sphere, the color was odd.  It was the same color as clouds but slightly lighter.  Not metallic, not white, almost translucent.   That along with the perfect round shape and the fast movement made it visible against the back drop of the darker blue cloud.  It could have easily gone unnoticed if you were not looking in its direction.  This was not an airplane.   My husband, the complete skeptic said, “I don’t know what it was, but I know it wasn’t a plane.  It certainly was odd and something to consider.” ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.

It looked like something close to being spherical shape with white lights revolving around it.  We were about 1/4 mile away.  There was absolutely no noise which was extremely odd.  I turned down the next country and watched this object slowly go down behind a house with hills behind it.

We stopped to try and get the cows off the road, when a neighbor, whom I knew, came down to help.  He asked if we knew what had happened because cows just don't break down an electric fence for nothing.  We didn't say anything about what we had just seen.

We were sitting outside late afternoon and noticed a stationary light at high altitude.  It appeared to be “twinkling” and we wondered if it might be a weather balloon.  Looking at it through binoculars, we saw that it appeared to be a sphere with two smaller spheres that were either rotating around it, or the object itself was revolving, as the central sphere would shine a very bright light which would then disappear, only to reappear within a second or two.  We had a difficult time at first determining its shape because of the brightness of this light that appeared and disappeared. The light, which we at first thought might be just reflection, was very strong, and seemed to have a “diffraction” effect around the edges, which were blurry and rainbow colored.  We decided that it was no reflection, but that the sphere was actually emanating the light. After about 15 minutes, the object drifted north, and we followed its path, still observing through binoculars.  The drift made us decide it might be a balloon after all, but we kept watching because it was so unusual.  After about 10 minutes, it drifted south again, to return to its original spot.  This of course sharpened our focus, as its movements were now not simple “drifting,” but purposeful.   Then, suddenly, it started to head west, which would bring it almost overhead. It accelerated slowly at first, and as we watched we noticed that its form seemed to shift.  Overhead, we could see that the material it was made of was extremely shiny, almost like glass, and highly reflective.   The object was flying in a straight line but it “rocked” and “pitched” a little, so that the light emanating from it plus the reflectivity made it difficult to determine what was happening, as it seemed to be changing shape, elongating, and splitting into a boomerange shape, but with a middle sectio! n that was slightly smaller than the two edges.   Within a few seconds it lost all luminosity and became a dull dark grey triangle with what looked like 5 darker circles, one at each apex and two between those at the top and bottom.   It flew perpendicular to the earth so we could see the shape clearly, and rapidly disappeared in the distance. After about twenty minutes, we looked in the same direction we had originally seen it, and it was back in the same spot, but this time at a much higher altitude.  It stayed in that spot for about ten minutes, looking like the sphere with the light and the two smaller spheres rotating around it, then it changed to the dark grey triangle again.  Suddenly what looked like a puff of “vapor” emerged from it and the triangle shaped shrank rapidly and disappeared.",2017-07-07T00:00:00,39.68000198902607,-104.7929670781893

I am a 50 year old male who has enjoyed camping and stargazing since I was a kid.  In that time, I have watched countless satellites cross the sky, and am very familiar with their relative brightness and speed, and that most of them tend to move along an equatorial route instead of a polar route.  I am also very familiar with the ISS, and use a phone app that tracks its orbit. On July 1, 2017, the skies were clear.  I was outside moving items out of my brother's Dodge Siesta RV, which was parked at a rural residence between Kent and Auburn, Washington.  Among the items was a pair of Jason brand binoculars, 50x magnification.  They are powerful enough to see the 4 largest moons of Jupiter on a clear night. I had been bending and lifting boxes, so I decided to take a break by laying on my back across the hood of my car and use the binoculars for stargazing.  Within seconds, I caught sight of what I first thought was a satellite moving from south to north in a straight line.  Immediately I knew it couldn't be a satellite because of its incredible speed, yet it was too slow to be a meteor.  Typically, if I keep the binoculars still (not panning to follow movement) and let a satellite cross my field of view, it takes between 15 to 20 seconds to cross depending on my angle of perspective.   This object passed the binocular's field of view in about 4 seconds.  Assuming that directly above my head is 0 degrees, the object was about 20 degrees eastward of my location.  It appeared like most satellites; a single point of white light like a star moving in a straight line.  The light reflecting off it was as bright as the average star.  I listened for the sound of jets, but heard nothing.  I figured it had to be a military jet, but a jet appearing as a single point of light through 50x magnification would have to be at an extremely high altitude, and this object was moving far too fast to be a jet at such a distance.   I tracked the object's movement for about 20 to 25 seconds.  Then it stopped.  It didn't gradually slow to a stop.  It stopped the way an Indy 500 car stops when it hits a granite wall.  I kept the binoculars trained on the point of light for a couple more minutes, but it sat motionless like it was just another star. I told my brother what I had just witnessed, and he directed me to your sight to file a report.",2017-07-07T00:00:00,47.38164504608295,-122.19678513824886

My senses are always on high at night since I have a bit of a phobia of the dark, but when I glanced out my bedroom window a saw a strange light in the distance; hovering over the large field thats across from my house. I was a bit confused and at first just wrote it off as some sort of helicopter or airplane.  But as I got up from my bed to observe the light closer I have reason to believe that it wasn't.  The light was way to close to the ground to be a airplane and fidgeted/moved way to abruptly to be a helicopter; wasn't hovering like I assumed a helicopter would (also no noises that sounds like a helicopter, it was silent). The light itself was kinda a yellow-orange with a red colored tint that fluctuated around the edges of the light. It paced in the air for a moment before it was joined by another matching light.  They floated above the field moving about a! nd what looked to be lights shiny down from them onto the field (like floodlights!).  They continued to move above the field before one of them either faded out of moved away (couldn't tell but it just started to get fainter) and then the other one just disappeared a few minutes after (just disappearing right of the back, not like the other one who faded).  My dog, who had been sleeping downstairs, had been barking off and on contiunesly in the night.  And at first I would have written this off, but considering how late she stayed up barking (much later then she usually does) I have reason that she might've been effected by these lights.  Though I do have to admit that she is a bit senile, so I wouldn't take her actions at the upmost proof. I went to bed last night confused but woke up feeling normal.

Summer 2007, I think it was, I had several sightings involving brilliant white orbs of light. One, the first, was so similar to the 6/9/17 Boulder, CO, report, that I have been moved to recount it here. In my original report, I described two types of orbs, one brilliant white that appeared as a metallic disc upon arcing miles away in a second or two, then pausing before disappearing straight away.  Another orb, deep reddish orange, smooth-surfaced, glowing darkly, appeared at the end of the event.  I now am thinking it may well have been the same craft!   After the initial sighting, with the object having arced away from a standstill corresponding to my fearful reaction, and while I was feeling bad for having only seen it so briefly, I think it came back, only this time it was moving slowly beneath the clouds erratically shining a beam up into the clouds along with a red pulsing light, still overwhelmingly brilliant white orb of light otherwise.  It disappeared into the clouds. Some moments later the reddish orange dark glowing orb appeared just hovering up in a pocket under cloudy outcropping  directly above me until the clouds enveloped it. Wish I knew what they were. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2017-06-22T00:00:00,47.4148,-119.4372

On a December evening, I was driving home from Fairbanks, AK, to Fort Greely, AK, and noticed several 4-5 bright stars as they appear to my right off the Tanana River.  These stars were abnormally bright and seem to move; however, at night in AK, you can see bright stars, but none like these. A few minutes of following the stars, I noticed something hovering above my car slightly out of view.  I could see the tip of what appeared to be something triangular in shape, with 4-5 green lights heading towards the mountains, no one lives in this area—it was moving towards Delta Junction/Fort Greely area.  The object was maybe several hundred feet above me and made no noticeable noise. Later, rather a few seconds later, I looked to my right, and the stars I had seen were gone.  I had no sense of fear I was oddly calm, I think I was in denial.  I talked to another person, but only 5 years later, and they stated they seen the same thing around the same period, but felt embarrassed to talk about it, too. I was the observer that night.

My neighbors were also doing some firewalls, and I went out my home to  watch them while walking my dog.  Then I saw a formation of six (6) bright incandescent red/orange oval objects in the sky, to the east, traveling from north to south.  The distance between each object was exactly the same, and there was not a noise from them.  The traveling speed was constant.  So, initially I thought a kind of balloons, perhaps attached between them, however I disregarded that explanation because of the constant speed, no noise, and the size of each object (bigger than a commercial airplane).  I see frequently lot of planes due to the location of the two airports (MIA and FLL), and these objects were not airplanes.  My neighbors saw them also, and they described them as something “bizarre”.  I follow the object with my eyes all the way, until the horizon did not allo! w me to watch them anymore.  However, after the six-object passed all the way in front of my sight, one minute after, another object, same shape and color started flying in the same spot the six other started minutes before, and this one follow the same path of the others, at a much more speed than the previous ones.

It was real dark, it must have been cloudy cause I didn't see a star or the moon anywhere.   I walk behind the barn and kneel down and stare at the ""house light"".

The orb was stationary above the tree line for a good 3-5 minutes, in which time we had a discussion.  Was it a plane watching for fires?  We reasoned a plane couldn’t stay in one location for so long.  We changed our logic and thought perhaps a helicopter.  It seemed to still and small to be a helicopter, there was no sound that we could detect.  We then reasoned it was a droid.  We have no knowledge of droids or their behavior.   Then the orb started moving in our direction, it gave off no sound, changed its color form em! erald green to red, moved behind a tree about 20 yards from us, changed color back to green and floated off in a southern direction beyond our view.  That was weird, we decided, what was that?   Within 5 minutes, it came back again, hovering above the tree line where it first appeared, to the left of the fireworks display.  I went into the house and got my phone and binoculars.

My attention was focused on the sky, and as I was passing the high school, I saw a bright green light, falling from the top of sky and down, northward.  A green meteor!  Must be a piece of on-fire nickel, burning green - that's what I thought at first - and then it just abruptly disappeared.  No sparks, no luminescent trail, no after-image.  Then it appeared again, still moving along the same path.  Then it disappeared again... was it blinking?  Yeah, it was blinking.  Huh.  Must not have been a meteor after all.  Then it stopped blinking and accelerated, and I lost sight of it behind the football stands. What the heck was that, thought I?  An airplane?

A drone?  Definitely not a UFO, right?  Well.  That was weird. I had just about settled down again to a regular pace when I saw a spire of light appear suddenly to the north.  It was long and tapered, like an icicle, and it was either shining up from the northern horizon like a stalagmite, or shining down from the clouds like a spotlight.  I couldn't tell which, but it was moving from east to west, covering about 10 degrees of arc per second. Now, seriously.  Come on...  WHUT. THUH?  I watched it for about five seconds, in a kind of stupor, until it moved behind some trees and I lost sight of it.   I ran back toward the football field and past the stands to get a better view, but it had disappeared.  I stood still for about a minute, watching the sky and wondering what would happen next... and then the green light appeared again!  It was closer this time, and I could see that it wasn't a single light.  It was actually three green lights, huddled closely together, in the shape of a triangle... HUH???  I watched as it hung in the air, perfectly still, and then it began to move to the left, accelerating.  It went out again for about two seconds, and when it came back on it was perfectly still.  Then it moved again, to the right this time, and then it went out again.

We were traveling eastbound on US Highway 54, approximately 5 miles south of Camdenton, Missouri.  The highway runs fairly north at that point. The skies were clear with a white fluffy cloud bank several miles ahead of me.  I saw what was clearly a large gray colored rectangular box shaped craft floating from my right to my left just this side of the cloud bank, moving in a southwesterly direction,  And what I would guess to be several miles in front of me.  This thing was immense but just how large was hard to tell because of the distance. I glanced at my watch, it was 12:25 PM. There are a lot of trees alongside the highway and this is a hilly area, so I lost sight of the craft a couple of times by going up and down the hills, but I saw it for approximately a total of 30 to 45 seconds, before I lost sight of it for good because of the lay of the land. I was looking for a place on the shoulder to pull over and stop and jump out and run back to tell my wife and daughter what I had just seen and when I did it was just before a T intersection with a road to the left, so I told my wife about what I had seen and told her to drive down that road and see if she could see the object which she did and she never saw it.

The details of the following report have been formally submitted to GreyStar Paranormal Institute by the clients and an on camera interview and screening was conducted. On the morning of February 19th, 2017, at 4:12am (witness #1) was on their front porch which faces the Manchester, New Hampshire, Airport located 2.5 miles in a straight line of sight from their front yard. Witness #1 noticed lights that at first were thought to be just an ordinary airplane in the distance.  (Witness #1) has lived at their current residence for several years and is very familiar with the air traffic and common flight paths used by the airport in the area.  The lights soon deviated from a seemingly typical course and started an approach to (witness #1’s) location.  The distant lights of the object became increasingly bright (at least twice as bright as a normal aircraft) as described by (witness #1).  At that point the witness left the front porch to wake his wife that was sleeping in their bedroom. Upon waking his wife (witness #1) requested her to come outside to witness this unusual event. Upon exiting their house to return to the front porch they notice that the lights were now just above the tree tops in their front yard making a slow descent, even closer to the tree tops, (witness #2) stated that the object was so close that it was almost touching the tree tops. Both (witness #1) and his wife watched in amazement as the outline of a black Triangular silhouette hovered silently directly above their home coming to what seemed like a brief stop.  They could clearly see the objects shape as it was slightly backlit by the aura of the soon to be breaking light of dawn, there were bright white lights on all 3 corners of the craft. (witness #2) remarked that the object was totally silent not giving off any engine noises typically heard with normal aircraft.  They did however, note that there was a slight whooshing sound present but not sounding like anything associated with any man-made objects. (witness #2) also noted that they could feel a warmth coming from the object. Both witnesses became frightened by this event unfolding just above their house. (witness #2) wrapped her arms around (witness #1) and she said she could feel his heart pounding from the excitement of the event as they stared at the craft in amazement and fear. During this moment, the object went from hovering directly above their house to almost passing completely over their house as if there was a cut in the frame during the event being played out.  The object seemingly hopped from one location to another without gliding as previously witnessed. Both witnesses then reported that after noticing this glitch moment that they both became almost robotic in demeanor as if what they just witnessed was no longer important.  The light of dawn had fully broken as if in one moment it was slightly getting light out to “it is now light out” in the next moment. Both witnesses could still see the object moving slowly over their house but instead of following the object that was heading towards their back yard both witnesses started to walk back into their house. They both entered the home and made coffee, not talking about the event other than a few blurbs about how odd the whole thing was.  They also reported that the whole event occurred in a matter of minutes but upon looking at the clock when entering the house they noted that it was now 4:45am and over 30 minutes had passed. It wasn’t until later that evening both witnesses realized that what they experienced was highly unusual and they decided to report the incident a couple days later to the ufo-hunters website and then a couple days later they reported the incident to GreyStar Paranormal Institute. This report is the result of the interview conducted by GreyStar.  Photos of the location were taken. No physical evidence was gathered however, a physical examination of the witnesses was conducted and a full background history was gathered.  The witnesses report that they have had unusual experiences in the past with strange occurrences and sightings of balls of light and odd animal behavior over the course of several years. There have been unusual electronic disturbances in the home in regards to the function of cable boxes, cell phones, computers and other electronic devices. (witness #2) reported to GreyStar staff that a family member on (witness #1’s) side of the family has allegedly acknowledged the possibility that they have had encounters with ufos & extraterrestrials, this statement has yet to be confirmed however, follow up interviews will ensue to confirm this statement. If the statement is true and is confirmed, then that would mean that there could be a family history relating back to UFO sightings and alien encounters as common with lineage based UFO encounters. The witnesses answered nearly 200 predesignated questions flawlessly and scored above average in authenticity.  The witnesses showed genuine concern when recounting the events they had witnessed and they were outwardly disturbed by what they had experienced.  It is in the opinion of the examiner that hypnotic regression be pursued. When this idea was presented to the witnesses only one of them agreed.  It is believed that the other witness is fearful of what they might remember and they have not been pressed further however, they have been given an open invitation to pursue hypnotic regression in the future. GreyStar estimates from details given from in the description by the witnesses that the triangular UFO was approximately 60ft wide by 90ft long calculated by using google earth as a measuring tool. This concludes our report to the National UFO reporting center.  This report has been submitted as a means to cross reference future data for other local UFO sightings and to attempt to see if anyone else in the area witnessed anything unusual or similar on that morning. The results of the of the yet to be conducted hypnotic regression may become available on the GreyStar Paranormal Institute website in the future if a release of such information is agreed upon by the clients and can be submitted to NUFORC for their records upon request if released by the clients.",2017-03-10T00:00:00,42.8731,-71.3904

(Note that the lights were very far away so I do not know the size or if this was a physical craft or simply a light.) more and more began to appear and I managed to capture all of it on my IPhone 6S. According to my Iphone, the location of the video begins at Coyote Run Golf Course, before my landing at Midway International Airport.  There is no sound in the video and this may be because my headphones were plugged in at the time because I was watching a downloaded television series.  Although I don't know if that is the reason, I beleive it to be that it was the result of my faulty headphone microphone.

Dear Sir:   As per our telephone conversation two weeks ago, following is a report of my sighting:  On a summer day in July of 1950, I was driving my car on a rural road in Sierra Nevada mountains of Plumas County, California, about 4-5 miles from the town of Quincy, California.  At the time, I was almost 19 years old, and I had two friends with me in the front seat, both of whom were a year older than me.  The boy in the middle was about a foot shorter than the other two of us, who were nearly six feet tall, this giving the middle boy a much steeper angle of vision out both side windows. The road was winding alongside of an open field, and I was going about 25 mph.  As we approached a ranch house, the boy in the middle asked, “What’s that up there?”  Since we were just driving under some electric wires crossing the road to some sheds, the two of us near each side window saw a bird sitting on the wire, and said to the middle boy, “It’s just a bird.”  Then, the middle boy said, “I don’t mean that up there, I mean that out there,” pointing out the side window.  The other two of us leaned down to look out, and I immediately stopped the car and shut off the engine, and we all got out. We saw a bright, shining, silver coloured disc-shaped object, like two saucers put together face to face.  There was no sign of any windows or ports, just completely smooth.  There was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  The object would spin completely smooth and straight for a few seconds, and then start to wobble for a few seconds, much as if you spun a metal pie pan on a pointed shaft and then hit it on its edge.  The middle boy had been watching it for several minutes before he called our attention to it, and it had apparently been going about the same speed we were (25 mph).  We watched in complete astonishment, until it went out of sight over a nearby mountain.  I then raced to the top of that mountain to see if we could see it again, but we weren’t able to see it anymore. I became a private pilot a few years later, so I am able to give an estimate of size and height as follows:  It was about the size of a small private aircraft, like a Piper Cub, or similar (aircraft), and was flying about 2,000 feet above the terrain.  At this time of my life, I am 85 years old, and I remember it all like it was just yesterday. I appreciate the time you have taken to speak to me.

I was on an evening walk not far from my house, when I turned in a westerly direction on a residential street.  The time was around 21:00 hours EDT on the date of 7/08/2017.  As I walked generally towards the west, I saw a dark, round object silhouetted against the still bright western sky.  It appeared to be about 50 feet above the tree line at a heading of WNW from my location. It was motionless and emitted no lights or sound.  It also appeared to be slightly wider than it was tall but was generally spherical in shape.  It seemed to be about the size of one of my fingernails, held at arm’s length, from my perspective. The first thought that came to mind was that I was observing a large tethered balloon some unknown distance away.  I also considered a kite but quickly dismissed that idea as there was barely a breeze and certainly not enough wind to keep a kite aloft.  I continued to walk westerly as I observed the object for about 10-20 seconds before the tree line obscured my view.  In that time, the object did not appear to move at all, but remained completely stationary.  I continued to walk to the end of the street and turned northerly at an intersection.  As I walked farther I tried to again observe the object through breaks in the tree line towards the west but to no avail.  The object was now gone. This is the first time in my life I have ever seen an object in the sky that I could not identify.  It did not appear to be a helicopter, plane or drone and (to reiterate) was completely silent.  It appeared to be much too small to be a hot-air balloon, and I have never seen hot-air balloons floating over my neighborhood in the past 4-1/2 years I have lived here.  Therefore, I am mystified as to what it was.",2017-07-14T00:00:00,41.68905889570552,-81.32667975460123

They appear every night; rectangular, round, long stream of lights. This is a summary of what my husband and I have witnessed and observed on our home security camera system since March 17, 2017, when we first observed a strange rectangular string of very bright lights, attached to what appeared to be a metal bar, in the southwest corner of the backyard, picked by the video on camera #7.  The string of lights appeared to be an ordinary light one would have in a shop; however, it is only visible on screen of the video recorder.  When we look outside, the lights cannot be seen with the naked eye. This summary does not address a single sighting, but is current and on-going almost nightly since April 8, 2017, when we first began to monitor and document observations of the nighttime activities, taking place around the property on a regular basis and have replayed and captured quite a few pictures and videos, documenting what we have observed today to date. Since we first began to observe closely on April 8, 2017, it has gone to another level in terms of the entire operation.  It appears that it has become an invasion of our property, now we are seeing strange creatures that cannot be described as humans as we know them.  They are very small in stature, fly in appearing as birds, brightly lit all over, and changing into circles and into small creatures with human characteristics in terms of movement, but definitely not human. When they come in they appear to be carrying out what appear to be specific  pre assigned tasks, prior to the larger equipment, consisting of very long strings of lights that appear to be controlled by something or someone to turn on and off periodically, as they approach the property.  Initially, they were coming from the trees on the west and the north sides of the house, only. Now they are coming from the southwest most of the time, and the West and North some of the time. There appears to be space ship! s and/or aircraft type objects characteristic of but different, i.e. Smaller, but able to light up a large area when they appear.  (Modes of travel) involved in the operations.  Sometimes the forerunners come in as a large brightly lighted circle or rectangular object.  From what we have observed, they come in as workers, here to do a job. They appear to be well coordinated and work in conjunction with the other objects as they come in.  As a part of the preparation, they appear to spray an unknown substance that look like snowflakes and appear to turn into hale or sleet resembling crystal flakes.  When they are in the completely screened pool area they release some type of substance into the water before the others come in.  Sometimes when it rains, we see many of something dive into the pool, which is completely enclosed, with no opening, except the locked doors. They have attempted to remove the small Weber grill from the pool area unsuccessfully. It is difficult to explain what we are personally seeing because it is monumental.  I must mention an incident that happened on May 6, 2017, at approximately 11:30PM when a laptop computer vanished from the reception room, while we were removing items from the car, which was parked right in from of the door.  The laptop was placed on a credenza inside of the reception area; it disappeared and has not been seen since. On the morning of May 29, 2017, at 5:39AM, we were seeing family off who were taking a trip in their automobile; we were in the driveway assisting them in re-arranging some of the articles in the car to make more room.  While we were outside, we did not hear or see anything or anyone, However, on replay of the video, The unidentified objects were flying all over our heads the whole time we were outside, approximately 30 minutes. I have looked for every possible logical explanation to understand what is going on.  Have researched the internet on aliens, demons, religion, witchcraft, national security, etc.   All I can explain is that the activities are very organized, comparable to an army, and there appears to be what I have determined to be the captain or director, who is always present.  Some time they appear to conduct air shows, with precision and formation. There are concerns about water and earth contamination as well as other concern.  We are looking for answers.

At 6 to 7 seconds in in 3rd pan camera movement, upper left just above the sun you will see a potential metallic object reflecting off the sun, pass in front of the Sun's brightness, its reflection then is overcome by the sun's brightness until the object reappears below to the lower left and then takes a 30 to 35° jog to the right.  Space rocks and satellites do not maneuver like that, it's against the laws of physics, their trajectories are set in motion and can't deviate!  The military does navigate their satellites, they can change direction, never in the way you see in the video.  Could be coincidence but the altitude of the aircraft to the upper right means that it is military.  Notice that you can see contrail but not reflection off its airframe, because it's so small compared to the UFO.  I have 15 years professional experience as a videographer/ photographer. 10 years of which, was with Cox communications.  I know what artifact is.  You will see a lens fl! are which is obvious and normal in a lens as one pans up into the Sun.  A lens flair follows the direction of your pan movement.  The UFO comes down from above in opposite direction of the lens movement and lens flare up.  Also the speed of the object down, is faster than the lens flare up. Keep your curser on pause button to click, to stop and review. I have additional pan movements, in same take, with lens flare moving with the pan up, but no object coming down in frame like this.

The object was bigger than a star, but smaller than a planet, and in comparison to a plane or jet lights, it was two (2) times bigger than those lights, it was solid with bright silver shine!  It was not pulsating or blinking at all but it seems as it was in the shape of the sputnik satellite, I can say the craft was not the space station because I have seen the space station in many occasions and it did not look anything like it but also it was traveling at a lesser speed than the space station. The shape was not completely round but kind of oval and the two (I will call it probes) for a lack of a better word,  Probes that had in the front also were shining with the whole craft; I was able to look at it for about two minutes and then could not see more because a tree line got on my way.

ESE from Marietta, OH On the night of Tuesday, Feb. 21st, 2017, about 10:45 P.M. Returning home from work, I saw a defined sphere/globe, bright glowing red orange ball appear apparently out of the cloud cover above (no stars were visible) and then traveling, almost downward, about as fast as a speedy jet liner disappearing over tree covered horizon toward east southeast as I was traveling down Acme Street in Marietta, Ohio. At first, I thought that it might simply be a reflection of a sodium street lamp on Acme Street appearing on my wind screen or one of the large area lights on one of several tall masts near the Interstate 77 interchange with Ohio SR 7/Pike St., only a hundred yards from the opening of Acme Street.  (No way one of these disappeared below the horizon, since you drive under them going through the interchange.)  However, continuing to observe the light as I traveled toward Pike Street the light continued in a fashion matching the speed of a fast jet plane, low, and eventually disappearing over the horizon. It did not seem to get much smaller than when I first saw it appear.  This object did not appear like 'fire' nor did it have a tail of any sort.  The object was close enough  that my palm on an outstretched arm would have covered it up neatly.  The light appeared as a well defined sphere or globe and never changed direction, indeed, almost as if it were coming down instead of going further.  This sighting lasted less than two minutes. There is an airport due south of Marietta, OH, across the river in Wood County (Gill-Robb Wilson Air Field/Wood Cty. Airport), where a West Virginia ANG Unit operates.  However, this light appeared to go past that direction, and did not appear to have any features matching a plane or helicopter.  There were no flashing lights or landing gear lights. I am a casual observer of the sky and have a decent knowledge of what planes look like in the day and night.  My son is an amateur astronomer and so some of that knowledge has come in handy knowing the difference of planets, stars, and other common aerial phenomena.  This was nothing like I'd ever seen before, as it was cloudy and the ball of light was under the cloud ceiling (which in my sons opinion rules out Jupiter, for instance, which was shining in the east—or a comet or meteor) and to my knowledge, any air craft (or phenomena) I've ever laid eyes upon.",2017-03-10T00:00:00,39.4411,-81.3466

I tried to look through the telescope but because they are uva treated ect.  I couldn't get any thing.  I am on the south side of bowen Island and it was before vancouver island.  On the left side between smaller islands.  This was changing color.  I took out a set of binocolars and went outside.  To my amazement when I looked through my binocolars this was not a round shape as I thought but egg shaped and covered with thousand of what I though lights.  This was stationary in the air but my hands were very shaky.  It was like a breathing thing.  In the sense there was another one on another angle but to the up right angle higher up and that the lights of the ship would otherwise completely light up or only a portion of it.   The other one would also have completly different pattern.  I did get my video cam out and only got one of the crafts on it.  Although when I increase the pic it looks like a ball that is morphing and changing colour shape. I am wondering if anyone else saw this tonight??

Their trajectories at first were consistent with helium party balloons.  After three or four minutes watching the objects had receded from orb shape to point light sources and three of the four collard a convergent path while the fourth remained at a distance.  It was at this point that I expected the objects to appear as black dots and plane out with the upper level! winds if they were balloons.

This is an old incident, but I've been thinking about it a lot lately.   When I was 13, my father was taking the trash out late at night, when he came back in yelling that I had to come out and see something. I went outside, looked up, and saw 4 extremely large objects hovering about 40 feet over the trees and houses on my street.  By that time, there were also several neighbors outside as well, watching and talking about what was going on. These objects were all oval shaped, huge, ringed by rectangular shaped white lights that blinked one after the other all the way around the crafts.  They were completely silent, and completely still.  These crafts were gray colored, smooth in appearance.  They were hovering over power lines, and stayed in place for 30-40 minutes. My neighbor called 911, and police arrived.  They stared up at the sky along with the rest of us.  The officer called more police to come and see it until there were about 3 police cars there.  They called the airports around us who said there was nothing flying over our area at the time, even though no aircraft looked like these things did. After some 30-40 minutes of silent hovering, these things just disappeared.  They didn't move, or fly away, they just disappeared.  We all stayed there for about another hour to see if they would come back, but they didn't. My neighbor recorded the whole incident on and old camcorder, but when the tape was later played, you could only hear what was going on, the screen was snow. The police said they filed a report, as this was standard practice when responding to any call.   To this day, my father and I still wonder what this was that we saw.  I would like to get the police reports, but I'm unsure of the exact date, since it was long ago, but the memory of seeing these UFOs will be forever burned into my mind.

I switched over to my 8 inch telescope and easily picked up the object.  This green star object was moving from my right  to my left along a straight line south of Leo. After about 5 minutes, I hollered out, ""Boys, I am tracking a moving object.""  Quickly three more telescopes were set up and started tracking the object.  Soon all 18 members of our group looked through these 4 telescopes and everyone was able to see and track this slow moving object. According to my notes, the object stopped moving several times.  Then moved south a short distance, then stopped, paused, then resumed moving straight ahead.  Basically we were still south of the constellation of Leo.   After about 3/4 of an hour of viewing, the other members grew tired and walked away to their own telescopes.  I continued viewing.  At 3:19 am, the green star stopped, then moved south a small distance, and stopped at another green star, or merged with, or went behind, this new green star.   As I am observing, I was calling out to everyone else what was happening, or not happening, with this green star.  At approximately 3:35 am, something  dramatic happened.  Two  missile-like objects came through the field of view.  These objects flew on a course from the southwest to the northeast.  One object went to the left of the green star and the other object went to the right of the green star.  A white streak followed these objects.  These objects moved very quickly through the field of view.  I continued to observe this green star until 4 am.   I grew tired and turned my attention to the Virgo cluster, which was well up by now.

Was driving 2 friends in the hills of Tustin, CA, which overlook John Wayne Airport, and can see the Pacific Ocean and the Island of Catalina as well.  It was passed midnight and a warm night.  At this time, there were no night flights at John Wayne Airport (but I believe there are now).  It was a warm January night, no clouds, a clear, all the stars (as much as can be seen on a clear night) were visible kind of night. We just turned right on to newport Blvd from Crawford Canyon.  The airport is to our left, and we can't see it yet.  But directly in front of us was the treeline my neighborhood, which was the street of Marcy Ranch, in Santa Ana. I  saw a coyote in front of us, and I'm about to say, ""Coyote!"" to my friends...  But before I do, I notice the a bright flash of light above the treeline in front of us, and am now about to say ""lightning???""  (I was Shocked because there was no clouds in the sky, it was not lighthing weather)...BUT... (At this point, Newport curves to the left, and at the turn, you can see ahead to John Wayne Airport, then the Pacific Ocean, and Catalina, all in one view.  The airport is roughly 5 miles away, in a direct straight line).  Above the runwsy was GIANT blue orb, surrounded by what looked like tangled blue lasers, like a tangled ball of yarn.  The rays looked like those plasma balls' rays, the kinds they have at childrens museums and such that when you touch the ball the plasma lasers gravitate towards your hand.  The lasers were were all were balled up around an orb in the middle.  This thing was huge, maybe as big as the room in the runways control tower, which was right next to each other, so I can decently estimate the size.  It was not much higher than the control tower. A similar smaller orb surrounded by lasers also appeared directly below it.  The smaller ball had to be no more than 5 to 10 feet off the ground.  It was some type of mass, because as it was under the bigger, brighter ball, it cast a shadow directly underneath it on the runway. If you Google Image search ""terminator time travel ball"" and look at the pictures of the time travel ball as it apears throughout the movies, it is kind of a good idea of what it looked like, but this ball had alot more lasers around it.  It was the kind of blue that solar powered LED gardenlights are. It had a HUGE flash, so it lasted a second or 2.  I saw the 2 orbs surrounded by lasers, the smaller orbs shadow on the runway, then looked in the hills in Irvine behind it, which was around the Turtle Rock Neighborhood (I know this because ironically enough, one of the passengers in my car lived in that neighborhood at the time)  It was so bright, it lit up EVERYTHING IN THE ENTIRE HORIZON.  EVERYTHING.  In the next second or 2, I saw:  - The hills of Irvine, behind the airport.  It was so bright, that I Could make out the green from the grass and the brown from the dirt in the hills. I Glanced at the ocean, and the blue reflected off the ENTIRE pacific ocean.  It was beautiful-I glance up and at last moment, and saw the Island of Catalina, and again, the flash was was so bright I saw the green from the grass in the hills and the brown from the earth in Catalina. Where we are, having turned right onto Newport blvd from Crawford Canyon, is just 15 seconds away from my house, which is off Marcy and Newport.  We were silent the whole way, stunned. I pull in front of my house, all of us are stunned, and my buddy in the back says, ""Please tell me you guys just saw that!"" and we all freak out, and everyone shares everything they saw... ONE friend saw just the hills in Irvine, which ironically is where he lived at the time.  He said it was bright as day and could even see a red street light in the hills. The other friend saw the flash reflecting off the ocean and he saw Catalina. On the other hand, as I was driving, I saw the orb laserball, the airport, the hills of Irvine, the ocean, and just barely got a glimpse of Catalina. Eventually they leave and I walk inside home.  My dad is inside, in the dark, playing solitaire on the computer.  I was hoping he saw the flash, but he didnt. I tell him about what we saw, and he shugged and said ""probaby a transformer explosion.""  I laughed because there is NO way it was. I checked the news, called the sheriff to see if anyone called in anything.  Turn on the TV and check the news,  Nothing.  I thought it would be all over myspace,  Nothing. Woke up the next day, nothing on the news or newspapers. The airport runs RIGHT NEXT TO THE 405 freeway, people had to be driving along the 405 and see it.  People on the 55 freeway had to see it. People at the airport had to see it. People at the bars across the street from the airport had to see it,  Bouncers, people outside smoving cigarettes had to see it.  The bellboys and valet at the hotel had to see it.  If people were nightfishing on the ocean, they had to see it.  I'm guessing hundreds, maybe thousands saw this. Anyhow, me and my friends have never met anyone who has seen it, until... 11 years later, I'm at work.  Some friends of my parents walk in.  They have kids my age that I went to school with since 4th grade till all the way to high school, and have older kids that went to high school around the time  my older brother and sister did.  A little disclosure, we went to St Jeanne de Lestonnac in Tustin, then graduated and went to Mater Dei high. St Jeanne's is a small school, and my parents came to be friends with these 2 parents.  This family are good people, all kids are smart, successful and none were ever trouble makers or had a bad bone in their body.  The family and parents are as straight laced and good people as it gets. I see the parents, and ask them how they are.  We shoot the shit, and he mentions he retired and sold his electrician business.  He says he has contracts out with a few cities in south orange county, and from 12 pm to 8 am, he repairs transformers if they explode. That reminds me of the night, as my dad saying it was a possible transformer explosion. I ask him what the biggest transformer explosion he has seen, and if they can light up the whole horizon (I knew full well what I saw wasn't a transformer bc it appeared out of thin air)  He laughs and says no, and asks why.  Seeing as how they are a straight laced, catholic family, I almost didn't say anything, but I told him the story, and left out some details.  When we were talking, it was 2014 and the ufo sighting happened 11 years before, but I started the story off ""about ten years ago. .."" and I begin my story. I finish, and with a serious look on his face,  He looks at me, and asks me, ""Did it take place in 2003?""  I say yes, it did.  He named the correct year.  Mind blown. ""Did it happen during the month of January?""  He names the correct month.  Then he names the specific time. He tells me ""I saw it too,"" then I hear his story.... It was a night he got a call to repair a transformer.  He went to Aliso Viejo or Niguel or wherever, did his job, and came home.  On his way home he decided to stop by his office and put his tools away because some colleagues of his had their tools stolen from the trucks overnight.  His office is a 3 minute drive from the airport off Redhill and Macarthur. He goes, locks his tools up, and walking back his car (his back is to the airport) sees everything light up.  He sees the shadows of the trees and trucks up on the building with a blue light.  Looks behind him and but it was so bright he was afraid he'd go blind if he did,  so he turned back around.  He pointed out it was silent, which when I heard him say, realized I never thought about the sound. His wife is staring at him with her mouth wide open, wondering why he never told her.  He said it was bc he told some work friends and they laughed at him, and he was scared she'd think he was crazy. AND that's it. I swear on my life, this is what I saw. The crazy thing is as child I saw a UFO on the same newport/ Crawford Canyon intersection.  During El Nino, I saw a metallic orb in the sky.  At first, Not sure what I was looking at, a low flying, fast moving cloud flew in between me and the orb, and  I saw the clouds reflection moving off the orb.  The reflection matched the speed of the cloud as it was moving, and when it passed, I finally got a clear view and grasped what I was looking at. This sighting was in the opposite direction of the other sighting. Those are two out of three of my sightings.  3 sightings in one lifetime, two if which, took place at the same intersection.

I got out of bed to use the bathroom around 11pm-midnight in mid December 2004, and, while looking out the third story bathroom window (looking towards Rt 2, which is about 2 miles away), I noticed a strange (and very large) white plasma like light on the horizon (cigar/eye shape).  Due to its location on the horizon and apparent size, I estimate the object to have been 300-600 feet in length.  It was moving from my left to right very slowly, in a relatively straight line, but in a strange non-linear way (i.e. it appeared to skip/teleport forward).   After watching the object for about 5–10 minutes, it stopped moving and multiple orange/reddish spherical objects (much smaller) were released from the top/center of the larger white object.  I saw a few of these orange/red balls moving through the woods (they appeared to be searching for something or just gathering info), and one flew over my house (pretty close too, probably about 200–300 feet above).  It appeared to be more of a bucky ball shape (more like a boxy sphere), around 10–20 feet in diameter, and metallic, with multiple red/orange lights.  It made no noise at all and appeared to just slowly float by and slowly rotate in random directions.   After about 30 minutes, the smaller orange/red objects made their way back to the much large white plasma object (mother ship?) and re-entered through the top/center.  The large white object then continued moving from left to right (going roughly in the north direction) similar to how it was moving before it stopped, but slightly faster, until it was out of sight.   The sighting lasted for 45 minutes to an hour.   The next morning, the sky was covered in criss-cross streaks (commonly referred to as “Chem-Trails”), more than I had ever seen, even up to the present day (almost 13 years later).

I was thinking about it last night and my date may actually be wrong (it might have been Dec 2005 or even 2006 - I'll confirm with my mom - i know it was the final December before we moved out of my old house after my fathers death).  I'll confirm the date with her and email you back asap.  I came to the site mainly to see if anyone had reported a similar siting (as i find it unlikely that no one else would have seen that!).  The morning after the event the only person I spoke to about it was my mom and she thought I was crazy, on drugs, or possibly dreaming (i was not).   After being dismissed by my mom i kinda just brushed it off and put it on the back burner for a while.  I didn't really hear of these UFO reporting sites till later on, and even once I did, I was kind of embarrassed to talk about it/report it.  I feel like it makes me a crazy ""conspiracy theorist"" to other ""normal"" people and being labeled as a conspiracy theorist in my line of work (Engineering in the Biotech/Pharma industry) is almost like a death sentence to your career (more so ""conspiracy theories"" pertaining to natural health solutions though - such as articles from Mercola.com or alternative news such as Infowars.com, Drudgereport.com, etc). Anyway, thank you for taking me seriously and not making me feel crazy.  I'll email you back as soon as i hear back from my mom to confirm the date and i'd be happy to answer any more questions or help the cause in anyway. Thanks again,  ((END ADDENDUM #2)) ((ADDENDUM #3 FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter,  I just confirmed that it was mid December (around the 14th) of 2005, not 2004.

It was not yet dusk, skies were clear with no cloud cover.  I saw what I thought was an airplane but something didn’t look right. It was either spinning or tumbling as it was moving.  As soon as I saw this I said to my wife, “This doesn’t look good-something is wrong,” thinking it was a plane in trouble and going to crash.  But the object kept on moving in the same trajectory, not losing altitude. That’s when it got weird because as I was watching, two star-like objects appeared around the larger object. While what I saw was in the distance-like an airliner at high cruising altitude- this larger object was as large if not larger in size than a jet plane.  The two smaller objects were like moving or shooting stars only they maintained a consistent altitude, never falling.  They did at times pull closer to the main larger object. The objects came from south of us and travelled north east until they reached a position pretty much in front of us.  It is a guess that the objects were approximately 50 degrees above the plane of the ground.  At that time they appeared to stop in midair, but in hindsight we think they may have changed direction heading east away from us until they disappeared from sight--smaller objects first, then the largest was last to fade away.  This all happened fast and they travelled at a speed similar to that of an airliner. We live within 15 miles of Bradley Airport and watch planes on approach all the time.  But this was different because these objects travelled away from the airport’s location.  What we found odd was that all during the time we watched, there were no other visible aircraft.  Once the objects disappeared, air traffic seemed to resume--at least eight other planes came into view within the next five minutes.

On Monday, July 10, about 11AM ET, my wife and I were driving on I-76 Pennsylvania Turnpike westbound, MM 225 near Newville, PA.  The sky is clear and sunny, visibilty is very good.  I am in the drivers seat.  Our speed, and other traffic, is 80 mph.  Earlier I had seen a sign ""Speed Monitored By Aerial Surveillence,"" so I was watching.   To the southwest, my left, through the front windshield, I saw a helicopter.  It was a white, familiar-looking police helicopter, hovering at an altitude that appeared normal for police traffic helicopters, and less than a 1/4 mile south off the Interstate.  Mountains rise up about 10 miles ahead, and I could see a small white airplane in the distance, banking to my left.  I looked at the helicopter, and noticed a long straight black tubular object (1) (the top surface reflecting the sun) above it, at approximately twice the altitude of the helicopter.  I comment to my wife, ""What do you think that is?""   My first thought was a large solar balloon.  The tubular object appeared to be more than twice as long as the helicopter and about the same diameter as the cabin of the helicopter.  The black tubular object was not a rigid cylinder and would fold to form a V shape, both arms about the same length.  At one point, I saw (2) one of the arms fold again about 1/4 of the length from the end.  By now, I am looking directly out of the drivers side window, due south.   A second white helicopter has appeared, and both helicopters maintain their altitude beneath the object.  The three aircraft do not appear to be moving away, but hovering.  The white airplane that I saw earlier, is now in view, south of the Interstate and at some distance beyond the helicopters and appears flying a circular path around the object, as I can see some top surface of the wings.  Moving past the event, I see the tubular object straighten out briefly and then refold (3) into a V.  It's still south of the Interstate, behind us and then lost to my view.  I was in the passenger's seat.   When my husband called my attention to the object, it was south of us, and I looked out of the driver's side window (I had already noticed one helicopter), I first thought it was a small flock of birds flying closely together.  When I realized it wasn't birds, I paid more attention.  It looked like (4) a translucent object floating without form, sort of like a jellyfish, but it had some kind of black large pieces to it that I took to be the birds originally.  I thought perhaps it was a large clear weather balloon that was descending.  I was not able to see it for very long, being on the opposite side of the car.  It quickly disappeared from my view.",2017-07-14T00:00:00,40.1707,-77.4174

Until I noticed it was impossible for a plane to be visible because of the cloudy weather and the red light didn't flinch like those of a plane would.   Because I'm an amateur astronomer, I grabbed by binoculars as fast as I could.  When I was back at the window with my binoculars the object was already halfway, so in the east direction.  When I looked at the object I still had no idea what it was.  It looked like an egg shaped object with a red light in it.  Because it was very cloudy, I guess the light must have been very bright.  Because no other objects were seen (stars, planes, ...)  The object suddenly vanished and was never seen again.   I discussed this sighting with others, but no one come up ! with an answer to what it could be.  After searching on the web, I found similar pictures of red objects in the sky.  One of the which looked the most to what I've seen was also in Belgium and also around midnight.   Thanks for the help to resolve this mystery, it deeply concerns me.

The object caught my eye on the western skyline, as it slowly gained altitude and began to move towards me.  The object moved silently and slowly from the west towards the full moon in a flight path directly over my campsite.  I estimated the object altitude to be approximately 2000-4000 feet above my head as it passed above me.   A commercial jet entered my field of vision to the northeast of the object, flying west.  The jets were easily heard and the flasing lights were clearly visible on the commercial airplane, even at the much higher altitude.  In contrast the UFO made no noise and the lights were constant. As the object passed above me I saw two large rectangular light panels, one to the front and one behind with a smaller square panel on each side at the center point.   The lights were very bright as it went overhead and the moonlight was also bright, but i could not see any shape or outline, only the cross shaped light panels.  The object moved towards the fu! ll moon and seemed to gain speed as it became smaller and disappeared, last seen moving towards the moon in a shallow ascent.   A few things about this sighting that i really can not explain or understand are: - the object did not move in a conventional manner when the object transitioned from a vertical ascent to an eastern flight path, the path was noticeable angular the movement was very slow at first, then gone - the object made no noise at all - the four light panels were all white in color - the objects lights were constant, none flashed - the only thing visible on the object were the light panels, no outline or shape I am positive that I witnessed technology from another world.

This location is almost exactly one mile from the eastern end of the north runway at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, runway 26.  The event was taking place on the roof of the three story facility.  There is a shade structure running along the north and west portions of the roof.  A 20'x20' canopy had been erected to provide shade for the guests.  My position was near the northeast corner of the roof where I had a small audio mixing board set up.  At that time aircraft were departing Sky Harbor to the east, from the north runway, passing less than a half-mile from my position. 	The event had begun at 8am with the Phoenix Mayor discussing details of the project.  At 8:20am, I noticed an object come into my field of view from the north, just above the Mayor's position at the podium, at a bearing of about 310 degrees.  It was elongated in the horizontal direction, reflective or very light in color.  I could not judge distance, but felt that it might be about a mile away, based on having witnessed countless aircraft approaching Sky Harbor.  I appeared to be similar in size to a small FedEx single engine turboprop aircraft which utilize Sky Harbor.  Its altitude was lower than that of an aircraft crossing over, so I immediately assumed it was making an approach, but it should have been much further west if that were the case.  I could not detect any vertical structure such as a tail, the reflective brilliance made it difficult to make out details. 	It continued south for a short distance then suddenly either came to a complete stop or made an immediate “jog” toward the west.  At this point the idea of “drone” popped into my mind, but the apparent distance to the object made it questionable if a drone would be that visible.  The other reason to reject the drone theory was the proximity to Sky Harbor.  The object then continued making a fairly rapid arc toward the southeast, again with an immediate acceleration which seemed very “drone like.”  I lost sight of it behind the canopy until it emerged southwest of my position.  It appeared to be following the departure path of  runway 25, the center runway, toward the east, but more rapidly than a traditional aircraft. I continued to observe it for another 10 seconds until it moved behind a large structure on the roof.  I moved to the other side of the structure but I did not see the object again. 	I could not detect any noise from the object, at least nothing which I could hear above the traffic on Washington Street and the PA system I was operating.  The movement was unlike normal aircraft in the sudden acceleration and deceleration.  The object's altitude seemed constant. 	Based on the flight path I observed I would dismiss any thought of it being an actual drone.  My immediate reaction was thinking “how bold” to venture into the departure path of Sky Harbor in broad daylight.  I have almost 40 years of working in close proximity to Sky Harbor Airport and am very familiar with aircraft and aircraft operations.  This object did not operate by normal flight standards.",2017-06-22T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

I went to take a rest from the flea market, and was shaded by a large bush.  I laid flat on the grass and had amber driving glasses on, in addition to my myopia lenses.  I was looking straight up to the zenith, watching airplanes from LGA airport, etc..  The sun was almost but not quite overhead, and shaded by a leafy branch, so I was able to gaze into the blue without the sun against me.  The clouds were minimal and there was a slight haze and I had a little coffee to drink and was relaxing.   Slowly, but suddenly, like a ghost appearing, there was a distant craft proceeding westward and slightly northward at an angle, slowly creeping.  It had a distinct boxy appearance almost like it had ""solar panels"" on both sides, and there was a faint blinking sidelight hard to make out because of the bright conditions.  It was at the limits of my visual acuity to make out any detail, but it was optical in nature as I was able to play with the image using my fingers in a triangle pinhole lens and saw it refract.   Soon after this, to my right (north), a group of approximately 5 (or more) of the same ""craft"" appeared in a rough and slowly jiggling polygon along with an extra slightly off to one side (""apple"").  This cluster slowly appeared out of nothing, and they too had faint blinking lights.  There was no entry direction, and were ghostly in appearing.  It stayed like this for about 2 minutes and then as if on cue, all of them slowly faded back into nothingness without any abrupt motions.  The lone craft from the beginning was proceeding in its same linear direction and still visible, and then that, too, slowly disappeared in a ghostly fashion.   At the end of this, I checked the sky without the amber lenses and saw that the area where there was the cluster of the craft was blue without clouds and only some haze as it was a hot day.   The lone craft was in an area of very thin cloud.  They did not act like drones and there were too many of them, and they just appeared and disappeared.  They did not get bigger or smaller; there was no noise and they all looked the same.   I had thoughts of some kind of refraction from a remote area, but the behavior and the coincidences of this happening don't seem to fit as being manmade, which is why I make this report to you.",2017-06-22T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

New moon so no moon that night, perfectly clear and windless, about 55-60º with a little moisture in the air from rains earlier that morning and the days before. A triangular shaped object that was cut in half a gap about 1/8 the total width of the object;straight down the middle making it appear as 2 separate objects to form one.  It materialized as a dimly illuminated condensation cloud/fog that disappeared just as quick as it came. My girlfriend and I were stargazing in the backyard of her stepdads house in the country, about 6 miles northwest of Topeka.  The only visible light was from the windows of the house.  We both were staring directly over our heads as the object seemed to go thru the moist air at a unmeasurable velocity of speed.  It was traveling due west and appeared for 1-2 secs.  It was as if it were cloaked and the vapor it caused were the only means of visibility. The only reference to size is my index and thumb about a inch, inch and a half apart with my arm fully extended in front of my field of view looking straight in the sky. Which the only visible portion of the objects travel path being about directly above us to over a tree that stands maybe 25 ft high to the west of us on the south side of the fence which on the other side is hundreds of acres of farming fields. From 1st sight directly above us; to disapperance; it covered this vast part of sky above us almost to the horizon in a matter of seconds, 2 max.  We were sitting inside the fenced in backyard of chain about belly button high.  We sat in a backwards leaning lawn chair with my girlfriend sitting directly on my lap with the back of her head on my shoulder so we both had the same field of view.  We had a blanket 3ft behind us on a clothes line which we used as a block of the ambient light of the house windows. The light it illuminated was almost rainbow spectrum In There Was No Solid Color To Associate With It.  I saw it flash above which is what drew my eyes, it being dark out i thought maybe my eyes were tricking me, so I asked my girlfriend if she ""just saw that,"" and at the same time as if she was gonna say the samething and finished by answering the question, she said she wasn’t going to say anything cause she thought her eyes were messing with her also, and ""umm...yeah i ((word deleted)) saw that!""  Even if we had the equipment to record the sky that night we would’ve needed about 6 cameras in night vision coving as much of the sky as possible and it would have been a one in a million chance of actually capturing it. I've been interested in RESEARCHING the unknown as pertains to ufo and ebe’s, to secret dark government/military space programs.  With all the channels I subscribe to and talk shows I listen to it was just a matter of time before my girlfriend would become interested in the subject herself but it was not until a few days ago that the 1st ufo sighting I’ve experienced and hers as well which brought all the things she hears me listening to and watching become something brought to fruition, a experience, something that was just a subject until we had a 1st hand witnessing  of something almost indescribable due to it or anything similar in nature have never been reported by anyone worldwide (to our knowledge) which created way more questions than the simple satisfaction of just observing an anomaly. That experience has turned my ole lady who is a former collegiate gymnast that gives private lessons to people who would let something like this make them think I'm ""one of them people"" and id have no clients for income.  From that standpoint  To now another believer via 1st hand experience.  In the years of interest in the subject and years of listening to coast to coast I have never heard anything close to describing the sighting that we had.  With the Uniqueness of the appearance of the object materializing/causing a disturbance in the air which gave shape, speed and size. Im a graphic artist and am currently opening my own costom silk screen printing  and tattoo shop.  I've been in the tshirt business for about 2 1/2 years running a store in downtown topeka. sometimes solo and still pushing out 300 shirts worth of orders.  On breaks id watch videos and as a graphic artist was highly disappointed in all the cgi and disinformation  out there that i didnt know what to/not to look for. Hence this being my 1st in 35 years of life. The reason I'm reporting this is due to its unique nature and the curiosity it spewed out of me. Wondering if anyone anywhere at anytime has experienced anything similar at all. That night we also observed a few other unexplainable events that we have never experienced. One being a unknown light due south of us close to the kansas river, about 1-2 miles away and what appeared 200-300ft above the ground, as we were looking upward, in the lower peripheral of our vision the light just appeared out of nowhere ad grew in intensity to the point of illuminating part o the sky, as the flash happened we looked for the light which had vanished as quickly as it appeared. Another light like that also appeared on the western horizon about a hour after the river one. We also witnessed what appeared as “stars” moving a high rate of speed. 2 of them going directly north to a south southwest direction. The third one seemed to come from the southwest and curved back towards the north west with another light directly behind it about 10-15 seconds. All of these id probably hafta say were satellites in orbit and maybe the iss. We witnessed what seemed to be a couple military aircraft that were flying directly across from each other maybe 10miles wing tip to wing tip at the same altitude and velocity with nothing but a red light to identify both of them as they came out of the western horizon and disappearing into the eastern horizon. Around 12:15 we witnessed a “aircraft” with A Single Bright Yellowish Light That Didn’t Flash, traveled north to south but the thing that caught our attention was the erratic movements. It seemed to glitch, the best ways to describe it. It’d seem to stand still for a couple seconds then dash forward, move left and right in very jerky, not smooth at all movement.  The best I can describe it is visual glitching causing it to skip fwd in space to make up for the time that it was in a static position.  Only explanation I have for that one is maybe the air temps and atmospheric variables that makes stars twinkle and seem to oscillate light intensities.",2017-06-02T00:00:00,39.1617,-95.8068

On May 21, I [a State HVAC contractor] was visiting a friend who owns an International Security firm.  We were at his home, just outside Jonesborough Tenn., when sometime in the afternoon as we were chatting, there was a popping sound above us.  Looking up we saw a small white light.  I say 'we', but he saw it first.  It was so small, it took me a few seconds to locate it. It didn't appear to be moving, so I grabbed my small 10x25 binoculars and focused in on it.  There was a shiney ball-shaped object that seemed to pulsate light, and under the light was a cigar shaped object that was pointing down, approxamately 30^ angle to the left.  There would be a pulse of light and the CS object was then pointing 30^ to the right.  These pulses occured approx. 3 seconds apart, with the object moving from one angle to the other, with each pulse. The distance of the CS object from the glowing mass was about 1/4 the length of the CS object.  The CS object itself was about 4-5 times the length of the lights diameter.  Other than its rounded ends, the body shape was constant.. like a cigar. It was difficult to guage how high it was, and it didn't appear to be decending.  It moved slowly to the west, as if it were drifting.. always at the same hight.  The entire experiance lasted 5-10 minutes. After giving it thought, it could have been something that was dropped from a higher vessle and when reaching a certain altitude, metalic parashoots opened.. which would acount for the 'popping' sound. The shifting degree's of the cigar could have been a 'swinging' motion, IF it was hanging.  Sunlight bouncing off metalic shoots could give the appearance of pulsating, stabalizing rockets, even though I've never seen or heard of 'metallic' para-shoots. Whatever it was.. it was pretty cool to watch!  Was there anyone else in the area that reported this?",2017-06-02T00:00:00,36.3022,-82.4825

I, Melinda Leslie, was leading my Sunday night, May 21st, Sky Watch with Night Vision Goggle Intensive out at Giant Rock on the 3rd night of viewing events for CITD.  Luckily one of my participants, Graham Slater, caught this and many of our other sightings (from all 3 nights no less), with his black and white night vision video camera.  His additional footage of some of the other incredible sightings will be posted at a future date once they are compiled. Here's a description of the jet chase sighting:  At just before 10:00 p.m. (did not note exact time) some of my participants and I saw a large amber colored light low to the horizon just behind Giant Rock from where my whole group of about 50 plus people were gathered and using 15 pair of night vision goggles.  A contigenecy of about 20 of us ran to get a better view of it.  To the naked eye it appeared to be a large orangish (amber) light, that quoting some of the 20 people; ""flew like a bumble bee.""  One guest, [name removed/CMS/jpg], came running with a pair of the goggles in hand and got a good look at it.  She said that through the goggles it looked like ""a large diamond shaped UFO.""  She drew a picture of it attached here.  This object then flew behind a small hill right behind the entire Sky Watch larger group.  As those of us who ran off walked back to join the others, 3 military jets flew over in the direction of the object now gone from sight behind the hill.  Some of us commented that ""if"" ""they"" were following it, meaning the jets, they were a few minutes too late. Just then, we heard the sound of a low flying jet from behind the hill, and suddenly clearing the top of the hill and right over our heads, came a very fast military jet chasing a faster large red glowing light.  The military jet had both red and white blinking strobe lights and glowing afterburners and was VERY loud as it flew directly above our heads.  The large red light had NO blinking lights and NO sound at all!  It became clear to all 50 plus witnesses, this was NO jet!!!  Those folks present who looked with the aid of the goggles said they were seeing either 2 lights, or one object with 2 light sources on it.  After extensive review of the footage, I am nearly certain it shows 2 UFOs (fast moving lights), flying in perfect locked tandem with one another.  It appears you can see stars between them in the background suggesting that these are 2 separate objects. As is usually the case, this footage while incredible, does not do the sighting justice.  The video is in black and white night vision, not full-color naked-eye vision, and does not have any sound, so you are unable to hear the palatable excitement of 50 plus witnesses screaming and cheering.

I continued to scan the sky and saw what appeared to be two stars in an area of the sky east of Ursa Major which were unfamiliar to me.  As I watched, I noticed their position in the sky was changing in relation to other stars.  A check of my watch indicated the time as 0307 hours. The lights that initially thought to be stars were moving approximately due north in a column formation.  As the two lights continued to travel northward, the trailing light began to maneuver north-northeast and came into a right echelon position in respect to the first light.  I continued to watch the lights travel north until I lost visual due to the cities’ light pollution. The lights were white in color, similar to starlight.

I left my house on my motorcycle at right about 23:00 heading to my girlfriend's house.  About halfway there, as I was driving along the south side of Pioneer Park on Whitman St., I looked up and saw a chevron shaped craft flying about fifty feet above the tops of the tallest trees in the park. The craft appeared to be about a football field in length with three visible lights on the bottom.  One light was on the underside of the leading tip of the craft and the other lights were on the underside tail of each ""wing"" forming a triangle pattern.  The ship was dark grey in color and although it was well after nightfall I was close enough to observe the entire vessel. I put the engine in neutral and hit the kill switch for the motor with my thumb.  I figured a craft that size must make noise but I was even more surprised when it wasn't making a sound. It was cruising from the Southwest corner to the Northeast at an impossibly slow speed of maybe 20 or 30 mph. A few seconds later I could no longer see the ship because the trees were blocking my line of site, so I dropped my bike into gear and popped the clutch,since I was still in motion, and hurried to my girlfriends house.  The entire sighting only lasted around 15 seconds. I searched the internet and local newspaper for any other mention or reported sightings but found none.  Months later I came across a video documenting the ""Lights Over Phoenix"" sighting from 1997.  A number of witnesses describe a very similar type of craft.

The craft was a flat metallic grey sphere about thiry-five to forty feet in diameter.  It appeared to be unpolished titanium, had no windows, no lights, and was completely silent.  It traveled at a constant speed, about the speed of a fast moving Bell Jet Ranger, which we see a lot of here, so approximately 140-150mph,  When I first saw it I thought it was a helicopter but I couldn't see any blades.  I pointed it out to my other half, and we looked at it as it came right towards us.  It was flying at no more than 1500ft, and at a constant speed, passing by in total silence at around 150mph.  At its closest it was no more than 1/8-1/4 mile from us.  It was a perfect blue sky LA afternoon with low afternoon autumn sun perfectly illuminating it, so it was absolutely clear what it was. We live on the Santa Monica Mountains with a very open 180º panoramic view out over the entire LA Basin, and this craft quite literally flew along Sunset Boulevard.

The craft was flying in a southerly direction from directly over the waterside area of downtown Norfolk, proceeding towards and over the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.   It was a beautiful night and the skies were very clear, as we could see many of the star constellation.  We were enjoying the night talking about the two CH-60 helicopters that had flown overhead thirty minutes prior, when we spotted six faint orange or yellowish colored lights in the sky, judging only from its lights; as we could not see any structural definition, we believe based on the formation of lights that it was chevron shaped.   As the craft flew directly overhead of us, the faint lights were ! no longer visible and the craft was completely transparent, and did not have any discernible aircraft marking lights; which was very strange considering the fact it was flying through an extremely busy corridor.  We noticed a few other planes flying over in their normal landing procedure, strobes on as well as landing lights lit up, as we commonly see in the skies near Norfolk International airport.  I am retired military, and my training as a stinger missile gunner required me to be able to identify all aircraft by their silhouette at any angle,  This was not any known aircraft I had ever seen, perhaps the most striking aspect of the incident was the complete silence surrounding it.   In viewing several commercial airliners after the incident occurred making their normal approaches at lower altitudes and taking note of the size they appeared based on our perspective, we estimate the size craft to be about 3-4 times larger than a normal commercial jet-liner.   The entire scene lasted about 30 seconds.

Also, in March, two of the lights seen at once. The object, seen through my window while I lay in bed early in the morning, initially appeared to be a bright star or possibly a planet.  It was blinking white, red, blue, and green in color.  Suddenly it began to move as if it were almost vibrating, but then the movements became more obvious–it moved up and down, side to side, and would zig-zag through the sky before it would stop and stay still like a star again. If I watched long enough, it would begin to move again, in the same manner. It was so captivating and interesting that I had somehow unwaveringly watched it for four straight hours before I had to pull myself away to get some sleep. The following week, I woke up around the same time and saw the same thing.  A single star-like object in the sky, blinking white and different colors, and moving in strange patterns for brief periods of time.  I continued to watch this object in the sky in the early morning every few weeks, always in a similar place in the sky.  Sometimes, when I would first notice it, I would doubt my earlier sightings (blaming it on my eyes or thinking perhaps I had imagined it), yet if I watched long enough, the object would begin to move and blink as it had before. On Thursday, March 29, 2017, I woke around 2:00 to see TWO star-like lights parallel to each other in the sky.  The first was in the same area in the sky as usual and the second was a little to the left. Initially, I thought maybe the second light was just a star, but suddenly both of the lights began moving exactly the same way.  This led me to believe that the lights could be on opposite ends of a large craft, but later the lights began to move differently than each other.  Sometimes they would move in opposite directions, but sometimes they would rush close together before vibrating away and then pausing in the sky.  This sighting was perhaps more spectacular than the other mornings, since I had never seen more than one at a time!  As I am writing this, I notice that the two dates I know for SURE I saw these crafts (I have a journal entry from the first sighting in December and for last week's sighting, so I know what days those sightings were on, but I didn't write anything for the other sightings) are both on the 29th of the month.  This could be a coincidence, but I wonder if the other times I sighted the craft that I didn't document the date for could possibly be on the 29th of the month as well.  If so, perhaps this coincides with some planetary cycle that could explain the light, rather than something extra-terrestrial.  I will continue to watch for the lights.  If I see any between now and April 29th, I will make another report. As for my background, I'm only a high schooler.  I don't have any qualifications that would lead me to be more trustworthy, but I am telling the truth of my experiences.  I would love to know if there is any information on similar sightings!  Also, an idea occurred to me the day after my sighting of two lights at once.  I set my camera's f-stop and ISO so that if I were to take a picture of a moving light at night, the photo would show the path of that light's motion.  I have arranged my camera on a tripod near the window I see the lights out of, and I hope to capture the lights next time I see them.   If I am successful, I will submit a new report with my findings.",2017-04-07T00:00:00,37.6485,-76.3891

This sighting was very much a spontaneous encounter on my part, and ended almost as quickly as it began.  I was in my car, parked outside a strip mall next to a park, with a Taekwondo studio and Scuba Diving store in front of me.  I had just dropped off a family member, and was reading a book for college while waiting in the vehicle for my family member to return in about an hour.  A friend called me on my cell phone; I became distracted from reading, and so we talked for about five minutes before the beginning of the UFO encounter.   I was casually looking outside at my surroundings without much attentiveness, when I spotted this apparent craft.  I did not actually think it was an aircraft at all, at first.  I was looking up at the dark/grayish clouds in front of me, and I glanced in the craft’s direction, thinking I had just seen a small dark break the clouds in my peripheral vision - as if I could see through to a darker cloud layer.  I was not at all alarmed, nor did I suspect it was a flying object.  I continued talking, and when I turned my attention to the area again maybe about 10 seconds later, I looked more closely, and noticed this was not a break in the clouds.  Something was definitely there, well below the cloud layer. I knew very quickly it wasn’t a bird or plane, because it was hovering completely motionless in the air.  My immediate assumption was that this was a helicopter, which is perfectly reasonable, as I see them fly by from time to time, even at this particular parking lot.   I like to check out aircraft whenever I seen them, so I asked my friend to wait a moment while I sat up closer to my dashboard to focus in on the supposed helicopter.  I saw it was smaller than a helicopter; it had no tail, no propeller blades or moving parts, and made no audible sound.  It was unusually difficult to make out its shape.  This may have been because of its size and the dark backdrop.   But I stared at it for maybe about 20 seconds as it hovered there in the sky, absolutely motionless, expecting it to move.  I was so surprised at how still it was, I even moved my head left to right, just to be sure I wasn’t somehow staring at a speck of dust on my windshield.  I am pretty sure it had corners; it was not an oval or sphere exactly, but it seemed like it was maybe rounded slightly.   I can’t say for absolute certain, like I said earlier, the shape was hard to make out - but if I had to guess, it was perhaps a cube or triangle with rounded edges.  Very dark – basically black in color, and may have had a small gray or white marking on it, but I cannot say for certain as it could have been a reflection of the sky, if it was metallic.  But from my angle at least, I would describe it as fairly dull; a matte black. In terms of size, I would say it was one to two meters across, and one-half to one meter in height.   I was still on the phone, and began describing the object to my friend, who was listening closely, and became a little concerned for me.  I did not feel threatened by it, but was very curious nonetheless.  I sometimes keep a pair of binoculars in my glove compartment, and so I began quickly rummaging through papers, napkins, and tools I keep in there, while still keeping an eye on the object, only occasionally glancing into the glove compartment fo r a second or two.   I had two plausible explanations in my mind; it was either a big balloon of some kind, or a drone, but I wanted to find out for certain.   At the exact moment I thought that, it started to move slightly to the left, and then a second later bolted off at high speed, traveling backwards, away from me. It did not tilt, turn, or otherwise look like it had control surfaces or a propulsion system.  I became upset it was leaving, and I could not find my binoculars.  Still talking to my friend, I figured I took them out of the compartment a few months ago to bring on a boat trip, and forgot to return them.  The craft left the location pretty fast; in about 15 seconds, it was a tiny little dot, and disappeared somewhere behind buildings or trees.   I found it very unlikely to be a balloon because if it was, it probably would have been smaller and round, likely would have had a string or something attached to it, and would have been ascending at a constant rate, not to mention being bobbed and brushed by the wind - not sitting perfectly still in the air, before suddenly bursting off at a very high speed in basically one direction.   It is hard to guess how high and far it was from my location with only a limited number of items for a point of reference, but I would say no more than a quarter mile from where I was parked.  It was relatively low; my best guess, I would say between 6! 00 and 800 feet above the ground.   When it moved, it began gently, and increased speed very quickly.  I would approximate maybe 250 to 300 mph the last I saw it.  Also note, there was a young man, maybe about 25, sitting in his car parked next to me, but he was facing the opposite direction and was staring at his phone, so I did not bother to ask if he had also seen the craft after it had left.   As far as I could tell, we were the only two people in the parking lot capable of viewing the craft.   Once the surprise and adrenaline rush had worn down, I resumed my conversation with my friend, speculating what it could have been. I regretted not taking a picture with my phone, but on the other hand, it probably would have been too small to turn up as anything more than a few pixels on the image anyway.  I decided to take a picture at least of the sky conditions where the craft was, about five minutes after it left, to give some perspective as to how I saw it. The only plausible and conventional explanation I have was that it was a large, black, very fast moving drone, with long range wireless capabilities.  This is a suburban area, so it was hovering and passing over small buildings, houses, and some forested areas.  I have walked near the place where the craft was in the past, and I know there are some small fields and depressions in the ground, as well as a high school it most definitely would have passed over or near.  I do not know how long it was hovering there prior, but I know it sat still for at least the minute or two that I saw it from when I first glanced it in the sky.  For a craft that size and altitude, it should have had some light beacon to indicate its presence to other aircraft, and I would have expected it to be flatter with four or more distinguishable copter propellers if it was a drone.  This craft did not possess any of those features as far as I could tell, but I would be willing to accept a drone as a conventional answer.  I readily acknowledge that it is just an unidentified flying object.  I am not necessarily trying so suggest this was some event so extraordinary that it exceeds all conventional reasoning, nor that it is of extraterrestrial or otherwise supernatural origin.  It was certainly very odd though, and this is not the first instance in the time I have lived here that I have seen unusual or inexplicable aircraft. There was one other event that occurred on my thirteenth birthday when I was walking home from a store.  I was on the top of a hill nearing my neighborhood next to a forested area with only a couple sleepy houses to my right side, when I spotted a silvery metal craft, oval in shape flying over the forest, completely silent, and traveling at similar heights and speeds to this one. Unlike the case I am presenting here, I do have a picture of the actual craft itself (albeit a poor resolution one) taken from my phone, and posted on Facebook. In the original image, the craft was too small to see without zooming in, but it was nevertheless in the image.  I searched old data folders and even tried to revive the (now dead) phone I took the photo with to see if I could retrieve the original file, but unfortunately could not bring it back. In the Facebook photo of this somewhat similar craft, I enlarged the image of the craft and drew a red line indicating where it was in the image so t! hat people could view it more easily, but other than that, there was no editing or tampering concerning the image of the craft itself. Both that one and this one traveled in about the same direction, heading north-northwest. This was before drones (especially of that size) were commercially available as they are today. I have not made any case files on this previous sighting, and this is the first time I have reported a UFO, because I felt compelled enough to say this really was unusual enough to constitute a true UFO. After showing the first encounter to friends online, they did not believe me, thinking I had pocket lint on my camera, even though I assured them something was in the air. I dropped the topic, and rarely spoke of it again, but with this new sighting, it has made me think back on that experience. I am not suggesting there is any direct connection or correlation, but these events are similar in some ways, and this new encounter marks the second time I have seen! an unusual or unconventional aircraft in this area, seven yea! rs apart , in the same stretch of about 5 miles.

We see many planes (commercial flights, small planes, helicopters) day and night because it is a much used flight path and our view is perfect.  Most planes make a turn towards T.F.

This incident occurred in Chula Vista, CA, between 5:00pm and 5:36 pm.  My Daughter and I are in town to assist my Mom after a surgery last week.  My Mom’s Neighbor invited my Daughter and me to take advantage of their swimming pool while she and her Family went out of town to go camping.  So we decided to do just that.  In her yard she has a lounge and as my Daughter and Niece were enjoying the pool I decided to lay on the lounge to relax.  As I was laying in the lounge I noticed a plane flying really high in the sky.  My Mom regularly has planes fly fairly low while waiting to land at Lindbergh Field.  This plane was definitely cruising much faster and much higher than other planes. This was when I noticed a faint white star in the North Eastern sky as I was lying facing North. It was clearly above the plane that flew by.  The star was faint enough to lose the image of the star in the ocean of blue sky in So. Cal if I looked away.  I used a palm tree to pinpoint the faint white star and kept staring at the star because it seemed to elongate then turn into a pinpoint, but I figured it was because I was literally staring at this star in the sky and my eyes were playing tricks on me. I decided to open up my star app on my phone, my Daughter and I love to use it up where we live in Auburn, CA.  The star app showed the tail end of ursa major or ursa minor I don’t quite remember which constellation.  In addition I am not sure if the app was calibrated properly.  Another plane flew by, again high in the sky, but not in the path of the star, which I thought was strange because I first saw the star because of the flight path of the first plane.  Then I considered the current plane is probably flying from a different airport to a different location hence the different location of the star in the sky. I continued to stare at this star when all of a sudden a red round light appeared right next to the star. Appeared is not the correct explanation it faded into view.  This red light pulsed and faded into itself.  The size of the round red light was smaller than the size of a round sewing pin when it was wide open and it disappeared when the pulse collapsed in on itself. I sat and stared at this pulsing light that was way above the next plane that flew by.  It circled around the white star all the while pulsing. At that time I thought I was seeing things.  No way could a red pulsing light be so high up in the sky circling around what I thought was a star.  So I called my 11 year old over and asked her to lay with me.  We use specific words to pinpoint stars in the night sky regularly so I directed her to the faint star in the sky.  She said, “Oh my god Mom!  I’ve never seen a star in the daytime before.  Is that a planet?”  Then she said in a concerned tone.  “Mom, what is that?”  I asked her to describe what she saw.  She said, “What is that pulsing light? Mom? What is that light circling the star?”  She had a little fear in her voice.  I said to her I was not sure what we both were seeing and that I’m glad she saw it too.  We both laid there and watched this pulsing light slowly move around the star one last time and then it moved east.  A tiny little pulsing red light expanding and collapsing in upon itself about 12” to 16” in the sky and then poof.  It was gone. I continued to watch that star for an additional couple of minutes and then I realized.  The faint star had moved North East in the sky about 6” toward the palm tree.  After thinking about this incident for the last couple of days I realized that stars move from East to West in the sky and that star moved East so slowly that I didn’t realize it until after I stopped looking at the star and took one last glance up.  What I saw was not natural.  It was not a meteor. It was not a plane. I have no idea what we saw.",2017-06-22T00:00:00,32.62885271493213,-117.02118393665158

It seemed to speed up and soon was beyond the trees on our horizon to the north.   The entire siting lasted approximately 10 minutes.

I noticed a bright red light out of the corner of my right eye hovering over another apartment building.  Not right over the complex, but a couple of miles East of our location.   I turned my head to look in that direction, as I turned my head the red light went away and became a small white blinking light.  It hovered in the same spot for a bit before moving. When moving, the light pulsed out and it reappeared in another spot.  Each time it moved, it moved West towards our apartment complex.   There was a pillar blocking my mother's view, so she didn't notice it until it was almost directly over the complex.  I hadn't said anything to her at this point thinkng it would disappear and I wouldn't be believed.  As it stopped and hovered over the complex, my mother and I stared at it without words, she was still unaware I had been watching it way before she noticed it.   Then it started to pulse green and as it did, its light grew bigger and brighter, along with some sporadic movements around the area in which it had been hovering.  Finally it moved in the same manner, seemingly jumping from spot to spot between light pulses towards the North and out of view.  Multiple times before its seemingly laws-of-physics-defying movements to the North. my mother vocalized her thought that it must be a helicopter before its light turned green.

Shortly after sundown, around 9:00 p.m., we arrived on the east side of the city lagoon, over which the pyrotechnical show would take place.  As it began at 9:30 under a clear sky of unlimited visibility---save somewhat less so in the west, where thin clouds had gathered --- with a waxing-gibbous moon rising behind us, three objects appeared, one behind the other, around one thousand-foot altitude or less. 		 I estimate each of the nearly identical craft was thirty to thirty-five feet in diameter.  From underneath them, golden flames projected downward in a rough, splayed pattern.  Reflecting in these flames was the reddish-orange underside of the objects.  They seemed disc-shaped to me, but my wife wondered if they may have been more spherical, as only the structures’ ventral area might have been illuminated by the fiery discharge streaming from the craft’s bottom section.  The three objects were regularly spaced from one another by approximately one hundred twenty feet or one hundred fifty feet, in a line formation that took them from the east, directly above the fireworks display, over which their initially rapid advance slowed to little more than a crawl, before they picked up a bit more speed, while executing a broad, climbing curve toward the west, one craft after another, gradually disappearing into the thin cloud cover.  Their construction appeared utterly unaerodynamic, and they seemed to less actually fly, than to be moved, not propelled, across the sky in the manner a stone picked up and transported from one place to another.  That, in any case, was the impression their flight made. During long pauses in the exploding fireworks, we strained our ears, but failed to perceive any sound from the flying objects passing practically overhead.  Perhaps five minutes after they became hardly more than faint sparks in the western sky, another group of almost identical craft --- also, perhaps, in threes--approached on precisely the exact, same heading executed in the night sky by their predecessors.  Like them, the newcomers arrived speedily, but quickly decelerated, cruising directly above the fireworks, then somewhat increased their velocity to follow the first set of craft identically into the west, no less precisely than if they were riding on a railroad track. 							 Other groups of the same kind of vehicles followed in circa five-minute intervals; all behaved in identical fashion, abiding unswervingly to the same, broadly curving course from east to west.  Their only apparent differentiations included color and its intensity.  One or two of the objects were entirely bright white, while most were reddish-orange, some more pronounced than others.  On three or four of them, I discerned darker, indistinct details lining the illuminated “disc”.  At first sight, I assumed for a moment that the objects must have been hot-air balloons, flying lanterns or aerostats of some kind, because they did partially resemble them at a distance.  But as they approached nearer, their varying speeds, unvarying course, and downward extending flames immediately identified them as something else.  The penultimate object was especially distinct and brightly lit in its discoidal or spherical configuration.   Altogether, we counted fifteen such craft.  The last one sailed directly above the fireworks’ big finale, over the center of the exploding display.  Total duration of all Wabasha sightings on the evening of July 4, 2017, coincided with the city’s Independence Day pyrotechnical program from the moment it began until its final shot, as though the disc pilots somehow knew the program in advance, allowing their own, perfect timing.  Their behavior made us both feel that they were solely interested in observing the fireworks.",2017-07-07T00:00:00,44.3438,-92.0607

This happened behind the ""Orchard Hill"" Dorms at UMAss, Amherst across East Pleasant Street.  I was a sophomore.  There were 5 of us, all students and friends at UMass, and we climbed the one story structure that we called the Coal Tower overlooking the train tracks.   Not sure what it was, maybe a mail snatching platform but there was room for us and it was a fun place to hang out.   It was a clear cool night.  We were gazing into the sky watching stars when all of a sudden there were lights in the sky moving somewhat together, maybe 7-12 of them.  They were possibly saucer shaped, completely silent, and  they were coordinated in their formations    When one of us found it hard to believe what we were seeing and expressed that, all of them turned off their lights.  We waited a  minute or so and they re-appeared, completely silent, and soon had made a formation, a vertical line which was now standing still.  At this point, one person shouted, ""This can't be happening!""  And again, the lights disappeared.   Another minute passed and they were back on, this time a little closer to such a degree that I could see a slight spinning motion, they looked more like rotating saucers but understand they were still quite small.  A bit larger though and I could definitely now perceive the spinning and even slightly colored lights, spinning it seemed, in the one I was focused on.   It was at the point where I just had to decide what I would do if they landed; it was that real. It was existential, this was happening (I instantly decided I would not be interested in leaving at all and that I'd run)  However, I did not feel fear.  I think once more someone shrieked, 'This can't be happening!!"" and again the lights turned off.   I don't remember exactly how or why but we were ready to leave, we'd been experiencing this for what seemed like 20 minutes.  So, we climbed down the stairs and walked up to E. Pleasant St about 100 yards away and started the 1/2 mile walk into town to get something to eat. A couple of minutes later from behind us swooped a very large cigar-shaped 'craft' that, although quiet, with no engine sounds, caused a noticeable whoosh overhead, just above the trees,  and then was almost instantly gone.  I just caught enough of a look to comprehend that it was big, maybe the size of a jet's body without wings. I've been telling my kids and my grandkids this story for years, and  I wanted to corroborate it and have tried to locate these long ago friends.  Recently, I got in touch with my freshman room mate, a still photographer of high respect in the movie business, and his memory about it was fuzzy, but he told the story to his wife with whom he lived back then (and still does), and she said ""Of course!  You told me all about when you got home that night!."" ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",,42.3872,-72.460375

We had circled the Marian Field in his truck and I was spot lighting the trees up and down, trying to catch the shining eyes of a critter.   E suddenly told me to turn the light off.  In front of us, the woods were lit up at ground level.  We were discussing that maybe it was his cousins, R and M coming in the jeep to hunt with us.  While we were watching, it rose to treetop level and looked exactly like the moon – only huge.   E cursed and quickly turned the truck around and sped back around toward the gate.  I urged him to stop because the object was no longer in sight.  He stopped the truck, and while we sat there for a minute, it reappeared like a falling star.  But, instead of just streaking and disappearing, it came straight at us, becoming the huge moon again.   It was so scary, I begin to raise my gun up, and Eddy pushed it back down and shouted, “Don’t shoot it”.  Then he tried to back up real fast, but let the clutch out too fast and the truck died.  He cursed more, restarted it and took off backwards.   I told him to stop because the river was right behind us and there was nowhere to go.  He stopped and we sat there for maybe a minute looking at it, it was huge.  If anyone saw it at this point, they would have said, “Man, look how big and bright the moon is”.  That is exactly what it looked like, nothing else.  It looked very close, but we could not tell how far it was, maybe a million miles.   He then took off toward the gate, and as we went through towards the woods, I looked back through the back window at it - we had passed under it, so it couldn’t have been very high up.  We went straight back to his grandmother’s house, woke her up and told her what we had seen.  She listened, and then said, “It’s a sign Eddy Boy, it’s a sign.”  From then on, anything that happened, we repeated that like a joke.   I went back about a week later with another friend C M, and we saw a bunch of falling stars, but nothing else.  E and I both saw the same thing, but he said it was going back and forth toward us when it reappeared, but, to me it was exactly like a falling star  – that is the only difference in what we witnessed.  It was very clear- there were no clouds and visibility was fine.   We were both 18 years old, completely sober and in full control of all our faculties.  It looked exactly like the moon, nothing else, but it was certainly ‘not’ the moon.   Both of us still think about it and discuss it.  I have given it a lot of thought, since then, and think that, just like a David Copperfield optical illusion, anyone at anytime could look up and witness the same thing and not even know it.  They would only think how big and bright the moon is….. until it moved as fast as a falling star, right at them, scaring the living crap out of them.

The night of New Years Eve 12/31/79, at about 9 PM, I was walking in a suburb of Pittsburgh to a party.  I tend to look up at the sky a lot when I walk.  The sky in Pittsburgh during that era, and possibly today, has a lot of haze and overcast, so there is an orange background to the night sky from reflections of the sodium vapor streetlights off of the clouds and haze.   I looked up at the sky and observed a black cigar shaped object silhouetted against the orange background.  The object was at about a 45 degree angle from the ground in the south or southeast direction.  Based on the fact that it was below the overcast layer, I’m estimating that it was at an altitude of 3,000 to 10,000 feet.  I also think that it was about the size of a commercial airplane, or maybe if it was higher up, as large as a zeppelin.  The object was silent and stationery.  I remember the black object as having three lit portholes, evenly spaced.  The portholes were definitely not stars.  They were definitely larger than a star or a planet, and shined white without variation.  There was only one object and it was pitch black against the orange overcast.   I stared at the object for about five seconds to 10 seconds.  I had enough time to stare, and realized that it was unnatural, debate whether to wave my arms at it, when it suddenly disappeared.  It did not move at all before disappearing. Since the object was silent, stationery, and disappeared abruptly, I’ve speculated that maybe it really never flew off, but instead was “uncloaked” just long enough for me to see it.   I’m an aerospace engineer who has spent his career working on satellites.  I was a little disappointed in that the object did not look or behave like I would have imagined for a flying saucer.  The incident was also so undramatic that I’ve only mentioned it to one or two people.

New Year's 1985 and the revelers were working up a steam in downtown Lahaina, Maui.  My childhood Carmel friend, Mrs. ((woman's name deleted)) invited my wife, ((wife's name deleted)) and myself, ((male author's name deleted)), to celebrate New Year's Eve Maui style beginning with dinner and secured balcony seating at Lahaina's infamous Blue Max Restaurant.  ((female friend's name deleted)) husband and my childhood Surf Bro, ((male name deleted)), was busy managing the Crazy Shirts stores, working the vacation crowds and couldn't join us.  The sun set, dusk faded to darkness with the wait staff lighting R table's candles and suddenly all the electricity went off.  Shreaks, bells and sirens of the store's battery alarms went off wildly bringing immediate attention to the darkened town.  R Blue Max balcony table was right above main street, with an unobstructed view overlooking the breakwater cement wall with a clear ocean panorama across the glassy, mirror like sea with darkness setting on...  Suddenly, all alarms went silent... FLASH of LIGHT. Directly in front of us was a UFO; silent, large, glowing sphere of golden light, hovering still, above the ocean, less than a mile away.  What was totally amazing was that the light emitted and began directly below the UFO, starting on the ocean surface...  Yes, like with the sun setting, creating a path of light, coming from over the horizon, the light from the glowing UFO sphere beamed down onto the ocean's surface, creating a spot of origin and raced to shore like a yellow brick road.  The UFO sphere's golden glow emitted no sound, provided the only light anywhere and the lit path was beckoning. Cars quit driving on the street below, people poured out of the buildings and congregated at the breakwater cement wall to stare in silence at the huge glowing UFO sphere.  Everyone was in awe with an eerie yellow glow on their bodies, reflecting the golden UFO light.  The UFO sphere appeared to be glued, suspended in the sky, as it was positioned so extremely low that the Lanai Island was the back drop behind it...  People were packed onto the street so tight; U could not put paper between them.  The pathway of light appeared to emerge out of the ocean, distorting my understanding of the Universe, everything learned at school made no sense anymo'...  The phrase ""We R Here"" took new meaning. Soon, I was wondering if the golden lit path over the ocean to the breakwater shore would become a cosmic walkway that everyone may hypnotically, like the Pied Piper, be summoned to walk on to and be beamed up the glowing UFO?  Walking on water?  Anything was possible now…  All conventional knowledge had just been tossed!  Time stood still, with only the light from the glowing UFO illuminating all of Lahaina...  Everyone was stunned, waiting for something to happen...  We, by default, felt controlled by this strange, silent glowing UFO, realizing U have little control of Ur Life, when a glowing sun like UFO omits Ur only light.  We now know that we don’t know anymore... Eventually, I became fearful, scared, frightened, as my Life was changed forever, knowing ""we R not alone""... With the challenge of this UFO banging on my psyche's door with the ""Big Bully Denial"" blocking any acceptance of this UFO experience.  I found myself talking to myself, a strange, nonse! nse, babbling an incoherent conversation, ""Go away and leave me alone... I want to stay here... On Earth!""  Everywhere, all lights were off, the only light was coming from the large, glowing UFO at nearly eye level to me, directly in front of everyone...   The Maui newspaper reported the next day with a simple front page column stating that an ""unexplained electrical outage of 55 +/- minutes shut-off all electricity on the entire Island of Maui with electricity being restored, as mysteriously as it went off .""  No, none, nada, nothing, zip, zero, zilch was mentioned of the Lahaina glowing UFO sphere sighting and no interviews with anyone!  Everyone during the 1986 New Year ""daze"" that followed tried to find photographs...  None to be had!  From what I understand of the UFO ""electrical disconnect"", cameras do not function, as the camera batteries also electrically malfunction, with the same principle that caused the battery operated store alarms to stop?  Being introduced to USO (unidentified submerged objects) phenomenon of water fusion energy relationships, my inclination is that this glowing UFO sphere may have come up out of the ocean!  The UFO sphere was visible by thousands, remained still and provided the only light for over 40+/- minutes, then sped off in a wildly, squiggle flight, abruptly stopping high, almost directly overhead, while still being larger than any star.  Now, everyone looked up to keep the UFO in sight.  Some minutes later, the UFO ""burst"" into fragments like in Star Trek ""warp speed"" and Star Wars ""hyper space"" acceleration.  As suddenly as the UFO appeared, the UFO disappeared; ZAP...  Electricity was then immediately restored!  Ur mind changes, challenging all U were taught...  Religion, well, U get real religious when the unexplainable lights Ur way. No longer is the Question ""if""... ""If"" becomes reality, now real Q's begin...  One may want to deny what U have just experienced, but like an ebbing tide, eventually denial erodes to the base rock fact of the UFO experience...  I've been ""Touched by Alien Light"".  This glowing UFO sphere had no sound, was still, exhibiting the color and intensity of the sun, all electrical power stopped with the UFO presence and the electricity was restored when the UFO vanished...  As Detective Joe Friday of TV's Dragnet fame says, ""Just the facts, Mam.""    The following year 1986, I returned with ((wife's name deleted)) to Lahaina Maui.  Driving down Main Street and coming to the breakwater cement wall looking out to my right over the ocean where the UFO light began on the ocean surface was an emerged Nuclear Submarine!  I was told that the US Navy made Lahaina a port-o-call for the Nuclear Submarine fleet.  OMG, Nuclear Submarines have a quarantine zone around them, when there or not...  How ironic, the site of the light starting in the ocean beneath the glowing UFO is now off limits because of nuclear submarines.  Go figure?  I was stunned to view the black stealth ""nuclear death"" submarine, appearing like a floating missile in the calm sea of Lahaina Maui that once was my sanctuary from a mechanized, techno-mad world, my escape since 1971…  I have never been back to Lahaina, I go to Hana, Lahaina; in Hawaiian means :  ""Blazing Sun""... Has this happened here before... R U 1?",2017-05-06T00:00:00,20.905862790697675,-156.62671627906977

It was, judging by the distance, a seemingly very small craft.  Perhaps the size of a Dodge caravan, maybe bigger. It had metal prongs/legs all around the craft, red and green lights, and the vessel itself was brown in colour with darker brown, thick plates on what seemed to be the front of the vessel (based on the plates facing the direction it was moving).   I opened my window to see if I could hear anything, but I could not.  The UFO was literally, completely silent.  It was not emitting any sort of fog or exhaust, simply hovering as if it were completely defying gravity. The UFO was also extremely slow-moving, moving at ~5 mph.  It moved across the sky in a straight line and then stopped abruptly, perfectly frozen in place, for about 60 seconds before continuing its path.

He said he thought it was a flare but then when it cMs ovst the butler building he thought it was a missel or a millitary rocket.  But when it got closer it looked like a fite ball or orb.  Then exploded as it took off and left real fast.  I didnt see it yet.  But as we were gking on break walking to the shop.the butler building the maintenance shop.  The orb was not a missel or a rocket. It got really close and I stood in amazement.  And it was glowing like a fire all around. It kind of look like a jApanese lantern but nothing like those japanese kites or lanterns.  It looked like it had 4 jet streams spinning in.a circle and A 5 jet stream pointing down the ground.  It was really amazing.becausr the top of it! looked like an optapus head or it was oval.with a sharp point tip like a tent but what I could describe it it looked like an insect or felt like it was a living organism and I.could feel.it like.it could sence me and gave me the chills.

The firery orb seemed more like a living organism and glowed and fiery orange or amber type of glowing live flames or real .fire.  It was real quite and made no sound.  Then it flew around the stadium around the west where I stood almost as close to the light poles then flew around the south end.  Then we All went on break.  The sighting I.believe they live in the wetlands behind sam boyd stadium.  Because it came from the mountains behind the stadium. Sam boyd elevation is one of the lowest part of the vegas valley.  Plus I think.now that the wetlands preserve is undergoing construction with the hicking trail.  Alot of construction and bulldozers are channeling.the water and the water detention basin to get the wetlands to flow.

UFO Sighting: 2 lights moving  It was Thursday, February 23, 2017, about 8:30 PM driving home from bible study, about a 15 minute drive home with my three minor children and my friend.  As I turned right off the Douglas-Hiram road, route 92, I noticed two moving objects with bright lights that just moved horizontal across the sky.  They were not close together but distanced apart but moving at the same level across the sky.  I said something to my friend.  She then saw them as did my children. As I drove along we all watched.  I turned into my subdivision and onward to my house in the cul-de-sac. Trees blocked my view into my subdivision to my first left turn up to my right turn onto my street.  Just at the intersecting streets, the view was clear.  We could still see these two bright lighted sightings just gliding across the sky at the same eye level and same distance apart.  The two lighted sightings didn't seem to be very high in the sky but distance enough to just see the lights which appeared to be linear horizontals.  We watched as long as we could on the tree lined street into my cul-de-sac before I reached my garage. I am not sure if this was reported by others, and we did research the Internet to see if anyone reported this.  I just really find this strange. I myself have witnessed three UFO sightings in Baltimore, Maryland in the summer during the late 60s and early 70s.  Those sightings were witnessed by several people where the sightings just seem to be suspended mid air about I'd say about 400 feet off the ground having what appeared to be lights circling the flying object having flown very close to our community recreation center viewed through the paneled windows some 22 feet from the floor.  At that time, 20 plus people saw this on movie night.  The sighting ended over the field on an elementary school property, Bentalou Elementary, to be exact.   I would see two other sightings from my home on Lexington Street, Baltimore, Maryland.  I say this to say, I believe there are UFOs which makes me sensitive, alert and observant to anything flying in the sky.  These two lighted sightings just struck us as odd.

We are near the normal flight path for Life Flight helicopters coming from Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire so that was my initial assumption.  However, the noise was so intense, I went out onto my back deck to take a look. My deck has a panoramic view of the Bennington valley.  I looked east and saw the aviation strobe lights of the copter as it came over the tree tops across the street.  Then I noticed two bright, white points of light about 300 feet in front of the helicopter.  They were separated by about 50 feet from each other.  They were solid lights with no blinking, fading or strobing.  The tri kept a steady pace as they flew over the valley.  The two lights never changed their path, elevation or distance from one another.

While getting into my vehicle, I notice a large light high up in the sky that I thought was the Planet Jupiter, although I thought that it appeared to be 3 to 4 times larger than what I am used to observing from my home in Albuquerque.  As I began driving, I noticed that the object appeared to be shimmering and changing from a golden color to a light shade of red or pinkish orange.  After I had traveled approximately 3 miles, I noticed that the object appeared to be increasing in size.  As I passed the La Cienega exit the object had doubled in size and now appeared to be near the size of a street light and the colors became more vibrant.  The object was gradually  losing altitude and traveling in roughly the same direction as Interstate 25 (from north to south), and appeared to be moving slightly inward toward the interstate.  It became obvious that this was not a commercial aircraft as it appeared to be within a distance of less than 3-5 miles from my location and the object appeared to be at least as big as 2 to 3 airliners.  There were not any other lights on the craft, and no definite shape could be seen due to the brightness of the light the object was emitting.  At this point the object appeared to be at half the altitude it was at when I first observed it, I would estimate somewhere between 3000ft. to 5000ft. It was at this time that I brought the object to my passengers attention.  She observed the object for the next couple of minutes, stating in agreeance   that the object was not a plane and that is was descending toward the earth at a steady rate.   As I reached the Cochiti Exit I noticed that the object was now at about ¼ of the original height, and we agreed it was flying somewhere between the Cochiti Pueblo and Interstate-25.  My passenger was attempting to take a picture as we were approaching the Budaghers exit but was having difficulties focusing on the objects as we were traveling at highway speeds.  Around a mile before the Budaghers exit, the object appeared to begin moving west and away from the highway.  I decided that I would exit at the Budaghers off-ramp and attempt to get a few pictures or videos.  As I was exiting the off-ramp the object was visible until I had my vehicle almost pointing in its direction of travel.  The object “blinked out” and was no l! onger visible.  I stopped and continued to observe the sky in this area for another five minutes and never observed the object again.  The event occurred over a period of twenty minutes, and a distance of at least twenty-five miles.  As I returned to Interstate 25 and drove south toward Albuquerque I noticed two military helicopters to the far southeast, near the backside of the Sandia Mountains.  I live in an area of Albuquerque where Blackhawk helicopters often fly near my home when they are performing training exercises so identifying the helicopters was not difficult.   I also want to note that the object appeared to begin moving in a westward direction at the time my passenger took her first picture with the flash turned on, on her camera phone.  I also thought I would mention that there are radio towers everywhere in the area and the light of the object was much larger that the lights on the towers.  This all may be coincidence but interesting none the less.",2017-03-10T00:00:00,35.661082683982684,-105.95390714285715

We made a right turn on Highway 87, north bound.  I continued to watch the light out the drivers side window.  We both observed what appeared as though the light was moving parallel to us.  After travelling 1/2 mile I asked the driver to pull into a gas station, the movement of the light also stopped.  The driver exited the car and started videoing the object for several minutes, using the wide angle/ telephoto feature back and forth.  During the video the object changes colors from a solid to multicolor and the shape changes while maintaining a hexagon shape.

After watching for short time and taking more videos I asked the driver to drive the car south while I stood in the parking lot and kept it under observation, it appeared to remain stationary.

Some of the people were friends.  They were all just standing still watching something, quietly talking and I went to see what they were looking at.  Ahead on the left branch of the road...actually above the road... maybe 50 or 60 feet off the ground was a glowing ball of pink light and in the center of it, the light was a turquoise blue. It was a gaseous thing, with no structure.  The intensity of the ball of pink did not increase or decrease in light or in color.  It was luminous but did not illumine anything around it. Neither did it move in any direction.  I just was suspended about the road and may have been about 500 feet from where everyone was standing.  No one walked toward it.  There were two houses off the road on the left side, one occupied and the other was empty at that time.  (A week or so later my boyfriend, my son and myself moved into it.)

The sky was clear with patchy clouds here and there.  As it began getting dark, I was disappointed because as usual, the sky was overcast, and not many stars could be seen. Maybe around 11pm, I was outside having a smoke and looking up to the sky. Night before last, within about 10 minutes, I seen what I think were satellites.  Two separate tiny white lights, like specks, no flashing or any other colors just steady white light zoom across the sky.   Tonight, all of the sudden I see one solid white speck of light but it's much lower than the two that I seen the night before.  Travelling fast, steady white light. I grab the camera but my screen is broken so I can't see what I'm aiming at.  Pointed it in the direction of the light which I can see with my eyes but it's already a bit away from me.  I did manage to capture a few seconds of it on video but the quality is poor. I had some house chores to do and made a late dinner.  Remembered that I needed to send an email with photos attached so went upstairs to do so.  I'm borrowing a computer from a friend and not used to Windows 10 and had to figure out how to download the pics from my camera.  And I got sidetracked... Next thing I know, it's almost 4am!  I turn off the tv and look outside and quickly notice a super bright orange light in the flight path but it seems to be descending. It was very low, grabbed the camera and pointed in it's direction.  Then a bright white light comes from same direction and looks to be slowing down.  I took five separate videos because the lights were busy - doing something for probably 20  minutes.  Two of those videos did not come out. You can hear me on them but no video was recorded until the last few seconds of one. I was surprised and almost couldn't believe what I was seeing.  All together, I think there was at least four lights - low, and they would break into different lights flashing - at one point, the first two lights were making a cross of red, yellow and blue flashing very quickly but that doesn't show on the video.  I'm a bit embarassed of the quality of my video - it's extremely poor - Canon Powershot, video taken outside my upstairs bedroom win! dow through the screen.  Diidn't have another angle accessible for viewing. Got just a bit nervous towards the end of videoing because a couple of the lights seemed to flash close.  Don't know how to describe but my friend and I have captured many videos in the past and sometime when capturing unusual lights - it might not be noticed by the person filming at the time, but upon reviewing, it will seem like the light(s) will suddenly come up on you quick.  Oh, and my cat kept getting in the way.  In one of the videos, there's a weird sound, otherwise, it was quiet outside. I'm estimating some people around the Sumner, Pacific, Edgewood areas HAD TO HAVE SEEN THESE.  I have no idea how low they were but from where I was watching, the lights were below.  I almost called the cops because I've heard of other people doing that  - to see if anyone else had called but it was after 4 am and didn't want to sound like a crack pot.",2017-06-02T00:00:00,47.17250000000001,-122.1845

As I got closer to the laundry room door, I noticed past the other apartment building on the main road in the distance there is a river in which above that river caught my eye a giant ball coming straight down over the river.  It was very white and bright almost little yellow on the outside of it.  I can only explain that it almost look pixel like it was very very bright and something in my head just went wow that is way too big to be a shooting star and it wouldn't go in that direction straight down into the water nor would or could a star be that close to town that close and it was way too large.   At that point the hair on my entire body stood on end I immediately called my husband who was upstairs in our apartment with our Sleeping Son.  Which I will include that he did not.   After a few moments of speaking with him on the phone I had proceeded into the laundry room to switch over the laundry.  I been texted my mother.

By that time my husband was outside and I was trying to explain to him what I had just seen and we walked out back together but the same time I began to get very anxious very nervous I was very uneasy I just wanted to go inside.

They both acknowledged seeing it glint.  As I was pointing out the object to them, another zoo patron walked by me and said to me, “You see it too…huh?”  I smiled and nodded at him.  He kept on walking. My son, his friend and I observed this stationary glinting object for 5 minutes or so, before it just disappeared.  I did not see again for the remainder of the time we were at the zoo.  The object was too far away to discern any detail.  I have no idea what I saw.  I did try to take pictures of the object with my phone, but nothing came out on the pictures I took.  To my chagrin, I did not think of taking video of the object.",2017-04-07T00:00:00,25.7741427135084,-80.28951850011829

It appeared basketball in size, silverish in color, and at a high altitude (1-2 miles).  The angle on the horizon was approximately 75 degrees.  This is close to Easterwood airport, so I initially thought it was a plane, then maybe a helicopter.  However, the shape was not quite right.

Ok.  So, I'm not 100% sure what I saw.  I am a pretty scientificly literate person.  I am going to explain what I saw in the best detail I can.   Mid-February sometime, I'm driving along the 101 highway near the Vermont exit in LA.  It's raining sort of heavy and all of the cars are going about 10-25mph.  I see an object floating in the distance.  It gets my attention because it's not moving at all, it's completely frozen/locked in position.  Mind you it was pretty windy and raining (rare in LA).  I squint to see what it is but can't make out any details.   At first I thought it was a balloon but a balloon would've been moving with the weather.  As I drove closer I pass under a bridge and it comes in to view about 50 feet over the next bridge.  As I drive closer I see this object.  The best way to describe it would be 3-5 balls in a vertical row connected to a central line that was not visible (imagine 2 balls on the left of the line,3 on the right).  The balls were literall! y merging and crisscrossing into each other repeatedly.  They were all metallic looking and I remember seeing red, a darkish blue and dark silver colors.  The rate at which these balls were merging was completely against the environment and unlike anything I've ever seen.   The merging was slow and rhythmic.  Kind of like a 1, 2, 3, 4  of a waltz but half time.  I looked to see a line, maybe something it was connected to and saw nothing.  As I got closer those details got clearer to the point where I could actually see the balls enter into each other and coming out on the other side.  I passed under the bridge it was floating over and never seen it again. Being a very sane person, and someone who deeply values science and the scientific method, I have been troubled by not being able to express exactly what it is I saw.   I live in Los Angeles and drive on this highway all the time.  I've never seen pictures or heard stories of anything like it.

Between ten and eleven p.m. in the second week of March, during a crescent moon which hung in the western sky, I thought it was a perfect night for stargazing. There is a mid-sized tree in the center of our backyard which obscrued any clear view. I seen that my best bet to have the  clearest view of the night sky would be on the roof of our lean-to. After making myself comfortable,  laying on my back and hands behind my head, I had a perfectly view to the north and southeast. I was able to see clearly to the south at about 35°. The roof of our house blocked everything beneath that.  To the west, there is several thirty to forty foot trees, which were bare of leaves, but still making it too cluttered for a decent view that way. The moon was showing through those trees, and was in the sky at about 75° when I first settled in. The stars were very bright that night.  And for early March, it was very comfortable to be outside.  Completely still, no wind whatsoever. I had probably been stargazing between 45-minutes to an hour.  The moon loomed at 30° in the western sky. Four dim white lights coming from direct south on a straight northern route, flew right over the house.  They passed directly above me as I lay on top the roof of the lean-to.  The Orion constellation was to the southeast, which was my focus at that moment and my clearest view of the sky. The lights cought my attention the moment they appeared over the roof of the house. I'm guessing within a quarter mile or so south of the house.  The four lights were dim, white, and appearing to be two seperate objects moving at a fairly quick pace and very close to each other like in a wingman formation. I have no idea how the objects were shaped.  Nor even trying to imagine how they might look! Because the way these lights moved across the sky had me, not only jumping with joy as I knew I was seeing a bonified UFO, but also left me completely baffled as to how they could possibly have looked. I could, however, see that each object had two lights which I am sure were each set on either side of the object.  I'm guessing the objects were only a few thousand feet from the ground, and by the distance  the lights were apart from each other.  The objects were likely the size of a small plane.  Maybe even as small as a car or truck. But it was the way they moved across the sky that has left me clueless. As the objects passed overhead there was not a sound.  All I could see were the four lights. I knew it had to have been two objects, each with a pair of lights. Imagine holding a dim light in each hand.  Arms outstretched horizontally&#8203;.  Now move your arms in a rolling motion.  As the left side rolls forward, the right side rolls opposite.  As if in the shape of an hourglass  rolling on its side.  Only it wouldn't be shaped like an hourglass. Its just the only thing I can think in comparison. The event lasted no more than ten seconds.  It was very dark that night, and I was able to keep my sights on the lights until they passed beyond the horizon, which was only a couple miles to the north because they were at such a low altitude. I googled the description of what I seen of the object and the way in which it moved, but was not able to find anything that seemed similar.  I did, however, come across this website, and thought by posting my account in the most detail I can give.  Maybe someone else has seen a similar object and can share with how the object possibly looks.  I'm intrigued. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

We were sitting in a golf cart on the driveway talking.  He looked over at me, and saw lights behind my head that weren’t like normal plane lights.  When he pointed it out, I turned and looked. What I saw next is hard to explain. 	The object that was moving in the sky was very large, and no more than 500 feet in the air, and it was silent.  A normal plane, at that height, would have been so loud.  We were in an open driveway, in a middle of a field, so the night was quiet.  We would have heard it if it was a normal plane. This object was so low, and moving slowly.  When we noticed planes in the sky later, they seemed to be moving so fast compared to how slowly this object had been moving. 	The lights themselves were so different from anything I’ve ever seen before.  The object looked like a triangle shape, but the sky was dark as I’m assuming the object was as well. But on each side, in the  middle, there were blinking lights.  They were blinking both red and white.  We watched as this object turned, and as it changed direction I saw more lights.  Either on the bottom or top of the object there was also a circular pattern of lights, that seemed to be rotating.  There were at least 10 lights all together, if not more. 	We watched for about 5 minutes as this object made its way overhead before disappearing above the tree line.  My boyfriend and I were talking, and I was trying to reason with him logically.  We’re in Carlisle, PA.  There are plenty of military bases around.  Carlisle is a huge shipping port. Etc, etc.  Then we stood up to go inside.  As we got out of the golf cart and turned to enter the house, we saw a light so bright just hovering then, above the field. 	At this point, I almost couldn’t move.  This light also was maybe 500 feet in the air.  It hovered in one spot, but not completely still.  It seemed to almost dance in the sky.  It was only one light I could see. But it was so bright, it had beams coming off of it, almost like it looked like a pinwheel.  It was so bright, it made everything else feel dark.  I couldn’t even see the tree line in the distance.  It didn’t fly away, it didn’t do anything. 	That is when my boyfriend grabbed my arm and pulled me in the house.  He was scared and wanted to go inside, but I couldn’t look away.  This experience lasted only maybe 2 minutes in its entirety before I made it into the house.  But once I got inside I realized more.  This light was also silent, and for how close and bright it was, it would have had to have been making a noise.  Even small drones you can hear in the air.  But this was completely silent. 	We went to tell his brother and friends, and when we told them it had just had happened, they ran outside to see if it was still there.  Within 5 minutes, by the time we had made it back outside, this light was gone and there were no traces of it.  When we walked back outside, the sky was brighter and back to normal.  It seemed almost like a different atmosphere outside. 	This also, is happening at a time when a lot of strange things have been happening to me.  I have RH- blood, and joke about being an alien pretty frequently.  But, I’ve recently been waking up with strange bruises that are very small (less than half an inch) in diameter, and are in a straight line.  I’ve had objects move literally while my back is turned, along with my phone acting strangely.  All of this, along with what we saw last night, is starting to add up.",2017-07-14T00:00:00,40.189189427312776,-77.2037678414097

I would like to report an unusual sight in the skies above Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on the night of 22 July 2017. At approximately 10:15pm, three of us were on the 9th floor common roof-deck of a high-rise condo complex.  We were there to observe fireworks in the downtown area; these fireworks were, as it happened, low on the horizon and occluded by other buildings.  The sky was generally clear, with a few long & wide “contrail-like” clouds present. After a few minutes of watching the skyline, etc., we looked directly overhead and saw the following phenomena.  We saw a grouping  of small white cloudlets within an elliptical patch of sky, whose long dimension was approximately equivalent to 5” held at arm’s length.  Within that grouping was an illuminated “v” shape, about ½” at arm’s length in extent, with the arms of the “v” consisting of a number of bright “pinpoint” emerald green lights, each surrounded by small halos.  The shape and distribution of lights (which appeared quite definitely organized or “non-random” to us) remained stationary, as far as we could tell. A we watched the “v” shape, we saw it gradually fade away.  Then, to one side of its location, but also within the elliptical patch of white cloudlets, we noticed a faint white line, extremely linear and precise, and stationary in the sky, with an extent of about 1” at arm’s length.  This white line, and the surrounding patch of cloudlets, then faded entirely from view; that is to say, it did not disperse or drift away. The duration of this sighting was approximately 45 seconds. At various times before and after the sighting, we noticed low light-aircraft above Montreal; in addition, a rotating searchlight/beacon was operating from one of the downtown highrises.  Regardless, the phenomenon we observed bore no relationship to these other light sources, nor to the distant fireworks.  And incidentally, we noticed that smoke from the low fireworks simply drifted with the wind, and did not fade out. Lastly, one of us (me) waited for clouds to drift into the area directly overhead, where we’d seen the phenomena, to see if some local ground-based illumination might have been the culprit; but I saw nothing of the sort. For whatever it’s worth, I myself am a PhD physicist (particle physics), 58 years of age.

By the time we got back outside it was gone.  I also realize for some reason the phone did not capture the green of it that I saw.  The green that I saw was as green as a green traffic light.  I would estimate its height at around 6000 feet and around 5-6 miles from me.  The blinking in the video was when it would go behind a power line.

I live near Washington, DC, and got up to look out the window to see if I could spot any fireworks.  As a preface, I do not drink or smoke, and although I was a little tired when this took place, I was looking out the window simply out of curiosity.  While I'm interested in UFOs, on the whole I have generally been a skeptic in this field.  Sometimes I have seen objects that I think are unusual, but it turns out to be a plane or a planet.   This was different given the motion of the object and the clarity.  Being the Fourth of July, I also thought a rogue firework might be behind this, but the object was visible for 20-30 minutes, moved with purpose, and was soundless. I noticed a green light which was pulsating at regular intervals, hovering several miles away without moving.  I thought this was a helicopter, but it was unusual because the light was blinking green (no other colors) and wasn’t moving. As it so happened, a plane/helicopter flew by as I was watching this object, and there were a few main differences easily apparent -   1.)  The plane moved in a linear direction. Helicopters, when seen, generally do too.  This object was stationary. 2.)  The plane had a blinking white tail light, along with red and green running lights. The object I was seeing had neither.  Shortly after the plane passed, the object ascended rapidly and stopped. I thought this was odd because usually helicopters will gather momentum as they ascend and they’ll stop as they reach their new destination.  This object simply went up and stopped. I moved to another room with a better vantage point and viewed the object directly for ~15 minutes as it moved occasionally.  The object was located to my south and would have been by my estimation about 4-8 miles away.  It blinked green continuously (no light, green light, no light) at regular intervals.  It moved behind a tree and I believe I saw it flash more rapidly with a pinkish color but I am not certain.  During this time it moved in one direction, stop briefly, then would reverse direction or move in another direction.  Planes and other aircraft curve to meet a path - this moved fairly linearly.  I don’t believe this was a drone as I don’t think I would have been able to see it as far away as it was, given the distance, and it moved past the trees, and moved back to near its original position.   I attempted to take several photographs and videos of the object, but it is difficult to make out in most. The object then moved directly towards me and I saw there were two lights as part of the object. I could not identify a shape of the object but it seemed as though the lights were on the underside, if indeed there was an object.  It passed directly over my residence and hovered there for a second, before moving on.  The lights were bright and there were very clearly two of them, side by side (left-right oriented).  The lights were two large to be running lights on an aircraft, my best analogy is as though someone put two small flashlights together and pointed them down. I went out my front door to look at it and saw it moving in the reverse direction, but it was silent.  I could still clearly see two green lights.  I estimate it was flying lower than typical small plane but cannot estimate its altitude in feet/meters. I went to go outside to try to take more footage but as I was doing so, the object went back to its original position, hovered, then moved off to the W-SW.  I was able to capture video of it moving from a stationary camera on a tripod, as well as phone video.  Given the darkness it is difficult to see but the blinking light(s) are visible in these files.  Unfortunately I did not capture the moment that it flew over my location, but it is clearly visible in one photograph that the object had two distinct lights.",2017-07-07T00:00:00,39.07793837209302,-77.14956651162791

I am open to any explanation as to what I saw, but, I feel I am pretty good at identifying aerial phenomenon, and I can’t figure this one out. 7/4/2017, 2155 hours PST, watching fireworks.  I already know what you are thinking.  No. Not 30 seconds before I stated, maybe we will see a UFO.  And then there it was.  The following is why I am baffled.   Location, general, King County, Washington State, general street coordinates 195 Av NE/NE 175 St.  Direction of flight, southeast. Appearance, looked like the ISS going over, but about 5 or more times faster in travel, and….maybe twice as bright.  ISS is not supposed to be visible here tonight.  There was an Iridium Flare listed for about 2155, but I thought it was going to flare to the north, not travel southeast-bound like a bright, non-dimming object that looked like a bright ISS. My millisecond thought process as I watched it for about 4-5 seconds (it was moving out!) was at first….oh, there’s a piece of burning magnesium powder from a firework. Wait, it is not dimming, and it is moving in a straight line.  Oh, looks like the ISS.  Negative, it is not visible tonight.  This is too fast, the speed is like a low flying airplane going over.  But it is bright.  Maybe an aircraft, no, not seeing any green/red navigation lights, just looks exactly like a bright ISS. The only way I can try to explain it is, but I don’t believe my own explanation because of what I saw, was, a helicopter flying over with a bright search light shining mainly downward, drowning out the red/green nav lights, and I can’t hear it because of the fireworks in the area. So, UFO is correct in that, I can’t identify what I saw.  I would welcome any explanation because I am not sure how to classify this in my own mind.  If I could look at radar recordings in this area, I would do so.  If anybody can, and they can tell me what the heck it was that we saw, I would appreciate it.  I only had, at best, 10 degrees of view because of a nearby tree, but we saw it continue on, without dimming, through the branches a couple times. UPDATE:  I started reporting this at about 2245 hours PST, 7/4/2017.  My brother texted, and we have since spoken on the phone.  He is in Maui.  His text, at 2252 hours PST was, “I think I just saw the space station go over Maui here and it was hauling as_”.   More texts, and I had to call him.  He is in Kaanapoli.  Looking WNW between Molokai and Lanai Islands.  He sees something in the sky to the SW, south of Lanai, moving generally west to east, but south of his location.  I questioned him carefully.  No nav lights, looked exactly like the ISS, not dimmer or brighter, but many times faster.  He thought, jet airliner altitude (30000 feet or so).  He explained it away as the ISS, but hauling as_.   He next explained it away as a satellite losing altitude and coming back to earth.  No trail at all, like shooting stars or space debris (which I have seen back in I believe the 90’s when a piece of Soviet debris came down and was visible from Washington State, it left a green trail! as it burned on re-entry).  How long did he see it?  2 to 3 seconds!  Wow.  Mine was 4-5 seconds, and I am sure he had a better view in Maui.  The thing was moving fast!. Ok, I am done for now.  I have not been stumped by objects in the sky until tonight, and I am in my 50’s.  So, there it is, for comparison to other reports.  My gut feeling is, if my girlfriend and I saw something and my brother saw something far away in Maui, there may be a slew of sightings coming in!  While I was typing this, my girlfriend already found youtube videos from tonight with ufo’s, UFO spotted in Norwalk, California, July 7th 2017.  But, the ufo in that video was barely moving compared to what we saw.  And, what we saw was more of a white light, like the ISS, not orange.   Signing off.   I hope to learn from other reports if I am still waiting to see my first UFO, or if this is explainable and I need to keep looking.   Thanks PD!   And, PD, please reply if this can be explained.",2017-07-07T00:00:00,47.7543,-122.1635

There was also one very bright stationary magenta craft that followed this same pattern.

It appeared as two distinct lights: pulsating blue-turquoise light on its left, and constant red light to the right. The object appeared to be hovering and not moving much.  The object was in about the same location as another type of object I saw a few minutes earlier (see my other report).  I watched #1 for a while and then I saw another object that looked exactly the same in the West;  I’ll refer to it as object #2.  The #2 was about the same altitude as #1.  Then realizing it is something unusual with two of the same objects, I went inside to get my binoculars and iPad.  Both #1 and #2 were hovering and visible when I went inside. While inside, #1 disappeared.  Using binoculars, I took a closer look at #2 and could see not two lights but a string of 4 round red lights to the right and below the blue lights.  The blue lights were 3 or 4 and round as well and only the blue were pulsating.  The lights were parallel to each other (blue on top red on bottom) but they were not perpendicular to the ground.  They were higher to the right and lower to the left when viewed.  Also the blue lights were not directly above the red but offset a little to the left:  Blue Blue Blue Blue Red  Red Red Red.  The lights were very distinct or solid and not at all like aircraft lights.  I am a few miles north of the airport, but there were no airplane or helicopter sounds, and the objects I saw were relatively motionless. I proceeded to take a photo followed by a 4 minute plus video of #2 on my iPad.  The photo and video are not at all as clear as I could see with the naked eye.  However, when I zoom on the photo, I can see the 4 red lights in a row as I described.  The photo didn’t capture the blue light which must have been “off” in the pulsating cycle.  On the video, the pulsating lights seem more white than the deep turquoise blue I experienced. Many people in the area were setting off their personal Fourth of July fireworks as seen in the video.  However, #2 hovers over the spectacle below.   After four minutes or so, I quit taking video and after 10 minutes from the first sighting of #1, #2 descended slowly out of view behind some trees. Shortly before I saw #1, and immediately after # 2 disappeared, I saw 3 other objects of a different type and will report the sighting of those in a separate report.

At an intersection, I noticed a silver object in the sky, which i presumed to be a very low flying 747 which struck me to be odd as I was 60 to 70 plus miles away from Ohare and Midway airports.   Looking at it closer, I noticed it was not moving.  I took off my sunglasses to see if I could see it better, but as soon as I did, that it disappeared.  Putting them back on, you could easily see it again.  I figured this was related to the polarized lens....very weird though.  I immediately changed my direction to head north towards it.  Driving very fast, I was only about 2 miles from the object that was only about 3,000 feet in the air.  I had never seen anything like this in my life.  As I got closer the object began to move.   At this time, I immediately felt light headed and a headache ensued (which I rarely get...related idk).  At the same moment hundreds of birds began to flock away from the object from the adjacent tree line.   It changed its direction a few times and began to head north.  I hopped on I-57 towards Chicago and drove very fast so I would not lose sight of it.  As I did this, the craft picked up incredible speeds towards increased altitude dramatically.  If I had to guess, roughly 15 times faster than a typical 747, but this is likely an underestimate.   I was dumbfounded, concluding the only explanation is new military technology or extraterrestrial.  Unfortuantely, the object moved so fast that it disappeared in the distance in less than 30 to 45 seconds.   I decided I would turn around at the next exit at this point as it was long gone.  I slowed down a bit because I noticed an unmarked all black police car flashing white, yellow, red, and blue lights pulled off on the side of the interstate.  I could not identify the model, as it was a car I had never seen before, and I know my cars very well.  I would say the closest car would be a Chrysler 300 with a sleek body kit, maybe it's the 2018 version.  Who knows.   As I approached it, I noticed it had US Government plates, with no other vehicles pulled over next to it, and I could not see into the windows as I passed, they were tinted which striked me as odd.  I thought it might be related to the presence of the craft so I kept driving past the next exit.   I continued on the expressway for another 10 to 12 miles to see if anything odd would appear.  As I began to merge into the right lane to get off the expressway I saw it again...maybe 10 miles West of me hovering above a radio tower.  At this point I tried to snap a photo, but figured it would not work as I could not see the object without my polarized lens.  I got off the freeway and headed west towards the object which was likely above Frankfort, IL.   At this point I noticed a prop plane heading towards it from the east and two dark planes flying in formation from the north.  At this point I was only a few miles away from it, but as the jets approached the craft it accelerated south at a very high speeds.  The best pa! rt was the fact you could see it breaking the sound barrier within a matter of a few seconds.  It picked up speeds so fast and headed into the skies where I lost sight of it within 10 seconds. I pulled off the road to turn around and see what types of planes where approaching.  They were two fighter jets, maybe the F35 but I couldn't say definitely.  They had no chance of keeping up with the object though.  I hopped back on the freeway and on my way back home I noticed a strong presence of police cars.  I saw 15-20 in the 20 minute drive home.  As I approached my town I noticed more police lights, a fire truck, and ambulance which was weird because it was right where I began to have a headache.  There was a car in the ditch on one side of the road and two cars that collided at the intersection.  Maybe it was just all a coincidence though, but it was very odd coincidence.  I reviewed the photos I took and I managed to capture the object on one of them, which I will upload. I watched the six o'clock news to see if anyone else reported it, but no news at all regarding craft, military testing, fighter jets, etc.  Hoping someone will see this post and possibly confirm some of these events.   Lastly, I have been keeping an eye out for an odd activity over the last few days.  I noticed a strange, constant light that traveled much faster than the any of the other planes that fly over my house the night after the initial sighting.  Additionally, I worked outside the day after and today on the landscaping.  I kept hearing roaring jet engines over the house. This occured 6 or 7 times since I saw the object on thd 7th.  Unfortunately, it has been cloudy here since then, but I can only confirm that I saw a fighter jet on two of these occasions during the day.  I've lived hear since 2004 and have only seen a fighter jet once so all of this is very odd.  Hope someone else can provide an explanation.  Thanks.   Note: the attached photo is the original unedited photo.  It has the object on the right side, if you zoom on you can see the radio tower in the distance 10 to 15 miles away or so.  It is directly above the radio tower.",2017-06-15T00:00:00,41.2541,-87.8912

After a few seconds, they disappeared all at once with a slight decay.  It looked like someone had turned off distant, but powerful, lights, and it took a second for the filament to fully dim.  Could also have been them disappearing behind distant clouds.  It was confusing and I thought maybe I had witnessed some sort of reflection onto my drivers side car window that went away as I drove.  I continuously looked into the southern sky, but never saw it again.  About 20 minutes later, between Yuma, AZ and El Centro, CA, I noticed a pilot in a small propeller aircraft doing aggressive maneuvers in the night sky, intermittently turning on and off 2 lights on the ends of each wing of his plane.  Perhaps he was doing night time crop dusting.   I also later heard there was fire in the area so could have been dropping flame retardant as well.  As this is an agricultural area,  I assumed I has seen lights on the wings of crop dusting plane or planes.  But now not so sure after reading the other reports from further north at the same time.

At first, I thought it was a large plane, but then I saw it coming slowly, silent, from West to East, and slowly passed over where I was, fading behind the trees in the mountain.

First,let me start off by saying that I am just an ordinary person.  I am married, have three children and am currently a substitute teacher.  I am a former police officer and veterinary tech.  I am a well rounded, faith based individual. Hopefully, I have established somewhat of a picture of my credibility.  What I am about to tell you sounds completely illogical and totally fabricated.  But let me assure you, the night it happened and for many nights afterwards, it was very real to me. 1996, I was 18.  I had moved in with my fiance into a two story home that was located in the country.  The nearest house was over two miles away.  The only way you could find our place was to know where it was...those winding dirt roads were easy to get turned around on. It was around 11 p.m. on a breezy summer night. I had been outside most of the day and couldn't sleep because of my sunburn.  I went downstairs and took a cool bath.  The inside of the house was rather stuffy, as it was a much older home and didn't have central air conditioning.  Once toweled off, I wrapped a bedsheet around my body and stepped out into the front porch to enjoy the breeze. As I stood there, I began to feel very uncomfortable.  To the point that my stomach knotted and my bladder felt as if it would burst.  The hair all over my body stood on end.  The front yard was made up of a small carport, in which two vehicles were parked.  A street light stood next to the carport and it illuminated the entire yard.  I scanned the yard searching for whatever it was that was unnerving me.  The fight or flight was delayed because I couldn't see what I was reacting to.  Just as I decided to retreat into the house, I turned toward my left, eyes still scanning.  Then I saw it. A figure stood, appearing half crouched, between the two vehicles (toward the bumper area, we always pulled straight in) under the carport.  Now the light didn't fall into the carport, but illuminated the surrounding area.  But it did give off enough light  for me to see it.  I stood there in shock, frozen with fear, and with my mouth agape, tried to rationalize the large head and simultaneously attempt to register what I was looking at.  Your mind has a way of flipping through everything you have ever seen, in order to place such a being.  I had nothing. I took one step forward to try and focus on on its features when it ducked between the cars.  And let me add, nothing or no one I have ever seen has ever moved that fast.  It was as if we had spotted each other and both of us were terrified. The head and neck alone were unbelievable, but the speed in which it moved was down right impossible. I ran inside, urine running down both legs, up the stairs and screaming the entire way.  My fiancee woke up and I told him what I saw.  He grabbed a pistol and went outside, me begging him not to go.  I stayed at the top of the staircase and cried. He found nothing. Nothing at all. I didn't sleep that night. I realize how this sounds.  Let me assure you that I know this sounds like the ravings of a mad woman.  But the truth is, it isn't.  This really happened.  This changed me. Thank you for your time.

It bugs me that no-one else in the general public saw what we saw that night, as far as I know - & the bloody thing was as big as an aircraft carrier, floating up in the sky!  This is a report of a gigantic craft that myself & a friend saw, directly in front of us, over the ocean off the East coast of Australia. Back in 1995, I was sitting with a friend on a headland at The Entrance, north of Sydney, Australia, looking east over the ocean.  It was around 8pm & we were there at random - we went for a drive to visit some relatives up that way.   All of a sudden, the sky in front of us seemed to ""shudder"", as if something was entering the airspace.  My friend reacted like I did - about to run.  I said, ""Did you see that!""  In front of us was a gigantic craft - it would've been over 1 km wide, & the aspect was the same as if you looked at a jet from the front.  it looked like a pyramid on its side, looking up at the point.  We could just make out the right angles.  The thing was silent, & we felt really eerie, & got the hell out of there.   Interestingly, around that time there were multiple sightings of smaller craft reported, but as far as I know, we were the only witnesses to this thing. The really disturbing thing about this is the fact that we were just north of Australia's largest city, & people were oblivious to this craft.  Where we were sitting was a populated area too, & the people there had no idea what was sitting just off the coast.  If this craft was hostile, what I feel is that nothing on this planet could defend against this technology. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in 1995 is approximate.

Next to my right arm was a ‘smaller figure’ I am not looking, but sense being directed.  It directs me toward a wooden fence, as we walk closer I see a metal ladder and a push on my arm.  I start climbing up.  I remember being confused and wondering how come I am climbing ‘up’ against a property line fence. I step-up at least 4 steps up to a small metal standing space, the area is a little smaller than a manhole cover.  I am very aware of how smooth the metal is and put my right hand onto a railing to stabilize myself. As I do, I am directed to step down into a darkened hole, I am not afraid.  Descending, I see 4 metal tub sitting bench circulating this 7-8 feet across small room.  Climbing down, I glance just below steps and see a blond man,  I do not look at him again.  There is one other person a brown-haired lady, she does have clothing on (I presume night ware).  I am only wearing panties; I realize my modesty, briefly hesitating I am pushed to sit down.  After sitting down, placing my feet on the metal floor it was wet/water to my bare feet. I am now able to see a round bubble-out window, I have sat down (to my right) across from the other lady.  I have no thoughts of how come I am here, or the smaller figure to my right next to the window. No panic up to this point, complete acceptance. My next thought is us traveling above a freeway, very fast with a slight movement, but not a noticeable wobble.  I have stood up a little and bending slightly at the waist to look squarely out the window.  I am not stopped (?) thinking back that is strange.  I am surprised to see how light it is outside, as I remember thinking it was not morning yet.   I see an over-pass coming up quickly and voice out that we are going to crash into it.  I am more afraid of the possibility of crashing than I am in a tight-enclosed vehicle going very fast.  I turn to look at the smaller figure to my right and yell at him we can’t go through cement!  I hear a voice (but it is in my head) from behind me saying, “Quiet that one down.” I feel like I have fallen next to the brown-haired lady a surprised yelp from her and seeing we have come and connected with the bottom part of the over-pass everything goes black.

"""Fire flies"" in South Beach.",Miami Beach,FL,2015-04-25T23:00:00,light,~3 seconds,"Occurred : 4/25/2015 23:00  (Entered as : 04/24/15 23:00) Reported: 4/27/2017 5:12:26 PM 17:12 Posted: 4/28/2017 Location: Miami Beach, FL Shape: Light Duration:~3 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/133/S133858.html,"Fire Flies in South Beach At around 11pm I was sitting in my living room.  I live in a high-rise in Miami Beach and I have a city view.  I was looking through the open sliding glass door, (I was sitting in front of), at the time, when suddenly a bright light appeared from behind a building.  At first, I thought it was fireworks, but I quickly realized that this was not the case. It was seemingly in close proximity and flying at about the same height as my apartment.  I am on the 5th floor and these things were in my line of view, looking due west, and were visible for a few seconds.  The only way I can describe them is that it looked like flying fire.  They were 5 or 6 feet across, in my estimation, maybe larger.  They appeared solid, not translucent.  What I could see was a flat surface which didn't look to have much if any depth. They came from behind buildings that lay in my line of vision and then disappeared from sight the same way, going behind another adjacent building to the north.  If I had to guess, I would say that it was about a block or so away!  First there was one, then a second appeared, which seemed to split off the other.  They moved in a way that could not have been fireworks, swirling around themselves, or interacting for a moment and then speeding off to the north. As these fiery things moved through the air, the tail of the flames undulated in such a way as resembling a flag in the wind.  As it did so, small flames were left behind like a trail, but immediately dissipated.  Gravity and the laws of physics had no effect. There was an absence of smoke and sound, so I rule out fireworks.  There was nothing to indicate to me that there was any human involvement and it was unlike anything I've ever imagined.  I was quite shaken after seeing that, somewhat frightened. I don’t know if I can correctly recall the color, but it was bright and looked like fire.  I believe it was orange and red but there could have been other colors.  I was so astonished and it all happened so quickly, but I got a very good look at them.  They, whatever they were, had no apparent shape, other than the appearance of fire. It could not have been a projection.  The was nothing in the air space where they appeared for them to be projected on to, and they were above the lower 2 and 3 story buildings in the space where I could clearly see them.  I ran out to the balcony, but by then there was no sign of them. I occurred to me that someone else must have seen it.  I have lived in this apartment for 5 years and I have gazed in this direction countless times.  I have tried to figure out what happened that night, lost sleep over it and have come to the conclusion that either I had a hallucination, or I witnessed something unknown, not to mention extremely bizarre by any standard.   Since I am not prone to “seeing things” then I tend to believe the later. It’s very strange circumstances, because the objects, if I can call them that, appeared in a densely populated area with many tourists and people walking around.  South Beach is very active at least until 2AM.  Before midnight there are scores of people and heavy traffic in my neighborhood.  How could I have been the only one to have witnessed it?  I was out on my balcony immediately when I saw them, but like I said, they had disappeared by then.  I am less than a block from where it seemed to have occurred.  I heard no exclamations or commotion.  I also did not see any smoke or hear any explosions such as fire works-I definitely would have heard that. This is such an unbelievable occurrence that I have trouble believing it myself.  Nevertheless, I saw a pair of self-illuminating fire like objects flying through the air with what seemed to be some form of intelligence.  I have no idea what it was, but it was unlike anything in from my imagination.  It was but for a few seconds, but I will remember it forever. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Yes, Peter.  After review it was Tuesday, the 25th, not Monday the 24th.  My wife and I had gone out to dinner that night and I am certain the sighting occurred after that.  It was definitely Tuesday night the 25 and not Monday the 24th.

I just remember there was not any crops in the field behind my town home. It was warm out as I had some windows and patio door open.  Now that I really realize what I saw, I am going through the same emotions again as I did that night.  But now I am having a lot of anxiety.  When they passed, I did not feel evil, it was like they where looking in the windows on the 2nd level.  I tried to tell myself that they where what every those luminary things are with the candle that makes them float away.  Until I saw them being set off on TV.  They floated up, these objects moved steady across and changed direction.  I told myself that they had to be tied together by a long string if they were luminaries.  There was no sound at all.

Looking over, I noticed lights in the sky, moving at the same speed and parallel with each other. Upon seeing them, it turned out there were two more sets of lights.  One of the sets of lights, reminded me of a colon symbol from the keyboard, moving straight over my house and over the trees.  Following the same path was another set of lights only the looked as if a colon was on it's side. The third set of lights, broke the formation by going diagonally across the sky.  It seemed to have started off with them but ended up breaking away, still staying parallel with itself.  It was almost as if the sets of lights were attached in the pairs by a bar. These lights didn't blink, and they weren't slow like a plane. They also seemed to be flying too low for them to be a plane as well. I'm pretty sure they were actually in the atmosphere. As I watched them, I had three thoughts cross my mind.  One was just surprise, but the other two thoughts stood out.  These thoughts were ""get inside"" and ""what are you looking for?"".  Of course, I had stayed rooted to the spot until they were out of site, before my friend and I said goodbye. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I looked out of my window to see what the cat was meowing at thinking it must be a box elder bug on the glass or something, but instead I saw a big green oval of light. I live in a high rise building and can see Council Crest and the eastern side of West Hills from my apartment.  I can make out the houses and features of this part of West Hills well.  I could see a big green oval of light in the sky.  It seemed to be moving slower than a plane or helicopter, and seemed to be silent.  I put on my glasses so I could see it better out of curiosity and when I realized it wasn’t a plane or helicopter, I ran out of bed over to the window to get a better look. I saw the oval move towards West Hills.  Then it slowly went over the hill and then I couldn’t see it anymore.  The whole time it was floating around, it was gradually changing color from green to orange-red and back to green, with the color change seemingly starting towards the bottom right of the oval, and then sweeping over the rest of the oval until the thing had mostly turned orange-red. I don't know if the oval was solid or just light, but it seemed to have very clearly defined edges.  It was not like spot lights at all, which kind of have fuzzy, soft edges. I know the oval was not a plane because planes are not oval shaped and they move faster.  I see planes all the time from my windows, sometimes even antique ones, but this was not plane shaped and did not make any sound like a plane.  I know the green oval was not a helicopter because I see helicopters a lot, too, and they are noisy and I can clearly make out the helicopter shape.  In fact, I saw a helicopter come from the SW part of Portland towards the center of Portland a few minutes after I saw the green oval. I know this wasn’t a car on the streets of West Hills because I could clearly see the oval in the middle of the sky at first.  And I don’t think it was a drone because it looked to be wider than the houses it was above in West Hills when it was above them.  I thought for a second that it might be the aerial tram, which I can see a little bit from my place, but the aerial tram doesn’t change colors, it is not green and it doesn’t float around in the middle of the sky, obviously.  I don’t even think that tram runs at 12:30AM. I know the oval wasn’t making noise because I can clearly hear planes and helicopters from my apartment.  Also, even though this green oval floated really close to the houses on West Hills, nobody’s lights went on like they heard a loud noise above their house.  I had my window cracked and could hear the helicopter a few minutes later, so I know that the noise would have definitely have come through if there were any. I tried to take a picture of the oval but my hands were shaking and I kept dropping my phone because I was a little nervous about the green thing in the sky, not knowing what is was and all, and I was trying to make my cat stop meowing by petting her at the same time.  By the time I got my phone camera ready, the thing had floated over the West Hills and out of my sight.  I don’t know what the green oval thing was, so I am hoping maybe someone else does and can tell me.  I could draw a picture of it if that would help identify it.",2017-05-06T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

I was outside Lapine, Alabama, near route 331, when I noticed a lone storm cloud on the northern horizon.  The cloud was slowly moving west to east.  Many cloud-to-cloud lightning bolts were flashing within the cloud, but few cloud to ground bolts were visible.  The lightning bolts were blue-violet in color.  Many low rumblings were coming from the cloud, but few could be connected to a single lightning bolt.  A person watching the cloud with me commented that the lightning activity was both unusually quiet and concentrated within the cloud.  They stopped watching the cloud and went inside before the object became visible.  They also noted that their dogs, normally afraid of lightning, were unusually calm during the storm. I decided to videotape the electrical activity visible in the center of the cloud a few minutes.  After recording the central portion of the cloud, I thought it might be a good idea to record the rear.  The sighting occured during the following seconds. During a fraction of a second a lightning bolt lit up the rear of the cloud.  When it did, what appeared to be the corner profile of a building-sized rectangle appeared.  A second brighter flash illuminated a wider area, revealing more of the object.  The object then disappeared from view.  Between the two flashes, the object appeared to change shape. I recorded more video of the cloud hoping to see the object again, but failed to get any more footage.  Other clouds similar to the first passed by to the south.  Two planes flew in a line southward over the area about 5 to 15 minutes afterwards. A person I know in the area claims that a wifi dongle had to be reset due to activity that night, and/but I can't tell if the object was the cause. I was told that two weather radars were down for maintenance during this time. I have sent screenshots from the video to the email address below, but they aren't very detailed.  I may send frames if I can get a video editing program for my phone.

Not perfectly round though if that makes sense.  Because of its side to side movements and being stationary for minutes, I that it might be a helicopter.  I was in the Army and was Air-Assault, so I have sling loaded and have ridden in many helicopters, so I soon realized that's not what it was.   It was about 6000 feet in the air at first and it took off over our home and slowed to almost a full stop.  It was higher in elevation as it went above my home but you could see the outline.  It was kinda round and you could see a light around it coming from the inside.  Like a revolving lit restaurant looking from outside of it.  It actually started scaring me when I realized it had no sound coming from it.  It moved slow but then quickly.  Faster than a plane can fly.  The lights were a smoky white light coming from inside.  You could just see a hazy light at farther distance.  Clear when it was close.  There were no flashing lights on it.  I hope this helps as this was the first time seeing something like this.

The object was a solid and somewhat irregularly shaped teardrop that was horizontal and heading at an even level and speed towards the east.  It was a gunmetal gray color.  The plumper part of the object was to the east and the sharper point to the west.  It was smooth, but on the east end, the shape had a slightly squared edge on the top rim.  The bottom of it seemed flat.  I wondered if it were a drone, but it had no protruding parts, such as propellers or wings.  I am estimating that this object was about two feet long and two and a half feet at the widest point. There was no traffic, so I turned east on W. 11th and kept looking at it as it arced northeast above the houses on the next street.  I turned down that street, but it flew beyond the street and disappeared from view. The wind was pretty strong from the northwest at that time.  If it had been debris, I believe it would have tumbled and pirouetted in the sky, taking on irregular shapes.  Instead, it remained in the same shape, and it moved in a completely even trajectory, at a steady altitude, and at a steady pace.  I do not believe this was debris caught in the wind.  I believe it was a craft moving at a steady velocity, with purpose, towards the east/northeast.

I looked again at the drawing I made soon after seeing the objects and while they didn't appear to be Chinese lanterns, it is possible that at the right height and right angle maybe they could be.  The thing that throws me off is that I remember when I saw them I thought they were way too big to be drones - even really, really large drones.   The next morning I googled drones and thought that maybe the drones that are large enough to carry one person might be large enough to match what I saw hence ""car sized"" or ""small car sized"".   I never did see any of them rise rapidly in the sky and disappear.   They all maintained the exact height and distribution pattern the entire time I watched them move off to the NE until they were just small orange/red objects.  It was not windy that night.    I'm torn. However, without a picture or video of what I saw I have to let it go.   I can't prove anything. I sure will keep an eye to the sky though and keep my cell phone with me at all times!

It was almost 5:50 AM when I went out my back door and into the garden to water my plants.  This time of day is usually very dark outside and sunrise would be approaching in about 30 minutes.  I usually look at the stars as soon as I come outside, but this morning a bright ball of light immediately caught my eye. At first I stood on my step staring and thinking how odd.  My brain ran through many possible reasons why I could see this bright round shape; is there a planet really close to us, was it a search helicopter in the distance, a weird street light off in the distance, anything that I could think of.  I stepped of the step and walked closer to the fence to see if I could get a better angle, possibly giving it a reference point or position.  It looked to be past the bayou, and possibly past the park.  Then it moved, very swiftly to the left and up. I froze blinking my eyes. Immediately telling myself no, nope, there is no way you are seeing things. Then it moved again to the right.  Now I  am retreating back to my steps. I stood there staring and then I checked the surrounding sky.  I could see stars, street lamps, trees, everything as normal, but nothing was as large as this object.   Then the moment came when I thought to myself, does it know that I am staring at it? I shook my head a! nd went back inside, almost had my daughter come outside to verify it.  I decided against that notion, I didn't want to worry her and also it was time for her to leave for school.  Made sure she was ready and out the door and I went right back outside to the garden to see if it still was there.  It was and this time I took photos. I noticed in the photos it is not as prominent or as large as it was to me standing there. I moved to a different spot to gain a better angle.  Still it sat in the same spot.  As the sun started to rise i thought that it would disappear into the light within a few minutes.  Minutes passed and I could still see it just as clear and now with little shimmers of metal.  The object stayed the same shape the whole time, and no lights flashed that I saw.  I started to water my garden and try and watch it at the same time.  I noticed that it started to move up and I had to reposition a few times to track it through the trees.  Then it slowly moved right more and then some more.  I watched this object for nearly an hour, taking photos and video clips periodically.  Around 7AM, I went  back into my home where I  was for about 30 minutes.  When I came back out it was nowhere to be seen. It was eerily quiet that morning.  Usually there are people out, lots of wildlife wandering in and out of backyard or the neighbors.  No squirrels, raccoons, cats, dogs, opossums, children, trash trucks, work trucks... nothing.  I waited to read about it from other people in the paper, local blogs, texts, instagram, something.  No one said anything, and I felt awkward telling anyone.  It was there large, round, brilliantly bright and quiet on a very still morning for at least an hour that I knew of.",2017-06-09T00:00:00,29.979059016393443,-91.83132459016393

While on a UFO night-watch at Giant Rock with participants attending the Contact in the Desert event, approximately 50 of us gathered to watch the sky and share at least 15 pairs of Generation 3 military goggles provided by the host of the event. At approximately 10pm, a few people noticed a bright red-orange point of light glowing constantly bright, not blinking and moving from one field of view to another in between the two giant rocks and hills.  I and approximately 10 others joined the observers to catch a quick glimpse before it left our field of view. At this time, for approximately 1-2 minutes, I observed this light through the goggles.  The first thing I did was adjust the depth of field in the goggles.  The goggles were in focus for high altitude focus, making the stars above look very clear.  To view this object up close, I had to lens all the way to the closest depth to see the object clearly. What I saw during the time the focus was clear was a diamond shape with sides very close to being equal all the way around.  I could see definition in the object enough to make out brighter areas in all four corners of the object and once more in the middle.  In the spaces in-between, it glowed with less intensity.  Once the object was out of view from being behind the rock, I immediately drew what I saw on paper and shared it with the event host. Approximately one minute after, in the same area we saw the diamond craft fly from left to right in our view, now I saw three aircrafts following the same route.  I am aware that military aircraft blink with multiple flashes in quick succession, whereas commercial and personal planes blink once.  This is how I came to my conclusion. Moments after we noticed the above mentioned aircrafts, a large bright light appearing red-orange emerged from over the hill we stood below.  The light zoomed quickly over our heads at the height of approximately 1000 ft.  I remember noticing that there was no sound coming from the light. A moment later, following the light, emerged a military jet craft making loud noise as it flew by us.  The jet seemed to be chasing the light.  The light flew straight towards the hills to our other side, and the jet chased it until they could not be seen with my physical sight.

I knew right off the bat it was not a helicopter because I saw multiple helicopters flying around periodically at much lower altitudes.  I also ruled helicopters/other human craft out because of the uncanny movement I observed.  The craft seemed like they were interacting with one another, slowly advancing, and then moving back to their former location. I went and got my brother so that he could witness the crafts as well.  He is a very smart individual and even he did not have an explanation for what he saw.  I then spotted a third craft a little west and directly straight up in the sky.  I went outside to get a better look.  I looked directly up in the sky and the craft slowly positioned itself directly above me.  I stood in awe.  I had a feeling I was about to get abducted, but nothing happened fortunately.  It soon dawned on me that there were at least two more UFOs west of the other three. One of the two western UFOs I saw was extremely bright so I recorded, and took the best evidence I could with my smartphone.  I am overwhelmed with confusion and I want to know more.

I mentioned it to A fiend of mine I had just met.  She pulled out her new phone & began recording video of the bright light I had been observing & taking pics & video of over the last 6-9mts.  My camera didn't pick up on all the other  light activity going on around the bright object..  Through here newer higher powered camera than mine, we were now looking at a stationary craft that had a distinct circular outline that can't be seen with the naked eye.  It seemed to be a large craft with other lights moving either around it, and/ or to & from it.  Some lights seemed to disappear then reappear randomly.  The large distant craft had a steady blinking red light just like a passenger airliner except it was stationary in the sky.  We observed 3-4 solid white lights just behind. As she turned her smartphone into panoramic view & zoomed in even further we could now make out several other odd shaped lights moving in & out or circling the craft high in the sky.

Other people there at the beach were observing the lights as well and remarking that they seemed strange.  The lights appeared to be 5  to 10 miles off the San Diego coast over the ocean due West of La Jolla.  The lowest light of the triangle pattern may have been 5,000 to 7,500 feet in altitude.  The 2 upper lights of the triangle formation were not level, and may have been in the 10,000 to 12,500 altitude range.  The triangle was large and the lights were much brighter in intensity than any aircraft landing lights would have been at that distance.  I tried to t! ake a picture with my cel phone camera but the images did not register.  All of us present observed the light pattern for about 10 minutes, then one seemed to turn off.   I drove off, continuing Southward on Pacific Coast Highway towards home, and when I looked about 10 minutes later the lights were gone.  My thought was the lights may have been some type of signal flares and perhaps the Navy was conducting some sort of training or practice exercise off of the San Diego coast.  I have seen signal flares in the night sky at Camp Pendelton and they slowly descend and weaken as they drop.  These lights did not descend and were at least 10x's brighter or more than any signal flare I've seen.  I've done a couple of Google searches and couldn't find any mention or explanation.   When I came across the other report from ""the pilot"" on Mt Soledad, I realized we had observed the same lights, and decided to file this report.  I do not believe earth has ever been visited by ""extraterrestrials"", I believe there is a man made explanation of  these lights.",2017-04-07T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

My partner and I were arguing because a brand-new, expensive hard drive had just stopped working, and lost valuable information, when suddenly it sounded like a plane was about to crash into the house. As I stood up and demanded, ""Where is that coming from?!,"" an enormous plane flew dead-center over where I had been sitting, swooping lower in front of the window and into the Ilfeld valley.  It looked (and sounded)like a World War II era plane with three engines (protrusions/turbines?) on each wing.  The entire plane was dark (black? gunmetal grey, or dark green?)  The wings were at 90* angles to the body as was the flat squarish tail.  It was less than 200 feet above where I sat, speeding north, and diving even lower in to the valley below the hilltops.   My partner ran to find a camera.  We both were screaming, ""It is going to crash!"" when next we saw it turn upside down.  We watched in shock as it pulled up vertically just before the opposing hills and did a sharp barrel roll to the right (east) like it was out of control.  Then it dove down into the hills toward the ground.  We braced for an explosion.  When there wasn't one, we both feared that it might come back towards us, but saw only a white orb/round light that then darted briefly to the left (northwest)toward the base of the foothills, where it disappeared completely.  I ran outside to watch and try to see more clearly where the plane had gone.  Nothing happened after that, but it left us in a state of excitement and completely baffled.  I'm not sure that what we heard and saw was actually a plane, which is why I am reporting it here.  If it was, it looked exactly like the old WWII bombers:  too large, low and unwieldy to do the kind of aerial maneuvers we witnessed.  The cameras in the backyard had stopped working at this time, but the front camera did catch a large black plane coming off the mesa in front of the house.",2017-04-07T00:00:00,,

I said its maybe a kite and continued walking to the corner, but kept watching the object. As I came to the corner, a tree blocked my view, but as I was able to see it again past the tree, I was shocked to see that it had projected itself in the trajectory of my eyesight and itself approximately 50-100 miles away and on a 45 degree angle that went straight towards space. I tried to grab my camera but didn't want to take my eye off it, and within 5 seconds, it was so tiny that it disappeared into the sky at a steady, but rapid speed.  I went back to the truck and asked the three guys if they had continued watching it after I left and they said no. I speculated it was like the object sensed it was noticed by me and took off when the guys stopped looking and when my vision was blocked by the tree I had passed. I am a average working man and haven't seen anything my whole life except for now two sightings ( including this one) in the last two years and I just turned 40.  Strange thing is I had just left my friends house after telling him a theory about how we as humans are the top predators and think zombies are scary, but if we had a new predator, an alien one, that we would find whatever shape the alien was to be horrifying and our instincts would change to fear the sight of them and that we would become uncivilized and not be able to be in groups, as we would be easily targeted by this new predator that we don't even know exsists yet.  For some reason I think such a horrible race of ""monsters"" exsists in space just waiting forsure numbers to get to a certain point like they have for generations.  Waiting till the earth is full of humans than coming down and harvesting us all spare a few to re- colonize.  Just a theory, but a mortifying one one is reluctant to ponder on.

At 10:30 pm this evening I went outside in my back yard to secure the patio furniture for incoming storms that were predicted.  The rear of my house faces due north.  I looked up into the sky and saw lightning far off in the distance towards the north.   I then noticed two red balls of light traveling from the west  (approximately along the path of I-70) moving to the east at a fairly rapid speed. At first I thought it might be a helicopter, or two.  As they came closer, I heard no sound from any type of engine.  Two lights travelling the same distance apart in the same path.  Red orange in color, not blinking, but solid the entire time. As they came from the west, about the time they were directly behind my home, the lead light turned due north and appeared to gain altitude, fading from view, possibly behind clouds.  The second light followed the exact same path as the first one, and also disappeared. About two to three minutes later, from the south west of my home, and closer to my home, I saw three additional lights, the exact same appearance as the first two.  The first two were closer together, with the third one trailing a bit behind.   I called my wife out to see what I was seeing, and to bring her cell phone to take pictures.  She arrived, and confirmed that she was seeing what I was seeing.  She tried to take pictures, but they did not turn out very well. Again, the three objects followed the same path of the first two, and turned due north, fading away from my view.   No sound of any engine was ever heard, no other color of light was ever seen other than the red/orange solid light color. At first I thought it might be a Japanese lantern display of some kind, but the objects were moving too fast, and the winds were from the northeast, the opposite direction that the objects were moving.  The two separate groups maintained a distinct separation distance from each other, and equal speed.  Hot air Japanese lanterns would not behave this way. Aircraft routinely fly over our home as they move into the landing pattern for St. Louis Int. Airport Lambert Field.   I know what an aircraft looks and sounds like, and how it behaves.

It looked like an orange-ish and red circle with flames coming from the top of it.  It flew quite quickly, at first but then it slowed down, the flame also seemed to slowly be dying down, and after it slowly got smaller, it just disappeared, the last bit of flame went out really quick compared to before, it also seemed way too quick for something that was burning to be put out, but I don’t know much about fire so I might be wrong.  It was silent and didn't leave any trace.  It was only there for a short period of time before it disappeared.  I have recorded a few seconds of it, you can’t see a lot and I didn’t record it going out or it changing speed.

An almond- (or oval-) shaped UFO in the sky in Panama City, Panama, was observed in a direction where no such object was observed for a whole two years prior to June 18, 2017.  Proximity to building provided reference point that the craft was static.  The object generated its own energy source as it was brightly lit.  (It recalled a previous sighting in early childhood in South America observed by the entire neighborhood which also featured an object that was similarly lit.   That object sat up in the sky but slightly higher than the horizon).  This craft was located much higher up, possibly in the Earth’s upper atmosphere.  But it was far closer than a satellite would have been and, again, it did not move.  Stars that evening were also clearly seen and looked like distant dots.   Object also appeared to have a rod-like shaft of light sticking downward out of its belly.  It is not possible to tell whether it was a light beam or a solid part of the craft.  The general impression was similar to that of a wasp in flight — except that the object did not move.  Because the craft’s shape was elongated, it could have well been a transport vehicle.  But it was too far up in the sky to make out any occupants.  It also looked rather large.   Observer does not know how long the object remained in place as it was only seen for an hour, after which the person went to bed.  Observer has seen craft with the naked eye twice before but never in this same area or country.  This object could certainly be described as having the broad characteristics of similar UFO.

I then told her to get my phone and of course by the time she got back and I turned it on and started recording, it was gone but that isn't the end of what I witnessed. A couple of caveats to point out. 1.  This object ""just appeared.""  My chair where I was sitting just happened to be pointing in that direction, so I was basically looking at the area in the sky and it just appeared where as if it where a plane, it would have been seen coming from the left. 2.  When the object disappeared, it didn't just disappeard, it was moving father and father away and then we could no longer see the lights. 3.  No noise.  No sound  4.  The object was up in the sky quite a bit.  About 15 minutes later, an actual plane was taking off, and was about 70% lower than the object, really just right above the horizon. About 30 minutes later directly overhead we seen what seemed to be the same object except for this time it was extremely high in the sky but you could still faintly see the green and red lights. It was so high that you know it couldn't be any sort of tower.  What is odd that a star was sitting right to the left of this object and you could see them both fairly well although the star was much brighter. Cloud cover came in and I could no longer see the object but it was just sitting there for about 20 minutes.  I have no idea if this was the same object or a different object.  I will be on the lookout this evening.  This was our experience.  This is what we saw and I'm just glad I had a witness.

(07/04/2017) 	Last night (07/04/2017) at exactly 9:51 p.m., myself and four of my friends witnessed a UFO sighting in the southern sky south of Yreka, California, during the fireworks display. At first, it was thought to be a high-flying jet liner, but then it stopped and didn’t move. It was a neon green object that appeared to be round, but was to far away to discern its exact shape.  After watching it for a minute or two, it began to make unnatural maneuvers un-like anything any of us had ever seen before (Quick turns, and reversals of direction), then came back to its former spot and was stationary.  It made these sorts of maneuvers three times during the fireworks display. After the last maneuver, the object changed color, from green, to white and red.  It was about the size of the largest visible star, and seemed to be flying in the upper atmosphere at about a 45-degree angle from where we stood.  We commented to each other that it was probably watching the fireworks displays in Yreka and Lake Siskiyou (a lake immediately west of Mt. Shasta). About 30 seconds after the Grand Finale (10:10 p.m.) the object turned a bright red.  It began moving slowly in a northwestward direction and we lost view of it as it passed behind a tree.  Emerging from the other side of the tree, the glowing red object began to pick up speed, and made an abrupt turn westward.  It then darted from that position (still about a 45-degree angle), and in about two or three seconds disappeared over the mountains on the horizon.  This occurred about 10:12 p.m. It was too fast and too high in the atmosphere to have been a drone.  When it sped west over the horizon, it was at super-sonic speed, yet did not have a tail, or light trail behind it like meteors have. I contribute this in hopes that others may also have saw it, and captured it on their cell-phone cam.  It was so distracting, we paid more attention to it than we did the fireworks show. If it caught our attention that much, others must have surely witnessed it also.  I’m anxious to see if it makes the newspapers or local news channels.   It was a life changing experience.",2017-07-07T00:00:00,41.7511,-122.6727

I watched it for a while as it hovered and then it disappeared or went behind the haze or thin clouds.  My only thought was someone could start a forest fire on the East Ridge.  I went indoors and returned to the outside a few minutes later and saw a different type of object (see other report) in about the same location at a slightly lower elevation.

I observed a very strange flying object on July 5th at 1235am (I was so awe struck by the encounter, I immediately noted the time) over Portland, Oregon.  The object appeared to be heading in a general North to South direction and it followed, as far as I can tell, a linear path.  I originally took note of it because it was very bright.  The light was orange in color, looking like a planet might in the early evening sky, though it was even brighter and was about twice the size of what a planet would look like.  The light flickered.   I first spotted it at about 30 degrees above the Northern horizon.  I thought it was odd because it was so bright.  At first I wondered why a plane or helicopter would have such a bright orange light on at that altitude.  I live close to a level 1 trauma center so at first I thought that it might be a life flight helicopter flying to the hospital.  I’ve seen them with their landing/illumination lights on and they can be quite bright.  I couldn't hear a sound and I never did.  I continued to watch it, trying to figure out what it was.  As it got closer, I thought I could see a red navigation light.   However, as the object moved overhead and to the west of me, the red light that I thought was a navigation light appeared to actually be a red shaft of light extending downwards from the bottom of the glowing object. I thought this was really odd.  I’ve never seen anything like it.  It was strange enough to get the hairs on the back of my neck standing up. After the object had passed over my head (maximum height was about 75 degrees), at which point the object was very bright, the object rapidly began to get fainter and fainter until it looked similar to what a satellite would look like flying across the night sky.  Then it faded out and disappeared 35-40 degrees above the Southern horizon.  Total time of the viewing was between 60-90 seconds.   It was by far the most bizarre thing I have ever seen and I can't for the life of me figure out what it was or even surmise what it may have been.  Although I was positive what I had seen was not the ISS, just to check I looked up if the space station was going to make a pass over Portland that night, and I discovered it would be visible over Portland at 4:38am—almost 4 hours after my sighting.  I have seen the ISS a number of times and this was much brighter.   I can't for the life of me figure out what it was.",2017-07-07T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

As I went out the door, facing east, I noticed a very bright light to the northeast rising upward, about a third of the way off the horizon, initially almost exactly the same speed and curved trajectory a rocket launch would follow to the southeast.  I was upset because I thought I had missed the initial launch.  I tried to shoot a digital movie of the bright light, but it did not come out as far as I can see.  I visually followed the light as it climbed and got smaller and smaller, finally vanishing at high altitude.  I was puzzled because the light was an intense white color, and usually rockets at low altitude display a bright orange flame, as I was thinking I had been watching the Falcon-9 launch, and I’ve seen many launches from the Cape over the last 10-years, and what I thought was the launch just didn’t add up.   A few minutes later, a 7:37 pm (1937 hours) I saw the bright orange flame of the Falcon-9 booster appear just to the southwest, as it climbed and started to leave a contrail as it went into the upper atmosphere.  What really puzzled me, is that I had the impression that the bright light seen a few minutes earlier had been moving a whole lot faster than the rocket after it gained some altitude, I’d say about 4-times faster.  I know they prohibit aircraft in the immediate launch area, and the bright light flew directly through it only a few minutes prior to the actual launch.  I thought maybe an Air Force jet had left the skid strip on afterburner or something, but I was in the Air Force and never saw an afterburner as bright as that.

The sky was blue, and without any clouds.  The Cessna flew at an altitude that suggested it would land at nearby Fullerton airport.  It was perhaps about one quarter mile south of my location. Just a moment after looking at the Cessna airplane, I noticed a mostly round shaped object, about one third the length of the Cessna in size, was flying just slightly higher and behind the Cessna plane.  The object was colored mainly white and black, and had a single and very bright white light near its top that flashed regularly, like a beacon or strobe. The object flew on at a slower speed than the Cessna, and I followed it for about one minute as it flew farther away and farther South than the track the Cessna had taken.  When the object was then just a tiny point in the clear sky, it suddenly just vanished.  I watched for another minute or so, but it never came back. The best thing I can compare the object to would be the flying ‘drone balls’ that are in the Tom Cruise Science-Fiction film called “Oblivion”.  The object flew and looked much like those round drones in that movie, though I estimate it to have been much larger in size than those in the film were.  Maybe the size of a Smart Car or Fiat 500. I believe whatever this object was, that it was a remotely controlled vehicle.  Whether it was of an alien origin, or a secret military device, I can only speculate at this point.

On Friday, June 9, 2017, my two friends and were at Smokemont Campground just outside Cherokee, NC, in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park.  We were not staying there, but had driven there from a neighboring town where we live, specifically to see the synchronized fireflies event that happens in late May, or early April, every year. We parked and decided to walk along the path along the creek to first see the “glow worms” that my friends discovered the year before in the root bank of a tree up the hill that had a small spring in it.  Tiny glow worms, but they're nonetheless, cool. We walked back to the campground, found the darkest spot away from the camp fires, set up our chairs, and waited for the show (synchronized fireflies event).  The turnout was low, probably because it was cool, and there was a full moon (strawberry moon, in fact). I had just gotten back from a short walk down the road, and when I returned, I noticed that my friends were looking up at something in the sky.  Naturally, I looked up and there in the sky was a white glowing object, seemed to be round in shape.  At first it looked like a giant firefly but it was too high up in the sky.  The first thing I noticed, was there were no blinking lights like an airplane.  It continued in a line, then stopped, then moved forward, then seems to turn on its side like a tire rolling down a road and disappeared.  The whole encounter lasted 20-40 seconds.  There was no sound and I would have expected a sound since it was that close to us.  The time was around 10:30 pm. Two of us early saw the object stop and hover. We left and the park and headed home.  On the way, several cars were stopped in both directions, and we could see an elk on the side of the road.  We thought that was all that there was but as we passed, we saw an elk calf was down in the road, likely hit by a car.   Being that we were from the area and the others were likely tourists, my friend called her friend that works in the park to determine who we should call about the incident.  He stated that park officers patrol all hours and that they would know in short order.  I am adding this one detail for one reason.  When my friend told her friend on the phone that we had seen what seemed to be a UFO, he then relayed a similar experience that he and a coworker had in the park just last Saturday.  He described a white object that moved through the night sky, then stopped and moved again, etc. I am a 57 year-old female.  I have never seen or reported a UFO.  I do not drink or use drugs and I do not believe in aliens. I know what I saw and from my account, this was a real UFO experience.",2017-06-15T00:00:00,35.5161,-83.2733

Tumbling, silver-grey cylinder. 30 degrees off horizon. Eight miles distant.  Steady course & speed Note:  This is the same report that I sent to another UFO reporting service in July, 2015, but this is an update of sorts.  The reason I'm sending it to you, is because I've remembered some other details about the sighting.  Specifically, the date and distance from the object.  It was either October 2003, (I think this was it), or October 2004.  Also, the object was between me and `Little Prospect Mountain,' so it was not more than eight miles away. This experience disturbed me greatly and has stayed with me.  So much so that I've tried to learn the proper way to investigate a sighting and to study any physical evidence that might be found.  Also, after hearing on a television show how some people, when they've had a spectacular sighting like mine, (the Phoenix lights), simply got in their car and drove on and didn't discuss it among themselves.  They described it as a temporary amnesia.  There are other examples.  I think that may have happened to me, as well, as I waited until 2015 to even start thinking seriously about what I saw before finally reporting it. Here is my report:  This was late October, hunting season.  It was dusk.  The sun was low on the western horizon.  I was staying in my camper in the trees.  After dinner, I took a cup of coffee and walked out to the main dirt road, about one hundred (100), yards away, out of the trees.  This is a fairly isolated place in the Wind River Mountains, about thirty (30) miles northwest of South Pass, Wyoming.  There are high, granite peaks to the north that stretch all the way up to Yellowstone.  Farson, the closest hamlet, is about sixty (60) miles to the west-southwest. It was a cloudless evening; a very beautiful sunset.  A movement in the sky caught my attention and I looked up and saw a cylinder tumbling across the sky, end-over-end.  It was gray to dull silver in base color but shown gold-red as it reflected the sunlight.  It had a ratio of about eight-to-one (8 to 1), diameter to length and seemed to have a raised rim of some kind on one end, about a sixth of the way along its axis.  At first, my mind could not grasp what I was seeing and I thought, `Well, it must be a booster stage from a rocket.'   (The following was not in my original report):  I didn't get excited.  I should have.  This is not normal. Only later did I recognize that if it were a booster rocket, it would have crashed into the ground and from its apparent size, it would have been at least five hundred (500) feet in length.  To my knowledge, no one has ever built a booster rocket of that size.   I observed it moving from the south-southeast to the north-northwest.  It never deviated its course.  I never altered its altitude.  It simply tumbled end-over-end as it moved across a blue, evening sky.  Then it disappeared over the mountains.   I made no notes of my sighting that evening but rather went to bed early as I planned on hunting the next morning.  The strange thing was, that night, I had a nightmare that terrified me.  I do not use the word `terrify' lightly.  I never have nightmares but this one scared me as I have never been scared before, or since. In it, something came over my camp and hovered.  In the dream, I knew `they', (whoever `they are'), were coming.  and I thought, `now wait.  They can't do that!  There are more people in the campground a half a mile away.  They'll be seen.'  But never-the-less, they stopped over my camper and shined an ultra bright light down on it, bathing the whole area around my camper for fifty (50) feet.  Then two entities appeared outside my door.  They were dressed in tight fitting suits, like the old usher uniforms that people use to wear in movie theaters and they had on rimless caps of a dark gray color. I couldn't keep them out....   and that's all I remember.  A few days later I made some notes on this dream and my observation.  I haven't been able to find those notes so a few years ago, I wrote out what I remembered, one more time.  I have never had a dream like that again.  I have never had another sighting of any kind. The following was not in my original report: It befuddles me that I was so unmoved by this episode.  Now, I'm not even sure that I made those notes, `a few days later.'  This isn't normal and it's bugging the hell out of me!  I'm a reasonably intelligent person, (I think).  I ran a college level welding program for twenty-two (22) years and currently work as a Certified Welding Inspector, (when I choose to), so I'm bewildered by my behavior in the aftermath of this sighting.  Anyway, I hope you can use the information in my report to help solve this riddle and I would certainly like some answers if any are forthcoming.  Thanks.

The first UFO I ever saw was in Kentucky just below the south tip of Illinois.  I was in a 20 ton waterfowl blind floating in 15 feet of rising waters of two connecting major Midwest rivers. I was looking up and duck hunters do that all the time. This sighting happened on January 28, 2006.  1,000 bobbing goose and duck decoys were at eye level.  In the Northwest blue sky there were two lanes of fluffy white clouds.  To the left of the first lane an object to stare at came into my view.  This oval shaped object was flying slowly like a big jet would at 30 thousand + or - feet in altitude.  There were clear edges to this oval.  There were no wings or tail structure at all.  A white cloudy texture was the only color.  Like it was using self administered camo just like the clouds ahead as it neared them. There was no shine at all. The UFO (with a white cloud-like camo) as an elongated but wide oval went behind the first lane of white clouds with the blue sky behind it.  The opening of the lane had a space about what your forefinger would have if you held it up.  This pill shaped object DID NOT come out of the first lane of clouds.  I stared for over a minute and it would not have taken but seconds for it to show in the blue lane between the clouds.  This UFO had actually stopped flying behind the first row of clouds!  Two men were on either side of me in the big floating blind.  The owner and his son.  There were two hunters in a boat coming over for a visit. I said nothing about that UFO to them. I caught a ride with the boat to change blinds as my long time friend had asked for me to move to another floating blind in a flooded corn field.  I told him what I had seen 20 minutes ago because he had seen a night time UFO event below a midwest ciy in the seventies. Two weeks later, after my waterfowl hunting trip.  A far western state resident, talking to the host of our nation's most listened to radio show, had seen a UFO's clone of my sighting!  It was an elongated oval shape with a cloud-like whitish color!    Yours truly, albeit an old report from Me!   _________________",2017-04-20T00:00:00,36.9744,-88.9965

It did not seem to be moving at first.  It had three lights on the underneath: two were a greenish tint and one was more of a regular white/yellow color turning on and off at random times slowly.  The one turning on and off seemed to move around like it was on a rotator.

I had my window down and it made only a quiet sound. Then, on the tip of the 'wings' two more lights lit up (two on each end).  They were brighter than the three lights in the underneath middle of the craft.  We thought it was a very large drone after trying to rationalize.  It was a long skinny rectangle shape, but I saw no blades or anything.  If it was, it was a drone that was 15-20 feet or more. It was terrifying and my fiancé and I are very logical.  We asked the Indian man who picked us up in a golf cart to take us from the parking lot to the front if he knew of any drones the Indians had, and he acted concerned and said he did not.  He said the head Indians may have something like that for protection, but I honestly thought it had to be military.

I was at a friend's house sitting on his front porch busy street busy area.  Talking about random stuff video games, etc..  He was like hey look at that, I'm like what ... look right there he pointed out a weird flashing object kind of strobish and similar to a plane flash but much brighter.  I said that's a plane he said no look how it's moving.  From where we were sitting he had a telephone pole to our right on an angle so we eyed it up with the pole to see which way it's moving if it even is moving and sure enough a couple of seconds after we did that it started moving. In between the bright flashes, within a mili second of each one, we saw it in one spot then wam it was at least 1,000 yards (from our eyes, could be miles in the sky) but away from its original position.  We had a hard time keeping up with it in between flashes and moving irradic from left to right up And down.  Nothing that a plane helicopter or drone in today's world that's known to the public can move with such speed and agility.  Literally between its flashes, which was absolutely in under a second, it was in a totally different spot far away from the last position.  We watched do this for at least 15-20 minutes moving around.  Then it started moving a little farther away from us south east direction but still very visible with the flashes so bright.  But now it would flash then go dark completely no lights and show up in a totally different spot then it was like before.  We knew by then it wasn't a normal  plane especially because there are a bunch of planes flying in the sky and you see their regular flashes . So we were asking ourselves how do these planes not see see this and move out the way or change course, but the way this thing was moving, it couldn't be near them at the speed in which it moved.  Then, after a minute or so of it going dark, a flashing, then dark again, moving to different spots.  It started flashing and rising up and just hovered while flashing.  Then lit up solid blue or white kind of like a floodlight, but nothing projecting down like you see with other common flood lights or search lights on commercial equipment, it just lit up whatever this thing was.  And for the way it reflected off the object it had to be a light colored object (white light with grey object projects a blueish color). It was fully lit up for about a good 25 seconds went completely dark again then within a mili second we saw the flash of it farther away from where it was lit up which is farther away from where we were.  So more south central south east .  The only thing out that way that it could be as high as it was a project that bright of a light is fort dix combined base  no other airports or private places for such a thing in that direction then fort dix joint base. And in that direction depending on which part of the base is a given 30 to 80 miles away from us.  So that thing was bright . After it headed farther away and disappeared me and my friend went to go get food took about 10 minutes or a little over got back to his house sat on the porch ate an we were still talking about it we never seen anything like it definitely unexplainable when all of sudden we saw it again back in the same area where it was before moving all over and flashing but did not light up solid or hover.  Just kept flashing then went dark and it was gone.  We sat outside for another 20 minutes looking at the sky, never saw it again or anything like it, just saw your normal plane passing by . It was truly amazing how it moved liked that in a blink of an eye.  A night to remember never saw anything like this here before hopefully someone else saw this too and didn't blow it off as a plane it was anything, but I know the area very well and seen everything from regular helicopters to police helis, blackhawks  An your military crafts fly by all the time with lights on and off day and night  just as common as your regular plane and you can hear these far away aswell as a very lit up landscape from homes ect so to be that bright to outshine everything else wow .  . This thing had no sound and moved like no other craft known to the public could truly remarkable experience I will never forget.

It was a summer night in Texas in 1972, I was 11 years old at the time.  I remember very  vividly the local news channel my parents were watching saying there were strange sightings of flashing lights in the sky around town that were unexplained.  It didn’t seem very alarming to my parents at the time so being kids, we were not very concerned, just kind of excited to see them. 	My sister and I went outside to see if we could get a glimpse of any of these so called lights in the sky.  She was 6 at the time so of course she followed me.  We went out to the back yard to see if we could spot any, it was around 5:00 PM, so the sun was still out.  It was about 15 minutes and we didn’t see anything so we decided to sit on the brick fence and watch for a few more minutes, nothing. 	We were just about ready to jump off the fence when we spotted 3 flashing lights in the distance, probably no more than a few miles away.  They were still and were like flashing orbs.  We got excited and jumped off the fence (it was a small brick fence) and were going to go inside to tell my parents when all of a sudden we heard a humming from right above us.  At that point we were in the middle of the back yard.  I looked up and to my amazement, saw a ribbon of round flashing lights not 50 feet above us. It was a disk, sort of like the flying saucer you see in comic strips.  The lights were different colors and they were flashing around in circles.  It must have been no more than a few seconds when I looked at my sister to see if she was seeing the same thing.  She had fallen to the ground, passed out. I was scared and shook her to see if she was OK.  She opened her eyes and I heard a whoosh. I looked up and the saucer and gone.  Both of us were shocked and couldn’t talk. She got u! p to run in the house to tell Mom and Dad.  I stopped  her and said, “Don’t tell Mom and Dad, they won’t believe us.  This is just our secret”.  Surprisingly she did not say anything that night, or even the next few days.  I had dreams about that evening for days, not bad dreams at all, just like it was watching over us. 	Years went past and we didn’t tell a soul about that night.  We have two sisters and a brother and kept this all to ourselves.  She was very young so I thought she just forgot.  I had so many dreams about that night and after all the years went by, I convinced myself it was just a dream. 	Thirty five years passed, it was Thanksgiving and we were talking about when we were kids.  I mentioned a dream I had about seeing a flying saucer when we lived in Texas.  My sister flushed, turned as white as a ghost and said she had the same dream.  She explained her and I were sitting on the back yard fence looking at the skies when she saw flashing lights in the distance.  She remembers running and looking up seeing some kind of saucer with different colored lights at the bottm and passing out after seeing it.  She remembers me waking her up saying, “Don’t tell Mom and Dad, they won’t believe us.” 	Did we both have the same dream?  I don’t think so.  I believe what we saw was real and deep in my heart, I know there are peaceful beings out there watching us.  Maybe knowing our hearts and letting us know we are not alone.

I was driving home from the nursing ( R.N) program at our local college,where I was enrolled in my second year of the two year program.  I live in a pretty rural area.  I was driving home after class had ended for the day right at about 3:30 in the afternoon (alone in my car) with moderate traffic on the freeway.  I was south bound on Interstate 5.  As you head south you can see for miles ahead,( probably 20) miles or so.  We live in a valley, where three sides of us, north, east and west have mountains,  Mt Shasta (north) Mt Lassen ( east) and the trinity mts to the west. to the south is  rolling foot hills,not mountains, and you can see foothills approximately 15 miles to the south of us where a town called Red Bluff is located.  It was a warm, very clear day with the only clouds, way high in the sky. As I drove south out of the corner of my eyes just slightly to my right (west) and out in front of me (south), probably about a 1000 ft off the ground and maybe 8 to 10 miles out ahead of me, were 3 absolutely huge UFO's, huge !!!  They were a dull silver, kind of grey,silver but not shiny at all.they were stacked like a pyramid shape,one up top and the other 2 below it,evenly spaced,pretty much a perfect pyramid.it wasn't one ufo though,it was three separate ones.they were cigar shaped,but the ends were blunt,they didn't taper to points.they were all sitting perfectly still,they weren't spinning,there were no lights,no windows,they were just sitting perfectly still.Im amazed I didn't drive off the freeway and wreck,I had to tilt my head up slightly and put my face kind of close to my winsheild,so I could get a good view of all 3 at once,and I was just staring up,I don't remember really looking at the road.I thought to my self'oh my God,is anyone else seeing these??'. There was no sound,I had my windows down due to the warm weather and I was driving a car with no air conditioner,no sound ! at all,no movement at all, there were no heat trails,that I co! uld see anyway,no air disturbance at all,they weren't bobbing  around d at all..they were just sitting there,I thought at the time they were probably Around 2000 feet long each, they were all 3 exactly the same looking.after staring up for probably 10 to 15 seconds, it seemed longer,it  was almost like everything  was in slow motion. out of my left peripheral vision I could see something coming up from behind me, fast,I didn't realize for a second that it was lights coming up behind me, I glanced over to my left and saw a highway patrol car,a forestry Jeep,and a Sheriffs car all with their lights on,but no sirens going, they were flying past all day he traffic,heading south,probably around 90 mph, at least,they were driving in the dirt that divides the freeway lanes.the freeway( I 5)runs north to south,two lanes each direction,with a dirt center dividing the lanes its about 35foot  wide or so,they were all three lined up,lights flashing, south in the dirt. I only glanced away for a ! split second,and I thought to myself, "" wow!! Someone else does see them,I'm not crazy ""!!. When I looked back over at the ufos,they were exactly the same,nothing  had changed, for about 3 to 5 seconds anyway, because then all at once,all three at the same time.its hard to explain.It was like they jerked just a tiny bit all at once toward the ground,not much,maybe 50 feet,I don't know, then bam they were all gone,you didn't see them take off or leave, they just disappeared,I don't know if they cloaked themselves or actually left right then,but they were gone.no nothing. I called the police and the airport in my town and in the little town south of us( Red Bluff) and asked if anyone reported seeing anything,they all said no.Ive always believed in UFOs,but I had never seen one,let alone three,broad day light,clear skies.man,It felt almost dreamlike afterwards,like I was in a daze for a couple of days after.I don't care what anyone says,I know what I saw,they were re! al, they weren't man made,we have nothing that huge,that can s! it perfe ctly still for that long, no noise at all,no heat trails,they weren't clouds,they were solid objects.I stare at the sky constantly hoping to see them again.I wish I had a cell phone back then,man I'd do anything to go back and have a cell or a camera to take a picture,I can still see them in my head.Ive asked many,many people when they're with me in the car in that same spot driving the same path again,I'll point out how high up they were and about how far away they were and I'll point out a  cloud in that same area (as close to the size of the ufos)that I can find, and I ask them, "" how long to you think that is???""  Most just say I'm not sure,but huge,but when I asked  my boyfriend and my aunt who are both retired from the Navy,one being a pilot and both serving on aircraft carriers, we were  in the car( me with them at separate times) and I asked them for their best guesstament, on the size?? my boyfriend said his best guess was at least a mile wide, but less th! an 2 miles. my aunt who was Navy for 25 years,worked in the Pentagon and was a highly decorated officer and pilot, she said her best guess was a mile to 7000 foot long.I know that seems crazy, but I swear they were that huge. I live on 44 acres now we're I have a perfect view of were they were in the sky that day,when I'm out with our horses or cows or just working the ranch,my eyes are always searching the sky for them.now I have a cell phone and a back up camera with me in my purse and in my glovebox at all times.if I'm ever lucky enough to see them again I will have a picture,well I hope I would,honestly I'm not sure if I would have taken one,I almost felt like I couldn't look away from them or like if I did they'd be gone and I wouldn't know if they were real or not.lol.  But I don't care what anyone says,I know what I saw,they were real,they weren't reflections,they weren't clouds,and they were massive,we have nothing close to what I saw,not on this planet,not yet.Ive t! old anyone and everyone I know about what I saw, I guess they ! believe me, they say they do, but they also kind of look at me like, uh hu ??!! I understand though, even though I've always believed in UFOs,once you see them yourself,it's just totally different,because you know without a doubt,they are real. I wish people could see what's in my minds eye, because even though it was 17 years ago,I can see it in my head like it was yesterday. Anyway,thank you for letting me tell you my story.you don't have to contact me,but if you have any questions at all or can help me find any evidence of that day,please feel more than free to call ,m sage, or write me any time.

From a distance my mind made me think it was a stop light.  But there was no stop light in that area, this was a long straight section of highway leading to the main gate at Edwards AFB.   As we got closer to this green orb looking object our conversation stopped as we were trying in our minds to explain what we were seeing.   But we had no explanation.  We only told a few people who just laughed it off. I've never seen anything like that since then and still in my mind can come up with no explanation for what I saw that night.

I've kept quiet and kept this to myself for many years, but I did tell some members within my family.  Not sure this could be classed as a UFO but I like to think it's classed as a UFO encounter I had back in 2005. It all started back in 2005, when I went on a school trip to a pantomime.  My cousin and my friend also went on this trip to we basically could decide to go or not and us three decided to go.   We went on the coach from school to Aldershot and to Princes Hall where the pantomime was being heled and it was on for three hours and ended at 7:00 and it was really dark outside.   Once the pantomime finished, we went back on the coach and as I sat down and looked out the coach window I saw two balls of light shaped like circles they were a yellow/gold colour and the first light went horizontal and the second light vertical and as they went those directions it formed letter L. The two balls of light disappeared at a very quick speed and faded out into the dark I never saw them again afterwards I looked at everybody else on the coach and nobody else saw the two balls of light apart from two other people and unfortunately I never had a camera so I did not take any photos which is a pain really. Aldershot is a military area and there are army barracks there but no aircraft the nearest airport is Farnborough Airport and there are lots of aircraft there but I highly doubt the balls of light I saw had anything to do with the army or came from Farnborough Airport. I could draw what I saw but my drawing is not very good and I can't draw very well, but I would like to draw what I saw would be better if it was done in Photoshop or some drawing software.   My cousin and friend never saw the lights, only I did, but I wanted to share this because I like to think I saw a UFO it was something rather strange when look back at this now.

Then I thought maybe the lights we saw were chinese lanterns.  It should also be noted that our cellphone batteries drained approximately 20% during this encounter which lasted approximately 15 minutes total.  I am prior military and law enforcement officer and have never seen lights like these before. There is an anomaly in the video that is a white light that dances around.  That is what I assume is glare from the streetlight. ",2017-03-10T00:00:00,47.129400000000004,-104.8734

I’m a truck driver who drives almost weekly drives up and down the Alaska Highway in Canada and on the night of Saturday February 25th, I had a very strange experience/sighting driving north on the Alaska Highway as I was approaching the BC/Yukon border. 	When climbing a small hill, the corner of my eye caught an object giving off a very large white light, I would say in the sky it looked like a tennis ball compared to the other stars in the sky and what made me take notice is that appeared to be falling from the sky much like a meteorite.  I became a bit worried and actually almost made a full stop on the highway because it looked like this thing was going to fall into the hood of my truck.  As I was close to coming to a full stop, this object changed its trajectory from dropping down, to moving forward, so I sped back up to highway speed and watched this object  as best as I could while driving up the highway. It would constantly move at a slow but steady speed from my left to my right and lower itself and be near the tree tops of the forest.  Almost every time I got close to going downhill to a creek crossing the craft would do this, and I would lose sight of it from going to the bottom of the valley, and when I climbed back up in the truck to the hill top, the craft is back to my left and the same process repeated itself about half a dozen times of being to my left, rising and lowering itself then slowly drift over to my right and drop to the tree tops, almost like it was going to land.  It maneuvered a lot like a helicopter but there were no flashing lights, it was just a solid large bright white light and everything was silent, and if near a helicopter, the sound would’ve been so loud you could feel the vibrations from the sound of its motor. I followed the light for over 80km and reached a rest stop area about 10km from a town called Watson Lake, just inside the Yukon.  I pulled into the rest stop with the idea of stopping and getting out of my truck to try to listen for any sounds.  The rest stop is on a bit of a mountain ledge and when I pulled my rig in and stopped, the craft was out in the valley lowered and it was at eye level!!!  As quick as I could I opened the door and stepped down to the ground, and by the time I turned back to look in the valley, it had vanished.  I heard no sounds at all, and the time it took me to step out of the truck and turn to look out only took 2 seconds, if that and this craft was gone.",2017-03-10T00:00:00,60.1167,-128.8

I took my second camera with a long zoom lens and looked at it.  The image seen was two orange balls, twinkling, and something connecting them, which appeared to be twinkling.  At no time did the object move either up or down or in any direction.   At first my wife thought it was a light placed on top of Dover Castle, however it was the wrong direction and coastal haze prevented viability further than a few miles out to sea.  The object continued to twinkle for a period of about 5 minutes.   I took a number of photographs, the object appeared to be changing shape, with the two objects seeming to merge into one, which had a distinct saucer shape.  After which the object seemed to disappear.   My initial landscape photos were taken with a different camera, fitted with a wide angled lens.  On studying these pictures, there appears to be a disturbance in the sky where the object appeared.   I take pictures in both jpeg and raw.  The images I am sending you are jpeg images which are slightly over exposed due to the brightness of the sun.  The raw files I have contain about three times the information of jpegs, these have not been touched so far.",2017-06-09T00:00:00,,

There was no vehicle and I am certain that it did not leave the road as this is cattle country with fencing coming all the way up to the shoulder.  There is only one dirt driveway in this area, but I was not upon that.  There are no trees or bushes along this road to hide a car.  The vehicle did not pass nor turn around, it was just gone.

Also there was a vehicle coming from the opposite direction at the moment these lights disappeared. That vehicle continued on as would be expected. Now the extra weird part.  There was no way I would put this into the body of the report.  I have both heared and read of unusual animal sitings occuring at the same momet as a (UFO) siting, esp dog-like animals.  Well...just in the seconds prior to this vehicle's disapperance, an animal that appeared to be a hairless coyote (Mange?) was observed at the side of the road, sitting on its hind legs sort of leaning against a fence post as if waiting for something, maybe just to cross the road. It was at this very spot that the headlights ""extinguished"".  I am quite certain that the ""vehicle"" did not pull over here.  As I said I could see clearly in this moon. I am not asserting that this animal was anything but what I perceived it to be..but...it just looked so odd and was at the exact spot the ""phenomenon lights"" disappeared.

She was very enthusiastic about it and exclaimed “Isn’t it neat!”   The orbs were approximately 1000 feet above ground level, moving fast (more than a hundred plus miles per hour, I estimate) and mostly stayed together in a series of loose formations, yet there were some lone “stragglers” that would come along after groupings of 5 or 10 had moved along together.   They were luminous, but perhaps not self-luminous, as they may have been reflecting light from the setting sun.  The orbs also appeared to be “pulsing” light.   We live within about 4 miles of Reagan National Airport and the Pentagon; so, the direction they were traveling would seem to have taken them near, slightly south, of both locations.   I took a short video of the sighting with my iPhone.

On April 8, 2017, I was standing on an open deck of a cruise ship headed to San Juan, Puerto Rico, from Grenada in the Caribbean Sea.  At 5:28 PM, EST, I began taking pictures of the sunset over the ocean.  I continued to take numerous photos until 6:31 PM. Later that evening as I was reviewing my photos, I was shocked to see an object in a frame that was taken at 6:16 PM.  It appeared to be hovering on the water.  It was iridescent green, hat shaped, and upon zooming in on the picture I could see bump like ridges.  In subsequent frames, but not all, it appeared again higher up in the sky in different positions - several times in an orb shape, and once changing shape to what I would describe as a three quarter uneven circle with clear indentations. I showed the photos to the ship’s photographer in search of a logical explanation, thinking it must have been a lens flash from my camera.  But he explained that it did not have the characteristics of same or any reflection from the sun when it appeared on the water, as it was a distinct shape.  Additionally, I showed the photos to a ship’s officer.  He replied that it looked alien in nature. The next morning I heard that some fellow passengers were baffled over observing something that seemed to be “darting” over the ocean the night before but they could not capture it on film. Sunday – April 16, 2017, 8:00 PM, EST, AHC (American Heroes Channel) aired a program called “UFOs: The Lost Evidence.”  The entire segment was devoted to the theory, supported by evidence, some from the military, that the oceans are used as bases for UFOs.  Two images shown in the television segment resembled two of my photos.  One was the hat shape with ridges.  Another was an object found on the bottom of the ocean suspected to be a spacecraft – that shape resembled one of my photos of the object when it was in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  The source of this report attempted to send photos to NUFORC, but they do not open, or perhaps were deleted from the e-mail.  We have requested that she try again.

It had been the fifth time this type of UFO has come to our area, which is our back yard.  The difference has been its size and distance to My home.  Every appearance, has drawn it closer and larger than the last one.  The first sighting was on 30 December 2016 @ 2300 hours.  It appeared and traveled down the street and above My neighbor's house across the street, then it came over mine.  It was so close I could have hit it with a baseball easily.  The neighbor in questioned moved from the fear of the incident.  This first one was saucer shape, reddish/orange, pulsating as it revolted, silently, eventually speeding incredibly fast over head and east off of Hwy 87.   The next two were on 26 January and 8 February, 2017.  These two were very similar in size, though larger than the first on 30 December 2016.  The one on 26 January 2017 appeared at 2145 hours, with three major reddish/orange lights equal distant apart, with a diamond like object trailing it behind and below the craft.  It diamond shape figure eventually joint the major part of the craft from underneath, then flow away as it traverse the trees at a distance.  The next one, on 8 February was huge, yet silent as well.  It didn't create no sound or disturbance of the atmosphere.  It remained steady state for approximately 45 minutes, if not more, because I was lost in its beauty.  This one too hard the three reddish/orange glow of lights, equally distant from each other and a trailing diamond shaped object.  The only difference with this observation was that the craft was larger than the last and the diamond shaped object moved more distal from the main object and freely over the neighboring homes and streets and tree lines.  The observation was the 11 April 2017, and without a doubt, the largest ever observed, and not just by Me, but by My entire family.  I've waited a long time to be vindicated by this current sighting, because all the others were seen by Me and when reported to My family, it was received rather unappreciated.  Then this sighting! occurre d and I was vindicated.  Like I said this one was the largest of them all, were every detail could be observed by everyone.  It too had the three reddish/orange lights equally distant, the bottom base could be seen perfectly, which demonstrated were the diamond shaped craft would descend from and the full range of what else there was underneath the UFO.  The bottom part, as I said, had the diamond shaped craft, along with what appeared to be a silvery bracket holding it in place, with some lighting as well.  You could see the way the edges of the UFO curved upward, all the way around.  The top seemed like a shimmering light blue glow about it. Once again, it was silent, and I expected some sound, considering the size of this UFO. The size, without question, had two be 3 and half times the size of My house, because as it traveled over it. It had extend equally on both ends, which would make it over 3 times 76 feet in diameter, since My home is 76 feet long.  Making it more than 275 feet in diameter. The only thing I question id why now? Why these recent visits to My area, and almost the exact same area.  Truth be told, since moving out to this area in 2005, I've since UFOs land near by, even to the extent of leaving circles in My back yard.  Some time floating between My property and My neighbors, but never this large or this close.  There must be something going on around here, if not with Me, since I've had several experiences in My entire life with these things, and for generations apparently.

I have always been fascinated with all things space and love looking at stars, especially on clear nights.  In the distance was what I would call an ""orange ball of light/sphere"", traveling at a very slow rate of speed from left to right. Thinking back now, I would place it somewhere around 15,000-20,000 ft in the air, and miles away.  It moved slowly enough for us to visibly see it, and track the slow progress (pointing at it with my finger and following the path).  With a few minutes having past it finally shot at high rate of speed at a completely different angle and disappeared.  We were both in a state of amazement and shock, and as a 9 year old full of questions. For the next 6 months following this event I experienced a trance-like sleepwalking state.  It would happen late at night, and got so worrisome that my parents took me in to see a specialist/psychologist.  The best description I can give of what I experienced is being a ""passenger""...everything visually moving in extremely slow motion, while at the same time hearing what seemed to be a thousand voices (in a frantic manner)...what I would describe as ""chatter"".  Not being able to make out anything in detail, but remembering it being very upsetting while I was in the sleepwalking state.  Often a female or softly spoken voice seemed to be planted directly in my head reassuring me that everything would be okay and not to worry.  As I had come to learn from my parents the next day they would describe my demeanor as starting in a comatose state, although walking around, and then out of nowhere break into frantic screaming and tears, but unable to wake me from it. After months of seeing the specialist nothing seemed to change, and then all of a sudden it just stopped.  I had never felt that sensation before, but when I was 17 years old (1991, living in Columbus, OH) I felt an odd sense of deja vu late one evening, although awake this time.  The sensation felt a bit like telepathy, I heard the same ""chatter"", and for what seemed to be 15-20 seconds I was once again a ""passenger"".  Since I was awake I tried to make sense of what I was feeling, but it seemed far beyond any sense of normal comprehension.  Since then I haven't experienced anything similar, but throughout the years have experienced dreams that seem more like visions, and as of late have experienced the beginning stages of what could be considered Astral Projection while meditating.

The light from the sun descending in the west reflected off of it.  I reached the convenience store and went inside, came out, and it was still there. I was pretty scared as I drove back home. When I arrived, my roommate and his brother, who lived in the house next door, were out in front of our house also watching it.  I joined them, very grateful they were there.

My wife and i were travelling east on Route 30 east of Chambersburg, PA, on Saturday 4/29/2017.  My wife suddenly told me to pull over on the road because there were two objects in the sky in the proximity of a waxing crescent moon phase.   I have seen UFO objects twice in my lifetime before this at least 40 plus years ago.  We both looked at the objects while we were facing the west.  The two objects appeared to be larger than a planet, saucer/bell shapes in the sky, both were bright with an amber to white hue cast sort of pulsing as they stood at rest in the sky.   I had hoped that they would continue to get closer coming eastward to get a better look at them, but after about a minute, the one on the right began to slowly vanish followed by the one on the left then slowly vanishing.  There was a slight overcast with very high altitude cloud cover with some clearing.   When the objects vanished out of sight, it appeared as though they exited our atmosphere very quickly ! almost straight up and out.   Back in the early 1970's when i saw my first UFO, it occured in broad daylight, and actually had time to get my telescope out (50X) and sight in on it, before it quickly raced across the sky many times the speed of a modern military jet aircraft, and vanished as well.  I understand from my reading that the USA government does in fact have secret propulsion technology at Area #51 and has had it for years, continuing to unveil this high technology into military uses today.  I would not be surprised that the two UFO's we sighted on 4/29/2017 were engineered by our own government.  It is very exciting to see these objects, because it doesn't happen but once or so in a lifetime.  This is my third sighting in 43 years.  Now i must look at the skies every night.  My cell phone camera is too cheap, it would not have showed up well, but to be honest i just wanted to see these UFO's with my eyes.

At approximately 9:15pm I observed a light similar in brightness to the ISS but north of my location.  After observing the light for a few seconds I realised it could not be the ISS: it was flying in the wrong direction (nearly west to east) and was too far north.  The light also appeared to change direction a couple of times but this may have just been an illusion created by the atmosphere. After checking the Heavens Above website, I was able to confirm the ISS was not yet visible from my location so I returned to watching the object.  Soon after, I went back outside the light abruptly vanished. A few minutes later I observed another bright light NW of my location and, after watching for a short time (and checking the Heavens Above website again) I was able to confirm this second object was the ISS.  I watched the ISS for several minutes until it dropped below the horizon. The unexplained light I observed was first seen roughly north of my location and was in sight for about a minute.  I think it was at a very high altitide although I have no way of knowing for certain. It disappeared after travelling across about 20 degrees of the sky reaching a position roughly NE.  Angle above the horizon started at about 75 degrees and finished about 60-65 degrees above the horizon. Weather at the time was moderate wind (about 25km/h) from SE.  Sky was mostly clear - no clouds around where the light was observed.  Many stars visible but no moon. At no point was any sound heard nor were any changes of colour or brightness noted before its disappaerence.  It was a steady, bright white light. Personal info. I am a qualified educator (College/University graduate) in my early 50's.  I have worked in education and security and I am a trained observer.  I am a keen amateur astronomer and am fully familiar with the night sky.  I know what stars, planets, the ISS and satellites look like and have observed many meteors.

The lights appeared quickly, but were too far away to detect the object's shape.  It at times moved slowly up and down, and to one side almost at an angle before returning to its original location.  It would disappear and reappear at least 7 times over the next 20 minutes, always in the same area.  The lights eventually disappeared completely behind the tree line, and we debated back and forth over possible explanations for what we just witnessed.

I could not determine the color, though the other witness said it was green.  It moved in a circular pattern at high speed.  As far as we could tell, its height above the ground was slightly higher or equal to the height of Denny Chimes Tower, 115 feet. After a few minutes, as I trained my eyes to follow the shape as it moved, I thought that it was bobbing up and down a little as it moved, much in the same way as a bird flaps its wings. The other witness talked about recent social media reports at the Quad about sightings of Mothman, but I have not seen these reports.  I speculated whether it was search lights to warn aircraft of their low altitudes, or water from the sprinklers refracting off the street lights in the clouds.

Then we noticed that the rocks where being thrown over 100 foot trees into the creek.  With that, we decided to line up in single file and sweep the wood line.

The scoutmasters decided to bed down on the creek bed cause it was too dangerous to go back in the dark, for thee boys got hurt during the sweep of the wood line.  We where instucted to dig into the creek bed, and cover our heads with our hiking back packs to shield us from the rocks, and we went to sleep.

I grabbed my binoculars and I was standing near power lines because I could hear them crackle.  The ship was delta shaped through the binoculars and continued to slowly glide back and forth..way too slow stay aloft I thought.

Around 9-10 pm on the night of 09/10/2014, my son and I were driving to my house.  As we drove on the street before turning into my subdivision, we saw a line of lights, all the same size, to our left-hand side up in the sky.  They “sparkled” like a star appearing to change colors somewhat…my son described it as looking like a “burning ember”, basically white, but they would flicker, sometimes reddish, sometimes orangish…maybe from the gases in the air that make stars sparkle?  There were no lights on the object that could be likened to a plane. The line was traveling from a southwesterly to northeasterly direction. A direction if maintained could lead directly to St. Louis International  Airport. They were traveling in a single file, straight line horizontally across the sky with approximately the same amount of distance between them. We kept watching them as we turned into my subdivision, and they just kept coming…at least 20 had passed by in a straight line fashion either singularly or in formations of 2, 3 or 4 before we pulled over to video tape what we were seeing. So, we made a right turn into the parking lot of our subdivision swimming pool to pull over to watch them and take a video with my cell phone. They just kept coming and coming, some singularly, some side by side, some in a triangular formation and some in a diamond pattern.  There was virtually no sound.  They seemed to be flying fairly low and there were so many of them we surely would have heard any sound emanating from them.  At one point, I commented that we thought we heard a very slight sound, but cannot confirm it came from the objects As you can tell my comments the number of them was quite impressive and inexplicable.  Our guesstimate of total numbers would be about 50 or so.  This whole incident lasted approximately 20-30 minutes from the time we first spotted them until stopped taping. I am going to attempt to forward the video I took.  On the left side of the screen at times you will see the lights of the pool house, the poolhouse itself and the fence…but you can clearly see when I “zero” in on the flying objects.  There is also a little “floater” of a light that shows on the screen but that is not related to the flying objects either…and you can tell the difference because the objects in the sky are brighter and all the same size.

It then took a few steps backwards, turned around, and ran full speed to the door on the other side of the house (to be let back inside).  I looked around the tree to see what had frightened the cat, but there was nothing there, so I turned and took a few steps away, but decided to quickly look back one last time.  That's when I saw this object running from the tree to behind the trash barrels located near the end of the driveway.  It was about 12-15 ft. from me and in my direct line of sight on a bright, sunny day.  I was very startled, and decided to first let the cat back into the house.  A few minutes later I walked over to the trash barrels, but there was nothing there. The object appeared to 2 dimensional (like a geometrically shaped cardboard cutout), and it seemed able to camouflage itself (like a cuttlefish, or something I'd expect to be created in a DARPA lab).   The object’s legs appeared to be moving rapidly, but it’s movement was comparatively slow as if it wasn’t getting good traction.  The object was approximately 18 inches tall.  It was shaped like a small black sphere with a pie shaped cutout (similar to the outline of an astronaut’s helmet) over a black triangular shaped mid section, and a barely visible pair of legs below the mid section. I don't expect others to believe me, as I wouldn't believe such a story if it was told to me. Never-the-less, I’ve reported what I had seen, because I couldn't attribute it to being a shadow, glare, or another rational explanation, and perhaps others also spotted it.

The first thing I did was lower the car window to rule out reflections on the glass. I could make out no forms nor sound of aircraft and these lights were solid, not blinking as normally seen on aircraft.  They were not individual lights on a larger craft as I could make out faint clouds in the sky behind and between them.

They maintained the same formation the entire time, and did not “fade out” as flares would.   I waited to file a report until I had a chance to:  1) drive down the same stretch of road again, at the same time of day, to see if there were any extremely high light poles or radio towers, etc., that could have accounted for the lights and;  2) contact the local Air Force base to confirm whether they had conducted any drills, flare releases, or other such maneuvers that night.

I would estimate the altitude of the object to have been no more than 200-300 feet off the ground at the *very* most. County Road 30 runs east/west parallel, next to and along the Mississippi river along that stretch, on the north hand side of the Mississippi river.  Distance from the intersection of Joplin&30, to the Pinewood Golf Course on Waco Street NW, is between 1-2 miles.  When the ""fireball"" suddenly appeared it was only that distance ahead of us, just a bit north of the golf course, almost directly over top of Highway 10. Highway 10 also runs the same parallel east/west as County Road 30 and the Mississippi river, just a few blocks north of County Road 30. A little more than half way from the Joplin/30 intersection to the Waco/30 intersection, is the Sherburne County Government Center to our right (north), located along the south side of Highway 10. By the time we had traveled (1 mile) westbound on County Road 30, and were directly south of the Sherburne County Government Center (which was directly to our right, north) the object had already slowly and erratically moved a little southward and was now right over the golf course on Waco Street NW.  We could clearly see the ""fireball"" had been moving southward, and was continuing to move southward.  However, the object did NOT move at a steady speed.  Instead, it was moving only a little south at a time at random intervals, stopping periodically in the sky.  Also, with each southward movement, it randomly would travel to a somewhat higher and sometimes lower altitude in the sky. (Note: County Road 30 along that stretch is perfectly straight for a few miles, and perfectly flat. NO rises or falls in the road.)   When we reached Waco Street, we turned onto Waco, and I immediately stopped the car to view the object which was nearly above us at that point.  We clearly observed from the roadside stopped as the object continued its random erratic traveling southward in short movements changing altitude up & down also with each movement, for just shy of 2 more minutes.  Also, throughout the duration of the sighting the ""fireball"" somewhat randomly increased and decreased in brightness.  Each time it moved mostly the brightness increased. Each time it paused in the sky mostly the brightness decreased.  All the while it maintained being the absolutely brightest object by *far* in the entire sky, other than the moon of course which was to the south (left) of us. Then the object, after being viewed from our stopped position at Waco & 30 for nearly 2 minutes, suddenly vanished, as instantly as it had appeared in the first place.  At the time it finally disappeared in the clear open sky, it had traveled southward enough to had crossed over the Mississippi river to the south side of the river.  From beginning to end, from Joplin/30 intersection to the time it disappeared south of the river, the entire sighting had lasted between 4-5 minutes.",2017-06-09T00:00:00,45.334300000000006,-93.56769999999999

When I saw the other plane pass, the object appeared to be moving closer in my direction, & it seemed to me at second glance it may be one of those planes carrying an advertising banner - heading out to Jones beach, because I saw what appeared to be something wavy behind the object. As I stared at it a bit more, because it seemed unusual to me, I realized the object seemed to almost pause in its flight, and that's when I realize there were in fact two objects, and one appeared to be doing what I can only describe as a kabuki dance around the other object, and that's when I started seeming some orange color which appeared to be emanating from the bottom of these objects. At this point I took my cell phone out of my pocket & tried to capture some photo's and movies. I had to move to an area where the sun wouldn't quite be in my eyes because the object was west, but the sun was glaring off my back (as it was still early in the morning) and it was hard to zoom in and focus on the objects, but I did manage to capture some videos and a few stills of the objects. Upon reviewing the pictures I took, I realized how not so great cell phone cameras (at least my Samsung Note 5) seems to be a focusing on somewhat distant objects with an 8X zoom, but I do have some videos and still frames I'm happy to send along, or will attach to this report if provided. I looked at the objects slowly move across the sky from north to south slowly, seemingly doing this circle around one another routine, until at one point right before they vanished, they seemed to either merge, or one of them just vanished, and after about 8 or 9 minutes, all of a sudden, they were gone.
