I continued driving west on Upriver slowing to about 10-15 miles per hour because I had never seen lights in the sky like these before.   Now there were 8 lights that appeared just to left of Upriver, kind of looking like they were coming at me from the Airway Heights area towards Felts Field Airport.  The lights didn’t fly in a straight line, they seem to appear like slowly bobbing up and down, not a lot but out the windshield about a few inches,  They made a lot of ground very quickly.   About the time I reached Dick Rd, I pulled over to the side of the rode and rolled down my window shut off the radio and fan, to see if I could hear anything but did not.  So I sat there and watched them for several minutes, as the first one got to where it looked as if it were out my window it took off toward the south not only heading south but going up very fast then stopped and hovered.   Then the next one did the same,then the next one until it appeared to make like a backward J in the sky.  At that point the first one took off upwards and disappeared then the next until all were gone. I then pulled back onto Upriver Drive and I as I got back out on the road again, a ball of red light slowly started descending to what appeared to be over Beacon Hill heading towards Felts Field again I have never seen any kind of light like this before in the sky.  I drove home as fast as I could probably taking 1 minute from the time I pulled back onto Upriver, I ran into the house telling my 3 sons and wife and my son’s friend and one son’s girlfriend to come out and check this out.  Told them you have never seen anything like this before in your life.   Everyone ran out the back door and at that time 3 red lights appeared in a triangle shape hovering looking southeast out my backyard for about 3 minutes before the light at the right side of the triangle took off followed by the next two. I work in the medical field and have never before looked at this sight or have I ever called and reported anything before.  There is no way anything man made could have moved or propelled itself the way these objects could.

((NUFORC Note:  One of six sightings from same source, submitted over the course of two months.  PD)) (Sequel to previous sightings on 6/16, 8/18, 9/02 - same location.)  Milford, Gulf Beach Clear, no wind. Start: 8:08PM  First orange light appears, approaching rapidly above treetops @ 8 degree elevation, 295 degrees NW (above Milford's Fort Trumbull area). Observed with 10X21 Olympus binoculars (field of view = 5 degrees), while intermittently aiming 110 lumen LED flashlight in strobe setting towards it (No obvious response to this signaling). To naked eye, hazy orange glow with brighter core; occasional flickering of luminosity givering a spark-like appearance. Approximate altitude during approach: @ 500 ft, but seemed to be gradually rising.  Speed within the range of 75 - 95 mph, roughly estimated on the distance traveled divided by seconds observed. Apparent size: 15 - 40 ft diameter. No sound, even though other, more distant aircraft were perfectly detectable. Appearance of light through binoculars, prefocused at infinity, while being observed for a minimum of 60 seconds: 1. Very bright, concise ball of orange light 2. Surrounded by a faint yellowish halo 3. outlined by a reddish ring These create an impression of a lens which is positioned within the bottom of a tapering fan-shaped nimbus of hazy orange light. Imagine a headlamp which has its short light beam funneled upwards instead of outwards, creating a funnel shape of softer light. During travel this fan-like beacon occasionally flutters or jitters from side-to-side, imparting a flame-like effect. As this device passed above at about a 25 degree angle, traveling to the SE, its light began to sputter and fade.  Anticipating the usual disappearance, I maintained a tight view, detecting the fact that the light's dimming was the result of its becoming obscured by a structure surrounding it.  Eventually the forepart of this device, from which the light was issuing, became totally hidden. However, there was still visible a vague, smokey oblong of light which continued traveling over Long Island Sound into the SE.  After moving over about 140 degrees or arc across the sky this blob of light became too faint to follow. End: 8:12 PM  Within 90 seconds after losing sight of the first object, the second orange light appeared slightly to the right of where the first one had flared up (@ 305 degrees NW). This next UFO appeared to be heading directly towards me.  Again, I immediately (though nervously) began to strobe-signal it, while trying to maintain a steady view of it with binocs. Same altitude, speed, trajectory, lack of sound. More pronounced was the stuttering variance of this orange light beam - almost like the jumpiness of a bad video feed or the breaking up of a noisy hologram. Obviously  this accounts for the seemingly ""erratic"" or wobbly flight pattern that many have commented on while watching these things pass by. Steadily tracking this UFO with the binocs as it duplicated the trajectory of the first one (or maybe repeated itself!), I watched as its orange glow gradually dimmed until it too was visible only as a ghostly blob sailing over the Sound into the SE. End: 8:17PM  (Unlike some previous sightings, this one was not followed by a subsequent pair of lights appearing from the opposite direction.  At least not within the next 90 minutes I remained watching).",2012-09-24T00:00:00,41.223742105263156,-73.05265438596491

I looked into the sky to see if it was cloudy, because I was expecting to see clear weather. It was a little cloudy.  I looked to the south from where I stood, and saw an interesting red, glowing, oval shaped light hovering in place. At first I didn’t know what to make of it, then, two other unidentified flying objects appeared from the distance hovering not far from one another. It was like a light bulb slowly lighting into clear view. I walked into the house to get my camera phone as quickly as possible. When I returned back outside they were still there. I took a couple shots of them, and tried to get some video of these objects. After about a minute or two, another pair of theses interesting lights slowly illuminated at a further distance from the others, and one started slowly moving in random directions, but always returned to its original position. I took a couple more photos after the last t! wo arrived. The first three objects that appeared,  begins to veer off out of my sight till they were gone. The other two started slowly moving further above the first three, then, they dimmed away like a dyeing bulb. The pictures I took did not do any justice to what I saw. In the photos you can see one small red light along with two other lights that turned out white. In another one you can see the first three of them and they all are white. I am not sure why all but one turned out white, but what I saw was that they were all glowing red. The last ones I took with all five of them together didn’t turnout so great. The last two to show up did turn up in the pictures. I’m assuming it was because they were further away in the distance. As for the video, my hands were very shaky from the excitement of this event, and ended up with an 8 second video that was very shaky.

We arrived at the lake around 6am.   At approximately between 7am-7:30am I happened to look up at the sky towards North West of the way I was facing and saw up in the sky something that resembled a falling star.  It was coned shaped at the front and the color of the front was a bright white (like a bright light bulb). But the shape of the object behind the tip/front was what puzzled me.  The best I can describe it is sort of like the width of how planes leave a trail of clouds from the wings but the color which would normally be white was instead bright and resembled the color of a arc welding torch(super bright shiny blue). The object didn't leave a trail like how the trail of a normal plane is even visible after the aircraft has moved on, instead with the unknown object the ""trail"" so called seemed to follow right along each side of the bright white cone shaped center/tip leaving no! residual traces after it moved out of view.  I only observed the object for approximately 5-7 seconds before it fell out of view behind forrest trees in the distant.  If I had to estimate the distance the object appeared to be from where I stood maybe 1-3miles I can't be exact. I was sort of stunned/shocked when I looked up and saw the thing in the air and I was actually expecting to hear a loud boom or sound from the impact of the object which was descended at slight angle not straight down, but I didn't hear a thing.  Being stunned and caught in the moment I wasn't even able to sum up the wits to shout to my family members who were fishing down a couple of yards from where I was standing.  There was a good amount of people fishing North West of where I saw the object which would position the unknown object behind the other fishermen.  After the incident was over I looked around to see if any body else was pointing at the direction of the object but from the way it looked they! were all focused on fishing while I happened to gaze off at j! ust the right time.

It was about 2:30 in the morning on the 24th of June.  I say a light appear in the sky to the southwest so I looked up all that I saw was stars and one really big bright star.  I figured I saw nothing about 10 seconds later I looked back at the bright star to notice a small dull light appear below it then it started moving north.  I told my friends to come look at it.   Maybe 2 seconds later another small light appeared just under where the first one appeared and started on the same direction.  Then another appeared just above the big bright star that started on the same path.  Me and three of my friends watched for maybe 20 seconds as the lights moved together at a slow speed when we noticed the big bright star move to the south at a little bit of a faster pace then the others.   The bright light moved across the sky for another 20 seconds then stopped the move pack southwest and up and disappeared in less then a second. Side note about 10 seconds before I saw the light the radio station turned off didn't turn back on for the rest of the night.   At the same time the radio turned off the baby started crying like I have never heard him do before then as soon as the light dissipated he fell to sleep.,2012-07-04T00:00:00,35.5848,-118.3829

This really surprised me because I was under the impression that this was very far away.  I then noticed a smaller light that appeared to come from the first.  This light was moving east and flashing infrequently.  It would flash a few times then was out of site until it flashed again at a significant distance from the last flashes.

We were on our way to the symphony in Pocatello and as we drove by the Blackfoot airport on Teeples about 5:45 PM give or take a few seconds straight away and somewhat to our left (southeast) we saw partially hidden in relatively low clouds a series of golden yellow lights in pairs.   They would have had to be fairly large, just sitting in the sky motionless.  They were grouped in such a way that at first I thought someone had erected a huge crane with scattered lights on the metal framework but then I realized just how far up they were and I was struck by the lack of motion.   They lasted about 90 seconds and just faded away never changing their formation.   Kind of creepy.  I've heard of theories that these are reflections from earth but these didn't look like any reflection I know of because the clouds were passing by them partially hiding them so somehow the reflection would have had to pass to the other side of the clouds and not be obscured by the cloud formation.   Additionally these were very bright lights well circumscribed unlike any reflected light I've seen.  Have you ever seen anything like this?",2012-12-20T00:00:00,43.2779,-112.5627

Standing up and looking over the annex's roof I saw a flat darkened object coming at me from the direction of our county airport. I thought to myself, ""the FFA is going to pull this guy's licence"". The craft was no more than 100 feet off of the ground heading straight at me. As it got closer I noticed no tail on the craft and sounded as if it only had one jet engine. In front of it were what appeared to be two huge white lights projectinting out in front of it.  As it came closer it began to fly over the other side of the street on which I live and the detail was remarkable.  The craft was triangle shaped and painted in standard navy gloss grey top with creamey white belly. It was absolutely cleane no dirt streaks or oil on it.  What appeared to be a weapons bay was open and ran most of the full length of the craft.  There was no cockpit so was a remotely steered craft.  No markings of any kind could be seen but the weapons bay was lit up and you could see ribbing? and tubes for electrical or hydraulics inside.  The amazing thing was it's speed it was moving about the speed of a man fast walking.  A standard airfoil would not keep this craft up. Since it was running flat at very low speed the only thing floating it was probably a single gas jet generator pruducing some form of ionized, capacitive lift.  It was about the size of a large single engine private plane up to a private twin.the tail terminated in what appeared to be flaps that were set neutral   and again gave no assist in lift. most likely this is deriviant of the Bifield Brown lifting concept. It continued on in a wright Pat direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",2012-11-19T00:00:00,39.42305109489051,-84.5528097323601

Object seen on Saturday, November 10, 2012 at approximately 11:45 pm. My wife and I had just returned from watching a football game locally.  We pulled up in front of our house. (suburban neighborhood) and I noticed very bright lights to the south.  Since we have a small airport here in town (behind me and on the other side of a freeway to my east) I assumed it was a low flying airplane making an approach to land. I walked my wife to the door and turned to look at the lights again.  I realized that there were no red and green lights as required and the lights seemed brighter than a small plane. So I assumed maybe it was a commercial airliner making its approach into Eugenes regional airport to my northwest. The craft appeared to stop its forward motion.  I ran inside to grab a pair of binoculars.  When I came out and looked at the object, it almost appeared that instead of what I thought were lights, almost looked like it was on fire.  Flickering but I saw no smoke or vapor trail.  (Maybe the atmosphere causing the lights to appear to be flickering) It was then I realized that the object was not an altitude for a plane making an approach locally, but at what I would estimate to be at least 30,000 feet. I have observed jetliners flying over my town at high altitudes with my binoculars, high enough to produce a vapor trail.  And I could see that it was a plane with wings and lights etc…so I felt confident estimating the objects altitude. The lights all of a sudden went dark. I pulled the binoculars down straining to catch a glimpse of the craft with the naked eye.  And that’s when I saw a faint, gray object, traveling about the speed of a satellite orbiting earth.  I found it with my binoculars again.  It was at a very high altitude, no lights, no smoke or vapor trail.  Grey, round, not like a ball but like a disk from my vantage point. I followed the object in my binoculars for at least another minute or two as it headed north, and finally disappeared behind some clouds and my roofline. I called a local news station the next day to ask if anyone else had reported strange lights, but no one had. I talked to my dad the next morning. He is retired from Boeing and once held his pilots license. I asked him if what I saw could have been a weather balloon, but he said they don’t have lights (especially that bright) and wouldn’t have been traveling at the rate of speed.

The lights moved very fluently and had floating like motions in which the lights had the ability to move smoothly in all directions(up, down, right, left, etc.).

I wanted to take pictures of the beautiful Michigan night stars.  I went onto a dirt road in front of a cabin I had rented.  I took some pictures and then for some reason I felt compelled to take a photo of the sky that included a bunch of trees.  It was an overwhelming feeling.  I took the picture and did not notice anything out of the ordinary about the pic but did see that after I took the pic an object moved from the trees into the open sky.  I saw the object move approximately 100 yards behind another group of trees.  I moved my camera and tripod across the street and aimed at the object. It was moving in and out, or behind a group of trees but it was clearly moving. It appeared to be a horizontal cylinder that was showing red, blue and white colors. it went from rapid to slow and sometimes looked like it was making a ""Z"" pattern.  I then saw it shoot a white light to where it had been previously, the first place I saw it.  It seemed as if it were scanning the area for something. As it was scanning the first area the red/blue/white light continued to pulsate and the object continued to float behind/in the trees.  The light then came my direction.  I should mention that during this time I was capturing video and still images with my Nikon D90 digital camera.  I took out my Samsung Galaxy S III and started to shoot video with this as well.  The white light can be seen in the video. It was almost hypnotic and when you see the video it is as if it is pulsating or a modulated oscillation. When the light is directly on me it is clear in the video as it is difficult to see any details.  The light them moves away. In the video you can see two or three objects that move about that have blinking lights. One  seems to be shining a light directly below it to either pull up the object below or help guide it. The object on the far right - and this is purely speculation though I have watched this clip for 3 hours in a l! oop - *possibly* has a figure or several enter and then ascend! . One th is is clear - the ascension is absolute. Some of the videos (The Samsung phone) I did not think had anything at all but I did not delete them.  Two of the videos have odd noises.  The odder of the two show a very bright light that is neon yellow and long and something indescribable (like a very bright book or corner of a picture frame). It is only visible for a fraction of a second but it makes a branch snapping sound first, then the flash of the object passing incredibly fast, then an electronic blip type noise.  Almost like in the old days when an MP3 didn't have a proper codec and had a glitch type sound.  I expect that I will transfer the sound into soundforge to try to slow down to see what I can make of it, if anything. The most absolutely astonishing thing - and one that is absolutely beyond question, even from my most skeptical friends - is that the first picture that I took (the one I felt compelled to take) - when lightened and exposure corrected - shows easily 100+ objects above, in back and in front of the tree line. There are at least 5 different types of object.  One that seems to be about 100 yards wide that has a row of red and blue lights on its edge. There is one more that looks like this to the far right, in front of the trees, below the tree line. It was this object that I saw fly to the right and watched the most.  The other objects look to be miniature flying objects that have two ""head lights"" that are either both blue or both red. These are small, maybe the size of a car or smaller.  There are other that are teapot shaped. Most have lights apparent. There is one more that is either attached or directly under the ""mother ship"" that I call the topmost one th! at has the ring of lights.  I would be happy to send the one I am describing directly above this sentence if you would like to have a look. The videos are very large but I can store on DropBox or a place of your choosing.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,,

From a distance the object looked like the brightest star in the sky with a fair amount of illumination in the sky around it.  Through the binoculars the object appeared to be a series of blue, reddish, purple and white lights almost like a kaleidoscope of colour and appearing in a state of flux and flirtatious movement.  The intensity of the light appeared to vary over a period of time and the object moved across the sky as you would think a star or planet would.

There is a wide view of a long distance mountain range & the southern sky from my front yard where I was standing.  Looking at the mountains I saw an extremely bright white light moving slowly toward me.  It was moving from south to north slightly west of my position.  My first thought was that the light was much brighter than any plane or helicopter I’d ever seen.  It seemed to be illuminating the clouds in front of it the length of 2 airplanes.  I watched the light for about 10 minutes thinking it must be a military plane. It came out of the clouds & flew low, lower than any large planes would fly in this valley.  It moved very slowly & smoothly, sort of floating along.  I kept waiting to hear the engine, but it didn’t make a sound.  I knew it wasn’t any military craft.  As it got closer I realized how low it was, it was just above the tree tops of the 100/120 foot pines on the west side of my yard.  Then it went behind the trees.  Again I wondered why I couldn’t hear an engine or something. When it came out from behind the trees I could see the bottom of it.  It was a black(matt finish) triangle shaped craft with a white light on each of the rounded tips & a dimmer white/orange light in the center of the belly.  I watched the underside pass by me while looking west through a 25–30 foot opening in the trees.  I couldn’t see the entire craft at one time; it was much larger than that 30 foot opening. I continued to watch even after I couldn’t see it anymore thinking it was going to run into the mountain north of me.  When I didn’t see an explosion I went inside & told my husband about it & drew a picture. I thought it was odd that it was moving so slowly & I thought it was odd that the light was so bright, but the thought of it being a UFO didn’t occur to me until I realized it wasn’t making any noise & it was very low.  Then when I saw the matt black metal underside I was convinced. I haven’t told anyone besides my husband for fear of ridicule.  Since that night I research UFO sightings on the Web every chance I get.  I was surprised no one reported it, but as time passed I thought if there were other witnesses maybe they were just as afraid to speak up as I was.  So I decided to file this report. I’m still in shock & try not to let it consume my thoughts, but I’m sure what I saw was not of this world.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,35.5119,-82.7037

After eating, the teenage kids decided to follow the demonstration forest path to the top of the hill to look out at the Pacific Ocean.  A friend and I were at the front of the group.  When we got to the top of the hill we saw that there were hundreds or thousands of shiny triangular objects lying in the grass.  At first I thought they were lightning bugs, but they weren’t moving and were a crystal white color.  I started to pick one up, but one of the girls in the group screamed and we all started back down the hill together.  I thought that I would get one the next trip up the hill. After getting to the bottom of the hill, we all finally started the walk back up the hill.  About halfway up, I stopped and asked my friend if he also saw what I saw in the path ahead of us and he said yes.  Standing in the path was a gray figure that appeared to be bald and naked.  The creature (for lack of a better description) had large black eyes.  It seemed skinny with joints and finger tips that were bulbous.  Its hands had fewer fingers that we do, but its hands were larger and they hung at the knees.  We stared at each other for what seemed to be several minutes. The rest of the group had started later than my friend and I so no one was directly behind us on the trail.  Suddenly one of the girls screamed and the creature leapt like a cat, with arms first, into the bushes along the path.  My friend looked at me and asked if I thought that it was going to head us off down the path.  That was enough for me to start running down the hill.  Needless to say I didn’t go bac! k up the hill to get one of the triangular objects in the grass.  I tried to tell the adults at the dinner about what we saw, but my friend clammed up and said that he hadn’t seen anything.  Through the years, I have told a few people of this encounter and have always gotten a laugh so I don’t tell anyone anymore, ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

In the autumn of between 1980 and 1982 my friend and I witnessed an event that still baffles me to this day.  We were both 12 to 14 at the time and were standing by an open lot next to his house located a hundred yards from my house.  This lot is located on top of a valley that downtown Fremont is located in.  Going from the lot to the bottom of the valley is approximately 40ft.  While standing there talking the trees lining to top of the lot starting moving violently, as though a hard wind was blowing down on them.  A light slowly came up from the valley and was shining through the tree line.  My first thought was that a helicopter was approaching and conveyed this to my friend.  But, there was no noise, the craft, or whatever it was, was completely silent.  As the light approached the top of the tree line it went out and the trees stopped moving.  A few seconds later a blue beam of light (I am getting goose bumps even to this day typing this) shown directl! y on my friend.  The beam of light was perfectly cylindrical in shape, as though a glass tube was directing the light down.  The light shown on him for maybe 2 to 3 seconds and then went out.  A second later the beam of blue light shown on myself but for only for a second, went out and once again shown on my friend for perhaps another second or two and again went out.  There was no indication of a craft.  We did not see the outline of one, hear any noise coming from one, and no indication of a craft leaving the area after the final beam of light.  We were both petrified as we stared at each other for a few seconds.  My friend ran to enter his house, and being dark I was absolutely terrified of the hundred yard run I had to perform to return home.  I immediately proceeded to sprint home faster than I ever have.  I told my mother of the incident but she seemed skeptical at best.  For most of the night I stood at the landing of the stairs looking out the window trying to make ! sense of what had happened.  My mother had to tell me a few ti! mes to g et to bed.  The next morning my mother noticed that I had a peculiar color to my skin, as though I had been sun burnt.  Every exposed area of my skin was visibly red with what appeared to be a light sun burn.  My mother stated that perhaps I did have something unusual happen that night.  My friend also had the same sun burn like pattern on him.   Two weeks later my mother showed me an article in the local newspaper of others seeing strange lights in the night sky although none exactly as the encounter my friend and I had.  My friend and I did not speak of the incident again until we were in our late 20’s.",2012-05-29T00:00:00,41.3598,-83.1255

We were camped on the banks of Small River and several miles from the nearest town. As we were lying on our backs observing the night sky, one of the scouts points to the northeast and said ""hey look Sputnik"". Sure enought moving at what seemed a slow rate of speed was a light in the night sky (it would have looked like a star if it had not been moving). As the light moved from the northeast to the southwest, another scout shouted look there's another one. Looking to the southwest we saw a second light which appeared to be a copy of the first moving from the southwest to the northeast on a collision couse with the first. Although they were very far apart and moving slow, over the next 20 to 30 min.s they had come within approximatly an inch of one another. Then a flash of light occurred between the two objects and the one on the right coming from the southwest disappeared! and the one from the northeast continued it's southwestern flight until it disappeared some time later.  We were shocked and amazed and to this day this has remained an unforgettable experience. I found this on your web page and was very happy to find out that some one besides me had seen this happen. I was playing out side one night with the kids next door when their Father called us all over to him to show us something going on in the Eastern Sky. Two Star looking objects very high in the night sky moving slowly. There was three adults and maybe eight kids. The adults was out side on blankets to get out of the hot house. My Parents was out side on the porch but was not ready to watch UFO’s in the Sky, but I was and I laid down and watched for maybe 30minutes before I had to go to bed. I was Nine years old and been to all the shows about monsters and space ships. As we watched these two objects we saw something smaller than the other two move from below one and go to the other, as this was happing one of the Grand Parents that was out side with us said that this was the second time they saw this smaller obect move from one to the other. I have no Idea what we saw but we did see it happen. Its good to know someone else saw it to. THANKS   ((NUFORC Note: Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Looking straight at Polaris directly in front of us at 30 deg. elevation (our latitude), Cassiopeia was a bit higher than 3 o’clock. A bright star-like object appeared just south (towards the zenith) of a line between Polaris and the central star of Cassiopeia (Gamma Cas).  It was much larger and brighter than Venus has been this summer, so it was easily the most brilliant object in the sky. At first we thought it was an airliner with its landing lights on.  We see these often from Houston airports and occasionally from Austin.  But the airliners are never this large or bright and they always have little blinking red and green lights also, which are especially noticeable in binoculars.  I looked at this object with a pair of inexpensive 8 x 40 wide field binoculars and could see no blinking red and green lights at all.  Airliners usually turn off the landing lights before they reach this point in our sky, so I’m sure this was not an airliner.  My friend was also sure of that.  He said, “That has to be a satellite or spaceship of some kind.”  The object moved steadily in a straight line just due east of north and crossed the (imaginary) line connecting Polaris with Gamma Cas at about the 20% mark measuring from Polaris.  I followed it the binoculars for a minute or so after my friend could no longer see it with the naked eye.  It continued to grow fainter as it neared the horizon, but the intrinsic brightness did not appear to vary, and I eventually couldn’t see it anymore. It reminded me of a satellite in polar orbit – the speed was about right – but I’ve never seen a satellite (and I’ve observed many) that was this large and bright.  Total time the object was observed was about three to four minutes.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,30.1264,-96.6997

Then right after the two flashes of light, it started to go off.  The flashes were going off like a roll of firecrackers but no noise.  Just one right after another.  Super fast.  I ran to the window to see what was going on and to see what was out their.  Then it stopped.  Our dogs never barked.   Which they do when they hear any noise.

I am composing this note for both my boyfriend and I. We were driving home from dinner on Tuesday, September 18, 2012. At approximately 9:00-9:15 p.m. we witnessed an event we have ever seen before. My boyfriend's recollection of the event is a little different than mine. That is why I want to include both of our reports as two different testimonials for the same event. Here is his report: ""I am typing this report at 10.30 pm est September 18, 2012. My girlfiend and I were driving home from dinner at about 9:00pm est. We live in Knoxville, TN in an area about 20 miles from McGee-Tyson Airport. We are used to seeing airplanes fly over our neighborhood all the time, and this sighting was absolutely not an airplane. It moved too fast in the sky and in a very strange manner. I am not sure what I witnessed was from another world or something the government may be doing, but it was definately something I have never seen before. It was pitch black outside, and just as we were coming over a steep hill on our way home, I witnessed two distinctively bright lights that appeared to be changing colors from orange- to red- to green. They were very bright, brighter and larger than any other star or plane in the sky. What I witnessed lasted from about 5 to 8 seconds, it was very brief. However, I can say there was no avoiding seeing this because it was obvious something was happening that was not normal. The two lights moved higher in the sky in a coordinated effort, then crossed each other. First making arches in the sky, then creating an ""X"" path in the sky. The two lights then came together, stopped and held their spots, then took off at opposite directions a speed I have never witnessed. There was also a truck down the road from us that was stopped. We drove towards them, they rolled down their window and told us that they had witnessed the same thing. This was, by far, the strangest thing I have ever seen. The “orbs” (as some people have been referring to them) were in the southeastern night sky."" In addition to my boyfriend's report above, I wanted to give my own testimonial for this event: We were coming home from dinner at around 9pm on September 18th. We were coming over a steep hill, and I could see in the sky, much much higher than the tallest trees, two very bright lights. They were circular ""orbs"", I guess some people have been calling them. One was red-ish in color and the other was green-ish. They were very bright, much brighter and larger than any star. And they appeared to have a hazy ring around them. What I witnessed only lasted 1 to 2 seconds, but I know that it was not normal. It was not a star, an airplane, or any other ""normal"" object or light you would expect to see in the night sky. The two lights were moving towards each other, like mirror images. Then they stopped, and separated apart, almost like they were repelled from each other, at a speed I have never witnessed. They moved so fast that you could not keep your eyes on them, then they were simply gone. I did not see the first part where the two lights created arch paths, then ""X""ed over each other (as my boyfriend described) because I was looking out the other window, but I did witness the last part of the event, and I can stand with my boyfriend in saying that it was not normal, and something I have never seen before. As soon as this happened, I had a hard time recognizing what happened, I wasn't sure of what I saw, then my boyfriend asked me if I saw it. I immediately knew what he was talking about, and didn't know how to respond. My first response was to call 911 and report it, but we didn't end up doing that. We saw a truck parked down the road of 2 people we have never met. We rolled down our window and they told us they had just witnessed the same event. Basically, I saw one bright red light, or ""orb"", and one bright green light. They were large and moved at a speed I have never witnessed before, in the following pattern: First moving towards each other, in a coordinated effort: --&gt;   --&gt;   --&gt;         O    O         &lt;--   &lt;--   &lt;-- When they met, they stopped and held their position, then separated in opposite directions at a speed I have never seen. Exponentially faster than any other airplane: O   &lt;----- &lt;----- &lt;----- &lt;-----       -----&gt; -----&gt; -----&gt; -----&gt;   O Then they were simply gone, nowhere to be seen in the sky. Like I said, what I saw only lasted 1 to 2 seconds, but I do not doubt my boyfriend's testimonial at all. I believe that we saw the same thing, and I believe that he did see the lights first create arch paths in the sky, the ""X"" over each other. My boyfriend works in sales, and I am a manager at a local company in Knoxville. We make good money. We are not religious, or spiritual, nor are we ""UFO hunters"". We have nothing to hide, and we are not looking to be famous. We have never witnessed anything like this before, and we are honest people who just thought that what we saw needed to be reported. After the event, we researched internet sites to report what we saw, and nuforc.org seemed like the only legitimate website we could find.

When I looked up, there was a momentary streak moving from the West to the East. I thought it was a meteorite disintegrating in the atmosphere. As I watched the same area of the sky, I noticed two unidentified craft. One craft was moving from the North going Southbound, while the second craft was moving from the South going Northbound. They were moving towards each other. The craft from the South was bright white, and the craft from the North was less bright, and was yellowish-gold in color. Neither craft was emitting flashing marker lights. The craft were very high up in the sky. I am unable to determine an exact rate of speed, but they were moving at good pace. I would say if they were high-altitude jets, they were moving at a high rate of speed. As I watched the two crafts continuing to converge, there was another streak of bright light from the West going East. The streak appeared to pass between the converging craft before erupting into a bright ball and dissolve into nothing. The two craft passed each other in parallel, neither craft altered its course. The Northbound craft appeared to pass on the right (East side). I cannot judge distance at that altitude, but I would have to say that they were within a mile or less of each other. The two craft continued to travel in their respective directions in straight, unwavering lines. I watched for a few more moment to see if there would be any more activity, and then continued walking my dogs. I looked up occasionally to track the position of the two crafts. When I stopped to look more intently, the Southbound craft appeared to stop in the Southern sky (it did not move or change directions with respect to trees and buildings on the ground, it did not reduce or enlarge in shape). But I cannot be absolutely certain. I lost track of the Northbound craft. A few minutes later into my walk I saw a jet flying from the Southeast to the Northwest. This jet had the normal flashing marker lights and was flying at a lower altitude than the two other crafts. I suspect it was a commercial aircraft leaving the MSP airport (it is normal to see these in the morning). MSP is about 50 miles East of Silver Lake. The observed pace of the jet, even though it was at a lower altitude, moved at a slower rate of speed compared with the two high-altitude craft. As the jet passed to the West I could hear its jet engines.  There was no sound heard at ground level from the two high altitude crafts, nor from the two streaks. Weather conditions: Cool, around 68 deg F, humidity approx.: 58% Clear skies, no cloud coverage, the moon was visibly bright, there were still a few star formations visible, the sun was still below the horizon. Venus and another planet were visible in the Eastern skies (they twinkled). No wind, the air was still. This report was completed on 8/9/2012 at 10:55 am",2012-08-19T00:00:00,44.9033,-94.1955

I was sitting on the deck with my friend and about 60 yards away in the distance we saw glowing objects flying right above a 2 story house in front of the chimney.  From what I could tell, they were round, or spherical objects that could change their size.  At the very least they would appear to be the size of a firefly but much brighter, and at times the objects would appear to grow to the size of a navel orange, but then shrink and disappear.  I watched these objects fly around for about 15 minutes. I walked away for 10 minutes then returned and the objects were still there.  On Friday August 10, 2012 at approximately 3 AM I witnessed the objects again, they were flying around in the same place as before.  This time I had binoculars and with getting a closer look!  I was able to detect that they were not fireflies.  They seemed to maneuver like moths, in a rather erratic fashion.  But they did not have wings.  One of the objects which was about the size of a ping pong ball flew in a corkscrew maneuver within what seemed like an area of 2 feet or so.

Having a helmet view of the sky I could see everything very clearly. It was bright and mostly clear. There were a few distant cirrus clouds but when I saw this object it was back-dropped by clear blue sky. The object was flat and bright and moving easterly and  at an approximate 4 or 5 degrees angle upward. The brightness of the object could have been sunlight gleaming from it but it was much brighter than one would normally expect even having sunlight bounce off of it. There was a gleam about the object that appeared to move on the object.  At first I thought that the object was a jet since this location is near Boeing, and to be honest, it could have been, I guess.  It was probably four or five miles from me, I estimate, and it was about an half-inch wide from my perspective. After watching this object for around 10 seconds the background of the object changed so that th! ere was a very distant and slightly transparent, small cirrus cloud.  As the object approached the location in the sky where the background became the cloud, the object could be seen completely until the last part of the object was forefronted to the cloud at which point the object slowly faded away.   By the time I saw the fading occur, I will admit that I was in a slight turn on the freeway which put me in a more north east direction. I continued to watch the location of the sky where the object existed. After a few seconds, I ended up in a more sharp curve putting me in a north direction of travel again while still maintaining as close an eye to that part of the sky without getting in an accident but that object never reappeared *anywhere* in the sky. The cloud in the back ground was small so any flying object would have left that area of the sky back into clear blue sky within seconds. This object did not and I was never able to see the object again after that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There were “lines” connecting all 3 sides, but nothing to the center light. It moved swiftly across the sky, but slow enough for me to focus upon it. It moved much faster than the ISS I had just observed. It was a very pale amber color overall. It followed a path similar to what I was expecting from both the ISS and PROGRESS46P, as their times were similar, as follows:  [9:26PM--ISS tonight viewing duration was supposed to be for 3 minutes, 87 degrees maximum elevation, with an approach of 36 degrees WNW, and a departure of 23 degrees ESE.] A few minutes later, PROGRESS was to be as follows:  [9:34PM—PROGRESS46P viewing duration was supposed to be for 3 minutes, 83 degrees maximum elevation, with an approach of 34 degrees above WNW, and a departure of 31 degrees above ESE.]  I never saw PROGRESS—not sure what it looks like.

About an hour or so before sunset as we was playing in the yard..  We seen a object,  round in shape, about 6 to 8 feet in dynamiter (just bigger than the pitcher’s mound that it hovered over),   As I remember the object was no more than 4 to 6 ft. thick, no lights as I recall but a dull/shiny finish lol  The object hovered above a baseball diamond/pitcher’s mound.. I would say maybe 3 to 4 foot off of the ground.. The baseball field  was about 100 yards away from our location.. The field is there to this day and is still being used by the high school..  Not sure which one of us seen it first but I recall running to the far end of the house to hide and watch the object.. The baseball field is on the back side of the house,  At the time the lot behind the house was empty (no house on it)  with a street then the baseball field.  We observed this object for what I would guess to be about 3 to 5 mins  as it hovered in one spot over the pitcher’s mound. It did not make any noise of any kind and did not blow dust from the pitcher’s mound,  When it did move, it moved very slowly away from us or to the outfield and raised slowly as well until it cleared the tree line that was about 1000 to 1500 yards back  away from the pitcher’s mound,  Then we was unable to see it anymore.  When my Dad got home a short time later and I was telling him about it he laugh and told me to call the police and gave me the number,  So I called and told them as best as I could for my age,!  But hung up when they started asking questions lol (I was 6 yrs old) there may be a record of the call IDK.. That was 39 years ago and it has made such an impact on me that to this day I look for anything that comes close to what I saw.  I do fly on helicopter on a regular bases and that’s not what I saw and it was not a air plane.. So I just don’t know what it was.. Thanks for your time..

We are both professionals and I am also in college for Astrophysics. We were both completely sober and have no history of mental health issues. We had been there for about a half an hour it was then 11:00 pm and we had seen over 10 meters, a few satellites and of course some planes (the plane that flew the highest was still nowhere near the altitude of what I witnessed). We were both sitting in the truck and it was parked facing the Big Dipper. I was looking at the Big Dipper when I noticed a light (same light intensity and hue as the star) moving rapidly around. It was next to a star that is almost directly under the second from the last star making up the handle of the Big Dipper. It startled me because what I saw first was a light, the same size and brightness as the star, shot out to the right from in front or behind this star, then almost instantly two more (slightly smaller in size) lights came rushing towards the first light and stopping dead underneath it on either side making a triangle formation, this lasted just a second. The first light darted down several inches in the sky (this was at an extremely high altitude) the other two followed even faster circling and darting around it, crossing over it as it kept darting away from them. They seemed to get closer and further away all during this, at one point it was very hard to see the! m. It was about 2 minutes in and we had gotten out of the truck to see better. Right as we stepped out my Fiance finally looked to where I was pointing just in time to see the first, slightly larger light dart straight down at an alarming rate, we lost sight of it for a second then saw it rush (again at a ridiculous speed) straight up again, this time a few inches to the right  from where we lost it. It seemed to have lost the other two lights (I’m assuming they’re the same ones) and then, again, out of nowhere, they appeared at either side of it and their interaction started again. They were darting all around the area of the big dipper, faster than anything my Fiance or I have ever seen. The smaller two kept darting away and then would bombard the first light for either side and cross over it, however, it was never the same move twice. It looked eerily like military tactics, however, it seemed to be outside or just inside of the atmosphere. We watched it go on for over 20 minutes, it put both of us so on edge, mainly because, for the first time in both of our lives, we only had one explanation, and that is extraterrestrial crafts.  We finally had to stop looking and left shortly after. Neither of us could sleep that night and we aren't the kind of people to be “spooked” easily.  What we saw is the kind of image that is seen in sci-fi movies, NOT real life, however, there is no denying the activity we witnessed. Both of us are born and raised in Alaska and spent our entire lives looking up at night. Over the years we have seen many strange air crafts coming from Elmendorf air force base that we live near, and pride ourselves on being able to recognize terrestrial crafts and not jumping to conclusions. My Fiance has spent may years studying air crafts and is able to recognize them on sight, even the lesser known ones. We would never have believed it if we hadn't seen it. There is no possibility that it was some sort of advertising lights, I have never seen anything other than stars and satellites at that altitude, and satellites do NOT move like that, nor to meteors.  This was completely erratic and spontaneous movement but seemed very apparent what the craft was trying to do (get away from the other two). I know of only one other person besides my Fiance and I who saw this anomaly and that person has no relation to me and knew nothing of what we saw when she told me, her description is on point to what we saw, and I hope that she chooses to report her sighting as well. We tried to video tape it, however, we only had our phones and neither of them could zoom in close enough to see the lights.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,61.18196014109348,-149.84252680776015

It was around 8 pm June.24.2012 we were still in Smyrna and had just gotten off the ramp by the Nissan plant heading toward where Florence Rd crosses over. *I'm being specific for anyone else who witnessed this in the area. We noticed a single bright light in the sky which we thought was a star or planet (I was sure of that) because it was just sitting there not moving at all and it looked like any other typical star/planet that you'd see on any given night. As I was driving (maybe 2 or 3 miles later) my daughter said it looks like it's moving, I said it could be us driving and it just looks that way. But then to me it did look like it was slightly moving. All of the sudden it began to travel across the sky and downward, gaining speed. I said what the hell? Then I started thinking it was a meteor but I couldn't figure out why it was sitting in the sky like that? After it went from the left to right side of the road and was headed more downward I then pulled over (I was about a quarter mile past Florence Rd). The bright light went out and some smaller lights appeared around it and I could now see a long dark cigar shaped object. It slowed down almost barely moving to a complete stop for about 10 seconds and the lights were changing around the object (changing as in where they were located and from flashing to not flashing) all appeared to be small white lights and then took off again with great speed which I have never seen a plane do and went out of sight just that fast.  I have tried to think of what this was, but after cycling though rational explanations I am left with none. Someone had to of seen this besides us. This object when the bright light went out was very large, we couldn't see the object before that because the light was very bright. I didn't see any wings and there was no sound.  Again I'd like to point out: 1. It was stationary and looked like a star/planet nothing unusual about it. 2. It then moved very fast across and downward falling like a meteor would. 3. The bright light went out and we could see a long dark object with no wings or sound and smaller lights appeared around it. It looked like a mist/veil type glow was around it. Maybe a thin cloud? 4. It hovered, traveled very fast,moved slow and came to a complete stop (things which a plane,star,planet,meteor does NOT do!

I live on Valliant on a corner house. A metalic spherical object just appeared in the direction I was looking. The object was round in shape and pulsating as it got brighter the pulsating looked to be faster. I was looking up at about 30 degrees. I called over the person that just pulled up at the neighbors house to see it and in the time it took her to walk across the street it faded out like a light being turned off and all the sudden it was gone just like that. As we stood there and I was pointing at where it was it re-appeared lower because it flew out farther from me in a North Eastern direction. The lady saw it again as it got brighter for about a minute and stayed stationary in one spot. The girl came out from the house and the lady I was standing with called her over. By the time she got across the street it faded out again and disappeared.It again re-appeared further out as it was going in the NE direction. We all saw it as it started moving a tiny bit and made a short little white broken up comtrail behind it that was kind of broken up then stopped as the trail stopped behind it and sat stationary again then faded out and disappered in the same position it sat stationary. I got two pictures of it when it was at it's furthest away when I ran up stairs to see if I could see it over the houses.I was talking to my mom on my phone and didnt think at the time it was at it's closest to take a picture of it with my phone (DUMB ME I KNOW).

The light seemed to be about 500 feet away from our house, located behind my neighbor’s house.  They both immediately called my father and me. My dad was on the phone so I went to go look at the light from my brother’s bedroom window.  The light seemed to be stationary at first; however it slowly started moving to the north.  We called my father and he watched it with us for roughly two to three minutes.  The light again started moving a little further north for another minute.  Then it began to rise rather quickly. It seemed to be about 60 to 80 feet in the air.  Then it seemed that the light started to get bigger; however it began moving to the west, towards us.  It traveled extremely fast, crossing about 500 feet in a matter of 10 seconds.  As it traveled it produced an extremely loud humming sound.  As it approached our location the bright light seemed to die out! . It crossed in between mine and my neighbor’s house, so to get a better look I ran to the other bedroom down the hallway.  Once I got to the window I looked and seen that it was some sort of aircraft.  The aircraft seemed to be like a cross, with a triangular front.  It seemed to be about 30 feet long, and 15 feet wide.  The sides of the aircraft seemed to be very straight with a point at the end.  It had two antenna-like lights coming off the front end of it and another antenna-like light at the tail end of it.  The antennas were about 7 feet long with a diamond shape light at the end and the lights all a very bright red. At the front of the aircraft, there seemed to be some sort of headlights.  They were dim, but I was still able to notice them quite easily.  There were no lights on the sides of the craft. As the aircraft passed, the bright light it emitted turned on again.  It seemed to be almost like some sort of searchlight and was located behind the headlights.  As the aircraf! t kept traveling west, it just vanished. Almost like a quick f! ade out. I do understand that it is a possibility that it could have been airplane of some sort, however there are a few airports only several miles away from where I live so I see many planes flying by all the time and never experienced any behaving in this fashion with such a bright light or moving with so much noise.  UPDATE: at 12:35 am ET, I heard the loud humming noise once again except I wasn’t able to locate the aircraft or where the sound was coming from. The noise lasted for about 35 seconds and seemed to be moving from north to south.  My brother took several photos of the aircraft and a video; however, it’s a small dot in the pictures and video. Although, you can see how bright the light is compared to the light my neighbor has on the side of his house.

The moonlight wasn't seen in the sky that night and there had been some heat lightening on and off prior to the sighting, but no rain. All of a sudden, there were two large round dull-orange lights in the sky.  As if someone had turned on a flashlight, they just appeared, like that.  They were side by side and large, hanging in the sky, perfectly still/stationary.  They were not blinking, there were no other colors, there was no shape - just a round orb of dull-orange light.  They were shocking to see, they were absolutely too high to be from any ship out there and they were not any ""flares"" or any such thing.  They hung there, side by side - they looked like 2 moons, side by side.  They ""turned on"" suddenly, hung there perfectly still for about 10-15 seconds, and then, as if someone simply turned out a flashlight, they disappeared.  There were no shapes or any other lights whatsoever around these 2 dull-orange balls of light.  Then, after about about 10 minutes or so, a set of three of the same exact lights, not moving, simply appeared (again - as if someone behind the dark sky turned o! n a flashlight) - and they sat there - stationery, not glittering, just sitting there as if three moons, side by side were in the sky, then turned off - again, they lasted only about 15 seconds or so, then turned off.

They were dull-orange orbs that appeared, and disappeared, 3 times within the space of 25-30 minutes time.  They did not ""sparkle"", or blink or anything else. I asked a man fishing in the surf that night if he saw them (after the last set disappeared) and he said that yes, he'd seen them, had no idea what they were, that ""it's just weird"".  He then told me that he and another person witnessed them 2 weeks prior, in the same spot over the ocean.  He did not elaborate on what time that was (2 weeks prior) or how many sets, etc. - he didn't seem to want to talk about it. All of our family on the porch have been going to Kure Beach to vacation for 30 years - never, ever have we ever witnessed anything like this over the night ocean sky - and it was no ship nor any ship signal, it was not a  ""craft"" that we could say, it was simply lights like described, and they didn't ""move."" The other reports I read over the island (Pleasure Island) over the past several years don't exactly describe them as we saw them. We are in awe - and are looking for some sort of logical explanation other than ""military"" or ""alien craft.""  We are logical people and feel there must be a natural phenomenom due to a storm or something else - but what we witnessed, as we did, could clearly, if there were alien craft - be exactly that - much to our discomfort.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,33.9904,-77.9207

Let me first start by saying, I found this site by stumbling on it while trying to find answers to what my son & I witnessed and have witnessed in the past. My son is a 10 year old curious young man who has questions about everything.  So it was no surprise that he would have questions about the lights in the sky that we witnessed together. I myself am a 47 year old male who has experienced some really odd and unexplainable stuff in my life after spending 21 years in the military and serving 13 years as a uniformed police office and 2 years under cover.  I’ve seen just about all the weird stuff, I want to in my life. On July 25, 2012, at approximately 21:00 hours, while fishing in a lake on our property, I observed a solid white light crossing the sky from southwest to northeast.  I pointed the light out to my son, who by far has better eye sight than I do.  The light was so far up that if you didn’t track it, you would lose sight of it.  The light appeared to be moving at a fairly rapid speed as that of a jet plane, but with no flashing lights, the altitude was much higher than what an aircraft could travel. My son & I continued to observe three more lights over the next hour traveling in the same direction at the same speed, matching the same description as the one before it. If it’s a UFO, interesting, if it’s plane or satellite great, we are just looking for answer to what it is.  I have seen these same lights in the sky before, but in another location with my old son who was about 13 at the time. These lights are not something notice by walking out the door of your house and looking up in the night sky.  I’ve only noticed them when concentrating on the night sky in a very dark area without much interference light from surrounding homes.  I don’t think you would notice them unless you are looking for them.  We just want to know what they are, so when we see them again, we have an explanation.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,39.7193,-92.2348

There were several clear patches through the misty clouds (we had a thunder storm not too long ago) and I saw two tiny dots of light. I want to say they were white/bluish in color but because it's a busy street with lights on it I am not 100% sure. also the lights never flashed/blink like a plane would. Now there two lights, going over my head (southbound).  Both distance from each other. However the one further behind started bearing to the left (east bound). The first one still going over my head disappeared behind the clouds.  Since I lost sight of that one I looked for the second one, it went behind a tiny patch of cloud and stop in a clearing. It just stopped, as if hovering then dimmed out. I thought I was seeing things so I looked for the first one  but it was no longer in the path it was going.  The strange things is I looked at the north bound again where I original saw the lights before and there was one in the same spot, just hovering.

This evening at approximately 10:30 P.M. central time, I walked out of my residence in northeastern Louisiana. The moon is very bright and intense, and the entire landscape is bathed with a silver aurora of moonlight. The night air is heavy and dense, but the cloudless night sky is similar to the clarity one experiences on a chilly winter night.  I glanced at the sky very briefly to study how the moon has dimmed the stars, making only the brightest ones clear. The radiance of the moon outshines the majority of the stars towards the west, but to the east, a large portion of the stars are left shinning. It is here in which my gaze was drawn. I was admiring the stars when I noticed two distinct and separate lights moving in the sky.  One was the typical sight of a commercial airliner flying at 30,000 ft.  These are easily distinguished because of their snail-like pace, and how they creep across the night sky, in a steady line, and never change course quickly.  This plane was moving towards the southwest, and was flying at a much higher altitude than the second object. This object I thought as being very peculiar.  It seemed to be at a much, much lower altitude than the airliner, and was at approximately 2000-4000 feet in the sky, and emitted no sound, it featured red, white, and green lights, that functioned as follows: the outside lights were red, the middle lights were white, and the center light was green.  The lights pulsed from the outside toward the inside and were arranged in a horizontal fashion, and allowed for me to follow the craft’s trajectory, while the shape was more ambiguous, it could have been either cigar shaped, or disk-like.  It was flying in a southwest direction, coming from the northeast section of my property, traveling southward diagonally. It flew in a line that went from open air to behind the tree line.  It traveled much more quickly than I have ever seen a plane, and this is what sparked my curiosity.  After it disappeared I went inside and told my mother and brother to come quickly.  Thirty more seconds elapsed, and then the craft came from behind the tree line, changing from a southerly course and began traveling westward towards the moon.  This change of direction is what heightened my curiosity, because the craft seemed to be completing some type of circle.  The UFO went from the visible east skyline, to the visible west skyline traveling at an immense speed, and in under a minute it disappeared into the distance and out of my sight. I am apprehensive to believe this is a craft from another world, because there is an Air Force base in Shreveport within 200 miles of my location.  But this was not a helicopter, commercial air-liner, or weather phenomenon.  I believe in the reality that other beings visit our planet, but there is the doubt that the craft I saw was a form of secret military testing.  I have not to date every seen anything in the sky that resembles this craft.  I am still somewhat shaken from this event, and the shear, silent eeriness that I experienced will not be soon forgotten.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,32.8926,-92.2512

It was an extremely cold day. As I was looking forward in my car with my children, we see a very huge and large object that was very bright, white looking object that was very high up in the air and was about a ½ block away from the school parking lot near the park area intersection.  It looked like a meteor moving across the sky, in a slight curve motion going over the high school.  It dragged a thick, wide, large flames cascading off the round sphere, still bright, with a moving motion tail of flames.  It was clearly visible to all, and very large and very swift.  There had been no explosion as a meteor would or any type of fire to any part of the earth and it was assumed it did not hit the ground. Still idle on baseline road, before you know it, you sense something approaching for about a ½ second or less then appears very large and bright like a flamed sun, white in color, but did not blind you.  I thought there was a possibly we would die if this UFO would come closer to us or land near the intersection causing possibly a nuclear reaction, since I have never experienced anything like this in our lives so extremely close. As we stared, it seemed we saw enough to know this was bizarre and unbelievable.  As it came toward the center of the intersection, it was huge and you could not see behind this entity or the cars on the other side.  Most people were clueless because this thing is swift.  You have to have seen it when it appears at that time till it departs or else you only see a small flash instead.  Well that UFO went toward the left direction so swift, and toward the street Vineyard up and up swiftly over the houses and it was gone, and did not even hit a car or a home or the street; as I expected some type of landing or explosion or impact of some sort.  This UFO is hard to explain the movements as it seemed like to appear like magic and disappear swiftly. As I began to proceed toward the high school very slowly staring at the sky for another appearance; because I was afraid it would hit the school or start part of the school on fire. I thought by now calls would be sent to 911 or NASA by now; possibly earlier sightings. As I drive and enter inside the front of the school, near their steps, we all see the sighting toward the lot high above the teacher’s parking lot near the store market Stater Brothers, which is opposite of which I came.  Several students on the steps saw the great ball of light, such a beautiful sighting. I alert the school, they think it has to do with the winds and the power lines falling which was reported by school security guards; they are getting several calls at the main office & other phones.  I still am worried that this UFO will eventually decide to land if it wants to, and when it does, I know something will catch on fire and I was worried it might be the school. I came to the conclusion since we saw the sphere come down baseline, it was on the left side of the road and there were the power lines that the school was talking about.  It must have hit the power lines and caused something.  The school had the fire truck and officers eventually block that area.  The description one security guard gave was that there was a Flash on the power lines and was reported. It became very windy, extreme cold weather and a bright sun near the school. I am driving along Euclid Ave going toward Upland city and I had my window of my car rolled up and I could feel the heat of the sun.  When I began looking at the sun, I noticed it was so extremely bright, that caused my eyes to see dark circles as I randomly stared at it.  There was unusual large stream of rays coming off the sides of the sun in all it’s circumference which was also shinning white, and extremely bright.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,34.131319269776874,-117.57976085192698

On January 14th around 6pm my 8 year old daughter let our 9 month old male dog (Australian Healer) outside via our sliding glass doors that face the backyard, and woods. I was standing behind my daughter, the sliding door was open about a foot, we were standing just barely inside the open door, waiting for the dog to finish.  My daughter shouted in excitement,""look mom, a shooting star"".  I changed my gaze from the dog to her direction and saw a star shaped lighted object; it was traveling East to west and had a flaming trail coming from it; the object hovered for a few seconds just above our cotton wood tree and then continued in a downward pattern, heading east. It was hard to tell how big the! entire object was because it was very dark. It is odd that our dog never barked at it, or tried to chase it; a cattle dog chases everything.  My daughter did get a longer look then I did and has been drawing pictures of it. In addition; there were some odd occurrences at our home around 2am that same day. Loud noises outside, the security lights going off, rattling and banging noises on my 20 year old daughter's window well cover, the dog growling and barking at the back sliding doors at nothing and then he would run to the front and bark.

When I walked outside to join my girlfriend  on our back porch at approximately 8pm local time tonight, Monday January 14, 2013, she said, ""I just saw a bunch of orange lights, hovering out by the casino.""   I replied, ""Yeah, sure you did.""   I sat with her, lit a cigarette and about a minute or two later, they appeared again. At first, two lights appeared almost simultaneously, followed by two more lights a minute later and a fifth not long after.  The lights were a deep orange, a color I don’t ever recall seeing on an aircraft, and the size of the lights was much greater than that I have ever seen on any aircraft, as well. The moon was clearly visible, as were many stars on this clear evening, and while they were much smaller than any moon I have ever seen, they were also much larger than any star I have ever seen. We spend a LOT of time on our back porch and see aircraft every day, both during the day and at night.  Having been stationed at NAS Fallon, NV for 3 years, I’ve seen many aircraft, and these lights appeared and behaved like no aircraft I have ever seen before. From the time I first saw them, there were from one to five lights at between 180 and 200 degrees from our location, and in my opinion they were no more than two or three thousand feet above ground level. Angle of elevation was very slight, maybe 15 or 20 degrees at most. The lights were almost stationary, but comparing their positions with fixed objects on the ground, they WERE moving very slowly.  They never appeared to change elevation during the 20-30 minutes in which they were visible.  Having spent two years aboard USS OAK HILL as a part of the Navigation/Administration department, I spent many hours on the bridge wings, taking bearings of fixed objects ashore to triangulate our position, and there are many lights on the ground in the direction these lights were, making it easy to determine if they were moving.  They WERE moving, but hardly at all. The light were generally moving from right to left looking almost due south, BUT while the lights often appeared as pairs, these pairs were constantly moving in relation to one another. At one point, two of the lights appeared to merge, and then separate as if one was moving slightly faster than the other. According to Flight Service Station Phoenix, winds were either northerly or northeasterly, but it was stated that this was for elevations between 3,000 and 34,000 feet and these lights were lower than that, in my estimation. About 5 minutes after alerting our next-door neighbors, the lights disappeared and did not return.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,33.055867567567574,-112.05598918918919

Driving home along a fairly straight road last night, I saw a bright, brilliantly white light approx. 20' above the tree line about 200 yards to my 1:00.  There was also a loud, grating noise, which I initially thought was coming from my car, but upon rolling down my window, I determined it was coming from somewhere further away.  From what I could see, there was no discernable shape to the light. I live about a mile from the ocean in a heavily wooded suburban area with mostly summer residences (so about 90% of the homes in the area are empty in the winter), and there are no parking lots or shopping centers around that would emit any kind of light. As I continued driving, I kept an eye on the unusual light, noticing that the noise got louder as I got closer to it.  About 1/2 mile after I first spotted the light, the road takes a sharp bend to the left.  Making this turn, I'd have thought, would have positioned the light behind my right shoulder, but I lost sight of it.  The noise, however, was still quite loud. The road I live on, which is a narrow, dark, dirt road, is now about 100 yards away on the right.  As I made the turn onto my street, I was astounded to find the light was now at my 11:00, about 100 yards away, still approx. 20' above the trees.  My road is riddled with potholes, so one must drive quite slowly, and my house is about 150 yards down the road.  As I got closer to my driveway, which is on the right, I watched the light begin to creep forward, getting closer to the end of my driveway.  The noise, also, was getting louder.  I, irrationally, turned off my headlights, because I began to get scared, and pulled hurriedly into my driveway; the light was now only about 25 yards from the end of my driveway.  I parked my car and gathered up my belongings as quickly as I could and ran to the end of my deck, which overlooks the driveway and front yard.  However, in the time it took for me to turn around and register the fact that the light had now reached the end of my driv! eway, the noise disappeared and the light, which had been extremely slow moving, suddenly jettisoned off to my left, leaving only a long streak of residual light.

I had gone to see some friends play in their band. I was not drinking that night, because the night before was my birthday and I had a terrible hangover, so I was not about to drink again that night.  Once a week was enough for me!  Anyway, I turned on to a road that was the last mile to my home, where the speed limit was 50mp.  About 1/4 of a mile down the road, I glanced up to the right, through my sunroof, because something caught my eye. I noticed an object moving up along side of me, at a high rate of speed & I got the feeling it was trying to catch up with me. By the time I got to my street to turn into my subdivision, it had caught up with me.  As I turned on to the street it began to stop & remained stationary above the area I needed to go to, to get to the street I lived on.  When I first spotted the object I dismissed it as an airplane, because when I glanced at i! t I noticed a red & blue light, and because it was running in the same flight path as all the other airplanes that come into the city. (But what didn't dawn on me at the time was that it was running in the opposite direction, and it was going way to fast to be an airplane.)   As I coasted to a stop, I realized it was no airplane. Upon further observation, I could see that the red light was larger and darker than an airplane's & the blue light was larger & darker as well, & they were positioned side by side.  As I sat there wondering what this thing was, I thought maybe if I turned my headlights off, I could get a better look at it.  After I turned my lights off, it turned its lights off too! I rolled my window down some and realized there was no sound coming from it. Now it had been raining that night so there were some clouds in the area, but there was enough light from the moon that I could see the shape of the object. Which appeared to be saucer shaped. As ""we"" sat! there, it rose in the air a little and sat by a low hanging c! loud and then disappeared behind it. I realize now that it was waiting for me to turn my lights back on.

I actually submitted this report to a South African UFO organization sometime ago,but unfortunately I never recived a response. At the time of this sighting,my family and I were living in a suburb of East London in the Cape Province. Early one evening just before dusk,my son who was about 8 years old at the time,were sat outside reading.Although I cannot recall the actual month,I guess it must have been spring or early summer time,as we were outside on a very pleasant cloudless  and calm evening. My son said to me, ""Look Dad,there's an aeroplane"". I looked up,but what I saw was no aeroplane. The best description I can give is that it was a flourescent orb flying from west to east/south east at tremendous speed. As I was observing this,my son then said ""There's another one coming!"" and almost immediately thereafter ""and another one!"" Incredibly,these three orbs were following each other equidistantly in a controlled manner and didn't appear to be descending.Although it's difficult to judge what height they were at and what distance they were away from us,I would estimate at approximately 1,000 feet and probably no more than 1 mile away. There was absolutely no sound from them at all and as I say,their speed was tremendous.All in all from them coming into view to disappearing over the horizon towards the Indian Ocean,was probably no more than 5 seconds! I have been interested in aviation and related topics all my life and I can assure everybody who may read this,that no aircraft either then or now is capable of such speeds. Out of curiosity the following morning,I contacted the local newspaper to enquire if anybody else had reported this.Apparantly many people had,but obviously the newspaper could not offer an explanation what these UFO's were.They did publish a small article relating to this sighting a couple of days afterwards. It seems incredible now in these days of heightened security throughout the world of aviation,but the person I spoke to at the newspaper offered me the telephone number of the control tower at the local commercial airport to see if anybody there could offer an explanation. The guy I spoke to at the airport was very forthcoming with the information he gave me and I recall him telling me that although he hadn't been on duty the previous evening,a colleague of his had made a log entry that the UFO's had passed relatively close to the airport.He also told me that it was noted that the flight crew of a South African Airways Boeing 737 had contacted the control tower to report the UFO's!! Not being a computer buff,I cannot say that I have literally trawled the internet searching for further information of this sighting,but on the few occasions I have looked,unfortunately,I have not been able to find anything at all. What prompted me to report this incident to you was your report and graphics from Seattle,WA dated March 19 2006. Although this graphic only depicts one sphere,it is virtually identical to the three we saw. Hope this is of interest to you and good luck with your ongoing activities.",2012-05-29T00:00:00,,

I returned home and waited for them to come around the block. At approximately 6:55 p.m. I went to the kitchen window which faces the street in front of our home. The whole street was dark except for the Halloween lights and lite up pumpkins that people had turned on for the occasion.  But to my surprise, I witnessed more then just Halloween lights that night.  For there above my neighbors home, a crossed the street, were two large balls of white light blinking on and off, stationary in the sky.  When one would blink on the other would go off, and when the one that was on would go off, the other would come on.  They did this alternately for about 2 minutes and in perfect time!  One was a bit higher then the other, and after about 2 minutes of this, it lowered so it was parallel with the other.  Then they did a most ! unusual thing, they moved slowly together and became one ball of light.  Then they slowly moved away to the southeast, and as it moved it changed colors from red to blue and green.  At the time I had three pumpkins on my porch lite up and one of them was blinking on and off, and I can't help but wonder if that is the reason they chose to blink on and off like they did.",2012-05-29T00:00:00,43.61444520153551,-116.24467802303263

This report shall include only six experiences, three of which have witnesses. I do recognize that its arrival to you is not in a timely fashion as one would expect, yet its relevance to today is key. One experience considered A by this report took place in 1966 while outside my grandmother’s house in Texas.  As my brothers, sister and myself were playing in the summer evening, we were playing hide and seek. The spot to count was at the front steps of the the front portch of the house. After counting, I said ready or not here I come!  What took place next as I glanced up to the peak of my grandmother’s house, I noticed a light. What seemed interesting to me was that it appeared to be coming closer. I watched as the light grew larger as it appeared to be coming directly to me. I wasn’t afraid but curious. It suddenly was directly above the house approximately 50ft in the air. It was completely silent. What I saw was a craft about the size of the house, I know this because it hovered above moving forward as if it was looking at me. I was able to see all the detail and other lights of different colors. As I looked at its detail while it hovered forward which lasted about thirty seconds, it quickly shot upward disappearing. I saw, they thought it silly and discounted it as childhood imagination. Another incident considered B of this report took place on February 9, 1971 in California. I had turned eight the day before, which really didn’t change anything. It seemed I was always in trouble. That evening nothing really changed. I remember observing the T.V. glow coming through the closed door jam while crying myself to sleep. Close Encounter: February 9, 1971  I awoke from deep sleep - - - somehow completely awake. It was dark as all the lights were out. I looked at the closed door in silence. I didn’t know why I suddenly became awake, but what did become apparent was that the closed door became transparent and disappeared. I was able to see the coffee table and the couch in the living room. As I looked I could hear what I recognize as energy becoming present accompanied by a light. The light expanded from the midst of the living room completely filling its area with a pure white presence. Nothing else became visible in its presents. I sat upon my bed, I remember looking at my hands being lightened up by the light. The lights refective beauty was only visible upon the bunk bed I was on. While looking directly into the light, I couldn’t help but feeling closeness, as if I was seeing an old friend. The light was not blinding, as its presence expressed peace. After a few minutes of what I call a light bath, the bed moved. I looked upward and noticed my brother glancing to look down at me. It was obvious that he too, was witnessing the light. He looked toward the light as if wondering about its presents. He also wasn’t fearful. He glanced back at me as if to verify what he was witnessing. It felt good to see his smile as he noticed the smile on my face. We both smiled. In a little while my brother and I witnessed the light implode. Its memory is unforgettable. The importance of what took place was a question to my mind, but it would not provide relevance until later that morning. By naïve perception, its reality couldn’t be comprehended by those whose experience it wasn’t. Within myself I recognized its significance, but could others? My brother and myself tried telling our father about what had happened, but he didn’t believe us. February 9, 1971 at 6:02 a.m. The Sylmar earthquake 6.6-7. Reagan declared state of emergency. I remember the aftershocks continuing through-out the morning. I knew within my being that it was related. The light imparted that seed of reality. A communication if you will as that which would be unfolded in the future. As a child I was yet to recognize the importance of that experience, even though the reality of the experience existed in what was unfolding. Was it a glimpse of what the future could experience?  Are we destined to that result by our ignorance of the reality of the essence of the light?  A universal secret was that communication which would reveal itself in proper time to be united with another experience in the future. I needed first to experience the result of its misuse by mankind. March 1971 C:  Approximately one month had gone by. My father had decided to move the beds around after the earthquake. No longer on the bunk bed, I was now sleeping on a twin close to the window. I awoke to see a light orb appear in the room. It was small in size, approximately the size of a basketball. It was floating silently in the air. Because of the experience of February 9th, and the ridicule I experienced by my father, I was unsure of what to do. I pulled my cover over me and waited a couple of minutes. Bringing the cover back down that I can see, I noticed it was gone. I fell back to sleep. About a week later, another orb appeared just as before only it was hovering moving slowly left to right. Instead of pulling the sheet over me I turned my back, that I face away closing my eyes, hoping it would go away as before. After a few minutes, I turned to see it was gone. I fell asleep. Approximately one week later it happened again. This time remembering how the light of February 9th and how I wasn’t afraid, I decided to watch what it does. As I watched, it floated in the air silently slowly traveling to each of from my brother’s beds.  What was it doing? I wondered. Soon it was at the foot of my bed where it stopped. I looked at its light wondering what it would do next. It was obviously trying to show me something. But what? I then noticed that it began to travel very slowly alongside my bed. It was coming closer in a way not to alarm me. As it approached close to where my head was resting I positioned myself to get a better look. It hovered along side as I looked at it. As I was facing its presence, It inched forward closer to my head resting only about four inches from my face. I looked at it with no fear, but with curiosity. What was it seeing? And what part did I have to do with it? After about two minutes it disappeared. I was now in the darkness of the night. I lay there, wondering if I should say anything. I soon fell asleep. Nothing of this nature would happen again, except that I would experience moments of seeing into the future as if the light imparted within me a gift, which I know is a different subject than UFO’s, but it is related. Beginning in the month of April 2001 a motivation toward numbers began within me. I was compelled to write it down. What would soon unfold was a sequence of numbers I’m sure was imparted to me February 9, 1971 but held dormant until this process, and that its essence I would discover was base providing germ concept as source to all sacred within all religions. It even reflected the floor plan of the temple at Luxor. What I soon realized, was that its structure had been used by all ancient peoples and was not limited to religion. I developed various charts to show there correlation with number. August 16, 2001, D: While outside in my yard, my wife and I were staring up at the night sky, when a light was moving up above in was coming downward. It stopped as if noticing my telling my wife to look. It began to slowly move westward, I mention to my wife that it was as if it was knowledgeable of us looking at it. It immediately shot away. (Channeling) September 1, 2001 E: While instructing my wife to dial my ex-wife that I may talk to her, she accidentally dialed 911 instead of the area code 915, she hung up, Immediately a call came back from the call center asking if we dialed 911, she told them it was an error. I confirmed that it was an error. They said that an officer would never the less show up to verify. It frustrated me that they wouldn’t listen. I walked over and leaned against a shelf, while my wife was on the phone with them. The shelf dislodged and collapsed, causing a crashing noise. The woman on the other end of the phone asked what that noise was. We tried explaining what it was, and that no officers were needed. She said they were outside. They verified that nothing was wrong and left. Suddenly as if being channeled through my mind was a warning. I immediately told my wife to call back as I had a real EMERGENCY to reveal. After contacting dispatch I proceed to describe that something terrible was about to take place and that thousands were going to die. That there would be twenty bombers involved. Details are on the 911 recording. I was instructed to tell the responding officers. The responding supervisor with the local sheriff’s office heard me out. He told me that there was nothing he could do. As far as he was concerned, he hadn’t heard anything from his bossed to forewarn about something about to happen. I pleaded with him to listen, as this was very real. I’m sure he thought I was crazy. He chose to ignore what I was saying. As they walked away, I pleaded with them to listen and do something. They said there is nothing they could do, as they got into their patrol cars. I began to yell at the top of my lungs, “Your wrong, Your wrong, people are going to die. They never the less drove off. We all know what happened n September 11 2001. F: April 11, 2002  Being outside in our yard with my son, my wife and my two dogs, I was looking up at the clouds. They looked normal as cloud cover could be, but they began to change, becoming a blanket of clouds in square formations. Much more than I have explained in the past, I give detail here. Within me was a confidence of peace and discovery, for I welcomed its appearance. I recognized that something was not in the realm of natural expression.. A power not recognized was manipulating the clouds structure. What power established this I asked myself. Soon it developed two points of rotation which was witnessed by my son. Its development gave expression of creation process as I would discover. (The summary process is described within a publication) I needed to bring this knowledge into our current reality. What ultimately took place, was that which can be likened from Isaiah 44:8: 		“Drop down from above O heavens and let the cloud pour down righteousness. Let the earth open and let salvation bear fruit and let righteousness sprout together. [……] Woe to him who fights with his former”    I really do care what you do with this report. What is done about it will reflect the future of mankind. It is a choice after all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This light appeared to be a white, glittering (like a hand-held sparkler firework) spherical-shape and about twice the size of a basketball.  It was about 30 feet off the ground, and parallel to my window (on 2nd story of house), maybe two feet from my window.  I did not approach the window, but stared at the light from my position in the bed. This light was on the western side of the house, which sits at the crest of a hill and looks towards downtown Bellevue and Lake Washington, beyond that.  There are tall pine trees in the backyard, and the light was between a pine tree that is close to the house (maybe 10 feet from the window) and the window.  So, whatever this was, it had to maneuver around many trees to take up the location close to my window.   It made absolutely no sound, but was not menacing or frightening in any way. The light suddenly disappeared after about 2 or 3 minutes. I have since moved from that house, but lived there until 2007.  That light re-visited the same location at least three other times, always between 2am and 4am, between this first event in January 2005 and May 2007. One daytime UFO event did occur at the same house, around 4pm on/about May 19th, 2005, when a round, small, red-orange orb floated across the sky, being chased by a seagull.  The gull would try to grasp it, and the object would move away from it. I observed them for  a few minutes, as they moved above adjacent yards, then, above mine, and eventually above our cul-de-sac.  They were maybe 50 feet above the ground.  The orb was reddish-orange, and had a non-reflective, matte, surface. It had darker, circular spots on it.  I initially thought it might be an escaped red party balloon, but it was too round, and did not appear to have a valve/place where air would have been put into it and no tie, no string, no irregularity to the roundness.  It was about the size of a basketball. Suddenly, both the gull and red orb disappeared, in the middle of a large open area above our street. I thought I must have blinked and they changed direction and headed behind some trees, but they could not have traversed the distance to the trees in a heartbeat, and I did not see them beyond or between the trees.  This frightened me so much, I went indoors and went up to the second story to look out the window for them, for awhile, but never saw them again. They truly just seemed to have vanished!",2012-05-29T00:00:00,47.604556307692306,-122.16441774358974

We were driving on I-8 early in the morning through Arizona, outside Yuma I believe it was. I do know there was an airbase in the distance, close to the border, if I'm not mistaken. Straight ahead there were very bright amber lights I kept seeing go on, then off..over again. I thought I was seeing things. Then I thought it was a plane flying really low or something. It did that 3x before I finally realized my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. I asked my husband who was driving if he had seen them, but he had not. They blinked on and off rather quickly at first. However, as we got closer he finally saw what I had, but this time there were several lights that had went on at once, and they stayed on longer than before and then some would go off slowly, while others turned off quickly..if that makes sense. We drove closer to the object, so apparently it was sitting still. We came up on it rather fast. We were slightly elevated from the hill we were driving over, if I remember correctly, and the object was in the flat desert area. That's when we saw the object close to the ground in full view, near the highway. There was no one on the highway but us at the time from what I remember. It frightened us once we got close enough to it. It was massive. The lights were incredibly bright, but you could look right at them. It was so big. The amber glow was nothing like I've seen before. Maybe 5-6 lights..they kept going off and on, but not in succession like one right next to the other. I don't know for sure if it was a pattern per say, it just wasn't the same every time is what I mean. My husband actually became startled and he pulled over immediately since it seemed as though we would drive next to it if we went further. I'd say we were about 1/4 mile away. We got out of the car immediately, and then we heard jets overhead. We counted 4? They were in a V pattern initially from what we could tell, then they scattered overhead. The object was illuminated slightly by a large light that was next to the highway, and there were some lights next to the water storage units that we had parked by in order to get out of view. The object was dark metallic in color, I'd say like pewter. Absolutely no sound, no dust from the sand underneath. It was larger than a commercial plane I'm guessing, maybe twice as big?  After the jets scrambled, we looked back at the disk(?), which was rounded in the front, although we couldn't make out if it was round completely, just the front of it was bowed. I saw things on top, but they weren't sticking out. It looked more like welded doors maybe, I dunno for sure. It happened rather fast, and it was hard to believe what we were seeing. We didn't have a camera or recording device..and honestly, that wasn't the first thing we thought to grab at that time. I don't even remember how we got to the other side of the highway. All I remember is that there was a water storage area next to the highway, and it kind of hid us from view. I think my husband just didn't want us to be spotted, that's how startled he was (and he rarely gets startled). I just remember rushing to get out of view and that we wanted to turn our lights off as soon as we could so that we didn't draw any attention to ourselves. After we looked back down at the disk from looking at the jets, it literally...I mean literally...vanished before our eyes.  No dust.  No sound.  No hovering and then shooting off...NO NOTHING! We literally saw it vanish!  How is this possible?  Has anyone saw this before, how can something vanish as if it were never there? It was so big, and then nothing.  The jets were still flying overhead, and then they finally left.  We were both just stunned..and then drove on as soon as we could to get away from the area. We actually didn't talk about it the rest of the way to our destination..I still cannot believe what happened.  We've only told very close family what happened. I've never seen one that close before, nor vanish before my eyes.  I will never in my life forget the color of those lights.  The most brilliant beautiful amber, so crystal clear..incredibly crisp light..yet it didn't hurt my eyes to look at them.

I just figured we aren't all that exists and if intervention ever happened, the entities sent would be from a material plane like ours so they'd need vehicles. Then one morning around 6 am, I was heading outside to walk my dog. I sat on the bench near the front door to put on my shoes. I heard calm, deep male voice say, “Look to the South."" I wasn't afraid or even questioned the existence of the voice outside myself but said dismissively, ""I don't even know which way South is.""  The voice said just as calm and repeated, ""Look to the South."" I said ""OK"" and finished putting on my shoes and went outside. I went to the end of my driveway, looked up (which was actually North West but South might have meant up). There was a bright orange star. Brighter than I had ever seen. I thought, ""There isn't a morning star in that direction. Wait is that a star?"" and in that second it rushed down toward me and got as big as the sky. Its surface was moving like the sun. I was gold, orange and warm yellow swirling with “energy”. Then the instant I smiled at it in wondrous awe, it shot straight up and out of sight into the outer atmospheres and was gone. It left more North West than its current position so I saw it zip away. Believe it or not, I had no initial response to the event. I turned south and went on my walk. I said out loud, ""Gee thanks. “and then said,”  You said HI to me"". But as I walked I kept looking back to that spot in the sky and smiling to myself.  As I walked along I replayed the three minutes over in my head and that is finally when ego began having a conversation with me about it. I wanted to question its purpose, origin, and meaning.  But then realized it was just an acknowledgement of some kind and had no more meaning than those I placed upon it.  I just accepted it as a personal experience. The next two years were the most trying of my life; a complete destruction of all my ego attachments and ego identifiers.  But whenever I felt very alone, confused, overwhelmed and frightened about the drastic changes occurring around me, I always remembered that I had a nod from whatever is ""more"" and could gently release my attachment to the outcome of so much change.",2012-05-29T00:00:00,36.86390063694268,-119.65213566878982

The objects were sound less and if you were to take a just a glace to see what it was, would appear to be helicopters.  However, as I drove East on Upriver Drive just by Pasadena Elementary School, the objects were flying at about 120 feet in elevation from the ground, the one that was further away (so on the side closest to the river) disappeared as I came upon the elementary school.  The second object was flying slowly directly over me, I was able to see the object as it passed directly over my vehicles about 15 feet above the tree line. I stopped my vehicle on the side of the road and there was nothing but silence in the air, the object seem to glide slowly across the sky.  From this vantage point, I was able to see the shape of the craft in the air.  It resembled an egg with lights.!  There was a light coming from the bottom of the craft as well as a band of lights that went around the middle. I passed Argonne Ave. and noticed that the object that had flown directly over me was now following me as I continued my drive towards Sullivan Ave.  As I approached Arbor Crest Winery, the object was hovering over the hill to the East of Hutton Settlement.  That is when I really saw a good outline of the object. It was egg shaped but flying with the fat end front and the smaller rounded tip was to the rear. It was approximately 30 feet long and at least half that tall. It was dark in color with a single white light illuminating the earth from beneath.  I sat in my car for at least 3 minutes watching this object just hover there, when it turned towards me and my vehicle and the white lights that made up the ""belt"" of the object became extremely bright as did the single light on the bottom of the object. At 0438 HLT there is no natural light in the sky at that time in this time of year, however, the object's light illuminated the sky and surrounding area so well you wo! uld've thought it was the middle of the day. It was the brightest white light that I have ever had the opportunity to witness. As it reached the peak of brightness (after 5 seconds or so) it just disappeared completely, like it was flying in hyper-speed from the space movies. I, being absolutely baffled, started my car back up and continued East towards Sullivan Ave. As I came up on Plante's Ferry Park (located literally just around the corner from the Arbor Crest Winery), I noticed the other object had returned and was off in the distance about 400 feet away in the Southern sky at an altitude of approx 150 feet. As my car approached the softball diamonds on my Right hand side, that object illuminated bright and disappeared just as the other object. It was so bright I could see the four (4) diamonds, the play area for kids, and the puddles on the dirt in the infield. This morning was overcast and dark, I couldn't see anything until the light shone on the field. This was at approximately 0440 HLT. Since Saturday December 8th, 2012 I have been lucky enough to witness 2 separate events. What's going on?",2012-12-20T00:00:00,,

On September 19, 2012, while talking on the phone in my sunroom, at around 10:00 p.m., I saw two, round, orange lights in the sky coming from the south east.  It looked so unusual because they were traveling so close to one another.  At first I thought it was a double reflection in the glass of my glass door.  This door is on the right side of my sunroom.  One light was following the other, moving at a slow steady pace.  The best I could describe them is two full moons, the size of which is when the moon is higher in the sky and not at the horizon.  These lights however were about as high as a low flying airplane going overhead. At first I thought maybe they were two airplanes heading towards the airport since they were in the part of the sky of the air traffic pattern I see so often.   However, the two lights were moving towards the north, which would be the direction of downtown Pittsburgh and not the airport.  I opened the glass sliding door to possibly hear a jet engine, but there was no sound at all.  It was a very clear night and you could see a lot of stars. I quickly hung up the phone and grabbed my camera which was close by.  I then went to another sliding door which faces the backyard to take pictures.  By this time it was directly over my backyard at about a 65 degree angle.  I didn’t have any lights on in the room I was in, so I frantically thought I was snapping pictures when I realized I was in video mode and was turning my camera off and on.  I then turned on the outside light to see my camera settings and then started taking a video clip.  The two lights were starting to fade in the distance and they were now looking white and not orange with my naked eye. I then went to my computer and started to search for any information I could find to see if anyone else saw this.  It was not reported in the news. Today I called KDKA, one of the local TV stations to see if anyone else reported seeing the two orange lights in the sky and they said no, I was the only one.  They would not be able to take me seriously unless they had more than one call. I checked a compass to see what the approximate directions the two lights traveling. To my best ability the lights I saw came from the southeast sky on the compass reading 27/150 traveling northwest on the compass reading 60/340. I would like to know what exactly I saw that night.

This sphere rose up past the profile of the house, and very clearly hovered there, If you can imagine a frozen, elevated, hovering, firework. As if it were shot off then froze. it was very clear. the orange lights were illuminating from the orange sphere itself, and in the center like  I said, a triangle, fiery orange as well, but clear through binoculars... Like an orange being held in the sky, with orange lights all around the outside, not like a ring, ALL OVER, like lightbulbs almost, not spinning....and i could see through to the center, the triangle..I even went oputside and stood on a lawn chair in the yard to get a better look..

We had already been star gazing for 15-20 minutes or so, and we were looking at the constellation Scorpius (to our South-West I believe). All of a sudden, a light (just like a star) was moving through Scorpius at a steady pace (which must have been very quickly, because this light/object was so far away, it seemed like a star moving). I pointed to the light/object moving through the constellation we were looking at, and my husband confirmed that he saw it too.  We were silent as we watched it move, and within 8-10 seconds the light/object slowly faded from existence.  We looked at each other wide-eyed, and then stared back at the area of sky around Scorpius for another 5 minutes and never saw it again. The light/object covered about the distance of 6 inches across the sky before it started fading and eventually disappeared.  The light/object moved in exactly a straight direction, and as it disappeared it was still moving in the same straight direction. It was a cloudless night until after midnight, so the light/object didn’t disappear behind clouds. My husband is Army and has been on multiple types of helicopters.  It was unlike a shooting star, meteor, helicopter, jet, commercial airliner we’ve seen, and we’ve seen all types of aircraft on Oahu; this wasn’t one of them.

The object would then rapidly change course and head to the north or several times appearing to reverse direction or wobble side to side but in a very rapid fashion.  We observed the object doing these short bursts and also observed it stand completely still.

I looked in the direction that they were looking and that is when I saw three distinct bright lights moving erratically in the sky towards the northwest. It was cloudy and I quickly looked around the sky to see nothing else – no stars – no moon – just these lights.  I couldn’t believe what I was seeing – all I knew is that I have never seen an airplane or helicopter that moved like this.  These lights were oval in shape, seemed to have form and were not transparent, smaller than a full moon but larger than a star or planet in the sky.  They w! ere changing color from blue to green to yellow to orange-red and pulsated.  The three lights were independently moving up, down, in circles, from left to right in no particular pattern and they were leaving a light trail behind them as they moved. Like they were moving so quickly I was seeing a trail not like a rocket trail or an exhaust trail from an airplane.  The best way to describe it is if you have a glow stick and are waving it around at night – you see a trail of light behind it.

I would compare their flickering and changing color to watching fireflies in the summer.  When they got dimmer they almost seemed to disappear and then re-appeared bright blue-white.  The longer I watched the more I realized I was definitely not lookin! g at an aircraft. All of the sudden the three independent lights formed a line and stopped moving. To the naked eye they seemed to be in equal spacing from each other. It was at that point that I realized my ears stopped ringing and my left ear no longer hurt. I briefly took my eyes off of the lights since my dogs finally decided to run over to me and when I looked back up the experience just got more bizarre! These three stationary lights now had balls of light dropping from them!!   Or maybe falling from them? I couldn’t tell how far they were falling because my house and a tree were blocking my view.  At this point I panicked and decided I needed to run to my front yard to get a better view and I kept watching because I didn’t want to miss anything – I just felt compelled to keep watching because I wanted to figure out what I was seeing and quite honestly watching something fall from these lights just scared me!  I had a ton of thoughts running through my head – “are these bombs? I’m not h! earing any explosions – why am I not hearing an explosion? If these aren’t bombs – what the heck are they?” As I got on the other side of my gate and latched it behind me my ears started ringing again and the balls of light dropping from the other lights had stopped. I ran and stood in my front yard now and was trying to decide if the dropping balls of light had disappeared behind other trees or just disappeared in the sky.  I certainly didn’t hear anything explode – I didn’t hear any sound just the ringing in my ears. I just couldn’t tell and I had lost sight of the objects for a few seconds while running. Then I see two more orbs of light coming from opposite ends of the sky – streaking across the sky. One from the northeast and the other from the southwest – they momentarily stopped and then darted into the line with the other three lights, lining up on either end of the other three. Now there were five bright lights in a line, in the sky and coincidence or not – they stopped moving my ears stopped ringing! They did not appear to be moving and they were staying in a line with each other all the while changing colors – blue to green to yellow, then orange-red then dim then repeating that sequence. It was then that I noticed they were not changing colors together but it did seem synchronized though. My rational mind was trying to determine if there was a pattern to the lights when they all just abruptly started moving erratically – just as the first three did and then both ears were back to ringing and my left ear seemed to be taking the brunt of it. This is when I had the first thought of “is someone else seeing this?” And then I was debating with myself that it’s only 10PM – someone else has to be seeing this! My dogs were barking as were a few other dogs I could hear besides my own. As quickly as all five objects were moving – all five stopped and darted back into a line. From five different areas in the sky and all of the sudden they are lined up again in the matter of a seco! nd or two! That kind of startled me and I’m thinking, “now what?” and a little bit of panic was setting in. I literally was waiting for all five of these objects to start dropping light balls or start changing color since that is what happened before but that didn’t happen.  Instead I see another object approaching and it was moving much slower and seemed to be a lot closer to the ground than the other objects. I’m watching this wondering if it’s going to join the other five lights or even shoot it. That was a scary thought! As quickly as I had that thought all five objects flashed brightly or got bigger (almost looking like a glowing aura) and then just went straight up in the sky and disappeared. I couldn’t tell if they disappeared in clouds or just disappeared completely.  My ears did not ring when they moved this time and I’m not sure why? The one object still was in the sky and as it got closer I could see it, hear it and identify it as an airplane. This whole experience lasted somewhere between 5-10 minutes. I wish that I could be more accurate, but honestly, I lost track of time while all of this was going on.  It’s every unsettling and has left me with more questions. I don’t know what I saw.  All that I do know is that stories like this are SO easy to dismiss until they happen to you and hopefully in my lifetime I will have the answers that I now seek.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,,
Object with three orange lights hovering over cruise ship and shoreline in Puget Sound,Puget Sound,WA,2012-08-09T23:30:00,unknown,2 hours,"Occurred : 8/9/2012 23:30  (Entered as : 08/09/12 23:30) Reported: 8/13/2012 9:37:45 PM 21:37 Posted: 8/19/2012 Location: Puget Sound/Seattle, WA Shape: Unknown Duration:2 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91802.html,"Object with three orange lights hovering over cruise ship and shoreline in Puget Sound It was the last night of our 8 days Alaska cruise on August 9, 2012 aboard Royal Caribbean’s Rhapsody of the Seas.  We were sailing southeast, based on positions of the Dippers, at low speed from Victoria, BC to Seattle, WA at 11:30 PM.  We would pick up local port pilot at 12:30 AM to enter Puget Sound en-route to Seattle.  I could see some shoreline lights to the port (left) side of our ship. When I checked maps after arriving home, the shoreline must be Ebey’s Landing, WA and we were 2.8 miles from the shore. Deck 9 Solarum is a large sunroom with an indoor swimming pool, a food bar, and tables and chairs for guests to relax and eat food.  Clear lookout windows occupy entire left and right sides of the room. I was sitting at a table near a window panel with my wife and a friend, chatting. Not far from us were eight teenagers, probably made friends during the cruise and didn’t want to go back to staterooms too early on the last night of the cruise. There were five or six other people in the Solarum at the time and three crewmembers. At around 11:30 PM, all the teenagers jumped up from their seats and lined up the windows, looking out. Two adult guests away from us also rushed to the windows. I first thought they saw a whale in the dark, sighting whales had been one exciting thing to do on this cruise. I stood up casually and looked out the window, and there was this craft with bright orange lights hovering over front starboard (right) side of the ship. I ran quickly up to deck 10 to get an open view, this craft has three bright orange lights forming a triangle, inside the triangle are smaller circulating lights forming a circle. The craft was absolutely silent, I looked at it for about 5 seconds and pulled out my iPhone, I moved my sight away from the craft briefly to my phone, wanting to set it to video mode. When I looked up again, the craft was gone. It was hard to estimate the size or elevation of the craft since I only had a brief look at it. I thought it was an exciting but way too brief an encoun! ter. I walked to the port side to see if I could spot northern light since people had posted photos online of northern light taken in Vancouver in July, just one month earlier, and this night was the first time we had clear sky for any skyward observation. I could see dim low hanging lights but I convinced myself it was only inland city lights. That’s when I noticed an object with two or three orange pulsing lights above the ground at about 15 degrees angle. Since we were 2.8 miles from the shore, I would estimate the object was 3 to 6 miles from us, making its elevation at between 4,000 to 7,000 feet. This object stayed at the same spot for more than 10 minutes and I was convinced it wasn’t an airplane or helicopter. I called my friend in his stateroom and asked him to bring up his Nikon DX camera. The friend came up to deck 10 ten minutes later. To this point, the object had been hovering at the same spot for more than 20 minutes.  He played with his camera’s focus and y speed for low light far-object shooting. He used the max zoom of his AF-S Nikkor 55-200mm lens, it’s probably 3.6x times 1.5 DX camera factor to 5.4x zooming.  The object just stayed near the same spot, from time to time shifting left-to-right and near-to-far, so my friend had plenty of time to adjust his camera, it wasn’t easy though because the low light condition.  The attached photos were all taken with the same optical zoom and cropped with the same digital zoom factor, from 4,285x2,848 frames to 500x400 frames.  One red point in one of the photos is a camera pixel defect. At one point, we saw a small airplane flying to and pass the object.  As I was Google mapping, I noticed there are several small airports in the area.  At another point, which I missed, my friend saw two pulses of bright yellow flashes on the ground right below the object.  Our wives and a friend had also joined us to witness the sighting as well as two late shift crewmembers.  My wife described she could see circulating lights around the object.  Finally, around 1:30 AM the object moved inland and we stopped viewing.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,,

It was like a thought that came – get up, because there’s something out there. I got up and walked to the window, moved the curtain and turned the blinds, and saw way off in the distance (between a palm tree and a regular tree across the street, in a north-westerly direction) a bright light the size of a large star, but flashing red, green, blue. I watched it for about 5 minutes and it never moved. I watched closely to see if it was just a star twinkling (all the stars twinkle here in Hawaii, every night), but I dismissed that because of the colors repeatedly flashing. I urged my husband to wake up and come look, to confirm that he saw it too. He reluctantly got up and came to the window, but was too sleepy and tired to focus on anything, and he went back to bed. I stayed at the window another 15-20 minutes to monitor this thing flashing colored lights, and it never once moved. I kept thinking, ‘This has got to be a star, or a pole/antenna on top of the mountain range – it’s not moving an inch.’ Shortly after midnight, black clouds covered the entire area and I could no longer see the flashing colored lights or any other stars. I pinpointed the exact spot I saw this light by using the trees as landmarks – the light was just above the bottom-most branch of the palm tree, on the right side of the regular tree and the left side of the palm tree.  I tried taking a picture or video of the flashing lights, but it was so far away that it didn’t register on my camera or video camera.  When I woke up this morning, I went straight to the window to see if the light could have been a pole/antenna on top of the mountain range next to Schofield – and based on the position of the light relative to the palm tree – there’s no way.  The light was clearly in the sky, not supported in any way by the mountain range – the mountains were far below the spot where I saw the light flashing various colors.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,,

It’s flight pattern was at an angle and was heading from south to north.  When it reached a certain height it’s white light went out but seemed to flicker like a dying bulb before doing so. It then changed direction. From south to north to east. This time flying at a level plane.  I saw that it was headed in my direction so I waited till it was above me. When it was overhead of me it was far away but I was able to see that it looked like a grey bubble or blob that was spinning like a saucer.  All this time Ive been stopped at the stop sign though no signs of any auto failure. The nearest cross street was Marine Ave and I facing North on Crenshaw Blvd. It was also a very clear night sky. The moon was also very visible in the east side of the sky. I believe it was a Third Quarter moon. I didn’t see any one else around who might have been staring at this also.  It continued to fly East. I would have stayed out longer than I did to watch it but I was in a hurry.

For the second time now since July 7th, I have had another sighting of one of these things.  Last time I saw upwards of a dozen of these things fly over a grocery store. Last night/early this AM my girlfriend and I were standing on our balcony at 2am, gazing up at the night sky. We'd seen a shooting star (no question in my mind) moments before this and a jet was creeping by off in the distance (no doubt again - could hear it and familiar with the light patterns on airliners).  Then, we saw one of these fireballs. I saw it first and gasped. Pointed up at the sky, said ""HONEY LOOK HOLY S* THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I SAW!"" She watched it as I ran inside to grab something with a camera on it. It had come from behind us, flying over the top of our building at what appeared to be a relatively low altitude.  I started to capture video the best I could on my iPod touch...which isn't much obviously. Not a great video but I wanted to document it SOMEHOW for my! self mainly. Here's the strange thing....before I had a very difficult time describing just how odd this thing looked. This time I paid attention to every detail knowing that is what NUFORC needs. Luckily, on this occasion the thing made very erratic movements after coming in a north to south direction over our apartment complex. It did a sort of subtle zig-zag movement a few times, then glided into a change of direction to the left (East) in a motion that can only be described as perfectly organic. Ballerina like, very graceful and smooth.  At times it seemed to produce a bit of a red trail. It did change color dramatically unlike the last ones I saw. This time it started out BRIGHT yellow, almost white, faded to a blood red, then back to near white again. No real pattern to the changes that I could discern. Luckily my crappy video does at least show evidence of this to some degree, though not to the same degree as to the naked eye. OK here's the really strange thing... It had this..vibration to it. I don't mean that in some spiritual way or metaphysical pseudo-scientific sense....Imagine the way a guitar string looks when it's plucked. Sitting motionless, you can see a guitar string perfectly without interference or distortion. Now if you *pluck* a guitar string, causing it to vibrate and  produce sound, you can still see it. It still maintains it's same general shape (a metallic line in the string's case) but it is moving so rapidly that it appears distorted. It gets blurry, sort of elongated at times, or wider at others, but in the center where it normally rests you can still see a basic ghost of it's shape and details.... It's definitely there, but your eyes can't keep up with it. That's what this thing appeared like. It was definitely round, but there was this weird fuzziness to it that was not caused by distance or lack of efficient eyesight. There was some kind of....other wordly or at least odd and very rapid motion to this thing....that's what I mean when I say it was ""vibrating"". Anyway, it went left, going behind a tree, where I could still see it a bit with my naked eyes.  It sat there for a good minute at least, and eventually just was not there when I looked up again. Definitely not a chinese lantern. I actually had set one off into the night after the experience I had on the 7th of July just to try to see if it in fact was what I had seen. I can unequivocally state it was not a chinese lantern. I at some point felt electric, the way you do before a lightning storm. I checked the weather report for today on the NOAA site, and at that time it looks like the wind was blowing in a Northern direction at about 5mph, max of 8.....but north is the exact opposite direction this thing was going. I may upload the video but am hesitant to. It is not good quality, and on top of that I am audibly shaken up by what I'm seeing and sound like a scared little girl or something so it's kind of embarrassing. ALTHOUGH.....I am a video professional by trade so in an attempt to clean up the crap video a bit and enhance it to get a better look at this thing..... I found something positively EERIE. Right before I stopped taping,  something that appears to be a ""gray alien"" face takes over the left side of the frame.  Note this only happens when I process the video to increase contrast and boost GAIN levels, which can cause distortion if done inappropriately.   In my opinion I don't think if grays exist, they have anything to do with fireballs or really care to associate with us, but it is definitely maybe worth noting.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

Not incredibly unusual but a maybe a little unusual. I always look at the stars, anytime i can, we see a lot of shooting stars where i live, there isnt much light pollution especially when looking westward, we are on the Gulf of Mexico so basically its a black out. I noticed a line of four lights, vertical, which at first were all white, then as drew closer could distinctly see 4 colors, blue white, red and yellow. keep in mind they were all white-ish but they had distinct like almost florescent tone to them like a reddened white and so forth.

I watch planes, jets, helicopters all the time at night, they move maybe like 120 times slower than this thing did. I am making my calculation on this assumption. A normal helicopter moves maybe 150- 225 mph, a commercial jet plane, flies around 500-600 mph, we have air-force and navy jets within a hundred miles in two directions that zip through quite often around 2000 mph. When i watch a jet it will enter! and leave my sightline in about 15 -20 seconds, a jetliner ta! kes mayb e 45 seconds to a minute to go across the sightline.

I was standing outside of my house after 8 or 9 p.m. one evening in the late 1970s in Wilmington, Delaware. We lived in a typical residential development on a cul-de-sac.  While I was outside, I looked up because a spotlight caught my eye.  It was then that I saw searchlights being beamed onto housetops up the street - maybe about 6 or 7 houses away. I stood there and stared because the lights were coming from this large, circular disk that seemed no more than 35-50 feet off the ground.  The disk was moving very, very slowly, if at all, as the searchlights beamed down upon each house.  I stood there somewhat shocked as I tried to make sense of what I was seeing. As the disk started coming closer to my house, I became frightened out moved from the cul-de-sac sidewalk to the front step of our house, where I could still clearly see the disk and the lights.  Then, suddenly, the disk took an abrupt 90 degree turn and totally vanished.  The thing was COMPLETELY silent, which was odd. At that point, I ran into the house to tell my parents, who clearly did not believe me, what I had seen.  I felt insulted and frustrated, of course, because what sane person would make up something like this?  I was an honor student, for heaven's sakes.  Well, the next day our sweet, elderly neighbors who lived across the circle from us were speaking with my mother and happened to share the same story, as they had seen it, too.  Obviously, I was happy to hear that others had seen it as well. What was most puzzling was the absolute silence of the craft and its ability to simply make a left turn and vanish.

I saw two bright white lights in the sky.  The sky was clear and stars clearly visible as well as the moon.  The lights were slightly larger and brighter than surrounding stars.   They were not blinking so were not an airplane.   Also, they could not have been satellites because they were spaced very far apart (holding hand fully outstretched two points of light about 2 inches apart) and most importantly their movements were in sync with each other as one followed the first in a direct path/trajectory and speed (as if two lights on front and back of very long object).  They were traveling SW I believe and were very bright when I first noticed them.  They continued downward toward the horizon and became dimmer as they did so.  This was slow enough for me to consider what I was watching, then run inside and have my wife come out to see just before they disappeared.  Unfortunately she could not find them in the sky/didn’t know! what she was looking for.  I could not make out an object linking the lights but highly doubt that they were meteors or any conventional aircraft.  I could not tell the distance but was very confused, as they seemed almost as stars moving slowly across the sky.  They travelled very close to Orion’s belt and in a similar line.  They were the distance between the lights was also comparable to the length on the three stars which make up Orion’s belt. On a separate occasion about 2 ¼ yrs. ago, I saw three enormous (full moon) sized orange lights in the night sky driving down rt.11 @7:00PM.  The sky was overcast and there was a full moon behind the clouds. These lights were in front of the clouds and in a perfect line above the horizon toward the south.

Appeared as bright and large as a street light from a distance of 75-100 feet.

I heard what I thought was a whirring sound of a helicopter and saw lights and assumed it was a helicopter landing at the nearby hospital.  It began to fly directly over me and hovered, when I looked up, I realized (gulp) that it looked nothing like a helicopter and looked like a small version of a  stealth jet, which of course cannot hover.  It had very bright lights emanating from it all around the sides and at least one shining down from the bottom of the craft.  I looked over to my dog and she was looking up at it and was mesmerized, but not barking, which she would normally do at loud big things.   I looked back up at the object, which was about 40 to 50 feet above us, and it suddenly moved sideways for about 200 feet, then went up into space at an incredible speed that within 30 seconds, it was up so high it looked like a star.  I had never seen anything move that fast ever.  My father was an air force pilot, so I am familiar with planes and jets.   For days afterward, my dog just lay around listless, and I felt strange as well, extreme fatigue yet a blissful mental state. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

She said the orb just appeared out of no where, hung in the air, then went down slowly behind th! e house.

I continued to watch for about a minute as the meteor shreaked across the sky following the Earth's curvature until it was completely out of sight.

I have no way of knowing how big it was for sure but visually it was about 6 inches in diameter. The fact that I could hear it meant it couldn't have been too far away.

Also why would the last one dissapear each time and bring back another one. just to hover and wat! ch us.

On Sunday September 13, 2009, at approximately 9:00 PM, I and a few friends witnessed a hovering object high up in the night sky within the Chicago city limits, on the north side, Lincoln Park area. One hour after first spotting this object, I managed to take a picture using my 5MP camera phone with auto flash.  We watched this stationary object just sit idle in free air. Unfortunately, it took me a long time to take the picture because I didn't believe my friends who were outside watching it for an hour.  I stayed inside the house. Object's Position They said that it was a lot closer to the earth before I decided to go outside and view.  So the image I took was basically its very, very slow ascent back up into the stars.  Even though we were in downtown Chicago, it was a pretty starry night with some stratus clouds high up, but the only thing you can see in this picture is the brilliant amber-red spherical object. You don't see the stars in the picture, just the red object.  I tried magnifying the view of the object, but of course it's blurry.  I really need to share this story with someone credible if this helps us understand the big picture of things. Objects Ruled Out I'm not saying that what I saw was a UFO, but I can say that I have never seen any type of flying or floating vehicle, or weather condition, planet, satellite or lightning like the thing I saw that night. I'm so glad I was able to capture it when I did, because I was shaking and tried to grasp some kind of reasonable explanation for what I saw, but nothing came to mind.  I want to share with you my experience and photo if you are interested. This is a real image. You have to zoom to the red speck at the center.  This was taken at my friends place in the Lincoln Park subdivision of Chicago, the night of Sept. 13, 2009 during the Bears/Green Bay week 1 game at 9:00pm CST. This object appeared right around halftime facing the northwest horizon and much lower in elevation.  It stayed stationary, never changing direction.  I finally took this picture at approximately 10:00 PM. Object Hovers  What you see is something I and a few friends can't explain.  Outside the house my buddies were first to notice this thing around 9:00 PM.  They kept telling us to come out and watch this thing floating in the air and not moving.  We didn't believe him so we just kept watching the game inside. I finally gave in and went out to their backyard and witnessed what they were watching.  I could not offer any explanation to what I saw.  The following are things I have ruled out that this wasn't: -No aircraft (blimp, balloon, helicopter, airplane) -No comet, star or planet. -No low earth orbiting satellite Spherical in Appearance I could not decipher any shape of the object.  It looked spherical, and I couldn't tell if there were more than one.  It was definitely higher in elevation than the Sears Tower.  I'd say approximately more than 5,000 to 10,000 feet. My first reaction was to call someone miles away from our location just to verify the same unexplainable thing in the night sky.  Of course, nobody would answer their phone because they were probably watching the game.  I really wish I took video but I was actually shaking, because I was kind of excited to see this thing. It was amazing and frightened to watch.  I still want to believe that it was man-made, but my gut tells me that it's not, nor a natural phenomena",2013-02-18T00:00:00,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089

On the morning of October 21, 2012 at approximately 0330 hours I went outdoors to observe a meteor shower that supposedly originates in the area of Orion. My observation point was the lanai of a condo in Sarasota, Florida. I was on the top floor of the condo which would place me at approximately 50 feet from the ground. The weather was perfect with a clear sky, no moon, and a chilly breeze coming from the north.  The breeze was strong enough to move the tree limbs, slightly.  Orion was almost overhead, being 10 degrees south. I was watching the sky, not seeing one meteor, when I caught movement to my left. I then observed an object that was silently and steadily moving through the sky traveling East Southeast. It was going approximately 2 MPH and I observed this object for 10 seconds.  The body of the object, from my observation point, was dark and was approximately 14 inches long, 3 inches wide and was squared on the ends. At the side and coming off each corner was approximately 7 wavy lines, faint in brightness which gave off a glow similar to a dim florescent bulb.  These appeared to be fixed to a part of the object approximately 1 inch wide and 2 inches long.  Through these faint wavy lines a slightly brighter glow pulsed moving from the object outwards.  As I stated, this object made no sound. It was approximately 20 degrees below Orion. the object appeared as if it was only 30 feet or so above me. As the object passed over the building and thus blocking my view of further observation, within another 30 seconds I observed a dark round object moving to the east. This object was moving at approximately 5 mph and had no lights or sound. The cause of the object to be noticed was the object was darker than the sky. It appeared to be higher in the sky and approximately the same angle from Orion as the first object.

Our eyes had been adjusted and we had seen various shooting stars fly overhead.  We were both facing South, and all of a sudden from the East a Chevron shaped object appears, almost looking like it was in a sharp decent.  The object continued to travel west at a very fast pace, and within 15 seconds, the object had either disappeared or had already traveled out of sight. Immediately as the object flew over ahead we both looked at each other and asked if the other had seen this object.  We had both initially thought it was an array of lights that resembled some sort of large, cartoon-esque bird/dragonfly.  In disbelief we realized that this could not have been the case due to how high and quickly the object travelled.  We then both thought that it was a hang glider, but then realized this was impossible due to the height and speed of the object.   Still in disbelief after running through every possibility we are cautiously thinking we saw a UFO of some sort.  The reason being as the lights were far brighter than the stars so we knew the object was closer, yet far enough away where it could not have been any sort of animal or man made flight object.  It made absolutely no noise and it's motion was still and consistent.  We also both realized that the space filled in between the lights, say where the body of the craft would be, was some what distorted from the rest of the starry sky. As quickly as it appeared, it had disappeared.  As two people who took strong stances against the sighting and stories surrounding UFO's we can honestly say we are not trying to convince ourselves that we saw something for a story.  We both were on the same page with every detail and interpretation as described above.  It's to the point where we both wish that we had never seen it because we are that certain we saw something flying overhead and there is no available proof.  I hope that this helps and can say our minds our wandering to places and thinking of things we both never thought possible.

I told her that I'd show her what I had contact with 4 years ago. Something in me told me that I had to take her home, so I did. After I get home, I sit in my backyard until my other friend and his two friends come over. He also had contact with these ships 4 years ago. I can't explain it but once he got there, I give it 15 minutes. We see a triangle craft flashing lights at us TO MY MUSIC that was playing on my phone! I was lost in thought! I was going to take a picture but It moved away from sight. We decided to go to the spot 5 minutes from my house to be in the middle of nowhere to check the skies. We park beside a field of corn stock and the ship comes. But it moves across the sky slow. We get into the car to get closer, but it begins to leave. I stop the driver and I get out. It appears in another location, MAYBE over t! he Mississippi river. It sat there and opened the bottom hatch and a BEAM OF LIGHT shots down to the ground below it!!!! It slowly moves after that and another ship appears on the opposite side and they are slowly moving towards one another. Then they stop and flash red lights at us... Like it was a warning of some sort. Distracting us the whole time, we did not notice that they dropped something and whatever it was, IT CAME CLOSE TO US! Me and one other HEARD THE GROWL like noise. I looked in the tall field of corn and on top of that there was a white orb being followed by a red one, on ground level! It was maybe two car lenghts away from us.

I have seen a UFO 2 times now in my life. I am sure nobody will believe my story, but i have to tell it anyway. I do not care about getting famous or gaining anything from this. People have to know what i saw. NO i do not use drugs,i was not drunk, and i normally don´t belive in ghost ,UFOs or God(even if my mother is a priest). I have to see things before i belive in it.  First time i saw a UFO was when i was 15 years old and was walking home around 22:00 pm. I started to feel that it was strange that no street lights was on,no cars,no people, no lights in the windows, even the Gas station was dark. Normally at this time here in Umeå the area is full of life. but not tonight..i was totally alone, it was like time itself stopt, or i walked into some sort of twilight zone. I cant realy explain it any better. I look up into the sky and i saw this Disk come down from the sky(it was not in a straight line) more like it made a turn towards me and then it came down lower and lower towards me and then hovering ontop of me. If i had a snowball in my hand i would be able to throw it at the UFO, thats how close to it i was.  i just stood there looking at it like i was frozen or something.. i was not scared or anything but i could not move. it had lights under it and it did not make any sound what so ever. All i can say is that it was deffinitly NOT made by humans, the technology is way past anything we could dream about. it was gray/black/silver color. And someone was sitting inside it. I am not sure what they did but they returned exactly the same way they came down from..exactly! the same path down and up, the same curve. it had soft acceleration in beginning a few hundred meters and then it jumped lightspeed or something into the sky and dissapered. I have no idea if they abdukted me or something but i have had a strange electric place in my neck were dust seem to be drawn to. and for some reason i always BIP when i go thrue airport security and they cant understand why..and no i did not tell them about a crazy UFO story...because then they would not let me on the plane..thinking i am a crazy person.  The 2:e disk was seen this morning at around 01:35 am in the same city but different part of the city. I was out walking home from a friends house (10 min from my apartment) and i feel a pain in my neck, i see this BIG UFO above me, same theme,shape,color,lights,no sound. same feeling of time stop.no lights on outside, no lights on inside apartments or houses. no people ,no cars. Then i see the UFO fly away again. i have no memory of abduktion or getting beamed up or down or anything like that. why is this hapening to me? Today i feel strange, i am so hott in temperature, i dont feel sick, its ..something else. yes its a hot sommerday outside but i am still super hott after a cold shower. i have ice cube bags on me and temperature is 40 C. And dust seem to fly towards my neck. i think some shit is in there also. like a metall tiny thing.  I cant stop thinking ..its like my head is filled with stuff/thoughts i cant controll, it keeps repeting over and over. its like a message that saying there is a war amongst the alien races and we happen to be in the middle of it or close to the front lines or something like that. But we humans are no threat to anyone because of our low technology. i guess they see us as a bunch of retarded children busy blowing each other up.  I dont do drugs and i never have, i am not drunk, i am a normal guy. i am not crazy but i feel i am about to go crazy soon.  I would like people to know this story, i would like to be x-rayed and checked for metall stuff, i would like to be hypnotized to remember everything i saw, and yes i am ok with getting hocked up to a lie detektor. I am telling the truth here. !  I have to stop typing now because i am burning up.  !",2012-07-04T00:00:00,,

No lights were blinking on the aircraft and it was not making any noise that we could hear. As it flew by the light that was only shining, in what I believed to be the front of the craft, lit up enough that I saw it was a grayish color and appeared to be a disk shape with something on top.  A couple of days before this we had seen another light like this one and didn't really know what is was. However it was not flying as low as this one.  When I mentioned this to my daughter and her friend they has seen a strange light also on the other side of town.

I was traveling South on Hwy. 51 from Edgerton, WI and was located approx. 2 and a half miles past the Hwy M turn off to Indianford. I had gone up the hill and curve about 4 miles from Janesville, at which point the road starts straitening out and the view is less obstructed by trees. I was looking in the sky, hoping to see clouds, (as we have been very dry in this part of the state), and I noticed an unusual object traveling slowly and veering towards the city of Janesville on a S.E. path. This object had a bright round center and seemed to be elongated on the metallic, silver sides. There was like a haze around the entire object but the center was a very bright white.  It looked like a bright star with an outline where wings should be. It was traveling slowly enough at first that I thought it was an aircraft.  I slowed down to keep the object in sight and realized that there was no jet stream. There were no flashing lights.  There was no sound.  The angle of ascent was not like a plane, as it was climbing at a near 90 degree angle. By the time I reached the last stretch of highway, before reaching hwy. 14, with the jail in sight,the object was moving S.E. and upward at an incredible speed and just disappeared.  I figured that it disappeared very high in the sky, but, if I had been standing right under it and looking up, I think the last place I would have seen the object would have been right around the post office area on Hwy. 26 or Milton Ave. When I first observed this craft it seemed to be traveling at an angle of about 60-70 degrees then rapidly changed to about 80-85 degrees on acceleration.  The last impression I had of this craft was a glowing rectangle, outlined black. This is the second sighting Ive had of UFO craft. The first was unreported in the winter of 1975 or 1976.  My cousin was with me as well and the space craft was literally hovering over us and the top of a now dead Oak tree, for approximately five minutes.  There are questions about time displacement I have been struggling with for years about that event. The reason I bring that up is because although the crafts style was very much different, the flight behavior was very similiar.  They both had a gradual acceleration and then ""poof"", outta sight.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,42.68318214285715,-89.04936428571429

No sound could be heard coming from this object and the lights were not flashing as seen on any other identifiable aircraft in the air at night.   It moved quickly at a constant speed flying from the east, heading west.

It was Orange in color and was very bright, we were in awe of its size and brightness.  As we were looking and trying to determine what it was it started to move very slowly and take a triangle shape with twinkling lights on each point of the triangle, the lights were almost pulsating.  The craft kept moving in a very slow, linear path that looked like it was coming directly towards us.  It passed just to our right and was only 1,500-2,000 feet in the air, as it came closer we quickly determined it wasn't any airplane or helicopter because it made no sound.  When the craft passed us we noticed 3 more with identicle shapes appear, they were also moving slowly and had the same linear path just spaced further apart. As we watched the other crafts as they moved closer we noticed one craft that was almost directly infront of us drop a small, light-like object to the ground.  My friend and I were already kinda freaked out about seeing these objects and became almost scared when we saw one drop something to the ground.  These crafts continued their straight, slow paths and when they passed they just sorta disappeared.  We drive for another 5-10 minutes before arriving at our destination, when we arrived we continued to look in the eastern sky where these crafts were coming from and ended up seeing three more that went right over our heads.  We got very good looks at the ones that went right over our heads, they were definitely large black triangles with lights on each point and a few lights in the middle and along the edges.  They were moving very slow and had no sound until they were just past us, then we heard a very light propulsion-like engine sound. All of these objects basically just appeared and were all uniform in size, shape, and color, but their lights differed in slight color and patterns of the pulsations.  My friend and I are just a couple regular, football loving, family guys and neither one of us have ever seen anything that compares to what we saw this night.  After seeing these objects we tried to come up with logical explanations as to what these things were and we came up with nothing.

This is right near the old salvation army building on Burnside and 2ND ave. I can get the exact date I seen this event because I got kicked out for climbing out on the roof at night, simply to use the wifi internet I could not pick up in my room. While I was out on the roof I observed 9-11 brightly light orange spheres in the direction of the airport, from downtown. On the roof of the building, I could see the ground at a distance of apx 15 miles, and estimate the height of the flying objects to be apx 500-1500 feet above ground. The objects held a formation although they did not appear to be of one object.  They started to  slowly move independently of one another. I managed to observe these in flight for about 5-7 minutes.  There are two taller buildings that obscured the view, these orbs passed behind them and finally, I could no longer see them. There were no other objects in my view flying for apx 30 minutes after the sighting.  I simply gave up and went back inside shortly after. As a veteran of the armed forces, and my career in aviation, I feel particular to this event and would be willing to give a more detailed report, please contact me via email or phone and leave me a message.",2012-05-29T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

I  looked at it and thought at first it might be a helicopter as it was kinda hovering. It was already dark out and had patchy fog.   After I looked closer I saw it continue to fly westward but not in a straight line.  It seemed to be smaller than a helicopter but couldn't make out any size or shape.  It was just a single light kinda moving westward maybe 10 MPH.  I rolled down my window and stuck my head and chest out of the passenger window to watch it as it was behind us a little now about the 7-8 o'clock angle.  My wife continued to watch it too.  I was telling her pull over, pull over.  We next saw it change to a bluish color and move really fast in ! a small area switching directions quickly and almost randomly.  It then changed back to the yellowish color and gained a little height as it continued to travel west by north/west.  Almost as if trying to stay in the low fog/clouds that were in the area.  We never heard any sound from it and the lights were weird in color.  I guess you could say they were kinda rich/dark in color.  Not like any lights i've seen before.

I work from home and was taking a quick break.  While standing there I glimpsed a horizontal cylinder shape, silver, with 2-3 slender rings (attached) going around the cylinder shape (vertically) in sections. It was just a very quick glimpse and when I looked away and back again it was no longer there. There were no lights and it was so odd that it was just hovering there like a hummingbird.  It was pretty close, not at all as far as a plane but not real close, certainly in the sky.  Again, it was so fast and sort of like something you shouldn’t have noticed but it was or IS always there. I more or less blew this off as a possible mind trick or something.  I tend to be pretty practical and will rationalize anything. However, when I told my husband about it tonight when he came home from work, he really got excited about it. Now, the thing I dismissed as a mind trick became interesting.  I didn’t immediately think ‘UFO’ but more like a ‘Drone’.  I decided then to google images of ‘silver cylinders in the sky’ – no luck. Nothing came up like what I saw.

Imagine taking a pencil and drawing just a basic line in the sky. it was about an inch long from my perception of vision At 8:30pm or 8:45pm, in Belington - West Virgina, my mother and I were driving to town and saw a silver streak in the sky. It was moderatly close to the surface of the planet.  Both my mother and I witnessed this object and at first, we thought it was sunlight reflecting off of an airplane because the sun had just sat behind the mounitans, and the steak was located in the west where the sun had just set. We quicly ruled that out because after closer observation, we realized it was steady with absoluately no movement in the sky.  As always, all it took was a split second to look away from it and it was gone.  It's like it knew we we're looking at it and was waiting for us to look away for it to disappear so it didn't vanish in front of our eyes and seem even more fishy.  This happens everytime I see something that I think could be a UFO. The actual streak:  The object we saw was simply as I said: A silver streak. It looked like a white line in the sky (like a hole in the sky but instead of a sphear, it was a streak, a line). There were no lights, flashing or steady that we could see because it was still daylight. Conclusin of report: I consider myself quite educated in these things because it facinates me. I watch the programs on the History Channel all day like ""The Universe - How the Earth was made - Ancient Aliens"". I have ruled out these possbile explanations after some research and thinking. I am also not a paranoid person. I don't think everything unusual I see is a UFO. -It was not a star because it was much larger than any star that is located lightyearsaway from our planet. There were also no other stars visable in the sky at the time we saw this ""silver streak""  -It was not a space-craft of any human airline or human military organization that the public is aware of because it was motionless and if it were a jet, it would have left a streak of propulsion and fuel in the sky behind its tale as all jets do. It did not leave such tail of propulsion. Also, there was a jet in the southern part of the sky we saw that was obviously a jet because It had a streak of propulsion. So we even had the chance to compare a normal jet to the object we saw and they were absolutely nothing alike. -It was not a satellite in earths orbit.  The naked human eye can simply not view the satellties we have in orbit with as much sunlight left in the sky as there was when we witnesses this object.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,39.0492,-79.9561

The sky was very clear, as we walked up Crystal Springs away from Camden Ave about ½ way up the street I looked up to the left ( about 60-70% up in height in the sky) and there were 2 orange, what looked like bright stars, amongst the stars. These stood out because they were about 2-3X the size of others and were bright orange amongst all the other white stars. I pointed them out to the two girls with me and we watched them for about 5-10 min. At first they were stationary, then one started to move down and at an angle.  After moving a distance, in terms of the size of the light, about 20-30 times it size down,  it turned at a sharp right angle and traveled about 10-20 times it’s size to the right and stopped. Then it started up toward the ! other to a point that I thought it was going to go right into the other, then about 2-3 times it size away from the other, it stopped. From there in descended again, this time its light starting to flicker  and reduce in its brilliance, several times it almost went out but then lit up again, all the while it was descending, then it faded one last time and was gone.

When we retuned to the house, I sat in my back yard hoping to see something else looking up in the sky. While I did not see any more orange lights moving about, at 10:10PM my entire peripheral vision saw what looked like a meteorite streak across the sky with its tail in full view the entire time even after passing for a moment, it was lower than any shooting star I’ve ever seen, I would have thought it was the height of a high flying airplane. In the morning I looked hoping to see something in the local news paper but here was nothing so I Googled “strange lights in the sky” and saw clip after clip about just such orange lights.

I live <10 miles south west of the centre point of Lincoln,UK, I have a prior interest in UFOs, I have some experience at identifying aircraft, satellites including Iridium flares, ISS, planets, birds, chinese lanterns in this area, meteors, commercial and military aviation traffic in this area and various other conventional phenomenon. I was laying in bed looking through some poorly fitted slats (single glazing) at the night sky, at aproximately 2300-0000 on the night of 23/04/2012 or 24/04/2012. I had no internal lighting in my room, the windows were clear and I had a very obstructed but comfortable view of a low wedge of northern sky from aprox North to North East (<45 degrees azimuth arc), and <45 degrees inclination arc. The weather was cloudy, lots of sodium light pollution, very orange tint, a relatively low layer of disparate cloud allowed some view of the night sky. There was little to no wind judged from tree movement, it had been raining recently quite heavily in the area. Based on looking at stellarium I think I was looking at either Deneb or Vega, East of North, low to the horizon just above a houses pointed roof as seen from my vantage point, it was not particulary bright as I remember probably due to the cloud cover veiling it. I saw a point of light, orange tinted that preceded to get very bright, within a second it was very bright - it is hard to define but I would say brighter than I have seen Venus or Jupiter, not as bright as a very low magnitude Iridium flare that I have seen before, brighter than any chinese lantern I have seen. The light was very noticeable and after a second at full brightness it dimmed down again. During this time I did not notice movement. The light then dimmed to the level of a rather bright satellite and travelled slowly across the sky from left to right, before dissapearing behind a tree. At its dim level of light I did not notice flickering, strobes, or any indication of size of other detail such as nav lights etc. It travelled very slowly at the speed of a light aircraft and slower than Iridium sats I have observed, it also seemed to travel at a constant altitude and I did not discern any indication of a curved trajectory during the brief time I observed it (5 seconds or so). There was no trail or any other indication of its presence. I alerted someone in my house to this and we looked in the area for it, about a minute after the first incident another light source of the same luminosity characteristics of the first travelled along the same path and dissapeared behind the tree again, this light source did not get bright or change in any way other than moving across the sky at the same speed. That is my sighting :) Sorry for lengthy description of simple sighting, I believe that a more likely but not certain explanation for this is a satellite flare, though the ""pause"", speed, and seemingly flat path of the light source(s) I have not witnessed before with LEO man made satellites.

I can’t stop wondering what it was that I and my 26 year old and 18 year old sons and 4 other people witnessed in Anderson, CA,. on New Year’s Eve 2011 at about midnight. Here’s what I do know, that none of us were drunk, other people in Anderson witnessed it too, they made no sound, there were no other aircraft in the vicinity, we all saw at least 8 of them fly together in the same direction but like they were dancing with each other, or playing ""catch me if you can,"" we saw them move towards us in the southern sky, we then saw them disappear, we then saw 3 of them re-appear in the eastern sky and make a triangle pattern, then 2 of them started to move away from the third, then change from orange to a white ghostly silhouette and suddenly dart away at a faster than humanly possible speed and disappeared in the sky above us. I posted my story on this website a few days after this event and not surprisingly someone else from Anderson, CA, posted their story, too.  We spoke a little online about it, but I never met the other witnesses. I hope to hear from them again someday.  As this becomes a more common experience for people, I hope we keep the curiosity up.  Don’t become complacent, there is something out there.  It’s definitely not Chinese lanterns.  It could be a light trick or something to do with laser points of light.  It could very well be intelligent beings other than humans.  It did kind of creep us out and we did have thoughts about what if it’s something scary and unknown. I’ve seen video and testimony from witnesses who have seen the same thing and had similar reactions to it from as far back as the 1990’s. It’s just more common to hear of it lately it seems.

I always said ‘’ I wish I can see at least one -ufo- before I dye, ‘’ and the funny thing, even that a few days after the event I actually told some one about what I saw, it took a while for me to actually realize that I did see a ufo.. I guess it was so natural that it did not register as a sighting, and only tonight, several months after the occurrence that I came up with the idea to report it. I’m French Canadian from Québec so my wording might lead to questioning..or laughing.. ;)   So. first I must say that I have been a remote model airplane pilot for about 23 years, I recently move back from Ontario to Quebec.  As you might guess the sighting occurred at my flying field, the club name is Amidair..part of MAAC..  As my type of flying « «  a mix of 3D and precision » » require steady concentration I prefer to fly alone, so I usually get to the field very early 05:45 get set up and usually do several flight in a row before the crowd gets there. That morning the sky had several patches of gray clouds and I was doing my usual bag of tricks with my plane, and after I did a rolling circle I notice that some thing was occupying a previous empty spot in the shy at around 2 o’clock, honestly, I must admit that I had the feeling of being watch..  I also had the feeling that it was closer to me then the other clouds, we all know that doing a distance evaluation of object in the sky is very difficult since there is no point of reference, as a remote pilot like me, it’s some thing you learn the hard way as you think that your plane is in front of the three just to see it disappear in the back of it.. So, I’m flying my plane and with time my brain send me a few red flag so I get really interested and I want to take a good look at it so I go in an easy flying mode, doing some long and slow climbing that give me a few good five seconds to stare at it.  The more I look at it the greater my interest grew and the harder it was to fly my plane.. The shape was very surreal, basically it had a center mass with 3 long point sticking out, if I remember well one was at 12 o’clock one at 4 oc and one at 8 oc.  The surreal part was that it was camouflage ''same color'' like the other cloud with a wad of cloud around the spike and center mass so I never saw any metal or hard surfaces just a 3 spoke cloud… now I remember thinking ’’ that’s the proof.. 3 point clouds don’t exist.. so I kept flying in a survival mode so I could keep my eyes on it up to the time that it did start ’’  I guess’’ to move away from me, I say I guess… because with the same outside look, it just shrink smaller and smaller.  So if it was going away from me it must have done it in a very.. straight line with me, if it did, that denote some intelligence that it knew that I was looking at it and try to confuse me by not having a lateral movement, I looked at it until it totally disappear then I scan the sky for a moving object, I do think that I saw some th! ing reflecting the sun doing a small curve but I’m not sure.. After that, while I was still flying my remote plane.. 2 big 747 did a very… low fly by right over my head, it seam that they where coming from a take off from the Mirabel airport that is fairly close to my flying field..  They both appear far in front of me, going to my right did a long u turn, came over my head, it was so low that I got uncomfortable flying my plane.. the first pass was right over my flying field the second was a bit wider to my back..  I’ve been a member of this club for a few years now, we see our fare share of real plane passing over our field on approach to Mirabel airport, we have what I call the FedEx express that come in like a clock in the morning,  We also see a special 4 turbine engine plane with a fifth turbine engine, strap to the right or the cockpit , for testing purposes I guess, but never I saw a 747 or two for the matter at such a low altitude..   What crossed my mind for the 747 is that the government is doing some monitoring on ufo, that seems to have.. from what I can read, a weakness for airport traffic.. So there you go.. I now can dye happy because I finally saw one; too bad it took me so long to realize it.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was about the size of a dime held at arm's length.  It was white, and shaped like a full-bodied arrow on a street sign.  The stem of the arrow was only as long as the arrow head was wide.  It produced a brief white tail behind itself, the full height of the arrow. The UFO was going dangerously fast if it was over the airport.  It moved at 3 to 6 times the speed of the airliners I constantly see in that area. I watched it for 20 seconds.  I stammered for my son to look, so he observed the flight for 10 seconds.

I was riding in the car with two other individuals on the road 926, in Kennett Square, Pa.  We began to make a right turn onto School House Road.  I was sitting in the back seat of the car behind the drivers seat. I just happened to look out the window when a flashing light hovering about 100 yards above a tree line which caught my eye.  It was approximately 150 yards away from the road or right where a field meets a tree line.  I asked the two other passengers in the front seat what it was because I know there are no towers, or anything in that area that flash light the way this object was.  Initially it was brushed off and regarded as a helicopter or something of that nature.  However, as we continued to travel up the road I kept watching the object and totally rejected the notion of this being a helicopter or anything of that nature. The craft emitted flashing lights, but in a pattern from left to right and each was its own individual square.  Other than the light being completely unnatural for the area, size, the way they blinked left to right and the overall length of the lights flashing across the craft; it also sat perfectly still.  I drew attention to the craft again, sighting the fact that it was not moving and there was no way this was a helicopter.  Both the driver and passenger looked out the window to the left again until our driver agreed this was no helicopter and there was no explanation for what it was. We came to the next intersection of School House Road and Longwood Road, where we made a left turn, traveling maybe 75 to 100 yards up the road before we stopped, pulled over and were parallel with the object.  The object again was on our left, sitting perfectly still, continuing to flash lights from what seemed to be left to right.  We watched for a total of thirty minutes.  During this period of sitting on the side of the road the craft moved, and I cant describe this in any other way than “like an alien spaceship would” quickly shifting from left to right but very smoothly.  As it was moving, it going away from us.  It eventually stopped a fair distance away but still close enough to see very easily. This is when the weird got weirder, before it began to move it appeared to be sitting horizontally, as it moved away it seemed to turn almost vertical and the flashing light went around the craft a faster.  As I said before it settled again and went horizontal like it was before and hovered perfectly still.   As we continued to watched I noticed a plane flying in from the right side of the sky, and this plane was “hauling ass”.  The plane went directly underneath the craft but at some distance below it, than banking a hard left out and away.  The plane lingered out the far left of the craft.  The craft eventually moved away far enough and we had watched it long enough to leave. However, this is not the end.  After we decided to drive away, we turned around and went back on School House Road, making a left going towards Route 1.  We stopped at a Wawa, when we parked, we parked one spot away from a man in a green Chevrolet pickup truck.  The man was wearing a dark olive fleece with a United States flag stitched to the side of his arm.  He was 100% military the only weird thing about that is, he was sitting there listening to a some sort of radio, CB?  I have no clue.  Now all this may just be a coincidence; however, if you were to know where we live like I do, you would know you never see a “G man” sitting outside of a Wawa on a Sunday night listening to a radio the night people happen to be witnessing a UFO sighting.  He seemed to be intently listening to a radio... Coincidence or there for a reason you decide but it looked very suspicious given the very recent prior event.  Did I mention the fact that what we saw as far as lights go looked identic! al to a craft caught on tape Christmas day in the same county... Ya.  The only thing is none of us could provide a 100% description of what shaped the craft was due to it being dark but our consensus was circular because of the way the flashing light looked as it moved left to right.

((NUFORC Note:  One of six sightings from same source, submitted over the course of two months.  PD))  Once more, please refer to the past Milford reports from this year for context on this sighting. Sunday, Gulf Beach, only a mild -3mph breeze from the NNW.  Intermittent high clouds.  Sunset about 6:40 PM. First:  7:06 PM.  Through windshield of parked car noticed a very bright low flying object approaching from the west (265 degrees), just above the treeline and shoreline houses.  Because of its familiar color, lack of blinking port/starboard/tail lights and peculiar gliding movement I immediately attempted to video record this aircraft.  Moving away from street/car lights to get a better view of it, and to project a 5 mW green laser at it, this object soon displayed itself as a typically flame-like oval.  It traveled from the west  into the SE, gaining altitude as it diagonally crossed the gulf.  The laser's 2,000 ft effective range did not appear to paint it, nor did it respond to the flash.  Within 2.5 minutes it blinked out in the SE sky.  Estimated speed = 45 mph. Second:  About 2 minutes after the disappearance of the first object another firey object suddenly popped up, either just between the trees exactly 270 degrees west - or possibly from the opposite beach itself!  This happened too rapidly for me to accurately judge its origination point.   As it moved towards me,  lower and more slowly than the previous UFO, I was able to aim the laser directly at it throughout its entire 2.5 minutes of travel in a trajectory similar to the previous UFO: upwards and into the SE sky.  No response, and nothing noticably reflected by the laser beam.  This object similarly blinked out about 120 degrees SE at 7:13 PM.

On the night of June 25th, I exited my house for a night walk and was surprised to find my cousin parked on my street talking on her cell phone and looking at the sky. I looked up and I saw five reddish lights moving from west to east in a linear formation. My cousin was talking to the rest of my family on her cell phone, and encouraged them to come out of the house and see the strange occurrence. Many family members came out the front door I previously exited and looked towards the sky to see two of the remaining lights. The lights seemed to disappear in order of most eastern (first) to the most western (last).  Once the lights disappeared presumably into the clouds, as I recall, there was significant cloud cover (enough to obscure the moon but thin enough to still allow some light to shine through).  I saw few if any stars in the sky, which made the red lights much more noticeable. So it seemed the lights were travelling below the clouds.  I was certain that they were moving to the east as their pathway took them behind a tree (from my vantage point) indicating movement.   Later, after some hesitation, I decided to go on my walk and ultimately stopped at a nearby park, overlooking Lake Erie. I sat on the bench to rest and observe the lightning on the northern horizon. Then I was surprised to see a single red light almost identical the previous lights I had seen was rising from the east until it stopped abruptly. It seemed to flicker for a moment and then disappeared without perceivably moving. From that point, I walked home and prepared for bed.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,41.3775,-82.5349

On Friday, July 27, 2012, at approximately 20:57 EDT (00:57 UTC), I noticed a bright cylindrical object in the southern sky, moving from east to west.  I at first thought it was a low-lying commercial aircraft, however it was moving very slowly and I did not see any structure resembling an airfoil.  I then thought perhaps it was a blimp.  I had access to a pair of 7x50 field glasses.  With magnification, I was not able to see any tail structure, propellers or gondola, therefore I ruled out the notion that it was an airship. The object was cylindrical in shape, with the forward end wider than the tail end, somewhat resembling an elongated tear drop.  It also somewhat resembled the shape of a helicopter, however I did not see anything resembling a main or tail rotor.  The object was metallic in color, and reflected the orange-pink hues of the setting sun.  It made no sound that I could hear and was not emitting any vapor trail.  I did not observe any type of navigational or warning lights on the object. By my best estimate, the object when I first observed it was 3 to 5 miles due south of Hagerstown, Indiana (Wayne County).  It appeared to be traveling parallel to Interstate 70.  I estimated its altitude to be between 2000 to 4000 feet, and I estimated its speed to be no more than 25 miles per hour (again supporting my thought that it was an airship).  It appeared to maintain a steady course and altitude.  When I first observed the object, it was at almost 90 degrees on the east-west horizontal plain.  I watched it until it was no longer visible due to tall trees and a near-by building.  My last sight of the object was at 21:07 EDT (01:07 UTC).  I did not see it actually disappear over horizon.  I would estimate its position to be at approximately 160 degrees on the east-west horizontal plain. I am an avid aviation enthusiast and student of military aviation, as well as a former student pilot.  I have a good familiarity of both civil and military aircraft.  I am 48 years old and have had a keen interest in UFOlogy since childhood.  I have no explanation of what the object was, therefore I felt compelled to report this sighting to NUFORC.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,39.9251,-85.1677

My wife (educator), daughter (nine years old) and I (technical writer) arrived home at Dash Point, WA between 9:30 and 10:00pm on July 27th, 2012.  The sky was mostly dark already, with just a trace of dusk light near the horizon and the moon (a bit more than half) rising in the south over the top of Indian Hill in Northeast Tacoma.  No house or yard lights were on when we arrived home. As we got out of the car (all car lights off) I noticed a bright reddish-orange light off to the Northeast, moving roughly from North to South.  We see a lot of air traffic over Seatac from our home in Northeast Tacoma, but what caught my attention was the obvious fact that this was not an airplane.  The light was neither blinking nor steady, but looked most like the fireball flickering of shooting stars I’ve seen in the past.  But there were many aspects of this object that were unlike any shooting star I've ever seen.  First, the speed at which the light moved across the sky was MUCH slower than any shooting star I’ve ever seen before.  The speed was also inconsistent.  At times it moved at about the speed of a distant/high aircraft, then it appeared to slow down, then to speed up again, all the while moving in the same direction.  As it moved southward, the brightness of the object was also variable, sometimes getting brighter, sometimes dimmer.  This variation in brightn! ess appeared to be a change in the object itself and not the effect of any clouds between us and the object. The color was also unusual, that being an intense reddish-orange. Most shooting stars I've seen in the past were whitish, bluish or greenish in color. As we watched, the object continued to move to the south, until after a minute or so, it gradually began to grow steadily dimmer and dimmer.  A few seconds after the dimming began, what had looked like a fireball took on the appearance of a bright ruby-red point of light, continuing to grow dimmer until it finally winked out completely, much as you might see when a glowing bit of firework cools and goes dark.  As the object grew dimmer, it also appeared to slow down. The motion of the object the entire time was roughly in a straight line from north to south.  While the speed and brightness of the object varied, the direction didn’t seem to change. I’ve seen thousands of aircraft at night, I’ve seen dozens of shooting stars, I’ve seen a couple of comets, and I’ve seen reflected sunlight off the passing International Space Station and a couple of orbiting space shuttles.  This didn’t look quite like ANY of those.  In terms of the brightness and nature of the light, this looked most like a fireball shooting star, but most like a distant satellite in terms of its slow speed, except that the speed seemed to vary, sometimes nearly stopping. I have a theory, but that’s all it is.  It might have been a satellite falling out of orbit and breaking up.  This would seem to explain a) why it moved in a relatively straight line, b) why it moved slower than any shooting star I’d ever seen, and c) why it initially appeared as a fireball in the sky and not the steadier reflection of light off a coherent satellite or spacecraft, but then grew dimmer and dimmer and finally winking out.  But that’s just my best guess.  The whole thing took about 90 to 120 seconds from when we first noticed it the light to when the object went completely dark.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,47.21257223776224,-122.4597204895105

The lights were not moving, and appeared to make “smear” like shapes in the sky (especially the orange lights).   There were about 3 other witnesses that we pointed out the lights to that were also stunned by the lights.  The lights eventually faded out after about 15 minutes.   We were not able to see any stars or anything else in the sky.  The shapes were circular to oval, and appeared “smeared” (maybe due to cloud cover).   Spotlights were shining into the sky from downtown Minneap! olis (due to clubs/bars), and as the lights hit the orange balls, the balls would seem to quickly illuminate from the light reflection.   We have a good picture that shows what we saw as well.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,44.98078334423014,-93.29330787839163

The object's covered an area of the sky equivalent to an 8 1/2"" x 11"" sheet of paper at arm's length.  They were in no particular formation. The lights themselves were roughly the size of an average star and similar in brightness, except for when they flashed.  The flash was very very bright considering the size of the objects; it was almost blinding if you were looking at them when they flashed - like a camera flash, but slower and longer. Objects were viewed through a sliding glass door, at first.  Upon opening the door they appeared even brighter. As I observed them, some simply disappeared, but about 8 remained.   After a couple of seconds they began to move at a rate slightly faster than a commercial jet, at first.  One went west, one north, one east, and between 5 and 8 of them fanned out and moved in southerly directions.

I thought that it looked very strange and was way too close to the airplane for comfort.  The other object appeared to be round and smaller than the plane. Both were moving east, almost paralleled one another and very close it appeared both moving upwards and East. I fumbled with my cell phone camera to try to get a picture and by that time the object split off from the plane and went in a new direction. It was now moving in a horizontal line, where it was headed vertically before with the plane.  I do not have details if it was a exact angle or how this happened but it was then heading in a straight line to the right, due North I believe. So the object is now moving in a different direction from the plane and it looked like it was moving much quicker than the airplane now but not so fast that it was completely unable to track. So I followed it with my eye for a few minutes and the sun illuminated it for about 10 seconds and then it got out of the sun's illumination.  So basically it is a round, silvery gray object moving in a straight line now. I noticed that it had a bit darker silver dome and a brighter silver underbelly and it was not the shape of an airplane.  I say ""dome"" because it was not elongated like a plane, it was more round. I followed it for a while and I knew it was too high up in the sky to get a cell phone image it was just too high!  I also did not want to take my eyes off it!  It was heading directly to the right, in a straight line and then it just vanished right before my eyes.  The odd thing is I had a feeling that it was going to vanish. I don't know how I knew this.  It's almost like a sense that it was going to vanish.  After it was gone I could still see the plane I originally saw and how the other object looked absolutely nothing like it. The weather that day was completely clear, crisp 40 degrees and sunny winter day without a cloud in the sky.  The other planes in the sky all had little comtrails and did not just vanish.  This other ""craft?"" definitely stood out as being bizarre...which is why I am writing this. I spoke into my phone and got all these details down as soon as it happened so things would not fade and get jumbled in my mind.  I hope this report is useful, maybe someone out there saw it too or there is an explanation.  It seemed different that just another plane.  Something unusual about it, which motivated me to write my first ever UFO report.  No one else was on the trail at that moment.  It was like just me and this thing and I was mesmerized just watching it.  It was actually a pretty incredible feeling and I am glad I witnessed it.

I could not make out any major details other than a basic shape, being circular and white.  No military aircraft were seen any were near the object, though at least one Civilian Passenger plane a 757 and a Private Lear Jet flew in the vicinity of the object.  There were two other witnesses that saw the same object as it floated by.  Both of these witnesses saw nothing different than I did and said it was white and circular.  At 13:50hrs the ! object had floated out of view to the North.

I looked over and saw the craft, noticed that it was making zero noise, and took a few snap shots and a short video on my phone before the object got out of my focal on my camera.  The object traveled at a somewhat slow but constant speed, was very bright, but had a constant slow flicker. It continues outward into the sky and after it was out of the focal reach of the camera, I continues to watch the object until it was too far up to be seen.  Not sure what it was, but a stone shouldn't be able to reach those heights, and would make noise. It was round with no distinguishable ""body"" of a craft, so in this case it was purely an orange globe of light. This is not the first time I've seen I things in the area, but was the first that was not only close, but very close.

It was a rather  cloudy night, however my gaze turned  towards the sky and at the corner of my eye I saw the intense bright   moon casting its luminescence  hiding behind the clouds, suddenly the next minute I  glimpse at and I just saw  it just moved.  That's when  I paid attention for I assumed this is rather  bizarre ,more so  strange for the moon to move at that velocity, subsequently as I observed the cloudy night sky ; There was a white globe of light which one could visually measure it to  the size of the moon  around the Maney hill area where I live . I was entranced and mesmerised as   it started moving in a random yet circular fashion. I wasn't convinced so I looked more closely to find 4 to 5 more globes of white light similar to the size and shape moving in a random pattern. I ran upstairs to wake my husband up ,for this wasn’t a visual hallucination as I don’t drink , it was fascinat! ing as  he too witnessed it and presumed  they were laser beams .... I wasn’t convinced at the explanation as I seen laser beam displays, besides I questioned him “who would have a laser display at 2.30 am in the middle of the night”. Besides if the light is reflecting from below one can visualise the path or beam from below.  There wasn't any trace of torch or laser light shining from below  as it was above the clouds and very high . He  assumed it was perhaps solar flares and is the aurora borealis.  I disagreed as  the pattern had no resemblance to that of a  veil of northern lights, it was just pure white globes  of light , which one can  purely mistake it for a moon hiding  above the clouds . My hubby tried to capture it on camera, as we couldn’t capture the image we concluded that the digital camera was inappropriate and didn’t work for night vision images. Consequently I just watched intently and the pattern repeated itself once more and the globes of light disappeare! d, eventually the globe of light moved in the opposite directi! on of ou r house and vanished. The next morning I posted a query in our local Sutton Coldfield observer if anyone had witnessed anything or perhaps experienced what I had visualised for indeed it was rather strange and mysterious   phenomenon. There were no replies as it was late Sunday night and not many people would be awake when Monday commences as the working week. I am very analytical and believe in the rules of science, nevertheless still pondering if it were a natural phenomenon ... Not sure. I am convinced that this is not a prank. From my understanding of physics the incident light whilst shining from below wouldn't reflect in such an intensity , more so from above no way was it a real image  . The globes of light were too bright and too large... It doesn't sound logical at all. Either it is perhaps a military operation or something that cannot be elucidated. Rather unfortunate that the images we captured are not lucid. Furthermore as I was flabbergasted during the incident consequently my adrena! lin pumping impeded my ability to reflect or perhaps act logically to record the occurrence on an iphone was indeed an utter failure. Nonetheless I am convinced what I witnessed from the inception of my peripheral vision was not an illusion or a visual hallucination. It will be etched as a memory in my subliminal system ...

This evening, Wednesday, 12/12/12, at around 5:00, I was outside gazing at the stars when I looked to the east-south-east to see a VERY prominent, almost glittering, yellowish light in the sky, several degrees above the horizon, well above the tree tops. It was not up, up, up, in the sky. “Whoa,” I thought, “Mars? Really? No!” The light shone for about 4 seconds and then extinguished, and suddenly re-appeared well to the right (further to the south) of the first siting. This time the light was more intense, and shone for another 3 or 4 seconds, only to go out again and then re-appear, about a second later, even further to the south, glittering in the sky on the same horizontal plane as seen before.  This time I felt I could discern distinct lights.  This too shone for about 3 or 4 seconds then vanished again, and yes, re-appeared now in the south, again on the same horizontal pl! ane, again shining for a few seconds before disappearing.

Note that the light -- from one source I believe, not several -- did not move up or down, or side to side, when I observed it (when it appeared). It seemed stationary. It was not a white light, but a warm light, more yellow-white, or yellow. The area in which I live is a very, very quiet place. VERY quiet. And I spend a lot of time outdoors, even at night.

I always enjoy looking at the early morning and nighttime sky.  I live about 45 miles southeast of Columbus Ohio in the middle of nowhere, so there is very little light pollution from the city lights to ruin my beautiful view of the stars. It had rained for several days prior to this day so the cloud cover up until now had been constant. I walked down the few steps from my deck on to the sidewalk. The dogs were out in the yard somewhere in the darkness doing what dogs do.  I looked up and there was the beautiful star lit sky that I had missed for several days.  I was looking up and westward, probably around 70 degrees off of the horizon, not straight up but still at a rather steep angle.  As I was admiring what I had so terribly missed, I noticed that one of the ‘stars’ was moving. It was moving very quickly from a westerly direction towards the east.  My first thought was that it must be the ISS (International Space Station). I know it can be viewed at certain times and saw it myself a few years ago when one of the local TV weathermen mentioned on his telecast when and where to look for it.  The moving ‘star’ was just that………….about the same brightness as an average star in the nighttime sky and seemingly about the same size and distance away.  It was moving very, very quickly and then I realized it couldn’t be ! the ISS because it wasn’t moving in an exact straight path but rather had a slight waver to it as it traveled. It also didn’t maintain the same constant speed but would slow down slightly and the speed back up again. I blinked my eyes a couple of times and thought to myself, ""Am I really seeing what I think I’m seeing?""   I thought for a moment of running into the house to get my wife and have her see what I was seeing.  But I was afraid that it may be gone by the time I was able to persuade her to see for herself.  I continued to watch this peculiar ‘star’ when it suddenly made a very quick ‘U’ turn, turning to the south and then immediately back towards the west again.  This ‘U’ turn took all of 2 seconds tops. I knew then it couldn’t be any kind of conventional aircraft.  A jetliner has to make a prolonged swooping turn that would take many, many seconds.  An asteroid or meteorite would not make any turn at all to the best of my knowledge.  It was much too high to be a helicopter. I continued to watch this object as it was heading west again at a fast pace.   Suddenly, it made a 90 degree fight turn towards the north and traveled at the speed of a bullet until it was out of sight. This entire event that I witnessed was over a period of 15 to 20 seconds at the most. I continued to watch to see if ! it returned and went back outside several more times as the evening wore on but never saw it again. There was no audible sound from the object. It had no blinking lights but rather just the same constant glow and color as the stars. I went into the house and told my wife what I had just witnessed. She looked at me as if I had three heads. I told her that I should report this to ‘somebody’………….the Sheriff, the Highway Patrol………the Columbus International Airport……but who? She Googled something on her i-Phone and came up with the National UFO Reporting Center. I called the listed phone number and left a message. I received a call back a short time later and spoke with Mr. Peter Davenport, the director. He said he was very interested in my sighting and asked me to document what I saw on their web-sight. I am a 59 year old male.  I’m a Design Supervisor for an engineering company in Columbus Ohio.  We provide the design and engineering of protection and control systems for the local electric utility.  I’ve been doing this work for over 40 years. I’ve never witnessed a UFO before and quite frankly never thought I would.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,39.4504,-82.6927

At approximately 21:20 while waiting outside I happened to look towards the South West (225 degrees on my cell phone compass)and noticed 2 orange-ish red-ish lights in the far distant sky above some local shops.  I could not tell how far distant but assumed that they were planes coming into the SF Bay Area from the Pacific Ocean area, but that they were in a position in the sky where passenger planes do not normally appear.  I could not even try to guess how far they were apart but using the finger method they appeared to be approximately 1 1/2 fingers apart in the sky.   As I watched, the first one appeared if it was traveling slowly and started to turn to the right and climb higher. It eventually disappeared and I thought that maybe it was a plane that had disappeared into some distant clouds.  I watched the remaining visible light and followed the same path and then disappeared in the almost exact same place.  I know absolutely that these are not any known aircraft as every night while I wait for my wife to come home outside I continually watch the skys and watch all kinds of aircraft, both near and extremely far away fly by.  You can ALWAYS see their navigational markers flashing but these lights I saw tonight did not blink at all, no red/green/white blinking navigational lights anywhere, just the same steady orange-ish red-ish color. Approximately 3 or 4 minutes after the first 2 disappeared, 3 more appeared coming from the same direction.  These though, when I first saw them appeared to be a brighter red-ish color and then dimmed to the same color as the others.  These were also approx 1 1/2 finger apart and followed the same path and disappeared in the same area as the first to.  Once all 3 of these disappeared 2 more appeared approximately 3 minutes later and again, followed the same path and disappeared in the same place. I thought there was a cloud or something in that area and about a minute later I saw a distant plane (with blinking nav lights) fly from my right to the left (approx north to south) in the same area and distance and it was completely visable till it disappeared far to my left and far far south from where those lights disappeared so I know there were no clouds in that area. At this time it was 9:26 PM and about that time my wife came home from work. Just as she exited her car and was walking up the driveway, one more appeared again, I pointed it out to her and at first she thought it was a plane and I said no, just watch. 2 more appeared and she watched while the first one disappeared in the same area again and then went inside.

We sat and watched the star show for about an hour when something made me look at the horizon just above the mountain we were facing.  I instantly noticed a bright, bright star that held my attention because it was so big and appeared to be pulsating different colors. It was above the tree line and I drew my companions attention to it because I wanted their opinions of what it was. As we stared at it and agreed it was a plane it began to bounce in a graceful arc above the trees. It moved in a way that we had never seen from an air craft. We got a little loud with fear and excitement. It seemed to react to our reaction and after the arc shaped bouning for a few seconds it! lowered itself behind the tree line and we could only see it slightly through the summer tree canopy. Needless to say, I watched the spot it dissappeared to all night ignoring the stars and never saw it rise above the tree line again. Was it alien or human aircraft. Perhaps a helicopter but no noise was heard(maybe too far away)and the graceful arc bounce was so unordinary we huddled together out of fear. I'd love to know what we saw.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,,

I was in my truck talking on the cell phone when I noticed, through my windshield, a very large bright orange ball of light which appeared well above the horizon of the Galiura Mountain range east of the city of Mammoth, Arizona. It was at least 8 miles west of the city.  At first I thought it might be an aerial flare used by the military. Assuming that this object was facing me another object of the same size appeared just to its right but a little lower in elevation.  Then the second object temporarily “turned off” when a 3rd object appeared to the left of the first object but just slightly higher in elevation but of equal distance from the first object as was the second object.  As the 3rd object appeared the first object went out or disappeared. I ended my phone call rather abruptly and headed to my trailer to get my camera.  This all happened within about 45 seconds of the first appearance of the first orange ball. As I headed to my trailer I had noticed that they all had disappeared but as I got to the door of my trailer I noticed that one of them had appeared again. Then it went out just as another appeared but farther to the south and then it went out as another one appeared giving it an effect of “cycling” one to the next.  There were a total of five objects that were cycling and they were in a straight line at about an 8 degree angle. I use the term “cycling” because I had read another persons description from another UFO reporting website use this description and I thought it fit best.  If anyone has ever seen the lights on a Marquee at a theater you would notice that the lights seem to move but it’s really an optical illusion because they are only going out in a pattern and it’s the adjacent light that goes on making it appear that they are moving.  The orange lights that I saw were similar to this but a lot slower and much further apart. After the five lights had gone out I thought that maybe the “show” was over but I got my camera anyway.  One more orange ball appeared but much lower and at the other end of the 5 lights that had appeared and then went out after about 10 seconds. I have seen hundreds of thousands of landing lights from aircraft in my life and there wasn’t any possibility that these were aircraft landing lights from a plane. I have seen these orange spheres over the Picacho Mountains about 60 miles to the west several months ago.  It starts out with one orange ball glowing and then another one appears just to its right but a little below the first one.  Then another orange ball appears to its left but slightly higher.  The sightings over the Picacho Mountains lasted for several minutes but didn’t have the 5 lights that were “cycling”. I took pictures of the lights but they came out streaked because of the cameras movement.  A fixed tripod would have been the best to use for this purpose but I didn’t have one available. If this is an elaborate hoax someone has gone to a lot of trouble to make it convincing.  The only way this could be done would be to use helicopters or ultra-lites. The timing would have to be perfectly set up to have the lights go on and then off in the order that they were seen. Plus, there would have had to have had 6 aircraft there at the same time. Who knows, maybe someone will figure out what they really were.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,,

I only saw the very end of the object, but it was flat-sided, looked like polished aluminum, and had what I assumed were rivets or other attachment points. The sky was clear with no wind.  There was no noise, the object was angled slightly downward at about 200 feet agl and I assumed I had seen the tail end of a B-24 because, during the war, local pilots would sometimes fly low over their homes if they happened to be in the area.  The next morning, our newspaper had a front page article, below the fold, concerning a "" - military aircraft that appeared to be about to crash because its engine had stopped.""  Dozens of people along the Ohio river from near Louisville down to Owensboro had called law enforcement offices to report the impending crash landing.  It was interesting that none of the observers had reported whether the craft was single-engined, or multi-engined, nor whether it was low-wing, mid-wing or high-wing.  This caused me to reflect on what little I had seen: there had been no ""tail"" markings or hinge line, as it would have had if I had really seen the tail of a B-25.  At the time, I was a builder of model airplanes and our family subscribed to two model magazines plus Flying Magazine, therefore, had I seen the entire object, I would have been able to identify what aircraft I had seen.  No one used the terms UFO or flying saucer, because this predated Roswell by three or four years.  The partial object I had seen was flat-sided with upper and lower corners that were slightly rounded, much as was the case of the vertical stabilizers and rudders on a B-25.",,37.7610706185567,-87.15569742268042

This event happened in the late summer of 1965 just prior to returning to high school, I am fairly confident the month was August, however I do not remember the day, I suspect the it was a Friday.  I was 15 years old at the time, I am now 61 years of age.  This event was later confirmed by hypnosis as a contact event and certain details of this event which I did not consciously remember were uncovered and many years later corroborated by my friend L.V. who accompanied me the evening of the sighting.  My friend L.V. and myself had spent the evening at the movie theater.  The show lasted approximately 1 1/2-2 hours and started at around 7pm.  It was around 9pm when the movie got out and we walked home up Main Street. The walking trip home was approximately 30 minutes.  I remember that I didn't want to go to the movie that evening but my friend insisted and afterward I was very anxious to get home.  I remember I had a sense of dread walking home, I was on edge.  As we approached the street where my friend was to turn down in order to go home, leaving me alone to walk the rest of the way to my house, something happened which caused an argument between my friend and myself.  I consciously could not remember what it was (explained below).  The argument caused us to not speak to each other for several weeks.  What I consciously remember is I angrily walked off leaving her on her way as I proceeded home.  As I approached the turn off to my street approximately 2 blocks away, I b! egan to hear a very peculiar noise which grew louder and louder the further I walked.  The sound was akin to something metallic revolving very fast which I attributed to the axle of a tractor trailer in the distance.  I kept expecting to see traffic on the street but oddly there was none -- not one car passed the entire time, yet the sound continued increasing in volume.  I realized I couldn't determine which direction the sound was coming from -- it sounded as if it was coming from all directions. The sound took on the tone of what is described as 'metallic bees' but what was remarkable is there were no other sounds -- nothing -- no crickets, no traffic -- just the noise.  It frightened me a great deal as I picked up my pace anxious to get home.  When I reached the corner of my street, the sound became intense and I realized it was coming from directly behind me.  I swung around and there in the air just above house top level was an oval-shaped brightly glowing disk hoveri! ng above Main Street.  It was arc welder white with swirls of ! various scintillating colors and almost hurt the eyes to look at it.    It was approximately 40 degrees above the horizon and above house top level.  At arms distance the craft was approximately 32"".  It was as wide as a Victorian house.  It was approximately 6 times wider than it was thick.  When I first saw the craft it has been moving very slowly in a southward direction and gave the impression that it was following behind me as I walked up the street.  Immediately after I turned around and saw it, the sound became extremely intense and it sped up, I could see it go behind a stand of tall spruce trees traveling parallel to the ground, I lost sight of it behind the houses for a few seconds, to see it emerge at the end of the street where there was a large drop off.  It arched skyward and I watched it until it disappeared among the stars.  The sound I had heard dissipated the further the craft went away from me.   Afterward, I ran directly to my house screaming to my mother that th! ere was something strange in the sky.  I noted the time to be 10 minutes to eleven p.m. after my mother commented that I was late returning home -- which was more than an hour later than it should have been. I had no explanation for the time lapse other than my friend and I spent some time talking before she went home.  Years later I had a reoccurring dream where my friend L.V. and I had an argument about a UFO we both had seen which first appeared as a ""shooting star"" that approached us from behind.  It stopped dead in the air and dropped at a right angle to the ground behind some trees in a near by park.  In my dream my friend insisted it was a UFO and I vehemently denied it and we argued about it.  She walked off in a huff.  I never attributed this dream as relative to the conscious sighting described above.  In 1995 under hypnosis, 30 years after the conscious event described above,  I recalled the conscious sighting event to be the end of a contact experience where 'shooting star' dream was the beginning of the contact event.  The unremembered contact event happened in the park where L.V. and I had seen the 'shooting star'  drop to the ground. Under hypnosis, I witnessed a large oval craft on the ground and its occupants.  I'm not going to go into all the details of this hypnosis sessi! on here, except to say that there was one 5' tall grey being with large black eyes which politely led me to the sitting craft where I met many other beings which appeared as extremely thin bug-like mantis creatures with whitish skin and very large black eyes.  They were non hostile and the event seemed to be some sort of meeting which I was not able to recall the details of under hypnosis.  I did recall under hypnosis that the beings were very amused that I couldn't figure out what they were and they had been given me information which was extremely important that I would remember later. It is notable that this hypnosis session was more than 20 years after I'd lost contact  with my friend L. V. However ironically a few years after the hypnosis session I accidentally met her again.  When we saw each other at a distance, we nearly ran to each other saying we had to talk -- and we both knew what we had to talk about.  L.V. confirmed that she consciously remembered the 'shooting star' and that was the source of the argument the night of the sighting.  L.V. also disclosed that a few days after this event she and another friend mutually had another sighting of their! own of a large glowing craft where there was about 10 minutes missing time experience and she and the other girl found themselves in a different location several blocks away from the location of the sighting.  Thank you for allowing me to record my sighting.  Hopefully it will be of benefit to others.  After a life time of pondering various unusual events in my life, I have come to the conclusion that we are definitely not alone in the Universe and the entities which have made contact with human beings are benign, highly advanced and represent civilizations billion of years older and wiser than human beings.  I am no longer fearful of these events or the unknown in the Universe.  My only wish is that humanity will be able to some day achieve the technological expertise to peacefully traverse the stars and in turn welcome meeting other sentient extraterrestrial races rather than spend their time and resources killing life here on Earth.  Life is precious in the Universe, and that is a lesson human beings have yet to learn. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was on my way home from work at the hospital where I work as an RN at approximately 0040 on January 13th, 2013.  I was on the phone with my brother from California and was turning East onto Big Beaver Rd. and then planned to turn right onto Rochester Rd. in Troy.   As I was turning East onto Big Beaver, I looked up at the street and traffic lights on that corner and noticed that there was a orange orb of sorts that looked like it had a flame in the center of it flickering just above the street lights and moving in a horizontal fashion at a slow pace.  I could not comprehend what I was seeing, so I turned into the parking lot and just parked to watch it.   At first, I thought it might be a Chinese lantern, but it was close enough to see there was nothing surrounding the flame like orb.  I then noticed a second one appear close behind it going in the same direction.  At that point, I told my brother that I was seeing something unusual and that I needed to get off th! e phone to try to video tape this. Very quickly, the two lights had moved very far away in the distance and a third light appeared.  The three lights got into a triangular pattern and looked stationary for about 30 seconds or more.   It was at that point that I had gotten off the phone, parked my car, and pulled out my iPhone to take a photo and then some video.  I regret that I did not have the ability to pull out my camera and start videotaping when these two orbs were closer to me!  I’m very upset that I did not just hang up on my brother and start videotaping right away.  What shows up in my video are the three lights in the distance, very high up in the sky in the triangular pattern.   As I was in the parking lot, there was a lot of light pollution from the parking lights, so I drove past them and parked again and got out of the car to keep videotaping.  At that point, the lights started to disappear one by one.  The entire incident was approximately two minutes in length.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  There were other cars at that intersection during the same time, so I’m sure there is someone else out there who witnessed this.   After thinking about what I saw and going through all the possibilities, I’m convinced that this was not a Chinese lantern. To see it so close, move so slowly, and then quickly ascend and move SO far away so without any wind tells me that this is something else entirely.  The objects made no sound whatsoever.  The third one appeared only after the other two were high up in the sky.  Up close, they were almost organic looking in nature, and did resemble a flame of sorts, but not a flame.  That is the best way I can describe them, as I have nothing else to compare them to.   I did not see a metal object or disk.  It was simply this beautiful, natural looking orange/reddish light, gliding along. Ironically enough, once I stepped out of my car and started video taping, I heard police sirens in the distance.  Nothing has been reported locally, although some night prior, our local Fox2 News station did a report on lights in the sky that people in the metro Detroit area have been seeing.",2013-02-18T00:00:00,42.56675797546012,-83.15395782208589

She had shoulder length bright blonde hair that looked almost white.  Her eyes were black with no white showing.  She was wearing sweat pants and a hoodie, but the hood was not covering her head.   When I saw her, I said, ""Hi, how you doing this evening?""  She mumbled something, but I could not hear what she said.  She moved her head back and forth as she stood there checking me out curiously.  I felt there was something not quite right about her and felt a definite chill.  Though it was cold outside, the chill was not due to the weather.  I cautiously took a few steps towards her and she backed up.  In a moment she took off running, but not like any human or animal I had ever seen.  She ran with a fluid movement and there was no sound as her feet hit the ground.  She disappeared out of sight.

While we were stopped in heavy traffic, the 2nd ""copter"" swayed erratically from side to side above the busy highway.

We could see it was not a helicopter, but was an extremely large cube or boxy silver object.  It morphed into an elongated box, then became a sphere and then a whole array of boxy shapes, as it hovered, and raised and lowered its altitude.  We saw no lights on it.  There were no vapors coming from it.  When it changed shape it would momentarily shine like a piece of reflective aluminum. Finally it just shot off to the northeast at a high rate of speed.

I noticed several other red lights in the sky following the same path.

I was looking at the stars as it was a clear night.  While gazing upward a red flashing light caught my attention and I started looking at it.    I first thought it was an airplane but as I continued to look at it, the light continued to flash red but didn't move along the horizon as a plane would.  Then it disappeared from that spot and literally jumped to another spot.  Still flashing red light but now I'm seeing sporadically flashed of green below the red light.   At this point it jumped to various potions in the sky around the same vicinity that I originally viewed the light.

As we approached the Horizon Drive exit, my son says,  ""Mom, there it is,"" and points directly to the driver's side window or to the south side of I-70 headed west.   There I looked to see a very large cone shape with rotating red lights at the top of the cone and green strobing lights underneath that were blinking and and circulating as well as moving up and down as like a spring coiling and recoiling.  The object seemed huge to me, the cone being as big as maybe a 15-20 story building.  There was also some sort of mist or cloud around the outer edges of the cone.   I wanted to continue looking at this but I had to direct my attention back to the road as we immediately exited the interstate and parked as fast as possible, but once we had gotten out of the car, the object was gone.  I have never encountered anything like this but my son had been telling me for about four years that he and two of his friends had seen this before but not experiencing it myself, I couldn't wrap my head around it until now.

As I am leaving the driveway I see a large red light in the sky to the south east. I think to myself this is probably mars.  Mars behind some thin clouds as it also had a red glow I was assuming from shining through clouds.  It seemed too big to me to be Mars but I was still going with that notion until it moved. Some background about me. I am an avid aviation person. I have my own aviation website. I am a student pilot and have soloed.  I have served in the Air Force and have 20/25 vision.  Better than average. I can tell you what an aircraft is from a distance of miles and my head always turns to the sky when I see something (anything) flying.  I keep a pair of binoculars in the car and pull over when I see something I want to check out further. This night when I headed out the driveway I stopped when I saw the red light. I got out of the car with my binoculars and began watching. As I am watching the object faded out as if it went further into a cloud and just got swallowed up.  I have seen that with aircraft before.  As I took my binoculars from my eyes I instantly saw out of my peripheral the same object or one like it. This time it was east about 100 degrees.  This time it seemed closer and had the same red center and red glow but this time it had a short searchlight about 35 degrees wide.  Again I thought it’s in clouds and the searchlight must be hitting the outer edges thus stopping and not going to infinity.  The searchlight was panning up and down and in every direction and seemed to me at least from my vantage point to be on a single plain, as in it wasn’t round it was a flattened light.  During this time the object/craft is moving a short distance in its general area.  Not hovering but not really covering any g! round just staying in a relative position in the sky.  I realized then that there was not a cloud in the sky.  None just clear sky and stars…   I decided I needed a witness so I was going to call my friend and get him to look outside.  Instead I decided even if I got him on the phone he may not get out of wherever he was as see it in time so I decided to take my phone and take pictures instead…  I got 4 good pictures at full zoom… With each picture I am watching the craft in between shots as what I see in the view finder is a speck compared to what I actually see with my eye.  After the fourth Picture I pulled the camera/phone away from my face and see it is shooting down towards the ground it seems slow and takes about 10 seconds but the distance it went was a good distance across the sky so I know it was much faster than it seemed.  An aircraft such as a Cessna could not cover that much ground that fast, and also do the slow hovering it had been doing…  The craft shot to the ground and left a trail or light path of dashed lines to the ground I looked at the pictures after it was too low to the ground and had passed behind trees and houses.  I did not realize I caught this on camera.  I at first thought image 4 was a blur because I moved the camera.  Upon examination and thinking about it. I had captured the first part of the shooting towards the ground.  I realized this because there were 2 objects in the picture.  One blurred and one not blurred.  If I had moved the camera then both objects would have blurred. There is definite shape to the second object and with enhancement it becomes much clearer.

At the intersection of North Davidson and 11th street, near the onramp to 277 we observed an object hovering stationary in the sky toward the East/South, roughly over the Eastern side of Plaza- Midwood area, could be directly over Central and Hawthorne. It was on a Monday morning at around 8:55 AM.   Upon entering 277, we watched the object stay stationary and kept it in visual range until the beltway passed the exit for 4th and 3rd street, roughly 2 minutes.  During that time the object did not change position.  It struck us as odd because it was not behaving like an airplane or bird, and was too low in the sky for an airplane other than for an approach to landing or takeoff.  It was in the right location for a large bird, but it was not flapping any wings or gliding.   The oddest part was the shape, which is difficult to describe but I will do my best:  It was kind of a lopsided ""kidney bean"" shape, vertically oriented and proportioned so that the upper half was slightly larger than the other, rounded, and slightly curved or -c shaped.   It was too far away to make out any discernible details, but it appeared to have a surface texture or facets, and did not appear smooth and shiny. After we were out of visual range, and I was dropped off at work, my counterpart returned to the area about 10 minutes later, but the object was missing.",2013-02-18T00:00:00,35.20580084001527,-80.82639156166476

I was at the traffic light facing north and noticed the object which appeared to be a great enough distance above the tree line to make me wonder what exactly it was as it did not appear to be a tower, billboard, planet, etc.?  The object was stationary and almost looked like the silhouette of a really tiny planet but obviously within a few miles of my position and not in outer space, at least as far as I could tell. I snapped a couple photo’s with my iphone before the light changed with the thought that I’d relook at the area at another time when it was lighter out and compare my photographs.  I retook the photo this morning (10-23-12) when the sun had started coming up (7:23 am).  I definitely could not see anything in my second photo that could have been the object in my first photo (btw, I am going to try and attach the photos to this word document).

St. Rt. 74, Batavia, Ohio 45103, when two groups of bright orange/red lights caught my attention. The first group came from the east and traveled in a WNW direction. The second group came along about ten minutes later, appearing from a more southerly direction and traveling on a NNW line. If I were to draw a line on a map, the first group was heading towards Indianapolis and the second was headed towards Fort Wayne, Indiana. I was not able to distinguish any physical form within the lights so it is hard to estimate their elevation, but they appeared to be very high... my guess would be approximately 10,000 feet. The lights also seemed to be traveling very, very fast. The first set of lights was visible for about twenty seconds, the second group I was able to track much longer... nearly a minute. If I am correct about the elevation of the lights, I would say their rate of travel was over twice that of any jetliner I have ever seen in the sky. It is worth noting that in both instances there was absolutely no sound apparent from the objects. The lights were in a group of three that would coalesce into a single light, then split apart to three separate lights and then again regroup. This happened repeatedly with both groups of lights. The color of the light varied from a light orange, to orange to red. This coloring was also fluctuating. Estimating the size of the lights is again difficult as there was nothing concrete to offer comparison, but when asked how they looked in relation to a star or the moon it gave me an idea to perhaps explain it. If the moon were the size of a basketball then the lights would be about the size of an American fifty cent piece. Likewise, if a star were a dime, the lights would relationally be roughly the size of a basketball. So, they were much larger than a star, but much smaller than the moon.

On 6/26/2012 at 1:00a.m. my dog needed to go out. It had been raining very hard and very windy due to Tropical Storm Debbie. When I opened the door I expected to have to use the umbrella but it had stopped raining. I walked the dog around my cul-de-sac and directly across the street from my house to the west above the tree line was  very bright deep orange lights. I was trying to figure out what I was looking at and I was mesmerized by the light. It was not high in the sky or was it far away. As I was looking at this light it was intensifying with a back & forth movement. I went into the house still trying to wrap my brain around what I had just seen. Later that morning my dog was in the yard and was barking loudly at 2 baby owls sitting on my back fence. My husband grabed his phone & took a picture of them. He watched them later fly into our Palm Tree where they stayed for 2 days. On 6/28/2012 he took pictures of them and I sent those on to you Mr. Davenpor! t. I had told a close friend about what I saw and then I tried to report it to the local news networks but they said that it wasn't newsworthy. I beg to differ....Then on the morning of 6/28/2012 on GMA at 7:30 there was a report by Robin Roberts and George Stepanopolis  about UFO sightings and my friend then called that what I had told her 2 days ago was being verified in different states.  From then on I have been trying to process what I have seen and know to be real. We are not alone.  Since the sighting or encounter I have been feeling very anxious because I do not feel free to discuss this .  I am certain about what I have seen. My dog saw it also because he used to love to go out and walk but now he will not go past the driveway. He turns around and wants to go back into the house. He also stands behind the heavy wood Door and barks at nothing? I feel like I have expierenced something so very special but on the other hand it makes me feel like we have absolutely no cont! rol over anything.

I was supposed to meet fellow employees at Mc Donalds before going to work.  They were late and I was eating alone.   It was approx 5:30am and it was still dark.  When I noticed a ball of flame shoot over the mountain.  It shot in a straight line then zig zagged and disappeared going south east to south west over top of the mountains. It was directly over the US government installation BAE systems (an aeronautical defense company) located in Kingsport. BAE systems was formerly known as Holston Defense.    The Fireball was the size of a soccer ball in the sky and compared to normal sized stars it did not fit the usual description. It was very large with a piercing bright white and phosphorous glow. The sighting only lasted for a few seconds. I didn't hear anything, and it was too big to be compared to a typical shooting star. It did not travel down towards the earth, but instead It traveled horizontal and then zig zagged until it disappeared.   I do not believe it was a shooting star simply because it did not travel in the expected path of something entering into the earths atmosphere, and it was unusually large.

The object looked like it was about kite level.  About the distance that I sees the hawks fly.  The object was orange in color, and was flickering in a slower than flame pattern.  The bottom part of the object was almost rectangle shaped at the bottom base and was highlighted with a little red around the edges.  The upper area of the object was almost a lighter orange but had no outline. AND NO SOUND AT ALL!  I have seen the sky lanterns and weather balloon images and it was definitely more alive. Almost organic looking... it looked like it had a slight chug momentum almost like a swimming stroke. It was on an east to west path and then just dissipated almost like in to the clouds.  But it was a cloud free night.  I have just started having strange urges to look in to this stuff like the nephi! lim and angles and I have never even thought about looking into the sky.  I have had a strange feeling in my heart the last few days and it is so strange I happened to see this with 2 other people.  The strangest is that we just found out my wife was pregnant and we were breaking the news the moment the object showed up… I had heard recently that if you use the name of Jesus it would leave so I prayed aloud, “In the name of the lord Jesus Christ I rebuke you”.

I scanned the sky and found another extremely faint light traveling due south off to the righ of where the original spotted light was. I don't wear glasses and I could still see this light even though it was very faint. That's why I knew that these two objects weren't traveling in our atmosphere. It was way fainter than the International Space Station would appear in the sky. Besides I don't think the ISS would travel in two opposite directions.

I opened the blinds, and it was still very dark, that’s when I noticed a stationary red pulsating light over the neighbor’s apartment.  I continued to watch the light for about 2-3 minutes it would flash 9 times red then 1 time white.   As I continued to watch the light I noticed another red light seemingly to come from nowhere fly directly underneath the original red light.  I continued to watch the lights for about another minute, that’s when the second light to arrive shot off to my left over my roof, and out of sight.  I knew at that time that this was not a helicopter.

It was completely still in the sky very bright, and very silent.   I went back inside and continued to watch the fla! shing light 9 red 1 white.

It was also moving in a manner unlike any plane with hovering then deep descents and ascents as if it was looking for something. I slowed down my vehicle and went on the shoulder of the road.  I thought it was a helicopter ready to land but there was no sound. The orb seemed to be comming towards my direction (floating, blinking) in a eastern trajectory at approximately 250 feet in the air intersecting above my vehicle. THE FOLLOWING IS WHAT I SAW.  As the Orb passed directly overhead within my upward field of vision,  It continued to blink pulsating Orange bursts.  When it arrived overhead, the Pulsating blink visibly illumated the bottom of the craft for 3 total  blinks before it passed out of view.  The undercarriage was also backlit with darkened contrast due to some bright moonlight ! from the evening sky behind it.  The Blinking seemed to originate from the front section of the vessel only. What it illuminated underneath itself revealed a large rectangular vessel approximately 200 yards long and 150 yards wide.  This was HUGE!.  It is still earie speaking about this because I still have flashbacks about what I saw and my worldview on reality has now changed.  This immense vessel made no sound whatsoever and I noticed from the undercarriage the shimmering effect emanating like heat coming off the dessert sand. It is impossible to suspend such mass in the air with human technology.  I had 3 looks at it and still do not want to beleive what I saw.  Even stranger, after leaving the encounter, I telepathically transmitted to the craft that I knew they were there and that I acknowledged their presence wondering what they are doing here.

Every other set point entered on my GPS! worked fine.  The destination I was heading for however would consistently not offer a logical route and had me heading for the USA border.

Both had multiple white lights and moved around. I couldn’t fall asleep, so I looked out my window and saw what looked like a star.  It moved out of my sight, so I sat up in bed and split my blinds to see.  At that point I realized this object was below the clouds (right at the bottom edge of the clouds because a few times it crossed into them slightly.) I kept watching and thought to myself that it must be a plane or helicopter, but no, then another appeared and I realized they were moving very smoothly in different directions.  The movements were very subtle but I could tell they weren’t moving in a straight line like an airplane would because I compared their position to my blinds. They were kind of just white lights.  I kept eye contact on one and realized it seemed to have one bright light (or big light) in the center and many small lights circling that, like a stereotypical flying saucer I guess.  I think since it was so dark the lights were all I saw, and I really didn’t see a distinct body or shape, but!  because of the placement of the lights I could assume they were somewhat disc shaped and more convex at the top and bottom.  They weren’t flat discs. (more like lemons from the side view.)  By the time I realized one of the two objects was gone, the other was leaving as well.  It became very still, and then the light got smaller rapidly. (Almost as if it zoomed away, but something about it was a little different.  Maybe it was just too fast.) I was the only observer from my point of view, but I hope that other people in my area saw these as well.  For background, I’m a 15 year old girl and I’m going into my sophomore year at high school.  I suppose it might be useful to know that I’m perfectly healthy, physically and mentally.  I also happen to have 20/20 vision, so that’s pretty nice. I also haven’t taken any drugs or medication, and I’m not dehydrated or starved. (I think that might be enough to rule out a hallucination, right?)  I’ve always had an interest in UFO stories but se! eing one right above my home was extremely nerve wracking. At ! this poi nt I’m half-curious and half terrified, but I’m sure these visitors weren’t trying to harm us earthlings. They looked like they were observing us or taking note of something. The way they moved reminded me of the way someone would scan their eyes over their suitcase to make sure they had everything packed. (hopefully you can imagine that.) One last note, thank you to whoever keeps track of this site and thank you to anyone who took the time to read this. I had no idea this sort of service existed and right now I’m glad it does.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,,

2 stars moving in the sky & more.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of planets in the eastern morning sky.

One of them positioned in the place where the other one was (like i said territorial position not the exact position) The other one that looks it was about to do the same, it didn't (Both stars were moving at the same time, this part of the event had a duration of 3-4 seconds) Once one of the stars took the territorial position over the other one, stops moving. The other one took territorial position of the other one almost at the same time (Or at the same time, hard to say) didn't stop moving, this one kept moving and position it self at the other side of the sky (Like if i am with my arms opened this second star moved from one of my hands to my other one over my head, keeping the proportions and it wasn't exactly a 180 degrees move, thats the best way i can explain it) This star moved extra 9-10 seconds after the other one stops, so in total it moved around 12-14 seconds) I have to say, that the apparent switch it was more like a discovering surprise, when the other star m! oved like that i really freaked out. So, this event took like 12-14 seconds. After that both stars stopped moving, i took some seconds (less than a minute probably) to see where these stars where located then  look for another witness and also my camera. I told my friend what i saw, and he told me ""i believe you and i don't want to go outside"" so i took the key of my car and looked for my camera that i had inside my car) Then came back to the place i saw the events (All of this probably took me like 90 seconds) I came back, and this is what freaked me out some more:  While looking for the stars in the places i saw them stop from moving when i left, i found them real easy because that was the moment i realized they were not regular stars. They were changing colors from blue to red (being blue the predominant color, sometimes when turning from blue to red i could observe like a regular white bright light, but i didn't observe this every time so i don't know if that is an optical illusion or my eyes were tired at some point)  The object that moved for only 3-4 seconds were in the same location when i came back with my camera, but the other one didn't. I looked around and i didn't see it, but i saw this really bright star almost in the same location so i guess it was the same star (I am talking about stars because i don't know, i am trying to give myself my own explanations) This star wasn't turning colors, it was just a bright star (The most brightest in the sky that night, so bright that my camera got it) I don't check the video i took in the computer yet, but this bright star was able to appear in the film i took, not the rest of the stars or moving stars my camera was not able to capture them due to the dark and distance (I mean at that time, i think i have video recording of the star that actually change colors in the morning, but let me finish the story)  It was under my perspective at the moment that the brighter star was the star i saw moving from 12-14 seconds. So, i kept focus in that star and the other one (They were in different extreme of my view of the sky, so i couldn't watch both at the same time)  The other star was still there, not moving but turning from blue to red... Then after about 40 minutes i started to realized that the brighter star in the sky was still the brightest in the sky but not like before so, i started looking in all around the sky, every place, every spot. After 20 minutes i can say with property that they were 5 stars not moving but turning from blue to red. Also (Because i discovered the event around 4.30am) After the sky was a little less dark due to the rise of sun, i could detect that the star that i saw moving for 3-4 seconds was farer than i thought in the first place, and also that this star couldn't stay easily in the same place, it was like moving (A really hard to detect move) up and ! down, i couldn't appreciate that in the really dark sky, or maybe at that point my eyes were tired, or it was an optical illusion due to some more light in the sky (I don't know)  Then in the morning, i was able to film the object that moved from 12-14 seconds, i still don't see it in my computer but i was able to see it in the screen of my camera when filming.  Also you only will see a point in the sky so i don't expect to somebody to take that as evidence.  Another important thing, during the 2 hours i was there (From about 4.30am and 6.30am) I saw 3 falling stars, i saw falling stars before but always falling stars that born in the sky and die in the sky. These were falling stars that born in the sky and die in the horizon, like they were hitting the ground. I saw this 3 times (The first time was about 12 minutes after i saw the 2 stars moving and closer to the one that only moved for 3-4 seconds (Yes, i freaked out)  Around 6.30am i was able to see in the sky only, the brightest star i saw in the sky the whole night, the second brightest, the 2 stars that moved (There were stars brightest than the ones that moved but i wasn't able to see them, i don't know why i was still able to see the star that moved if they were not brighter than other ones that i couldn't see anymore, at this point i only could see them like a star not blue and red colors anymore) And i was able to see also 1 more of the stars that i didn't see moving, but i recognized earlier turning blue and red.  Then i decided there is no more reason for being there anymore, and since i was being eaten by mosquitos for 2 hours i went inside the house.  I have to say that, i am an industrial engineer, i don't do drugs, i wasn't drinking that night or the night before (or the one before that one) And i am not the kind of person who believes stories. I am pretty much a city guy, i have been working in a project in this farm, the sky looks different here as it looks in the city, so maybe what i saw it is normal (I will be looking in the internet more information about what i saw) And maybe by posting here, any of the staff can send me an explanation. I will be watching the skies in the following days at the same time to see if i get something again.  Ah yes, i went outside at 4.30am because the restroom that works is in the 2nd floor of the house, and i just went outside to use a tree instead since i was not in the second floor.

At 8:30 P.M. on the 27th of July, 2012, my husband and I were walking our dogs and saw several UFO’s at the end of our street. We live on the edge of the Sonoran Desert At 8:30 P.M. on the 27th of July, 2012, my husband and I were walking our dogs and saw several UFO’s at the end of our street. We live on the edge of the Sonoran Desert in North Phoenix near Cave Creek, AZ. and always enjoy the view. The mountains and horizon looked like a postcard and the horizon was purplish blue. As I gazed up at the sky, I noticed that there were a lot of trails crossing the sky. In fact, the sky was full of them. And there seemed to be a gigantic X in the sky where two of the largest ones crossed each other. My husband and I thought that this was very odd indeed. On further reflection, it seemed that the X marked a meeting spot. Then we noticed that coming from the north, very high in the horizon, what appeared at first to be a plane was not a plane at all. It was soundless, for one thing and moved erratically.  I could not believe my eyes. It jumped around sporadically in a fashion that no plane is capable of doing. As it jumped, it blinked, and then it hovered, waiting. Why was it waiting?  Then we noticed that an actual plane ( or what seemed at first to be a plane) was some distance from it but seemed to have some connection with this object as well as the other unidentified flying objects. This first one would not continue on its path until the plane- or what appeared to be a plane- turned off its lights. At that point, the object flew in a southernly direction in a slightly more normal path though at no time did any of them have the noise of a plane. This happened several times. We saw seven of them, and they did not all appear to be exactly the same though they all did act in an erratic fashion. Some had orangish lights and some had greenish lights. Some were bigger than others and seemed to have lights that blinked as if they were  rotating discs. The smallest of these were more cigar or bullet shaped and the size of a plane, but two seemed to be much larger. One was in the shape of a triangle. We watched fascinated. Before we left, one of the very largest ones first hovered and then headed in the opposite direction. It first headed closer to us and then followed us across the street like a low flying plane above the trees which made me feel quite uneasy indeed. Except for the last one, we lost sight of all objects over the horizon or they seemed to just disappear. Also, while this was going on at one point we looked at the moon and it was clear. Five minutes later there was a distinct trail across it- like a long line. There were no lights moving in the area. If it was created by a chemtrail in the area, then the flying object had no lights as we saw nothing saw cross the moon. It is odd that they all came from the same exact place and seemingly from out of nowhere.  We watched them as they appeared. My husband  now suggests it was perhaps from the area of 51 Las Vegas. They all headed in the same direction ( seemed to be Goldwater Preserve SW of Phoenix). We could not identify any landing. One flew back to the point of origin, inexplicably. The rest, five, continued on out of our sight except for the last one which followed us. It seemed to be a convoy mission of some sort ( some escorting others into the area that they were all headed).  The “plane” that shut its lights off and then on from the object waiting to make its flight seemed to be giving it a signal to pass. Also, not only was their behavior bizarre (hovering and stationary and then deep ascents or descents), soundless, and erratic, but they appeared to have come from a much greater distance than a plane possibly could. When they first appeared, they seemed to be brighter than the brightest star, so perhaps that gives some indication of size and distance. It seems as if they came out of thin air and were at first at a much greater distance. In fact, at first they looked star like, then like several  bright points that jumped around a bit( to get stabilized?) and then, coming closer (it appeared) into our atmosphere, you could detect some type of shape with lights (green or red) at the bottom of the unidentified flying object.  They all moved noiselessly unlike planes and were able to move in a manner unlike any plane. We did not take our eyes off of them, but I had the creepy feeling with some of them that they were trying to approximate the look of a plane once they began to f! ly in the same southwesterly direction. However, planes do not shut their lights off or hover and come to a standstill, planes do not come out of nowhere as far away as a star then jump in inexplicable patterns, and planes do not fly noiselessly.  I was not sure whether or not they actually changed their shape or the shape came into focus as it came closer. My husband and I are serious, well-educated, and professional people and have no reason to be making this up.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

The lights were brighter as if they were closer to our location. We watched this for about 20 to 30 seconds. Note: My wife was in a hurry to grab her camera, the fourth and fifth flying ship arrived in about 10 to 20 seconds. Once again not from the horizon, but from the atmosphere/space.

Our home is located northeast of Mountain Avenue and 21st Street.  I called the upland police at about 9:20 PM to ask them if anybody else has called in reporting some UFO’s. The lady that answered the phone said that no one had called her about this topic.  She gave ma a phone number to call to report this type of activity but it was a wrong number. I called the National UFO Reporting Center at *82 1 (206) 722-3000 at about 9:30 PM and talked to Peter Davenport. Mr. Davenport asked be to briefly explain what I have seen.  He did not want to tell me about other peoples reports and he then told me to write a report.  He said he would talk to me more after sending in a report.  He said he did not want to taint my report by talking about what other people have reported. Note I took a picture. The flash was on the camera and did not pick up a useful illustration. By the time I tried to take another picture the ships were gone. Flying ships; very bright, no noise, did not fly along the horizon. Vehicles came and left from the atmosphere/space. This drawing, which did not paste, depicts that the azimuth of the ships were about north 15 degrees east of the intersection of Mountain and 21st Street in the City of Upland California.

On the evening of Saturday, January 19, 2013, I saw something unusual. I was at Klondike Park, a sandstone-rich park in Augusta, Missouri, which is in eastern Missouri about fifty miles west of St. Louis.  The brilliant white sandstone is why it’s called Klondike Park because it sort of looks like the rocks are snow-covered. I was on a night hike. I was looking up at the stars, and it was a beautiful night for doing so, completely clear and far enough from civilization to where you could see a lot of them.  I believe I was looking up into the low eastern sky but I cannot guarantee that (I was looking up and to the right; if I had looked up and to the left I would have been looking at the Big Dipper and Orion). I happened to be looking at two ordinary stars, not very bright, right next to each other.  Since they were so ordinary, why I found myself fixated on them for more than a few seconds is a mystery. Anyway, it turns out that one of the stars was not so ordinary. Suddenly one of them starts moving straight away from the other, a very smooth movement. I thought, ""Oh it’s a plane,"" even though a few seconds before it had been completely stationary. Then, suddenly, it vanished! It was just gone. Now since it had been stationary I don’t see how it could have been a plane or a meteor or even a satellite. Barring any weird astronomical phenomena I am unfamiliar with, I would have to say that was some sort of flying object, and since I could not identify it, I guess that was a UFO. But was it an alien spacecraft of some sort? Who knows? I don’t. But I definitely could not identify it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD))",2013-02-04T00:00:00,,

On 01/19/13 at 18:43 my husband and I had come out of the Grayson Kroger. We had just put our groceries in our vehicle and as we were getting into the Front of our vehicle, I heard my husband say “Are we being invaded?” As I looked up into the night sky in front of us we saw about five amber colored lights pulsating. I replied and said: “oh, it is Saturday it’s got to be our military.” Then all of a sudden about four more appeared. It seemed like they were moving closer but in different distances. It is very hard to give any kind of measurement because it was dark. We could not hear them at all. All of a sudden on the right side two lined up perfectly, one on top of the other. It looked as if it was headed straight for us so we drove out of the parking lot driving towards them so we could get a better look at them. We approached the intersection at Rosebud Road and Grayson Highway we could still see them up through the trees.  The two still lined up one above the other and to the left a few were still scattered about but they had moved closer together.  It looked as if they were hovering above the trees.  We turned into this Church parking lot to try to get a better look and out of traffic. The lights had faded out, almost like they went backwards away from us. This was the most unusual thing we had ever seen.  It wasn’t any kind of aircraft we are aware of. I’m not even sure anyone else saw them.  Again, the lights were an amber color not to red and not to orange.  I would say they may have only one light on each one. I just wished it had been day light so I could explain them in more detail. I have to say it makes me wonder if we really are being watched. Now, after seeing this with my own eyes, I believe we are. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

Current time 1:41am January 20, 2013 To whom it may concern; In no way, shape or form of what I am about to tell you is a joke or hoax. My fiancé and I live in Crofton, Kentucky.  Like normal people we are skeptics as to what or who is out there watching over us.  Tonight around 1 am my fiancé went to take a pee out the backdoor (I was occupying the only bathroom) and immediately called for my attention.  So when I was finished with my business in the bathroom I went to join him at the back door to see what he was seeing.  At first I didn’t know what I was looking at, but then I saw it move. It seems to be saucer like and triangular in shape with lights that form the triangle.  I saw 5 others just like it in different areas of the sky both out the front and back door of my trailer.  They are moving way too fast to be any airplane or helicopter, and for the most part are remaining in their little sectors of the sky. Some are father away and the others are closer to us.  I can’t tell if they are in the atmosphere or just outside of it, but from the looks of it they are several miles away.  It’s is now 1:52 am I just looked and they are still out there.  I noticed that when they ascend they release a trail of sparks.  One of the 5 that we viewed released what appeared to be some kind of blue wave. Kind of what a shock wave from an explosion looks like only it was blue and didn’t last for very long. 1:56 now...  They are still out there!!  Can somebody please tell us we’re not crazy! I even made a Facebook post about it calling all of my Kentucky friends to acting telling them to look outside.  Whatever is going on out there... it can’t be good. I tried to record them with my iPhone4 but they are too faraway and it is much too dark out there for my camera to pick it up.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,37.0415,-87.47610000000002

The light came from the sky above traveling sort of straight down in path not unlike large bright fireworks coming down out of the sky downward.  The color was mostly bright white and I think I detected just a hint of yellow and maybe some blue - again it looked almost like a bright ball or stream of light heading downward behind the treetops and into the horizon. I awaited a boom or was expecting to feel the impact it was so bright. It was kind of unnerving thinking it was a missle or somthing. But nothing, just silence.  No vibration from impact. So I assumened it must have been very far away. The direction for my viewing point would have been roughly facing South East.  The path of the bright ball or stream of light took about 2 to 3 seconds to travel from sky to horizon and out of site behind the trees as viewed through my bedroom window.  Again it was so bright that I thought is was fireworks landing in the woods 50 yards behind my house.  I got up, startling my wife, and stared out at that part of the sky and woods for 10 minutes or so, but not a trace of any other type of activity accept twinkling stars.   That's it.

We called the neighbors to verify and they too said they saw the lights under it.  I reached for binoculars and could see many lights under the bottom of the craft. I handed my mother the binoculars and asked her to describe what she was...without my input so I could be positive we saw the same thing.  She verified the same description and mentioned it had ""snakes"" in between the lights.  Upon closer look...what she meant was in between the lights there appeared to be electrical sparks one light to the next...  We both watched the lights pulsate getting brighter and dimmer.  At times...it would turn sideways but you could still see the brightness of the lights but clearly it had changed positions.  It remained stationary for about an hour to 1 1/2 hours before moving to the northwest.  Finally, needing to retire to bed...I watched until about midnight.

I was with my boyfriend on our way to pick up my dog at the veterinary hospital I work at.  The location is Harkey Rd. and Broadway St.  We were in the turning lane on Broadway waiting to turn left onto Harkey Rd. when I looked out of the driver side window and saw two balls of red orange and yellow lights in the night sky.  It was very dark outside.  The sky was black with no clouds.  The lights were flickering but you could always see one of the colors.  I am an avid sky watcher I live less than 20 miles from a very busy airport and am always looking at the airplanes and for those blinking red and blue lights to be sure.  The lights I saw were nowhere near what I see on a regular basis when I go outside at night.  They caught my eye because there were two of them and they started out with the right one higher than the left however when I reached to get my camera they were already flying at the same height in seconds. The lights were positioned over a neighborhood located on the right side of Harkey Rd. which goes south.  They appeared to be farther out than right above the neighborhood.  I recorded video footage that shows them flashing on and off and hovering next to each other. They stayed in this position for approximately 2 minutes.  We pulled into the parking lot of my work with the front of the vehicle facing east.  The objects were southwest so I had to turn my head to look out the window. I was still recording them at this time but in the video you couldn’t make them out any more so I turned it off.  I could still see them with the naked eye but they were dimming.  They were still in the same position as before.  We pulled further into the parking lot, and in the ten seconds it took to do that while looking away, the lights were now higher in the sky and positioned straight south directly in my view of the passenger window, with the front of our vehicle still facing east. The lights were now further apart with one below the other.  I watched one and my boyfriend watched the other.  I didn’t know we were watching the different lights until about 15 seconds later the light I was watching disappeared and appeared to head straight south.  The one my boyfriend was watching zoomed east in what he described as “hyper-speed”. Update:  On 5/14/12 at approximately 22:45 hours we were driving east on Broadway St. a few miles from the location of my original sighting two days ago.  I noticed an orange light looking out of the passenger window southeast.  In the few seconds it took me to lean forward and look to my right where the orange light had been it was gone.  It was located in the same vicinity of my last sightings.  I also noticed an airplane was flying southwest at the same time I saw the orange light.  They were a considerable distance apart.",2012-05-29T00:00:00,29.5470222513089,-95.30299397905759

My Boyfriend saw it first moving impossibly fast towards them at a high speed downward angle and when he screamed, still focused on it, his Father only caught a split second of it moving incredibly fast upward, as fast as his head and eyes could turn and follow it for that split second.  They both agreed it was no falling star...this light had changed directions from traveling at a downward pitch to instantly changing its di! rection to an upward angle.  I remember them telling me how amazingly bright white and unbelievably fast it was.  They said it spooked them both and they remember it as if it were yesterday.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,,

As I was tracking the plane, a large sphere appeared just to the south west of Cygnus.  It then faded in a ""pulsing"" fashion.  I thought it might have been sunlight reflecting on a satellite, yet the light was at least the same magnitude as Jupiter and five (5) times the diameter.  Light color was white. Just  after that thought, the light pulsed on again, slightly moving to the southeast.  Both times the light pulsed on and off while moving.  Time between pulses was about 3 seconds.

Then I noticed more individual objects coming in from the distance behind them. None appeared to be going any faster than the others, and were traveling at a horizontal level. I called my wife and daughter out to see this unusual sight. I jokingly told them them the aliens were here. They came out and witnessed this with me. Some of these brightly lit objects would slowly fade to solid black, then begin a slight downward flight, in a large arc across the sky.

I thought perhaps this was what we were seeing, but I have seen meteor showers before, and these looked nothing like that.

We were traveling southeast on Houghton Lake Drive (it runs right next to the lake) approx. at 10:05 p.m. and it was pretty dark outside. We were on the road for about 3minutes,then suddenly I saw coming from the west...over the trees from the lake in the night sky 3 brilliantly bright orange lights shaped into a triangle, and one single (same bright color light) following it. It was so close to us... and so bright I could barely make out deep blackened outline on the triangle shaped lights, and I could make out a triangle, and it looked huge. I said to my boyfriend “what is that""!! The lights were moving very slow, slower than any helicopter or plane we both ever seen. ( and we live near a small airport, hear planes all the time)We stopped in the middle of the road for just a few moments to shut the headlights off, then I said let’s just go follow it, because that was not safe to stop a! nd turn our lights off, as it is a busy road at times. We followed and watched it until we got to m-18,( runs north & south) that took us at least a minute to get there, then we pulled over in a family restaurant parking lot, (it is closed that time of night and quiet) on the west side of m-18 to keep watching, this time we shut off our lights and the vehicle and got out. We heard absolutely no sound from these lights, that were still moving so very slow, then as we watched (for about 2 minutes) it go into the clouds, totally out of our view, then to our surprise,  2 more lights came from over the lake, (we were east side of the lake) they were following each other, they also looked very huge and the same kind of lights but they were both single, to both of us it looked like the first one slowed down so the other could catch up, right before they disappeared into the clouds heading same direction as the first, (moving southeast he says,I said just east) After they were gone ! i looked at the clock in the car it said 10:20.

On august Saturday August 11th about 10:01 pm my wife and I were traveling from a local pizza place to our home in Union MI. My wife 45year olf, and myself 51 year old have lived in Union MI with our children for 20+ years. as we traveled west on US 12 my wife said look at those, what are those airplanes. I looked to the west, north west in the sky just above the trees and saw a formation of what appeared to be 4 small aircraft with steady orange reddish lights moving in a sort of diamond formation just a couple of hundred feet I would estimate above he ground. The craft were traveling east-south east across the sky, and crossed US 12 near Trout road. I pulled off onto Baldwin Prairie Rd. and watched as the lead craft seemed to fade away as it passed over.  Then one by one the craft would appear to separate and disappear. We turned around and proceeded north on Baldwin prairie rd to get away from trees and get a better look at the west sky. We went about ½ mile and turned back around south again when she said she saw another one, we went back to Baldwin Prairie Rd. and US 12 and pulled over and I got out and got my cell phone and attempted to record one of the craft that she saw then coming again east-southeast across US 12 about at vera drive, above the John Deere dealer.  Th! e recording is not very good as the cell phone makes it appear as if the craft are very far away when in reality I would say they appeared to be maybe 500 feet away at most. We then proceeded west on US 12 to where we could get a better look at the west-northwest sky and saw another coming above the trees, I recorded it as best as I could. The craft appeared to only have one red-orange or yellow-orange flame like, incandescent appearing light facing forward as when the craft passed nearly directly over us it would fade then gradually you could not see it any more as if the body of the craft was blocking the light facing forward. Although there was really no visible portion of the craft to really tell how large it was just primarily the light. The other peculiar thing we realized is that they seemed to be totally silent. Although at 200 to 500 feet above us an ultra light would be quiet, when there were periods of no vehicle traffic we should have been able to hear some sort of engine noise. They were to the best of my ability silent, and probably moving about 25 to maybe 35 mph. I gave the camera to my wife who had turned off my vehicle, and got a spot light out of my vehicle. The light is a streamlight lightbox, LED spot light, used by firefighters, relatively bright. As another light began to move into view. She did her best to video this last craft and as it passed over us I decided to try and hit it with the light to see if I could get a glimpse of any portion of the craft itself. This was unsuccessful as the beam just seemed to fall short of anything related to the craft. I did blink the light several times to see if there would be any change in behavior and there was none. The only difference is after the light from the craft disappeared as all the others did it seemed like you could get a very faint reflection of light from the spot light. I don't know it may have just been the desire to see something straining against the dark as the craft disappeared, and trying to make some sense of the situation. We figure we saw 12 in all flying basically all the same direction east-southeast. I checked the weather as soon as we arrived home 10:16 pm and found the temp 63 deg. F., Humidity 83%, visibility 10miles. Wind WNW at 8mph. I have put the approximate path on the linked below Google Map. Links to the videos are here, the quality is from a cellphone so I hope you don't expect to much.  http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF&msa=0&msid=217523935539399827446.0004c7090a1cbc0cfaaa5  http://youtu.be/QPZXOURAiYA  http://youtu.be/9nGB8ExGIo0  http://youtu.be/eFOqLTjCZnM  http://youtu.be/ZbiLVOMpHHM  After trying to figure out what it might be we concluded it could possibly be some sort of remote drone type of craft?  They did not appear to be hot air balloons as there was no sign of the balloon from what might have appeared to be the flame producing the light, and as I stated as they moved overhead and began to then move away instead of towards they would disappear as the light appeared to only be in the front facing. They looked a little like a tear drop shape lithe or a cone shape toward the craft as the passed directly overhead.  With all the talk of military surveillance testing and drones, etc... makes me wonder. I called and reported it immediately to our dispatch center and asked that they call me tomorrow and let me know if anyone else reported seeing the craft.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,41.7849,-85.8568

My initial thought was that they were streetlights going up a tall mountain, but even though it was dark, we could see sky behind them and remembered that there are no mountains that tall around Conway.  The lights were staggered and did not form a pattern as far as we could tell.  My sister thought maybe they were several  radio towers, but the highest ones were way too high to be radio towers and the lights (whitish-yellow)did not blink.  The distance that the lights were staggered was large in both height and width,giving the appearance that they spread out over at least a mile.  As we approached the lights, I wondered if they were Chinese lanterns, but they appeared to be stationary and did not appear to flicker.  I recall the lights being squarish, or at least similar in size (it's hard! to remember exactly)  There could be a logical explanation for these lights, but I cannot find anything on the web.  We do not live in Arkansas, so we don't know who to ask.  When we drove back by Conway (in the daylight) on our way home on May 1, we did not see anything in the sky that could account for the lights.

Summer 1967, Decatur Alabama  Before I report the sighting,  I need to explain why I know what I didn’t see. I didn't see an airplane or a comet. 1966, 1967, 1968:  My buddy and I lived within walking distance of the river. Several times a week we would walk down to the river and sit on the dock and watch the skies and discuss girls, our band, and our future.  Sometimes we would fish but usually we would lay on the pier and watch the skies as we talked.  We began noticing the movement in the skies and starting jokingly calling them UFOs.  After a few months, it was very easy to distinguish between single engine airplanes, commercial jets, high flying military jets, satellites, and of course the very fast moving meteors.  We even began to start noticing the stars and their familiar patterns in the sky. We began noticing lights in the sky that were almost definitely not planes or satellites or meteors and we started calling them UFOs (half joking and half serious).  We would see an average of 2 or 3 UFOs on any given night.  We then started watching the skies for about 3 or 4 hours a night just to look for UFOs. We didn’t know what these things were, but they were not planes…and since they were very high up in the air, we never saw the shape of these object.  They were the size of the largest stars moving around in erratic patterns…but very, very fast.  Faster than our military jets and faster than our satellites.  Satellites move in a straight line and jets move basically in a straight line with some deviation in their course.  But jets and satellites do not stop and hover or circle at 60,000 feet. Sighting: My buddy and I had met a couple of girls and we were at their grandmothers house out in the country one night in the front yard. I was sitting on the front porch with my date and my buddy was sitting in the swing in the front yard with his date (4 of us total). The last thing on our minds that night was UFOs. My buddy yelled my name loudly and called for me to come and look at something. I wasn’t interested in him at the time and almost ignored him, but he wouldn’t shut up about it. So all four of us met in the front yard and looked up in the sky to the west. There was a fairly large light moving from west to east toward our position. This particular light did not move like any of the other UFOs that we had seen before. This light was a little bit larger than any of the other lights before and it was larger than any star in the sky that night. As it moved, it reminded me of pulling a fishing lure through water. It seemed to sort of vibrate through the air as it tra! veled in a straight line to almost overhead. We had been watching now for almost 30-45 seconds as this thing moved from the horizon to overhead at what we figured was about 20,000 to 50,000 feet. It moved extremely fast. Faster than a military jet or satellite but not as fast as a meteor. Then it stopped almost overhead. If we had walked down the road about a half mile, it would have been directly overhead…straight up. It hovered for about 3 to 5 seconds and then it began to circle overhead. It was not a perfect circle and it was not a complete circle. (Imagine a 3 year old trying to draw a circle on a paper with a crayon.) That best describes the path that it slowly flew above us. It seemed to be looking for something. The diameter of the “circle” was less than a quarter mile. Circling took about 10 to 15 seconds. Then it stopped again for about 3 seconds and started getting bigger and bigger. It was now about 5 times the size of the brightest star I have ever seen in the ! sky…almost the size of a street light. This thing was landing ! and it w as going to land in the field across the street about 200 or 300 yards away from us. All four of us began to run down toward that field to watch it land. All of sudden, something bit me and kept biting me. Something was in my way and I couldn’t move forward. I didn’t want to look down to see what was biting me because the UFO had just captured my total awareness. However, when I did look down to see what was “biting” my leg, I saw that I had run into an electric fence. So I was not going to get to catch up to everyone else and I decided to just watch the UFO from this vantage point. I watched this thing as it was coming down toward earth and it seemed to “panic” and stop descending at almost the exact time that I ran into the electric fence. The UFO was now low enough that we could have seen what it was if it was daylight…but it was still just a very, bright light in the sky. It stopped and hovered for about 5 seconds like it didn’t know what to do and then it went straight ! up and out of sight in less than 2 seconds. Totally silent. I have never seen anything move that fast before or since. I thought “we don’t have anything that can do that!” There was no sound of rockets or jet engines or any kind of smoke trail. My father worked on the Saturn 5 rocket booster and I was familiar with rockets and jet engines. This vehicle was strictly antigravity powered. Romance had now changed to UFO talk and we spent the rest of the evening looking for more UFOs. After that event, the girls never ridiculed our UFO stories. This event was within a year of the Falkville policeman who reported chasing an alien through the woods. Sadly, he was laughed out of the force. Falkville is 25 miles from Decatur. I figured that the NASA military base in Huntsville was the interest of all the UFOs we saw. After graduation in 1969, I never got to spend time just watching the skies and I haven’t got to see anymore UFOs.",,34.57360702702702,-86.94210270270271

My older brother and I went to the playground along with the children of my parent’s friends.  We had only been there a short while when we witnessed a silver saucer shaped craft either fall or land in the ocean.  I don’t recall details of the actual descent; but it didn’t make much of a splash.  It just bobbed in the water.  No one emerged from the craft.   ""I think we’d better go in now,"" my brother said.   We went inside and did not mention what we’d seen to our parents until years later.   At the time of the sighting I was not afraid, though my brother seemed apprehensive.

It came down pretty fast.  Then it stopped.There were strobe lights on and off as it floated to the left very gently.

Huge rectangular object emmitting intense white light across roadway with extremely loud roar.,Mescalero Indian Reservation,NM,1974-05-22T05:30:00,rectangle,Two Hours,"Occurred : 5/22/1974 05:30  (Entered as : 05/22/74 05:30) Reported: 3/25/2012 11:03:34 PM 23:03 Posted: 4/18/2012 Location: Mescalero Indian Reservation, NM Shape: Rectangle Duration:Two Hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88040.html,"Huge rectangular object emmitting intense white light across roadway with extremely loud roar. Dear Sirs.  I was browsing youTUBE videos on various topics when I came across one on the Coast to Coast broadcast with George Knapp as host.  He was interviewing Peter Davenport.  And when Mr. Davenport gave the url for his website I wrote it down, and sure enough it was accurate.  I meanwhile listened to the whole broadcast that was from March 2012 {about a week ago.}  But towards the end of the show Mr. Davenport urged listeners who believe they had seen a ufo to ""write down their sighting"" and then go to his website and list the report there.  So that is what ""I"" am doing now, as I feel that all reports are important of this nature and perhaps in time will aid researchers into figuring out who this phenomenon is all about.  With that said here is the description of my first sighting below...  It was late May of 1974 early on a Monday morning, approximately 5:30 A.M. ""ish""...I was in the USAF stationed at Holloman AFB near Alamogordo, NM.  I was coming from a mountain community called Ruidoso, NM and heading down the mountains through the Mescalero Indian Reservation, heading West on Highway 70 ,heading back to Holloman.  I had spent the weekend in Ruidoso and attended the Horse Races, and did some shopping in the village.  It had rained the night before and the narrow mountain Highway could be a bit treacherous back then due to the narrow winding roads, and numerous deer and elk that roamed freely across the Reservation.  So I opted to spend the night at a local motel and head back early the next morning to get back to base in time for work {approximately 7:30AM.}  I had just come down the winding road from what is commonly called ""The Summit"" {being the highest point} between Ruidoso in the mountains and Alamogordo down on the basin floor.  There was a straight part of the highway that ran for about 2.5 miles.  At that time there was virtually no one who lived near that stretch of highway.  It was also ""foggy"" from time to time as I came down the mountains.  {Fog in this area is usually clouds that have lowered down into the upper crevices of the mountains.  The other type of fog normally seen in this area is caused from a ""hot pavement"" after a rain, when the humidity is high...it will rise from the pavement like a thick ""steam"".}  As I rounded the last curve to the right coming down from the summit, I gasped as up ahead was the ""brightest light"" I had ever seen...it was not like a car light or street light, which were usually more ""yellowish""...this one was ""white as snow"", and was not shining ""at me"" but oddly enough was shining from ""right to left"" across the highway {which was East to West.}  I slowed down from about 50mph to about 25, as I came closer to where that light was emminating.  It appeared that is was coming from ""up a canyon beyond where the edge of a taller mountain met near the roadway"" just ahead of me.  At this point in time I experienced ""no fear"" just ""total curiosity"" as to what could be causing this odd light?  I continued to slow down as I had driven this stretch of road many times ""to and from"" the mountain town of Ruidoso on many weekends, although most of those trips were to and from in the daytime, but a few were occasionally at night...but I had ""never"" encountered a light of this nature before, either there or any where.  {I must make a note here that I have often seen a ""rain shower"" on the long stretches of highway in the southern New Mexico desert areas, where you can actually just drive right into the rain as if it was a ""curtain of moisture"" hanging from the clouds in front of me.  A very weird sensation to experience.  Very simila! r to driving through an ""automated car wash"" nowadays.}  With that said...this extreme, white light was stretching across the roadway ahead of me in the same fashion.  Whereas, most ""light"" tends to ""fade in and out"" of intensity from it's ""source""...this light appeared to almost have an ""edge"" to it.  I figured the only way to find out where it was coming from was to drive into it and look up the canyon to the North.  {I also need to say at this point that when I drove at a distance I tended to play the car stereo often.  And sometimes I played it loudly and would sing along if I knew the song.  I had been doing this on my trip back to the base.}  But it suddenly dawned on me about the time I neared the light that I could no longer hear the radio or even the car engine as there was a very ""loud roar"" coming from outside my vehicle.  {But at the time I had not yet associated the roar and the light as having any connection to each other.}  But then I entered the light.  It was just the ""oddest"" effect as I drove into the light...just like laying on a beach as the tide rolled in to cover your legs...this emmense white light was consuming my vehicle as I passed through the edge of it.   And once I was apparantly consumed into it I slowed down to almost a stop and veered off the roadway to the shallow ditch, so as to not be hit by any other traffic which might be coming up behind me, although at that point I realized that there was virtually ""no one"" on that whole stretch of road that morning, except me.  Once I came to a stop.  I put my car in park.  I fumbled through my glove compartment for a pair of dark sunglasses.  I found them and put them on, and even with them on the light was so intense I had to hold my hands in front of my face.  Realizing this was not working I opened the car door stood out and turned and still holding my hands in front of my face, gazing as best I could through the dark sunglasses, I stepped up on the rim of the b! ottom of the opened door to raise myself up a bit for a better vantage point.  I frankly have no real recollection of ""time passage"" at this point.  I assume I stood there trying to see something amid that loud roar that seemed to be coming more-or-less from the same direction as the light source {to the North.}  I spent what I thought was the next ""few minutes"" going between holding my hands in front of my face to guard against the bright light, and cupping my hands over my ears due to the instense roar!  And there must have been some passage of time as the faintness of the sky, or clouds above the light appeared to be brightening also.  All of a sudden I realized that the ""white light"" was ""artificial""...meaning it was other than ""natural daylight or sunlight"".  That it was emmiting from either a man-made source, or an alternate source of power.  And as the ""natural daylight"" increased, the white artificial light ""decreased""...to the point I could see that the white light was emmiting from ""four"" {4} round holes approximately twenty-feet {20} in diameter, and in a row from left to right against something that appeared to be solid and black.  {In my mind I equated these lights to the ""Hollywood Search"" lights that can easily be seen criss-crossing at a Hollywood Movie Premier.}  It was like a giant rectangular black box just sitting up in this field or valley against the mountainside.  And about the time this registered in my mind I saw the ""movement"".  {Imagine for a moment you are at a stoplight on red, at night on a city street just after a rain, as the pavement glistens in the street and headlights...and as people scurry across the street in front of you...you can see the ""scissor-like movement"" of their legs, like waving your finger back and forth in front of a tv screen.}  This is the type of movement I noticed at the bottom of those big, white lights.  At this point my mind thought...""They must be trying to make repairs on something""?  And with that thought my next was ""repairs on what""?  and ""Why"" in the middle of a ""field in the mountains""? And oddly enough after that my next remembered thought was...""this might be a UFO""?  And with that thought a big ""gasp"" of instantaneous FEAR came over me.  ""Oh my God I need to get out of here"".    I quickly got back into the car, shut the door and locked it.  {I remembered stories of people having a close encounter and their car engine stopped, and their watch stopped ticking, etc.  The roar of that sound was so loud still that I couldn't tell if my car engine was still on or not?  And the light was so bright that I couldn't see the face of my wristwatch.}  I felt like my only option was to step on the brake and put the car in gear and ""hit the gas"" and hope for the best.  And that's what I did and to my surprise I moved.  So I came up out of the ditch onto the pavement and drove like a ""bat out of Hell"" till I ran out of that white light just the same as I drove into i! t.  And once out of it...when the ""loud roar"" was behind me, I slowed down and stopped the car on the side of the road.  I got out and felt myself all over...as if to make sure that ""I was still in one piece""?  And there behind me at a bit of a distance was the faint roar, and that still emmense white light across the road.  I just shook my head and and said to myself as I got back into my car an drove on...""Man, no one is ever going to believe this"".  I got back to the base in time to put on my 1505's and go to work on time.   {It was also a bit ""odd"" to me in thinking about this later that the ""whole event"" from first seeing the white light across the road in front of me, to driving into it, and parking near the ditch, and gazing at the light and seeing the movement near the ground below the beams...that quite a bit of time seemed to have passed.  Yet it was about 5:30AM or so when I left Ruidoso and it was normally about a ""one hour"" {60 minute} trek either way, but I got back to the base with plenty of time to change into my uniform of the day, and get to work, open up and make coffee for everyone else.  It was as if ""time had stood still"" during that whole event?}  But no one other than a couple of very close friends ""ever"" heard this story until I had been discharged from the USAF in 1976.  {I have another amazing event that happened to me while stationed at HAFB, NM that didn't have a resolution until almost twenty {20} years later.}. Some people might live their whole life and never have a ufo sighting, or close encounter.  And then there are those of us who feel like we have had ""more"" than our fair share.  But I will share the other encounters at another time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2012-04-18T00:00:00,,

Had my military career and life threatened by an officer while in the USAF,Holloman AFB,NM,1974-08-21T11:00:00,other,1 hour,"Occurred : 8/21/1974 11:00  (Entered as : 08/21/74 11:00) Reported: 3/26/2012 12:50:07 AM 00:50 Posted: 4/18/2012 Location: Holloman AFB, NM Shape: Other Duration:1 hour",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88041.html,"Had my military career and life threatened by an officer while in the USAF As a teen growing up in North-Central Texas back in the late 60's I had once bought a paperback book on the subect of UFO's.  And years later in the late summer of 1974 while I was stationed at an Air Force Base here in southern New Mexico,  a case in that book caused me to have a very strange encounter. I was an ""Administration Clerk"" {called a 702 in Air Force terms.}   Once while my Boss and I were in the West area of the base doing some inventory of computer parts in a hangar, I noticed across the road was another hangar with a very tall chain-link fence, barbed wire at the top, and a lot of junked crates piled near the top on the inside, so barely the roof of the hanger was in sight.  The sliding hangar door where we had gone to inventory computers was only secured by a chain and padlock.  So I thought to myself that the other hangar must have some real important items inside to have such protection around it.  But when I asked my Boss about that, it was to my shock and surprise when he said ""they only store junk in there"".  This made me curious and suspicious.  I called my Mother and asked her to send me that old book I had as a teen, that was in the bookcase in my old bedroom at home back in Texas.  She found it and mailed it to me.  Upon studying it again I re-read the case about an ""object that came down and hovered over a runway at the base I was! stationed""...I think back about 1963, and in the event that pursued our people managed to get it to the ground, and dragged it off to a hangar in the West area and nothing more was ever seen or heard about it.  It was my estimation that if this event was correct as described in the book, that maybe I had ""found"" that hangar.   I did some checking around the base trying to find a way to gain access to that hangar to have a look around.  {At the time my rank was an Airman First Class.}  One day I was sitting at my typewriter working on a document in my office near the flightline.  My Boss was out to lunch, and the Colonel who was in charge of my office was gone to a meeting.  I was virtually alone in that part of the hangar.  The door and windows had dark curtains over the windows to keep glare out of the office both early in the morning and later in the afternoon.   So other than a desk lamp, the office was rather dark at times.  All of a sudden I noticed that the door to the office {which opened outward into the main part of the hangar} had been opened but I wasn't aware that anyone had entered.  My first impression was that it was my Boss coming back from lunch.  But after a minute or so it seemed odd to me that no one had come in, so I paused from my work to glance that direction to see who it was.  I did a bit of a ""double-take"" when I noticed it was an officer in ""full-dress blues"".  I stood up and walked around my desk to face him at which time he ab! ruptly ORDERED ME to ""Attention"" {with a salute.}  {Now this was very odd because ""no one"" did things like this in Permanent Party situations on base, unless it was a special event outdoors, but not inside an office.}  But in my shock and amazement I went to ""Attention"" with a salute as this man out-ranked me and it startled me so.  As I stood there at Attention I stared at him in the doorway, as he appeared to be sort of ""siloutted"" with the daylight behind him.  All that I could make out at the time was that he was either a ""Major or a Colonel"", and he had a ""three word name"" on his Name tag but in the dim light I could only make out two of the names.  Standing there at Attention for what seemed like forever...the man finally spoke and told me the following {paraphasing}:  ""Soldier...If you value your Air Force career and your life in general, then I hereby ORDER YOU to Cease and Desist from the search you are doing, as it's bigger than both of us, and could lead to a Court Martial and your ultimate demise""...""Soldier, do I make myself clear""?  To which I said ""Sir, Yes, Sir""!  And with that he ""concluded the salute"", and shut the door.  I remember standing there ""shaking"" for several minutes until I realized he was gone, and then carefully opened the door and stuck my head out and looked around?   I saw no one.  I ventured out and walked around down to a couple of other offices nearby and asked the personnel in there if they had seen anyone in ""Dress Blues"", but they had not.  I finally made my way over to the other side of hangar where the front parking lot was, and once outside saw ""no strange vehicles"" in the parking lot.  I just shook my head and went back to my office.  I sat down and took a deep breath, and realized that I was going to have to ""give up my search for that UFO""!, as now I knew beyond a doubt that it was ""real"" but I did not have the rank to challenge it.  After a few mintues I calmed down and came to terms with what had happened...and proceeded to continue my work.  About a half hour later the office door again ""opened"" all of a sudden and like a chain reaction I ""jumped up to Attention"" and in-so-doing my knees bounced the typewriter off the table onto the floor, and the carriage fell off.  This time it was my Boss {a Staff Sergeant} returning from lunch, and the look on his face would have ""stopped a clock"" as he stared at me and said ""What on earth is wrong with you""?  And then I just slumped into my chair with an almost feeling of collapse! As he bent over to pick up the pieces of the typewriter, I said ""Oh my"" and got down and helped him.  Then he sat me down in my chair and bugged me until I was willing to tell him about the ""whole event"".  Once I was finished he got ""very upset"" and said ""he didn't care who it was, that the guy had NO RIGHT to order his people around"", etc...He told me to lock the door behind him and not to open it for anyone until he got back, as he was going to hunt fo this guy.  I did as he instructed me but feared the Colonel would come back and get upset with me...but he didn't.  When my Boss returned I let him in the office and he said he looked all over and asked a lot of people but couldn't find anyone by the ""two names"" that I saw on this officer! 's name tag, that was either stationed on base, or visiting that day.  So from that point on that event remained an ""unsolved mystery"" to me.  Then...Some twenty-odd years later {about 1992} I was at my home and was going from my home-office to the bathroom when I passed through my bedroom where I forgotten to turn off the television earlier that morning.  A  Television Talk Show was coming on.  {it was 10am.} I heard the ""well-known"" TV Talk Show Host announce that the topic of discussion was the ""UFO'S"".  And I stopped and turned around...went over to the television, and grabbed a blank VCR tape and put it in the VCR, and pressed ""play/record"".  Then I sat on the end of my bed to see who was on the panel.  There were several fairly well-known entertainers, and other's whom I had seen on TV before discussing this subject...but when it came to the last man on the panel, there sat a man with short, graying hair, glasses, a little on the chubby side wearing a brightly colored tropical sport shirt, and when he spoke his name...I FEEL OFF THE END OF THE BED ONTO THE FLOOR.  IT WAS THE SAME MAN WHO ""THREATENED ME"" way back in 1974 when I was in the USAF.  Once I gathered myself, ran to the bathroom, and came back and sat back down on the bed, I watched the whole show as I recorded it.  In ""summary""...that man's purpose on being on the show was to tell people there is NO SUCH THING AS UFO's and NO GOVERNMENT COVER-UP.  {But from then on I knew his ""real name"".  I had only seen his first and middle name, but not his last.  And if I mentioned it here most ""EVERYONE"" who reads this would know it.  He's a retired USAF Major.}  This basically ""ends"" that event but in closing I wanted to say that since this event there were two well-known UFO Researcher's who came to my city and were on a Radio Program I listened to.  And afterwards I called the motel where they were staying and spoke to one of them at length.  I told him about this event and a few of my others and he told me he felt I was a credible witness, and very knowledgeable on this subject of UFO Phenomena and gave me a WATTS LINE for further reporting.

My First what I would call unusual sighting was in 1974 at Lake O The Pines,Texa .  It was a Nice calm clear late evening night.  Somewhere about 10 PM I was sitting with my 1 year old daughter on the Porch of our motel at the fishing lodge there.  The motel was surrounded by pine trees some 70 feet in height and the road leading to the boat ramp was was right next to my cabin. A very large object totally lit up as if one bright light I could see no form of the object, this object was likely 300 ft or so above the trees, it appeared to be fairly low.  It was round and probably 200 feet in diameter or more depending on its actual height.  I base this on the fact that it was much wider than the road leading to the boat ramp and that road was at least 40 feet wide adding in the total right of way opened for it.  The object went well over the tree lines that bordered this road. The object made no noise whatsoever, it did not illuminate the ground either which I thought to be odd as any actual light that is near usually has an illuminating effect.  It was quite low as I previously mentioned and traveling what I thought to be about 20 miles per hour.  This allowed me to watch it for quite some time.  I never knew what it was but it was puzzling to say the least. My second most notable was also in the 1970 era.  It was dark and I had arrived at a local eatery where I was to meet my brother and brother - in - law. I got out of my car and as I walked toward them, standing outside, I gazed up into the sky and thought I was seeing a falling star. Well it was really to slow and did not burn out quickly as most do.  Now this light was very high it seemed and appears to be maybe the size of a close star would be , you know maybe just smaller than a kitchen match head .  I continued wathing it move and then suddenly it appeared to stop. What was really odd when it stopped there were four more lights (orbs) identical to it.  The four objects appeared to be in the formation of a square, a box shape equal in dimension. They only set still for maybe 15 seconds and then all four objects or lights moved at the same time with no alteration in the formation.  It was as if this moving light had docked with whatever the others were or docked to or joined in formation, but it did seem they operated as one unit. I have seen a few other things but these were the most memorable and the only ones I really had time to actually watch for a period of time.

I believe it was disk shaped but it was a dark (non-starry) sky, so it was hard to see.  At first I thought it was Venus, but then realized it was too early for Venus.  My bedroom window faces west.  I turned off the bedroom lights and watched it some more, thinking it was an aircraft, but it didn't move closer or further away.   So next, I assumed it was a helicopter, since it was over the general area of the 599 road/Old Agua Fria Village, but it remained fairly high, 1/4 mile up (estimate).   As I watched it, it seemed to be shooting out lights, to the side, downward at angles, and to the sides at slight angles.  Periodically it glowed across the top (giving a disk-shaped appearance).  The lights were white and also bright-colored, and shot like rays, rapidly, and not far out from the craft.  I watched it for about 45 minutes.  I thought of taking pictures, but then figured no one would believe me, plus my cell phone probably couldn't capture the image in the! dark sky anyway.   I am partially handicapped too, otherwise I would have gone outside to try and photograph it.  But I live alone, and that would have been dangerous for me.  My dog was here, and she remained asleep on the couch the whole time.  Finally I just thought, ""Well, if I'm seeing it, someone else probably is too,"" so I threw the covers over my head and went to sleep.  I woke up later (3:30 a.m.) and it was gone.   I got up, went to the bathroom and kitchen, where I could see the moon low on the horizon, in the south-east sky.

My son took one of the dog’s around the block and I took the older dog the other direction down the street.  We always meet up at the end of the street. So as I was walking down the driveway I noticed above my neighbors’ house across the street 4 roundish lights going around in a large circle.  The circle was about the size of the house.  They were not real bright, almost resembled a foggy, cloudy light, but they were very noticeable.  At first I thought someone had some strobe light, which I dismissed, because it was not how a strobe light would look. I will explain that in a minute.  So I’m standing out in front of my house and a neighbor walks by with her dog.  I asked her if she saw the same thing I was seeing and she said “yes.”  I then asked her what she thought the lights were from and she thought perhaps one of those big lights from a store.  Then as we both looked at the lights weaving in and out as though they were chasing each other, we decided that couldn’t be, since that would be obvious if it were one of those big lights.  Let me make this clear.  I’m 51, I’ve seen the store lights in the sky, I’ve seen strobe ! lights too.  These circling lights were something I have never seen. They would go higher in the sky and then get lower.  At one point they were high enough to cross the path of a small plane going by.  It’s hard to estimate the distance of objects in the sky, so they may have been some distance from the airplane. Here’s the weirdest part.  As I continued to walk my dog the lights followed me.  When I reached the last house, there were only 2 orb type circles.  Still they were going around like they were chasing each other.  My son, was walking from the field, and the first thing he said was “Aliens.”  And I’m like, “ are you seeing them too?”  He tells me that he would not have noticed, but our dog stopped and looked at the lights, which made him freak, because she always runs the whole walk. My son, took off towards our house, leaving me with the lights and my slow dog.  I crossed the street and headed back home, aan of course the lights followed me.  I stopped several times just to study them.  When I reached my house, they were right above.  I took my dog into the house and grabbed my phone to videotape them.  As I taped them they were now high above in the middle of the street, and kept getting higher.  I’m not sure if I was able to capture them on my camera, but I haven’t checked. They finally disappeared   I have decided, without a doubt, they were either Spirits in the form of Orbs, or UFO’s of some sort.   I’m always going to believe something is manmade way before I conclude it is from a different source. But with this sighting, I see no other option, but to believe what I witnessed was from a supernatural origin, and they were studying me.  I also feel something big is about to take place.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,39.9583,-85.9988

My Boyfriend was in a truck ahead of me.  Initially, I didn't pay attention to the lights because I must of thought it was a street lamp (there are no street lamps in the area, but i grew up in cities) or maybe I assumed it was an airplane, I just didn't think to look at it - it was dark so I concentrated on the rd.   After a minute maybe, I saw there were two lights, I'm sure there had been all along, but I was now looking at it, trying to rationalize what it was -  At first I thought it was an airplane changing direction, then it looked like an airplane flying towards us.  I did not see an aircraft or other body, just the lights. As I was trying to figure out the direction (because if it was an airplane it would have to be a jet based on the distance between the lights) the left side dimmed, and one light was left. Then it came back after 2 or 3 seconds and the! right side dimmed. I can't remember if both came back on or what, but basically the lights disappeared off to the right (west north west)I assumed they went behind a cloud and I thought it was strange because they didn't reappear. I had slowed down from 55 mph to probably 30 mph or so, there was a car behind me so I didn't want to make them too angry. I just thought it was kind of a weird thing, but didn't think too much of it. I wondered if my boyfriend saw it in the car ahead of me, but thought probably not because he is one of the least observant people i know. Also his truck is in really rough shape and his headlights don't work well, so I assumed he would be watching the rd.  When we pulled up to the driveway where we currently live about 10 minutes later, A good song was on the radio, so I turned it up, jumped out of the car and started dancing in the driveway...just to tease him a little.  He was exhausted. I forgot about the lights.  But as soon as he walked up to me, he said ""did you see the UFO?"" and I was like YES!!!!   So the actual event really only lasted a minute or two, with me paying attention to it for less than a minute before it disappeared.  We both saw the same thing in two separate vehicles.  Initally he said he thought it was the radio tower nearby. I never thought that because of the color and the position. The lights were the color of dim headlights, or low burning embers from a fire. they were larger (and higher in the air) than any headlights would be from a car.  I have been searching for similar sightings since last night online. I have seen on your site alot of ""fireball"" type incidences - I dont know that it looked like something on fire, but it was definitely that kind of color/hue. the lights were a few inches apart (4 maybe?) in my line of vision but i don't have any good indication of distance or how far the object was away from us. my boyfriend said he was surprised the lights didn't show through the clouds or reappear like airplanes do, because the clouds were really more wispy and transparent than solid clouds.   So neither of us really know what we saw.  Apparently after doing a web search though when we got home there had been a UFO siting during the day a few counties away in Northern KY (pike county) there was an image taken, but we have no idea if it wa! s the same thing or not.  Their siting was during the day and we saw no craft or whatever, just the lights.  Also had the radio on, so no idea about noise.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,39.286,-82.4756

The whole sighting lasted no more than twenty seconds from the time I first saw the jets until the object winked out.  It is unusual to see any aircraft flying north to south at the altitude I observed, because of the proximity to Fresno Air Terminal, and the traffic patterns.

We were the only sedan on the freeway, but there were plenty of trucks on lane #2. I am sure that many of the truckers have also seen it,   The three lights were extremely bright, unlike LED or halogen or any light source that I am familiar with, and would hover to the front of us at probably 2-300mph, then immediately turn 180 degree, shine the three lights directly at us, and traveling in reverse at 80-90mph.  It would than just glide over to the east of us, and while hovering next to us, it was completely silent, unlike a regular plane or jet, which would have made a loud jet engine noise.  The three lights later turned into nine smaller lights with red/orange/blue/greenish color, all moving in uniform, as if it splits into three UFO. It would then immediately merge back into 3 large bright lights, hovering mainly on the east side of hwy 5.  The UFO flew next to us for almost five miles until we reached W Ness Ave (exit 385) before it flew south and disappeared into the darkness.   Wish we had a video camera.  After seeing other similar youtube videos, I am glad we were not seeing things.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,36.9036,-121.0215

A minute later he says what is that? I say where? he says in front of the car, and about twenty feet in front of the car were two lights shaped like two cylinders about three inches long with a glow around them and one on top of the other with about two inches between them.

I was on patrol last night at my job in downtown Seattle, and just doing a routine rove around my building when strangely enough something caught my eye in the sky. As i looked up into the night shy for about 5 to ten minutes a bright flash appeared dead center in the sky witch kinda freaked me out, I have always believed in UFO's I have just never witness it in person until last night.  So i remained glued to the clear night sky and as soon as my eye's started to focus in on the stars there it was (first one) a faint redish yellow object appeared it had to be 80 or 90 thousand feet in the air way higher than any airplane I've seen before but it was traveling pretty fast no sound was heard and slowly vanished. At this point i was kinda freaked out but excited that i saw this. 5 minutes later as i continued to look around in the sky another (second one) this one was kinda scary as it was very close could of been approx 4 - 500 feet from where i was standing it was really bight, the color of light was a hyper white blue amber color and was descending to the street level really quick. Again there was no sound coming from it and out of nowhere it suddenly vanished behind the building that was about 2 blocks from our building.  At this point I hope someone else witnessed that too as i couldn't of been the only one that saw this. Almost instantly after witnessing that I was about to head back inside my building and saw what i still cant figure out what to actually call it (third one?.) Three green blips of light occurred right above that where I saw the bright light descend down behind the building. Kind of like a connect the dots type of motion is the best way to describe the event - Fist one flashed top, bottom left, then bottom right. Like i said before I have never witnessed anything this strange ever while working here in my 10 years, last night was definitely an eye opener. I will have my camera with me from this point forth.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

We then turned right trying to find a detour. I had just mentioned how good of time we were making bc i looked at the clock it was 8:00. We came upon a very dark wooded area in the road. My mom said wow that is really dark. That is the last thing either of us remember. Then next thing we knew we looked at the clock, it was 8:30. It literally felt like seconds before it was 8:00! My 21 month old daughter had been fussy right before the woods, but was now very quiet. The dogs had been panting but were now still and quiet. Everything was earily quiet! We felt very disoriented and realized we were miles from where we originally were and in the totally wrong direction. Based on my memory and my good sense of direction, and my mothers knowledge of the area it made no sense to be where we were.  I then noticed a burning bump in the! back of my head behind my right ear. My mother felt very numb and extremely disoriented. We both felt as though we had a sunburn, a hot, tight feeling on our faces. She then noticed a bump in her head in the SAME spot. They looked like fresh needle marks. We drove to my mothers house in Seaford in shock and disbelief of what just happened. Since being home we have experienced headaches, neck aches, and feeling shakey. However, the swelling behind the ear has gone down on both of us. I was unable to find a mark on my daughter. We are upstanding citizens and this is NOT a hoax!

At about a third of the way I look up ( meaning above the horizon line ) straight ahead of me and I noticed between a street lamp post and wires crossing the street a circular bright light ( very bright, like a powerfull del light ) the object remained motionless for less than half a second and then moved left at a speed that no aircraft nor anything else could reach and vanished completely not to be seen again, there was no sound emitted and i could make out any shape other than the round light.

I thought it was odd, this time of year, but never assumed it to be anything other than stars, that were low in the sky and very bright.  That was until I read in the newspaper on Nov 16th, that people who were closer to them, saw what they think were strange lights.

We came to a stop sign at approximately 9:15 pm, when a very bright white object caught my attention in the sky.  There had been storms in the area, and a dark cloud behind the object made it stand out. I quickly asked my son if he saw this object, which he acknowledged he did. There were no other vehicles on the road, so we stayed stopped at the intersection and observed the object for a moment. I had never seen anything like this before in person, and reached for my iphone to begin filming. When I fixed the screen into the sky, we noticed a second object appear to the left. It was also white in color. Not a moment later, a much brighter and somewhat larger red object appeared to the right. All of the objects can best be described as fireballs. My son quickly pointed out that they were in a triangular formation. They stayed in that formation for a very short period of time, while they began to slowly change color from red, orange, and white. The object on the lower left of the triangle began to disappear, almost as if it was a burning out fire. At this point we pulled over to the side of the road, and got out of our vehicle to continue viewing the objects. The two remaining objects continued to change color, and their brightness would vary. At times, they were very brilliant. They slowly moved closer, while also changing elevations. Once they were at what appeared to be the same elevation, the object to left seemed to disappear in similar fashion to the first. I wanted to view the object without looking through the iphone screen, so turned the video off at this point. A few seconds later, the final object also simply disappeared. We drove up the road in the direction of the objects, trying to see if we could locate them again. We did not have any luck, they had just vanished. In general, these fireballs were much brighter than any star, satellite, or space station. They were also roughly 5 times greater in size than a star. No sound was audible at any point.

The red light went out on the first object revealing a circular disk in perspective as if it was 90 degrees to the ground aloft.
