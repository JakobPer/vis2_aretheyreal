Now our position was right in between 151st and 147st on gougar road.  During this time our vehicle was facing south and we were observing the object to the west of us.  To the west of us is the I-355 extension and the object was across the highway about a quarter mile.  When we first parked our car the object still had a flame shooting out the top of it.  At first it had seemed as if the refinery flame was lit.  But this was not the refinery.  The flame began to diminish and a very dimly lit spotlight appeard at the base if the object, at this point the shape of the object was unclear.  Everything up to this point happened in the first five minutes.  Now things get a little frightening, the spotlight on the craft had dissapeared and a bright green light turned on.  We were about 3/4 of a mile away from the object when it started to approach us, the green light was still on and the craft was approaching the highway heading east.  I couldnt believe my eyes as I saw this spherical shaped aircraft with six tentacle like legs under its body.  The craft was getting closer and now I can resemble the lights, there was one single light bar across the center of its body consisting of 1 green light on the right side (the brightest one) a white light next to that light, then three red lights that flickered as if they were being manipulated manually, they did not seem to have a set pattern and finally a dimmer green light on the left of the arrangment.

As I'm looking into the sky I saw objects flying in the sky (it was obvious because they would cover up the stars as they passed by). All of the objects seemed to be close in proximity to where I was. Also, they all had tiny dim lights all over them and wear flying pretty slowly, almost like they were gliding. Also, there was a soft ""swooping""/ ""gliding"" sound as the passed over head. The only thing that varied between them was their shape (or at least I was uncertain of their shapes, which lead me to believe they may differ). The first sighting I wanted to dismiss because it was (or what I saw of it) was a crescent shape, therefore I wanted to label it as a bird or something.  I took another look and noticed there were dim lights all over the object - ruling out it being a bird. A few minutes later I spotted another object.  This one was kind of in the shape of a plane or a chevron (its hard to tell because these objects were dark so some parts of them blended in with the night sky).  I knew it could not have been a plane because the object was way to close and there aren't any airports near by for a plane to be flying that low.  This object like the last had the unusual lights all over it as well. The third and final spotting of these objects I wasn't able to make clear of because it started to concern me.  I did notice the lights and also the speed remained the same.  The first two objects were flying from south to north and the last one i have forgotten. I am certain that what I saw was UFO's because I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I even phoned my father, who was a pilot for many years in the military and he could not think of any aircraft that fit my descriptions.",2011-03-10T00:00:00,29.87306124031008,-98.01287441860465

Others were observed flying independently North and South of 1-10 mainly between Fry Rd and Mason road. One craft flew directly over my wife's vehicle and she put her head out the window and heard a tiny swoosh sound. We then came home and watched the crafts appear spontaneously in the sky over our backyard at a rate of 1-2 craft every five minutes. The craft actually looked like fighter jets from the 50's and 60's but seemed to have a circular formation around them and pulsing red and green lights and a yellowish orange light that remained constant. The body of the craft also seemed to concave upwardly and outwardly like an upside down pyramid but much more subtle.  The white/off white jet fighter part of the craft(s) looked to have a very fat fuselage and had a very distinctive cross shape.  It was hard to see the circular part of the craft but you could see that it extended out from the main body and was much darker in color.  One would think it was a normal aircraft other than the fact that some of them seemed to sit still and no more than the minor swoosh sound could be heard. One thing that really stuck out is that they just kept coming from the west almost like bombers on a test run, many of them continued into Houston and some seemed to disappear. My first thought was that this could be some type of Harrier craft of even a type of silent helicopter but nothing really added up. I have never seen anything like it.

I had one cigarette in my hand and I was thinking or where my lighter was and all of a sudden as I looked up at the sky I saw something that left me speechless.  It was like an oval, saucer type shaped ball of light, bright white light. It was emanating light from itself, not reflecting it. It moved horizontally as if it was going into the sky´s darkness.  It left a white trail of light or perhaps it was that my vision saw it as a white trail of light because of it[s velocity. It moved so fast I couldn't even tell my 3 girlfriends about what I just saw. I  just gave out a tiny scream and looked at them in amazement. They didn't understand what was going on. I asked ¨Did you guys see that?¨ and they didn't know what I was talking about. As I watched them look at me with doubt, I felt tears in my eyes and sta! rted to cry.

As I approached it I noticed the three white lights and just thought it was a plane patrolling the freeways.  But as I got closer it became clear this was no plane nor was it a blimp due to its shape which was honestly dark and was only viewable due to some overcast skies reflecting the city lights behind it.  To me it looked like a soccer ball shape with 4 courners that seemed to flare  By this time im now very close to it and can see 3 more new lights that were red and staggerd between the first lights I seen from the front.  Passing it at well below the 65mph speed limit along with everyone else Im trying to make out what im looking at.  But I couldnt. It was just yards away on the oppisite side of the freeway so im lo! oking out my driver window stumped and somewhat suprised it was just sitting there.  I would argue til the end of time that it was not a blimp. Ive seen plenty of them to know this was much smaller and not elongated.and it was not a helicopter as it made no sound and was definately not equipped with rotors.  Oh and it wasnt a weather balloon or flares. Its something else and I just wanted to share what I saw in the sky last night.  Peace.

Nature of conversation in quotes is from my brief notes taken while driving and memory (8 minutes before writing this report). I have no doubt that the pilot's tone of voice was one of consern and wonder and he seemed very baffled about not being able to identifying a strange looking object formation that flew very quickly by him at slightly higher elevation. He announced he was at 24,000 feet just before I lost his signal. ATC could not identify it either, judging by pilot respones.

The sky was clear and the weather was mild and calm with absolutely no wind.   Upon looking southwards I noticed a large object moving in the sky at an altitude of roughly 5,000ft.  It was arc shaped and appeared to be made up of individual spherical objects (really tough to say how many, but I would estimate at least 10) flying together in perfect formation.   The object was slightly smaller than a Boeing 737 aircraft, and had no lights on it.  The object crossed the sky in a SW to NW direction at a relatively quick pace maintaining the arc formation without changing shape.  It appeared to be moving slower than a traditional airplane.  The object had no lights and made absolutely no sounds as it passed overhead.  The moonlight reflected off of the object giving it a greyish appearance but it was difficult to make out any specific physical details of the craft.   About 20 seconds after first spotting the object cross the sky it came to a complete stop but remained in the arc formation.  It hovered in place for around 2 seconds.  The objects then began to “swirl” around each other, taking on a more luminous white glow but were not brightly lit.  They “swirled” around each other in an apparently random pattern for about 3-5 seconds and then shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.   Again, there was no sound from the object at all. The total duration of the sighting lasted around 30 seconds.   This is the first sighting I have ever seen in Southern Ontario.  I am from New Brunswick, Canada and have seen UFO’s there when I was very young but nothing has ever looked like what I saw on May 7th.   Unfortunately I did not have my camera on me at the time to get a picture of this event.",2011-05-12T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

The lights were slightly smaller than the size of a full moon; they were white with a tinge of red and appeared as though a 747 was making a crash-landing in my yard. I yelled to a friend and ran out of the front door to look at the approaching lights.  I quickly realized that the two lights were two separate flying vehicles very close together; in fact, it appeared at one moment that they were going to touch but did not.  As I looked upward, I could see two distinct triangle shaped crafts flying just over the treetops perhaps 150-200 feet above the ground. They were moving about the speed of a person walking—they approached from the east and as I stood in my yard, the first triangle moved slightly toward me in a northward direction about 20 feet.  Both the vehicles had very bright whitish lights ! at the tips of each triangle that seemed to be moving in a searchlight motion.  When one of the craft was directly over my head, a beam of white light surrounded me as if it were daylight, yet a slightly different frequency of light, one that seemed like neither sunlight nor any type of headlight. From the vantage point I could see up into the triangle, appearing a bit like a pyramid shape, the points were evenly space; I think it is called an isosceles triangle. Between the bright lights on the tips were smaller round shaped lights perhaps 8-10 of them on each of the three lines of the triangle, I could notice shapes inside each of these lights. (I thought later that they might be telescopes) There was also a green and reddish light but I could not from this perspective see the direct source of the colors. At that moment, I believed I was witnessing something that was “Other-Worldly”. I felt no motion of air despite the closeness of the vehicles nor did I smell anything lik! e exhaust fumes. There was the sound of an engine, more like machinery , a very low frequency rumble, not very loud, yet I could feel the power.  The crafts continued the slow flight over the treetops and turned slightly south heading south, southwest out of sight.  My friend was now outside with me; she was also in disbelief and said that I seemed to be in the middle of the beam of light as it passed over me. The entire encounter lasted perhaps 80 seconds, yet it seems longer. I made an effort to be more observant, however, I was paralyzed with fear and astonishment; it was two days before I could get to sleep. I called my neighbor and the phone rang and rang and she ran into the house picked up the phone and said, ""Yes I saw the lights over your house!""",2011-05-12T00:00:00,45.0736,-69.0343

Around midnight I stepped outside for a smoke before bed and was on the phone with my boyfriend when I saw the object.  It wasn’t high in the sky but more on the level where I caught the movement out of the corner of my eye.  It appeared to be a faint reddish color, not too bright but bright enough to see clearly.  And you could really see it with the clear sky. It was disc like in shape, but that could have been motion blurring it?  It was going left in a zig zag motion and then stopped (complete stop) and dropped down then came up again then shot off to the left.  It was there and the next moment it was just gone.  Since it’s been extremely windy, I also though perhaps it could have been a plastic bag up high or some other thing, but nothing I’d know of would just stop like that.  I went inside for a while but decided to come back out about half an hour later to see if I could ease my fears because frankly it’s scary thing to experience.  I wasn’t seeing anything ! and again I was on the phone with my boyfriend when I happened to see it again.  This time it went from the left of the sky to the right with little corkscrew-ish turns but extremely fast and smoothly.  It wasn’t as faint as before when it had been near the mountains and it seemed a little larger in appearance.  We have a dam nearby that’s extremely well lit up and it went in that direction.  I stayed out for another hour looking for it still and it actually appeared again.  It seemed to come back from that direction but this time it flew seemingly straight and still extremely fast.  I actually had to get out of my car to see where it was going. About 3 minutes passed and I saw it the final time.  It appeared near the little/big dipper (not sure which it was) and made a few strange movements like it was drawing a star or octagon. Just left, right, forward, back but all extremely fast.  And this time instead of winking out when it was done, it did it in the middle. It would reappear! then disappear.  Then it finally stopped.  I waited another hou! r before I went inside to bed but it didn’t reappear again.  As a result i'm one tired camper at work this morning!!  Because of the weather, I considered trash flying about or debris in the sky perhaps catching the glow of the lights around me, but the way this moved and the range of sky I repeatedly saw the same object in nullifies that conclusion. I saw a lot of planes as well, but this was closer to the earth than they were.  Also, the planes were extremely slow where as this object caused me to look from my right and turn around to continue looking at it in 4 seconds. I also considered other things like lights or laser pointers, but there was absolutely nothing for anything to reflect off of.  It was a completely clear night and the wind was blowing in gusts of 35mph. Also, each time I saw the object wasn’t for long at all.  The first time was the longest, lasting about 15 seconds. The 2nd and third time were both durations of 4-5 seconds.  And the 4th time it lasted maybe a little longer…8 seconds at most. I believe there might have been only one of them, but i'm pretty sure that the last 3 sightings were the same one.  If anyone could shed some light on this it would be much appreciated.  If it's not a UFO (well i suppose it is lol), then are there any logical alternative explanations for this?",2011-05-02T00:00:00,34.2572,-118.4195

We were talking while we were looking up at the sky.  It was partly cloudy that night but u could still see a great number of stars.  As we sitting looking up a light caught my eye it was small round light coming through a cloud and it looked like there was a light behind it.  Naturally I said o look to my Girlfriend there is a shooting star.  I thought it was a low one with a bright tail behind it. She looked up and it came out of the cloud into a clearing in the sky.  What came out of that cloud was no shooting star.  It was rectangle in shape with three small round lights in a line inside the rectangle.  The lights were brighter then the rectangle part.  It wasn't very high and it kept moving in the same direction.  It was no Meteor, no satellite , no plane or jet.  It didn't even make noise when it was approaching or when i was gone like a jet does just quiet. !   I looked at her and I said, ""Umm, did you see that?""  just to make sure and she replied,  ""I think we just saw a UFO"" I could not believe it at first but I am 100% certain this was a UFO.

I will also add more detail at the bottom. Driving northbound on Rochester road at Hamlin (see attached map), I saw about a mile ahead of me two VERY bright, yellow-white lights close together.  The lights were very different from the street lights, car lights, and building lights in the area.  All those lights looked washed out compared to the floating lights.  The floating lights were also significantly brighter and larger in diameter. At first I thought they were landing lights from a plane flying really low.  As I approached I realized the lights were stationary and then thought it must be lights on the end of a high pole - perhaps they're having a carnival in the parking lot of the mall again.   As I came to a stop in the left-hand turn lane at Rochester and Avon, It was about 20 or 30 yards away (west and slightly north) and about 4 stories up... and still not moving.  I keep thinking to myself, ""I can't be the only one seeing this"". The thing that stood out most was how I had traveled a mile with this thing in full view and it never appeared to move at all.  No wavering, nothing, even when I was right next to it. It was just hanging there steady in the same spot. At this point, I could make out a third light, and the three lights formed a triangle, but I could not see anything between the lights at all.  I pulled out my iphone and shot 3 pictures, but only 2 came out (not very well, either.  I have an iphone 3g so it's not HD). After about 10 seconds it started to move south.  It didn't accelerate, it just started moving at a slow, constant rate.  As it moved over the parking lot to my left (west), I could CLEARLY see its shape since the ground lights were illuminating it from below.  It was a triangle with equal lengths on all sides and appeared to have no markings at all; just a flat, ""grayish"" surface with lights on the each end.  I could not tell how thick it was.  As it moved, the lights faded to nothing over the span of about 6 seconds and then I couldn't see it at all even though it was fairly close. FYI, it was raining slightly and there was a slight ""haze"" in the air. This may be unrelated, but when I crossed the road two miles back  I saw four police cars with lights and sirens blaring as they drove through the intersection of Rochester and Auburn roads.  Two continued west and two turned south. Additional notes:  The lights on the craft barely show up on the photo although, to my eye, they were really bright, glowing balls of a diameter larger than the parking lot lights.  Strange that they barely show. Also, the lights were constant the whole time: no flickering, pulsing, etc. until they shut off one-by-one. I can't emphasize enough the strangeness of how this thing was just ""parked"" in mid air.  It was just hanging there completely still. Friends have been asking whether it made any noise.  I didn't hear anything but since it is a busy intersection I'm not surprised.  Although, you'd think if it was a jet that I would have heard a loud, high pitched noise, but I didn't. Also, the three lights were not underneath the object but appeared to be on the sides.  I couldn't tell how tall it was because the lights didn't reflect off the black surface. In retrospect, that's pretty strange too.  And I don't remember seeing the lights reflect off anything in the environment, but I probably didn't notice because I was watching this thing so closely.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,42.67501279527559,-83.1424346456693

The lights appeared to be flying from south to north in Fayetteville, Arkansas, along interstate 540, in triangular like formations.   3 or 4 lights seemed too turn west along Wedington road.  At least 2 other lights disappeared from sight completely in an unknown direction, the rest of the lights continued north over interstate 540. The lights appeared to be under 10,000 feet (3,030.3 meters) and moving quite fast but at varying speeds.  I witnessed what seemed to be 1 light dropping altitude, speeding  up and  passing another light in the same formation.  The light that was passed  then broke sharp to the west and a few other lights  behind it followed along the same route west over wedington road. I can say with 100% assuredness that in my 6 yrs Launching rockets as a MLRS crew member in the US army national guard, and my time in Iraq watching night time take offs and bombing raids by US jets, multiple helicopter formation  at night, and UAV flights, that it was nothing like anything I have ever seen while being in  the military.

I live in a 4 story condo, and occupy the top 2 stories.  I have an exterior deck that faces the south. At 10:55 PM,on Saturday, June 18, 2011,    I walked out on the deck to take in the night air, before watching the evening news.  I was facing the eastern sky, when I noticed an object, about the size of a 'quarter', circular in nature, with a large organge light emanating from the middle, and many smaller lights surrounding the perimeter of this circular object, spinning, in what I believe was a clockwise direction.  This object was, as I mentioned, the size of a quarter.  It was not small.  It was very high in the sky.  It did NOT make a sound, and its lights were spinning.  It flew from the south-east, to the north at a very high speed.  When I say high speed, I mean, it took about 4 or 5 seconds to cross the horizon, until I could not see it.  It was NOT a plane, helicopter, or any other natural object that I have ever seen in my life. I live about 6 miles from Montreal's Trudeau International Airport and ALL of the planes in this area, fly east-west or west-east.  BUT I have to make the point, that I also saw a plane, taking off along the same path as the object that I saw, but at a much, much, much,  slower speed. I have NEVER  seen any plane move as fast as the object that I viewed.  I have never seen any planes take a northerly path as this one did. I have never seen an obeject as large as this one was.  I have never seen a circular object as large as this one, with an orange center glow, with lights circling the center orange glowing light.  But most importantly, I have never seen, something move so quickly accross the sky.  This thing dissapeared in the space of about 4 to 5 seconds.  It was so high, that I only saw it materialize, halfway in the East horizon, that is, I did NOT see it span or cross the complete horizon.  It appeared about 1/3 of the way, in the South-East horizon, and then flashed accross the horizon, moving North, until my vision was blocked by the roof of my home.  I could only follow it with my eyes, until my roof blocked its progress. This whole event took no more than about 4 or 5 seconds.  I can tell you that I have seen, satelites, shooting stars, the 'space station', and other unknown lights in the sky, including high flying planes.   BUT this is the first time, where I can say that what I saw, was NOTHING resembling anything remotely 'Earthly' constructed.  This thing was high in the sky.  It was large (the size of a quarter). It was orange in the center and spinning with orange lights on its circumference and it flew at such a high speed, so as to preclude anything else I have ever seen in my life.  This was NOT a plane! I believe it was high in the sky, because the lights were NOT blinding.  They were visible, but not extemely bright.  The evening sky was clear.  There were no clouds in the sky. The moon was a 3/4 moon. I don't know what else to say about this event, except that I know what I saw.  It was large, spinning and extrememly fast.  I am a believer, now. When I watched it, I could not believe what I saw. I can tell you this though, this was not a plane, baloon, star, fighter plane or anything else.  It was round, orange and glowing with lights circling it, and it was motoring at a very high velocity!   This sighting was over in 5 seconds.  I was in awe and surprised, and delighted and in shock, all at the same time, and I still am.  I don't know what else to say.",2011-06-20T00:00:00,45.51408695464828,-73.58579954756006

It was very bright orange, and larger than anything I've seen before.

Description of a singular Phenomenon seen at Baton Rouge, by William Dunbar, Esq. communicated by Thomas Jefferson, President A. P. S. Natchez,  June 30th, 1800. Read 16th January 1801. A PHENOMENON was seen to pass Baton Rouge on the night of the 5th April 1800, of which the following is the best description I have been able to obtain. It was first seen in the South West, and moved so rapidly, passing over the heads of the spectators, as to disappear in the North East in about a quarter of a minute.  It appeared to be of the size of a large house, 70 or 80 feet long and of a form nearly resembling Fig. 5. in Plate, iv. It appeared to be about 200 yards above the surface of the earth, wholly luminous, but not emitting sparks; of a colour resembling the sun near the horizon in a cold frosty evening, which may be called crimson red.   When passing right over the heads of the spectators, the light on the surface of the earth, was little short of the effect of sun-beams, though at the same time, looking another way, the stars were visible, which appears to be a confirmation of the opinion formed of its moderate elevation.  In passing, a considerable degree of heat was felt but no electric sensation.  Immediately after it disappeared in the North East, a violent rushing noise was heard, as if the phenomenon was bearing down the forest before it, and in a few seconds a tremendous crash was heard similar to that of the largest piece of ordnance, causing a very sensible earthquake. I have been informed, that search has been made in the place where the burning body fell, and that a considerable portion of the surface of the earth was found broken up, and every vegetable body burned or greatly scorched.

One evening I went into a nearby janitor closet to get a broom to sweep up my room.  It was nighttime and the closet had a window.  A glowing green object caught my eye against the black night outside. It moved! Of course, I also moved to the window to get a closer look.  The glowing thing drifted to the top center of the window as I went forward. It strangely moved to follow my head as if it was curious. It was approximately the size of a peanut shell seen from the side, with no details to be seen, only the bright green light.  My immediate thought was that this was alive and must be some strange glowing insect that would make a great addition to my collection. Hoping that it would not go away, I hurried back to my room to get my “butterfly net”.   The excitement increased as I returned to find it was still hovering outside. Pulling a step stool over to the window, and climbing up, the “bug” a! nd I were face to face. Again, it moved slowly side to side watching me as I moved to open the window from the top. It moved a few inches as I raised my right hand, grabbed the handle and pulled the window slowly in to quietly open it.  By this time I was really excited!  It was still hovering around and was still in reach. I brought my net up to make a sweep at it.  As I placed the net at the opening it instantly went straight away, without a sound, at unbelievable speed. It left a trail of light in my eyes. Next, I tried to find an insect in my entomology textbook which fit the object’s description. It did not exist. Thinking about this event many times over the last 47 years has led to my conclusion that the “object” was definitely intelligent.  It demonstrated curiosity which is a sign if intelligence and thinking.  Precise movement is common for an insect but not combined with movement showing curiosity.  Also important was the complete silence.  Insects fly by beating the air with their wings which creates a buzzing noise.  This was a fairly large insect which should have made a significant sound when it flew away at such speed.  Similar reports of silent hovering objects have been seen following aircraft in flight.  I wanted a record of this event for future reference. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",,,

The object hovered approximately 500ft above us it was a silver (metallic) in colour it also had a dome.  We yelled for help but no one heard us..   Finally the object started moving north from our location at a high rate of speed i have never seen anything move as fast as this object moved..   But this sighting was not over we no longer settled down and we saw the UFO again this time it was flying above the cockpit of a airliner i don't think the pilot even new this object was above him.  The UFO followed the airliner to about the same location where it left the first time and it was gone at a high rate of speed..   I really believe we were making contact with this UFO through our electro magnetic transmissions. I would take a polygraph test to prove what i witnessed that day...

We didn't report it at the time.    Unfortunately, my mother has since passed away, so I am the only one left to depart this information.

The sighting was years ago, but the details of the astounding craft, its show of interest in us, and the entire experience have remained clear. Please read my story and see what you think.  Something of  this nature is quite difficult to share, for fear of how it will be received, but I hope you will find it credible and interesting.  I would appreciate hearing what you think after reading this account, and if you have any questions I'd be happy to try to answer them. Sincerely ((name deleted)) Shelby Township, Michigan   In 1966, I was 19 years old and lived in Gibraltar, Michigan, with my family.  I don't recall the date, but at that time there had been a flurry of UFO sightings being reported in our area .  There was much discussion and speculation on the local radio stations concerning the reported sightings, and the topic was being handled with a mixture of curiosity and derision.   Later, I think ""swamp gas"" may have been given as an official explanation of the many sightings, but by then my mother and I knew there was more to the story than that. One morning, in the midst of the time period of the frequent sightings, we had our own UFO experience. Around 11:00 A.M. my mother and I left the house to go shopping.  She was driving the car.  It was a bright, sunny day with a clear sky.  We were driving northwest on North Gibraltar Rd., heading toward nearby Trenton.   That road had, until recently, run straight out of Gibraltar to join West Jefferson Rd. near the Gibraltar McClouth Steel plant, but had been rerouted so that there was a left bend in the road and it now joined West Jefferson somewhat south of the steel plant. I mention this because, as we were approaching the new bend in the road, I could see straight ahead to where the road (still intact but blocked off) had once joined West Jefferson near McClouth Steel.  Over the smoke stack of the steel plant, there was a large shining disk-shaped craft, just hovering in the air low over the stack. I pointed it out to my mother and said ""Hurry and get up there so we can see what it is.""   There had been a lot of press given to pollution from factories in those days and ! my first  thought was that someone was testing the exhaust from the smoke stack.  The nature of the unusual disc shaped object, however, caused me to quickly reject that simple explanation. The change in the road forced us to turn left instead of approaching the steel plant directly,  so I kept my eyes on the disk as my mother quickly angled toward West Jefferson Rd..  We reached West Jefferson, turned right onto it (now traveling northeast),  and began approaching the section of road in front of  McClouth Steel.  By this time, we had slowed way down in order to continue to observe the disc.  There were no other cars on the road at that time, or throughout the duration of the sighting. As we slowed down and approached the factory, the disc began to move slowly and silently  toward the road, so that our paths would converge right in front of the steel plant.  This was a four lane highway, and the aircraft stopped and hovered, centered over our lane as though waiting for us to approach.  We did, very slowly.  The size of the disc was such that, centered over the far right lane where we were, it extended over the other three lanes on one side, and out over the shoulder and ditch on the other.. About this time, even as it was happening, I became aware of a remarkable feeling that came over me.  I suddenly felt extremely comfortable and relaxed- completely unafraid and unthreatened, even though what I was seeing did not fit at all with my concept of reality and would logically have had the opposite effect.  It was the calmest, most clear headed, yet overwhelmingly curious I had ever been.  So much so that I can still recall that strange, very positive mix of emotions that were so contrary to the data my senses were taking in.  I've never experienced anything like it since.   At this time,  I began to calmly describe aloud everything I was seeing, to confirm with my mother that she was seeing the same things.  It is this deliberate, and methodical process that we went through during the sighting that, I believe,  has helped me to remember so clearly after all these years, the details we observed that day. The disc was shiny metallic in color.  It seemed to be made of an unpainted metal that was bright in the sunlight, but not highly polished.  It had come to a stop and was hovering about twenty five to thirty feet above the road.  It was a perfectly round disc shape, and the bottom surface was slightly rounded (convex), almost flat.  The top half was convex also, but the center portion of the top half was more raised and dome like, so that there was an elevated, angled surface on which there were large windows.   We could see just one side of the craft at that time, but the windows disappeared around the curved surface as though they went all the way around it.  The windows were rectangular in shape, wider than they were tall, and had rounded corners.  We counted four of them.  I described all these details to my mother aloud as I observed them, and she concurred. Due to the shape of the upper portion of the craft, the windows were angled farther away from us at the top than at the bottom.  I said to my mother, ""Try to look inside.  There has to be someone in there looking out at us.  They're probably looking at us just like we're trying to look at them.""   We both tried, but something about the glass, or possibly the angle of the windows, kept us from seeing beyond them. The aircraft was close enough that, if it had been a house with vertical windows of regular glass, we could have easily seen inside. My mother was afraid to stop the car and, even though I kept saying, ""Stop,"" because I wanted  to prolong the sighting,  she insisted on allowing the car to continue to creep forward, though barely.  We continued to try to see beyond the glass, and to look for details to confirm with each other, until we gradually began to overtake the object, but as we did it moved very slowly off center of our lane and more over the right shoulder of the road and the field beside it.  At this time, I started describing what I was seeing on the bottom surface, because our angle of observation had changed. I told my mother, ""Look and see if you can see any markings, numbers or letters."" - as you'd expect to see on an airplane, helicopter, or other commercial or military aircraft.  We both looked closely, but couldn't see anything like that.  I did note, and verbalized,  that the bottom surface had ""seams"" in it.  It was not a smooth surface like one piece of metal but, instead, was made up of many different pieces joined together in a fashion I could not make any sense of.  I stated that possibly the seams marked compartments that would open, and we tried to tell if there was an entrance door, or compartment for landing gear.  We talked of that possibility, but there was no way to know if that was the case. I also looked for evidence of how the different sections were fastened together- large nuts and bolts, screws, giant rivets, etc., - anything that I'd recognize as typical construction methods for other large metal objects that I was familiar with. There was no obvious ""joining"" system for the separate metallic sections that made up the bottom surface of the disc. As we continued to roll slightly forward, the disc had moved off to the right a little but it was still ahead of us, so we were looking out the windshield and a little off to the right at it.  Then, without making a sound,  the craft moved a very little, slowly, paused, and then shot off at a great speed, rising into the sky at a very shallow angle and disappearing in about 3 seconds.  We noticed that, even though it departed extremely fast,  the tops of the trees near where it had hovered were hardly disturbed.  It seemed as though the sighting lasted for about fifteen minutes, with about ten of that being spent face to face with the disc at close range.  However, we didn't check the time so I can't be sure how long we watched the aircraft.  After it left, my mother accelerated the car to a normal driving speed and we continued to our shopping destination.  Of course, we discussed what we'd seen and wondered if we should report it, but it's amazing to me now that we were so unshaken by the event as to continue on shopping as though nothing had happened.  When we got home we told my dad about it and he laughed at us and said, ""Oh, you girls just saw a helicopter.""   We explained to him that it was too close to make that kind of mistake, but he was intent on not taking it seriously and discouraging us from making a report that would draw ridicule.  Considering the public derision then being aimed at the reporters of strange lights in our area,  my mother and I became convinced that the authorities and general public would not have believed the up close and detailed experience we'd had.  Over the years since that day, I have been very happy to have had this rare experience,  to know for a fact that U.F.O.s do exist, and to know clearly what at least one kind looks like.  I'm still in awe of  the overwhelming sense of clear minded alertness, coupled with unnatural calm and a sense of safety that suddenly came over me in its presence.  Below, you will see a picture I drew of the U.F.O. we saw.  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *   Thank you for reading my account of this event.  I hope that, in some way, it might shed some light on this important subject.  Again, I'd appreciate your comments, and will try to answer any questions you may have.

If it was, it would not be good as it was low and very large.  I woke up my husband and brought him to the window.  By then it was gone.  We looked out a window facing to the southeast and saw the object, only a few moments transpired between sighting it in the west and then sighting it in the southeast.  It was much higher and further away at this point. We observed lights, sometimes multiple and could see another shape, elongated which we thought might be the glow from the lights.  As the object turned this second shape moved in different directions, at first on its right, then on its left and then below the very bright glowing lights.  We found our binoculars.  We observed that at times we saw three very bright lights from the object, then it would shift and we would see six or more.  The second object moved further below the first one.  It was a sphere, with lights, they could have been windows. When we first observed this object, there were airplanes in the area.  We are about 50 miles north and west of O'Hare airport.

When I got to the red light I stopped the car and I looked a this circular, very shiny and bright object in the sky... It was flying fast and in diagonal manner.  There was not sound, not flares, not colors, no rotation, no aura or a haze  around the object...  Just the round super shine shape moving in the sky.  Then, it disappear! In a blink of an eye! There was no cloud for it to hide behind or anything else - I cannot emphases enough that the sky was complete clean and without a cloud...  That is actually when I thought ""wait ... what was that....""  It was just so fast and then it was gone I did not have time to think anything about it until then....  I looked around to see if I could spy it somewhere else or just in case it would re-appear farther up or down... NOTHING!  It was gone for good. I looked at the clock in my car.  It was 1:50 pm.  After that I spent much of the afternoon looking up just in case I would see it again...  Later (closer to 3:30pm) I saw an airplane and then around 5pm another airplane. In comparison  these two aircrafts where leaving a white line in the sky and although,  they were significantly farther up than the first unidentified object, I could recognize the ""airplane"" shapes....

After a few seconds, the object veered north and northeast and its light disappeared (apparently making a tight U-turn).   At this time I thought I was witnessing the landing lights of an aircraft coming in for a landing.  However, the lack of lights on the wings and tail was curious.  Seconds later, the object reappeared farther west than where I had last seen it.  And again, a few seconds later, it veered north and northeast and its light was extinguished.   It reappeared a second time, again further west, but shortly thereafter the object flew behind tall pine trees that obstructed my view.  Throughout the episode I did not hear any sound emanating from the object. Approximately 10-15 seconds after I lost sight of the object, I observed a high flying plane in the eastern sky also moving in a westerly direction.  I felt that the aircraft was following the object that I saw, but keeping a safe distance away. Minutes later after entering my house and telling my wife what I saw, a jet approached from the east (possibly from Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo?) and roared overhead, again traveling in a general westerly direction.

We were walking on the beach to the north and it was dark.  Looking out over the ocean to the east I noticed a bright yellow colored light moving parallel to the beach toward the north.  The light slowed to a stop and went out.  I had shouted for the others to look at the light and they also were able to see it going out.  The next we saw was a single yellow light appear and it was stationary. A second light appeared south of it and then another and another.  A total of four lights were in a row and all stationary.  Then a fifth light came on further south of it.  The lights then went out in sequence and reappeared in sequence twice more.  My daughter said it appeared to her to be rotating.

My friend and I stepped out on the deck to have a smoke when we noticed a strange moving object in the sky.  It had red and green rotating lights as if either the craft was rotating itself or the lights were moving around the craft (clockwise motion).   Now I AM aware that all small planes have green and red lights, but the way this thing was moving really threw us off... enough that I ran inside and woke up my wife.  The object appeared to be hovering in one spot but once in a while would get kind of shifty, as if as if it were banking hard side to side, and when it would do this it would expose the bottom of what we believed to be either a disc shape or a mushroom shaped craft, either way the bottom was lit up yellowish, about the color of like a street light.  Around the craft there was a very faint green glow to it.  The craft hovered for about 30 mins. or so and slowly moved away from us.  Both my friend and I are chefs at a local restaurant, and my wife! is a waitress, we are by no means experts on air crafts, but I have seen many planes in the night sky and this was not a plane.  Its movements were strange ... it moved up and down very quickly with a curvy pattern simular to an ""s"".  I am sorry that is the best way to describe its movements with out being abale to show you.  Ufo, i don't know for sure.  Airplane - NO. Either way I was wondering if anyone else saw this???

Just at the end of us watching this craft hover above what would have been a farm field, there was what appeared to be a falling star, if that has any relivence.

A new type of fire work?  But it looked like it was directly above Denver. We drove past a few houses and trees that blocked our sight from it.  And before i knew it it was gone.

We kept our eyes trained on it as it descended.  Strangely enough, it appeared to get lower and lower the more we acknowledged it's presence.   As it continued to descend we recognized it to be a triangular metallic craft having 3 white lights affixed to each of its corners.  And here is where it gets really bizarre.   The craft continued to lose more and more altitude until it was eventually about 500 ,or less, feet above us.  It was DEFINITELY aware of our presence, and was at this altitude to, seemingly, get a closer view of us.  The natural outdoor lighting around this time wasn't optimal, so scant details of the craft's exterior were acquired. We could however make out that it was metallic.  The craft's lights were jarringly bright. It hovered, silently, above us at this altitude for about a minute and then silently disappeared( for lack of a better word).!  The craft exited at an out-of-this-world speed into the Northeastern sky.  We have seen strange lights in the corn-field behind our house for years, but no experience can equate to this encounter.  As bizarre as it may sound, members of my family claim to have experienced encounters of the fourth kind as well, resulting in possible implantation of seemingly metallic objects no larger than a centimeter.  Time loss (4 hours or more at a time) is also common among members of my family.  I'm sure these encounters are more common than people report or admit.  I decided to report this encounter for it simply changed my life.  I'm unsure of the craft's agenda, but they seem to be studying us (humans).  Throughout our lives we have had blurry experiences and tossed around conjecture.  This happened, and IS HAPPENING, beyond a doubt.

It was high enough that it appeared to be well above the ridgetops.  At first sight, I commented that it was likely a helicopter, as it appeared to be suspended and stationary.  I further commented that it could have been an airplane flying directly toward us, as it again, appeared to be stationary.  It appeared to be yawing slightly as we watched it get closer. As we continued to drive toward the object, it became apparent that it was stationary, and that we would soon be closing in proximity, that the object would be readily visible out the passenger side window.  At or near LOCATION 2, I stuck my head out to see the object in a position that seemed to be nearly directly above my head, and slightly off to the right side of the vehicle.  From this vantage point, the object appeared to be lower than I had first observed or estimated.  It seemed to be 100-200 feet off of the ground.  It looked like a fiery ball.  It had a bright white ball-shaped center and 3 points of red, triangular light extending outward from the center, almost like a pinwheel.  It appeared as something burning and I expected to see smoke or hear crackling, but heard no sound from the object, nor was there any visible smoke. Quickly, our vehicle, which was traveling at approx. 45 mph, seemed to be pulling away from the object.  From this vantage point it seemed to be at a fixed height and position and our relative velocity in the vehicle was clearly far greater than that of the object, as it appeared fixed in position.  I had to maintain my head out of the window to see it from the rear vantage point of our vehicle.  I was afraid my glasses would blow off, so I pulled my head in and looking out the back window, I could see that it was still visible and close to the ground.  At that point (LOCATION 3), the object was out of view due to the tree line and direction of the road. I don’t know what it was, but I’ve never seen anything like it. In retrospect, it appeared similar to a firework that was ready to burst, but did not move or traverse or explode. It was just ""hanging in the sky,"" very close to the ground. The sighting and experience were so mysterious and compelling that my son and I drove back from our home, a few minutes (approx. 20 minutes) later to see if the object was still there.  It was not.  However, as we turned and drove back home over the same stretch of highway, we estimated the locations where we observed the object, and I recorded the locations as waypoints on my GPS device.

Lower than your usual aircraft coming in to land at DIA.  As it flew closer, I could see it tumbling over itself repeatedly and thought maybe it was a balloon at first.  But as it approached closer, I could see the sun reflecting off it very brightly and could easily tell that it wasn’t a balloon.  It started to get a little larger as it came closer and I ran outside to get a better look.  I am so glad I did that because what I saw next confirmed what I was hoping for all along. As I stood on my porch, I was able to see this thing pretty well at that point.  It was very black and shiny and was shape-shifting from a star-like object, into a triangle object and then into something I cannot even describe on any level.  But it changed shapes as it continued to tumble over itself.  But every time it tumbled, you could see something different going on, almost as if it needed to tumble in order to accomplish a particular task.  I don’t know…that’s the best way I can describe it I guess. At any rate, after watching this for 1-2 minutes, I watched it for as far as I could before it flew completely out of sight.  However, someone from downtown Denver should have been able to capture this thing well depending on his or her location.  It was heading towards the news stations so they should have been able to see this thing too. I hope someone reports it besides me.

I saw an object moving in the north/northeast sky, moving north/northwest for about 1-2 seconds.  The speed was greater than a conventional airplane.   The object caught my attention because of its size, which appeared to be the size of a significant fraction of the moon if that had been visible, about a 1/3 visible moon size.  Most striking was the bluish green color, not a deep strong color but more of a shade of white.   The object emerged from a cloud, passed through I believe some haze because the outline was not sharply distinct, and was gone into another cloud.  I did not hear any sound.

This object was very long compared to its thickness (Long Tube), another thought for describing would be a (Long steal pipe). There was only one cloud above and to the East that had a high bank that tappered off.  The object slowly entered into the cloud at a slow speed and was covered up. I stood for a while longer looking all around this cloud waiting for it to exit, as I headed back to my job slowly, and with my eyes on the cloud...absolutely nothing came out of the cloud. I have thought of all other possibilities as to what it could have been..... The only things that are most outstanding is that it was very long for its thickness and with no contours to the body.  The other outstanding thing is that it did not have wings. There was a dark outline around the object, and with a (best description) white/shiny interior, the end were exactly the same (rounded), and there was no glare off the object from the sun in the West. I cant get this out of my mind....its time I report this!  The clouds were not that high up, a large plane at that height and speed would be too slow for long distance travel, and not to mention the shape would be of a plane clearly!  When I think of the cloud bank and the length of the object, the object could easily have covered at least 3 quarters of the clouds thickness (bank)!  With the sun shining from the West would why would one see a dark outline all around the object?

It seemed odd to us that stars would be aligned so perfectly like that, so we kept watching to see if they were planes, or thought maybe our shifting view would clarify what they were. Our view was obstructed for two minutes, and as we approached Palos Verdes Drive W. (we were on Via Coronel at this point), the lights came in to view again, unchanged.  Our view was obstructed again as we approached the Palos Verdes Drive West, and was blocked by trees as we headed North for around 1/4 mile.  When there was a break in the trees, we pulled over to give it a better look, and again we saw the lights. The lights were definitely above land, though not extremely high in the sky.  They were as bright or brighter than how Venus usually appears.  We guessed that there was around 1000 ft between each light.  It seemed odd to us that stars would be aligned so perfectly like that, and while we were watching, the middle and upper light started flashing.  The light on top was flashing green and the middle light flashed red.  This continued for approximately one minute, then suddenly a fourth white light zoomed in from the East and into position directly over the green light, and a second or two later the lowest light took off in the opposite direction. Following that, the red and green lights turned white again.  Then one by one, the three remaining lights appeared to be moving away into the opposite direction of where we were.  First, the uppermost light became fainter and fainter, then the middle light and finally the lowest light remained, becoming fainter, and then disappeared.

The object seemed to stay in place, relatively motionless for the entire length of the sighting.  Being unsure of what the object was I had my fifteen year old son come outside and take a look.  He verified that the object seemed to be hovering in the same spot.  At that time I called a friend who was working approximately 6 miles from my location.  He proceeded outside and spotted the object from his location.  At that time I went inside the house to get a pair of binoculars to try and get a better view.

Orange Orbs March 14 2011   I am an avid sky watcher.  I want to make that point clear.  Since my first sighting in 1979 I have been quietly obsessed with our universe and the many cultures that abound throughout.  I want also to be clear that I rarely ever report what I see to anyone other than my friends and family. In August of 2010, I began to see Orange Orbs at fairly close range with the lot of my home either front or back yard being my vantage point.  The first one I saw was after sunset but prior to the dark of night.  While talking on the phone standing on my patio when, as if directed in some way, I turned my head and focused directly on the orange orb heading my direction and saw it clearly.  I told the person on the phone what I was witnessing, stating that this was a “good one”.  At best guess I would say the real size of the object was about 2 to 4 feet spherical.  The orange glow at least gave it the look of being spherical.  I figure it was at an altitude of 75 to 150 feet and maybe 200 yards downrange.  I always have binoculars on the table so I told my party I was reaching for them.  As I reached I knew that the orb was watching me.  I knew that it was reading my thoughts and when I grabbed the binoculars it, as best as I can describe, folded into thin air.  The total e! lapsed time was maybe 45 seconds. The next visit was just two evenings later.  This time I was in the front of my house.  While playing darts with my nephew, I received a phone call.  My dartboard is in the garage so I took my call to the driveway in the front of the house.  I am a pacer, especially when I talk on the phone: While pacing up and down my driveway, just like the last time, I was almost summoned to turn my head and look up.  I did and there it was again, the orange orb.  This time it was much closer to me.  It was visibly about three times the size of a basketball, slowly moving about twice the height of my one story rooftop, between my neighbor’s house and mine.  Again I told the party on the phone, “There is that orb again”.  “Wes check it out!”  (Wes is my nephew) I told him to hurry and grab those binoculars.  All the while I never took my eyes off of the orb.  It was communicating with me.  I could feel it.  And the moment Wes grabbed the binoculars and started toward me it, once again, fo! lded into thin air. This was two sightings in as many days and I could feel that the orb was aware of me and it knew that I was aware of it.  I might also mention that I have had a number of sightings; I have lunched with Bob Lazar at a pizza place in Vegas.  Been to black box road several times, and so on.  These were the first “Orbs” that I have witnessed.  Well three nights later I had another visit.  This time I was just pacing in the driveway waiting for my pup to handle her business when I, as if someone called my name turned and looked right at the hovering orb.  This time it was a good 200 feet in altitude and over the middle of my street.  I stared for about 10 seconds, pointed to it and said, “Please don’t disappear again.” And backed into the garage trying to keep my eyes fixed and at the same time reaching for my binoculars and at risk of sounding insane, I felt it smile and just like that it folded into the night sky again.  At this point I am sure that there is something big happ! ening.  I do not mean in general.  That is obvious.  I mean specifically with me.  I thought finally after all these years of trying to telepathically reach out, someone is picking up the cottin pickin phone. Nights   turned into weeks, they quickly turned into months.  Each night diligently going out to call to the orb while stargazing and nothing except for maybe one sighting about 1000 yards down the street and higher in altitude but I am only 70 percent sure that was the orb.  That is until tonight.  While playing darts again in my garage, I stepped to the driveway and pointed calling, “Dude, tell me you are seeing that.”  This was not the orb but a huge ship!  Much higher, I would say 1500 to 3000 feet in altitude, maybe 1.5 to 3 miles down range, and glowing like a mini sun but it was longer top to bottom then left to right, it split into 4 equal size large orbs that slightly angled toward the ground, then, immediately went back to one, back to two larger at an angle again back to 1 large round, then stretched upward and blipped out. I have witnessed some very awesome stuff.  This ranks in the top three for me of all time.  My nephew could not believe that finally after hearing me talk about ufos and aliens for years he finally saw that.  It was a short sighting but a very fantastic one.  Of course I checked out all of the obvious possibilities knowing full well that what we had seen was genuine.  I have seen almost the identical thing on a post on some website, and I believe it was a film from Norway.  I could be wrong on that.  Needless to say it was significant enough to warrant this report.  I would like to hear of the many comparisons that are out there.  I know that we are and have been visited here since the beginning.  My being is fully aware of the endosymbiotic relationship that we all share with one another, with our Creator, and with the Planet, Galaxy and the Universe.  I spend countless hours as a crack researcher from UFOs to Mars anomalies, to alien races, underground bases, and the whol! e lot of it.  I throw out most hang on to some and dig into others.  I have always had a connection with space for some reason, as a child I was so afraid of ufos I would not sleep in my room alone until about the 8th grade and that was in 1979 I think.  I do not think I was ever abducted at least I do not think I was.  I may be privy to something I am not yet aware of but that is yet to be revealed.  I have the gift of sight and can see things in people that freak me out still.  Most of my closest friends know me as “The Profit.”  I simply can see through some sort of window when prompted to do so. Anyway, I just felt compelled to put this one on the record.  I will continue to look for them every night and will report back if they continue.  If you are in the know keep digging, if you are skeptical, look up once in a while, you will eventually be shown. If you are a government official, I feel sorry for you.  Just kidding, but if you are, help bring full disclosure.  We as a race deserve the truth.  Peace to all and may your spirit find its source and one day know it.",2011-03-23T00:00:00,34.506735795454546,-114.29056420454545

We decided to peak out the window to share in their revelry and noticed this red light passing through our field of vision. This was at 12:00AM. At first I thought it was a red stray firework light but it continued heading North East from our location. We watched in amazement for around 10-15 seconds and then ran outside to see if the light was still there. And it was. For at least another 45 seconds to a minute. Then we finally lost it through the trees as it approached Aberdeen Proving Grounds. The light was red and did not pulsate but rather stayed the same brightness as it silently moved across the sky. There were no tails to the light which ruled out a meteorite and there were no light drippings as would be seen from a flare or in our case, firework. It was difficult to determine how high the light was in the sky but it appeared to us that it was either lower than a normal helicopter or plane, or it was very large. We've been looking all over to see if anyone else had seen this occurrence. Please let us know if you hear anymore on this",2011-01-05T00:00:00,,

UFO Incident Report January 1, 2011   Six of us were celebrating the New Year at our home in Northern Virginia. We were all in the living room, watching the countdown to the New Year on television and were waiting to toast the event. The ages of the people were as follows:  One male 13 year old One male 15 year old One male 24 year old One female (approximately 23 years old ) One male 48 year old One female 48 year old  At approximately 12:02am, we all stepped out onto our deck to scream “Happy new Year” and to listed for others celebrating with fireworks, etc. Almost immediately, someone in the group shouted, “look at those lights!”  We all looked South and observed four orange lights in the shape of orbs. The lights appeared to be more or less, evenly spaced from left to right (East to west) and were clearly moving Northward, toward our location.  Two of our group began to film the objects with cell phone video cameras, while all of us talked and shouted over one another, identifying the obvious reasons why these objects could not be aircraft or other known manmade crafts. Those observations will be detailed below. As the objects came nearer, I (The 48 year old male in the group) decided to run down to the basement and get my video camera. I obtained the camera and went into our backyard, below and in front of the deck, where the rest of the group was still positioned, observing the objects…. Now, considerably closer than when I had left. As the objects continued to get closer, I could see that they were somewhat offset, as well as spaced apart. More specifically, there was one in the lead, the second was a bit off of the left and back and so forth. The “formation” was similar to military aircraft formations. As the objects began to pass overhead, the rear most one, began to dim at a constant pace until it appeared to vanish before our eyes. The remaining three continued on and flew over our heads and ass that happened, the trailing object began to increase its speed dramatically. That object was moving directly toward the object that was second in line and it appeared as though the last one was going to collide with the middle one. It sped up and raced right up to the middle one and appeared to pass within inches of that object. As it passed, it’s light began to dim and then the object vanished. Moments later, as we watched the remaining two objects continue North, they both dimmed out and vanished as well. With the lights out, I could still see the unlit object continuing north for a moment, until it was absorbed by the darkness. As all of us were talking over one another about what we had witnessed, someone directed our attention to the south, where we observed three more objects heading toward us in the exact same fashion. These objects were duplicates of the four that we had just seen. The 24 year old male in the group shouted, “I’m going to go get my laser light, and he ran into the house. The rest of us watched as these three orange lights continued north toward us. As they were at about the 2 o’clock  position on the horizon, the rearmost object dimmed it’s lights rapidly until it literally vanished before our eyes. The remaining two continued toward us. The 24 year old male returned to the deck with his laser and activated it. There was a brief exchange regarding the law forbidding pointing lasers at aircraft. He proclaimed what we all knew, that these were not aircraft and the law did not apply. We quickly discussed the possibility of an alien misreading the laser as a threat and the 24 year old stated that he was sure that they would be able to identify it as a simple beam of light. With that, he directed the green laser at the rearmost object, which was now passing directly overhead.  All of us were surprised to see the object illuminate with the green reflection of the laser beam. Seeing this, confirmed that the objects were much lower and smaller than we had originally thought. The two objects continued north to about the 10 o’clock position and then simultaneously dimmed out and were gone. Items Of Interest:  There is a commercial flight path within sight of this location, however it runs from south to southwest. There has never been a commercial or private aircraft that has flown in this path, since we have lived here. That is almost six years. All of these objects flew directly over the Quantico Marine Base. This base does not have a lot of aircraft activity. In the past 5 and a half years, I have only seen four helicopters and no fighter/fast mover type of aircraft. All aircraft are required to display one red and one green light, in addition to landing lights while on approach to an airport. There were no green, red, white or flashing lights on these objects whatsoever. These objects were illuminated with an orange light. None of us hear any sound associated with these objects. None of us had any physiological or psychological reactions, other than great excitement, to these objects. Of our group, three of the adults believe in and have observed UFOs in the past. The 23 year old female did not believe in UFOs but has been profoundly affected by this experience. The two children have witnessed unexplained lights (with the adults present) in the past, and seem stressed about the possibility of the lights being associated with alien life. The 48 year old male is a retired “Big City” police officer and is currently an investigator for a federal agency. He is also a Veteran Army Paratrooper. Because of the sensitive nature of his career, he is deeply concerned about being identified. Five of the people in this group are related. Husband and wife, father and three sons, Three of the adults in this group have had multiple UFO sightings throughout 2010.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,38.64662271428572,-77.31406

I live in Redlands, which is about 6 miles EESE of San Bernardino, CA. At a little before midnight New Year’s Eve, 2010, I went out on my east-facing front porch to listen to the celebratory noise. Approximately 00:05 am I observed two glowing objects rise from the NNE from my vantage point. The objects were, to my eyes, about as bright, and were about the same angular size, as the planet Jupiter (when it is on the zenithal arc). These objects seem to have risen from NE Mentone, the next town east of Redlands. The atmospheric conditions caused them to slowly rise, in an apparent north-westerly direction. The sky was overcast with some low stratus and cumulus clouds.  I was able to track these objects for about 10 to 12 minutes before they entered obscurity in the clouds, or their inherent light source went out. The two objects appeared to originate from the same ground location.  Their apparent angular separation ranged from about ½ degree to 2 degrees. My supposition is that they were large balloons carrying an ignition source well below the balloons themselves (to keep from burning the balloons). The light they gave off was mostly white, with a slight reddish tinge.  The time of their disappearance was approximately 00:20 am.  From the time of first notice, to final disappearance, they traveled approximately 55 degrees azimuthally. Thought I would write this in case anyone else saw the same thing. About midway through November, in the late afternoon, I saw two similarly-sized objects, with about the same apparent luminosity.  They, however (or at least at the time I noticed them), were separated by about 30 degrees, and had much different trajectories.  It is quite possible that their point of origination was also in NE Mentone – perhaps these were test flights?",2011-01-05T00:00:00,34.03061421800948,-117.14975355450235

I am a beleiver of outsiders but of course i dont fear them, but it was very interesting seeing this object flying upward (vertically), not horizontally. Afterwards, I saw 3 choppers scattered around the valley make their appearance shortly after my sightinging. Then I saw a superfast object with blinking lights (green and red).... either a jet but im thinking it was a sattelite trying to pickup the trace. I saw it above the northern part of SLC. Not sure if it came from Wasatch Mountains or from the city itself. When I stepped outside seeing it at the beginning of my sighting I would estimate it's altitude from the ground at ~ 5-7k feet up. I noticed it as I headed to the front door! and heard the neighbors making racket of the new year (which i dont mind). I'm 20 years old and I have had 1 OTHER EXPERIENCE where i saw a UFO 30 feet away from me. Take in mind not to associate UFO with aliens but with an unidentified object. Never been so scared and startled in my damn life from the previous experiece. But thats another story... -------- So the facts are: -Very Bright orange aura ~ 5-7k feet above ground when i first saw it -Had no blinking lights at all but a strong solid orange glow! -Was heading upward with slight zig zag movements at one point then went straight up -I never saw a speed increase but it's hard to judge at that distance -I watched it until it left the atmosphere.... I have very good eyes and i watched it until i could not find it in the sky. -3 hellicopters appeared around the valley( I'm from delaware and i know choppers)... They wernt regular news choppers or anything. I'm thinkin military but THAT is just a GUESS -saw a very fast moving object with blinking light ~ 5-10 min afterwards move right past where the object was moving. I beleive this to be a satellite high in the atmosphere scanning. -------- I saw something of great importance but email me back or call me if u find anyone else that shares the same sighting.

Then another report of about 5,000 certain type of fish was found dead New Year Morning. I can't confirm it was 5,000 Black Birds and 5,000 Fish my numbers can be off. I am not sure fireworks all over Illinois do that to just Black Birds or a certain type of fish. Well, I can't confirm this was a Chinese Candle or Moving Flares. I was! thinking this was an Invisible object that powered on to get away from the Fireworks (maybe). Why just black birds and a certain type of fish? I think what I saw had to do with these dead Black birds and Certain type of goldfish. I am going to find about now about this dead animal report.

It took the object approximately 10-12 seconds to move from horizon to horizon, traveling silently from south to north in a straight line. I’ve observed the ISS in the past, and this object was much bigger and seemed a lot lower in the atmosphere.  I’ve also considered that it may have been a meteorite; it certainly moved like one, but the red color seemed all wrong.  We did have some severe weather move through the area a couple of hours later, so maybe the atmospheric conditions gave it the red color. I can say that its brightness stayed consistent, so I don’t think it was reflecting sunlight; tt appeared to be self luminous.  While I’m sure it was natural in origin, there was just something very odd about its appearance. I just thought I would make the report with the hope that you might be able to tell me what the heck it was. Thanks.",2011-05-29T00:00:00,39.17450311744155,-84.48136299381886

I was travelling eastbound on Old St. Augustine Road, about 3 miles east of Capital Circle SE, when, about 5:20am, I turned left (north) onto Grassroots Road to routinely deliver a paper to a residence.  This is a fairly sparsely populated area of homes in a wooded, secluded area.  The road is narrow and unpaved and there are no street lights.   Almost immediately upon entering Grassroots Road, I observed what I first thought was an airplane and wondered what an airplane would be doing so low and back in those woods.  I immediately realized this wasn’t a conventional aircraft, and since I am a small statured female and was alone, I became very frightened and thought of turning around and fleeing the area.  But the road is narrow and there was no place for me to easily turn around.  I knew this to be a UFO of some sort as I had never seen anything like it.  I will attempt to describe in detail. The craft was hovering, nose in an upward direction, not straight up, but in such a manner that I could plainly see the belly of the craft but not the top side of it.  The belly was directly in front of me.  It seemed to be at that angle because it was very low to the ground, from tree top level to slightly below  tree top.  It was in a clearing in the woods, maybe 50 yards at most from my position.  I believe it had attained its position, nose up and hovering with slight, sometimes jerky movements back and forth, so as not to brush against nearby trees which bordered the clearing.  The craft made no noise at all. I will attempt to completely describe this craft.  It is difficult for me to relate the size, but possibly the size of a relatively small passenger jetliner.  It looked very large because of its close proximity to me and its location in the clearing with surrounding trees.  I would say it was a triangular shape with the wings forming a rounded, curved ""boomerang"" shape.  In other words, the craft was not a sharply shaped triangle.  It had red and blue lights on the wing surface, as I recall, one at the front, one on each side about half way back, and one on each wing tip.   The belly of the craft which I could clearly see, had about five lights, three in a row, front to rear, with two on each side and below the three in a row, and out toward each wing tip.  It was lit up so as to be clearly visible, but not in a glowing sense that it would light up the area around it.  The belly had several grooves running in orderly rows, front to rear.  I believe the color was gray like a Navy ship. I was so afraid, thinking it may be watching me and I might be in danger since as I said, at that hour there were no other cars on the road.  As it rose upward and begin to move upward and to the left, away from the road, I sped on by it.   I drove about a quarter of a mile to throw my paper, and when I returned on my way out, there was no sign of the craft",2011-05-29T00:00:00,30.47439334637965,-84.25529034572733

The event occured outside of Augusta, Montana on May 26, 1:00 A.M.  The area where I was staying is dotted with ICBM sites that are in eyesight of the road leading to the cabin.   The closest site to the cabin I believe was roughly 20 miles as the crow flies from the cabin.  I also believe that numerous other ICBM sites exist in the area that are sub Terra.   Six of us were sitting around a campfire, when a large reddish greenish glow started to crest the hill which leads down to the property.  We were staring uphill from a lower location looking up the road as the light crested the hill.  When a vehicle drives at night, which is rare anyways out there, the light does not crest the hills, the dips between the roads blocks out all night until the vehicle crests the top.  The light we saw was roughly 80-100 yards away.   Our first thought was that we were not witnessing a vehicle at all, but aurora borealis.  I remember a friend saying its aurora, but i fiercely d! oubted this accusation as the object grew brighter and showered the beam across the 4 acre property.  The object on the hill became glowing with a greenish purplish hue, that flooded the entire area we were staying in.  It illuminated all the trees behind us upwards to over one hundred yards.  The light seemed to expand over the entire area, then began to pulsate with tremendous colored light.   Six of us distinctly remember the intensity of the light and its changing color structure.  I remember staring directly at the object, then having the desire to walk towards it.  Not in an abduction sense, but more so a mix of curiosity and some sort of draw towards it.   My friend and I began to run towards it with his German Shepard.  As we started running to the top of the hill the orb pulsated and vanished.  No contrails, nothing at all, just turned itself off and vanished.  Since I was running up to the craft, my friend that was stationary said that the object had a center where ! the light was radiating out from.   What happened after the UFO left was also very interesting.  Every single one of us said we could feel some sort of energy within our bodies.  It was a very intense feeling, and it was not nerves or adrenaline.  It was as if my body was charged up or another state of awareness.  Everyone I was with said they could feel this feeling as well, upwards to an hour.   Within twenty minutes of the sighting, we noticed two planes flying overhead at low altitude with no lights at all.   Just two planes within a minute of each other, jet black, and not a single emitting light.  One of my friends who was in his tent at the time of the siting, said he felt an intense light pulse through the tent and that he could feel the presence of something hes never felt before.  The dog in his tent, had erratic behavior after and during the light.   The following day on the road out, we witnessed more U.S. Government plates on SUV vehicles than I have ever seen in a population of 287 people.  At first I was not going to post my encounter, but after reading countless reports of minutemen and other military personnel that were stationed in the exact same area, and reporting exactly and very close to what I saw, I changed my mind.   I believe ICBM sites are the main focus of these lights people have been seeing since the Cold War.  The incident at Maelstrom AFB really made me interested, and an avid believer that nuclear power and ICBM are of great interest to whatever is out there.",2011-05-29T00:00:00,47.4927,-112.3923

I quickly realized there were three and they were maintaining a constant altitude, instead of falling to the ground like your typical meteorite. They passed directly overhead at approximately 8,000 feet and 1500 knots.  As an air traffic controller, I've spent twenty years observing aircraft, and feel I have a good gauge for judging altitude and speed; however, it was at night which can throw off your depth perception. The three circular craft where in a perfect triangle formation, and made absolutely no sound despite their speed and passing directly overhead.  Perhaps the strangest aspect of the sighting was the color (or lack thereof) of the aircraft.  They were translucent, and displayed the night sky on the bottom of the craft, that you would normally see behind the craft, as if they weren't there.  The only reason I saw the craft is because they were glowing orange due to their speed and proximity to the ground.  They had no lights of any kind typical to every other aircraft in the night sky. Like I said, they were moving fast and I thought that I was going to get treated with a shooting star.  I watched them approach from the east, pass overhead, and leave to the west.  It is possible that it was one large craft with three glowing disks affixed to the bottom in a triangle formation; however, I believe it was three separate craft.",2011-05-29T00:00:00,40.5292,-104.9852

These two objects were moving parallel to each other with some considerable distance between them(I had to turn my head 90 degrees to see each object). The bigger light source had a constant motion throughout with a slow pace.The other smaller light object had a sporadic movement (i initially thought i was looking at a bird which emits light on its tail). But it was not, as this was at a higher altitude than what birds generally fly and this object was definitely bigger than a bird and had a light emitting with a luminosity which definitely cannot be a light emitting bird or any other man made remote controlled flying object.

I am a retired sea captain who spent 27 years at sea traversing the whole world. On the night of March 3, 2011, I was standing in my open doorway having a cigarette when I noticed a bright red flashing light through the trees approaching from the southeast and tracking towards the northwest.  Fort Brag is the jump-off point for San Francisco area air traffic beginning or ending their Great Circle routes to and from the Far East and we occasionally have some military flights off the coast so I am used to seeing air traffic, but this light was unusually large and bright to be a navigational light so it grabbed my attention.  It was a beautiful clear night with no clouds or haze. As it approached, white lights became visible and I saw that there were six white lights, much dimmer than the pulsing red light, in the shape of a triangle.  The red light was located between the second and third white lights on the starboard (right) side of the craft, which is the wrong side for a red navigational light. I estimate the altitude to be between 5,000 and 10,000 feet and it moved rather slowly, more like a propeller driven plane than a jet. It passed nearly directly overhead, at an elevation of about 80 degrees from the horizon and I observed it for what I would estimate to be four or five minutes.  As for size, it would have filled the lower half of a full moon.  I heard no sounds from it as it passed by overhead. When its course took it offshore, it seemed to ""eject"" a smaller craft out of its starboard ""bow"".  This craft had a smaller pulsing orange light and two small white lights.  The smaller craft continued on a northern course while the larger craft continued northwest until it disappeared from view behind some trees.",2011-03-10T00:00:00,39.4797,-123.6391

We were camping at the Pine Creek Campsite near Bayfield, CO, where two of our party had previously witnessed UFOs/strange lights in the sky. The craft appeared in the gap between two peaks, which is slightly west of true north.  Initially, it looked like a single, white light, an excessively bright light, in fact.  It’s hard to explain, but it was really, really bright  - WAY brighter than any other plane or star.  However, as it drew closer the white light seemed to separate into three smaller white lights in a perfect line with a red light hovering above it.  Presumably, this was the top of the craft as it seemed to be descending. The truly interesting thing about this craft was that it was incredibly low, perhaps even 500 feet or less above our heads.  It flew directly overhead and seemed to bank slightly before disappearing into the south - perhaps over Vallecito Reservoir. As it passed overhead and banked it became clear that this was a diamond-shaped craft.  Small lights lined all four sides, delineating the diamond shape and showing the outline of the craft.  From our vantage point we could see the underside of the thing which seemed to have four or five red lights (one at each corner and one in the center) and a series of three or four round white lights in the front and four slit-like lights toward the back. It moved slowly and took about thirty seconds to travel across the sky.  It made a low, rumbling roar, but did not resemble a plane in any other way.  I have no idea how large it was, but it seemed pretty big, at least as big as a jet, maybe bigger. About an hour and one-half later another craft appeared from the same general area and traveled the same general path.  It seemed exactly the same: appearing as an extraordinarily bright single white light and then showing us the three white lights and single red light as it drew near.  As before it was very low.  Once again there were small, white lights around the perimeter, three or four white lights at the front and three slit-like lights in the back.  The only difference was that the five lights at the corners were green and not red. Note:  This object was not on the same flight path as any of the planes that we had observed in the sky, and, most importantly, it was far, far lower.  I did a bit of research and discovered that there are nearby airports that could support a craft of that size.",2011-05-12T00:00:00,37.3774,-107.5508

I parked so I could continue looking at the object and I noticed it was moving real slow to only one direction and knowing off the top of my head that every airplane in the sky is required to have flashing lights, this one did not.  I stared at it more because I was thinking maybe the lights are delaying or something but to my surprise it started to dim out real slow when it completely turned off.  As it was off you could tell it was round and it looked white or grey,  I kept my eye on it for about fifteen seconds when it started going out of my vision that’s when I jumped back into my car and tried to follow it but it was too late. As I got home and started to park I saw two lights that definitely looked like the same light I had just seen and these lights looked pretty big to be a plane and they also were not flashing, just a deep, bright red orange light that reminds you of the color of fire. It almost looked like it was on fire.  As I got off the car I was watching these two lights travel slow next to each other but they had a distance. The light that was on the left side dimmed maybe ten seconds after I was watching both of them and the second light took longer to turn off but as I was watching that light I was examining it more to rule out the theory of this object being out of the ordinary and I truly found this object fascinating. I know for a fact it did not have any flashing lights at all it was just glowing that red orange color, and I found it so weird how it turned itself off and you can still see the object moving in the sky, if this was an airplane or a man made object it made some illega! l moves by not having flashing lights and flying in the sky with its lights off.

The craft was huge!  I got scared and u-turned and didn’t look back.  I drove the 20 minutes home and called and told my friends I was too tired to go out--which wasn’t fun because I had really wanted to go to see my friend, R., who was in town just for one night.  The spaceship is the only reason I didn’t make it to the bonfire. I have had 4 or 5 previous sighting with this kind of craft.  It is a UFO to me because I don’t know what can hover like that and I have seen them zigzag through the night sky out of sight in a split second; it could very well be a government aircraft, but since my government has not informed me of such things (as they should if they have them!) it may also be alien spacecraft.  I have seen one over the ocean in North Carolina that backed behind a cloud and came back (this was a GIANT black craft, still the three white lights on the ends---there was a government base nearby I know), one when I was traveling from Kansas to St. Louis down 70 E near Colombia (this looked exactly like the one from last night, except that when I first noticed it, there was a sort of spotlight coming from it I thought it was a soccer field spotlight at first, this one stayed with me on my drive down 70 for  a while), I have seen one at camp Zoe, MO (far off in the night sky and zigzags across in ! irregular patterns and then darted across to the right in less than a second.

I would love to know what it is I am seeing these last three years.  I have only seen triangle-shaped with three lights on the ends.  I have reason to believe that each of them have a see-through hole directly in the middle of the triangle (my ex boyfriend saw one very close up in daylight).  I don’t want to be abducted but I also don’t want to be scared.  I always tell myself I will be brave next time I see them but I am not yet very brave when I am alone (like last night).

As we approached the area where the craft was downed, not knowing it would move again, I saw it rise to a height just above the vegetation and trees, crossing over the highway but stopping dead center over our northern middle lane facing west.  It was now extremely recognizable as a disk shaped craft which was still slightly blinking but a as a bright shadowish green in nature and clearly translucent as a night shining skin with apparent electricity flowing through it.  I wondered how this could be as I have never experienced such lighting or energy technology. It was clear visible in its entirety from top to just about underneath.  After about 15 seconds we were just 100 feet traveling slower and watching.  I couild tell it was about 3 car lengths in diameter determining its legnth as it appeared over an overpass but this could not be determined as exact as I could not tell if it was directly over the bridge, or might it have been closer or nearer to us.  It accelerated west and! parallel to the surface exponentially across the highway and continued to accelerate to a speed which just started to make it appear blurred at 4 seconds, quickly turned at a compound angle, 60 degrees to the right and 45 to 50 degrees upward through 2 layers of clouds.  It could be seen as it was going through the second scattered cloud layer and disappeared away from our atmosphere at an extremely high rate of speed. I had only average (laughable) interest in this type phenomenon prior to this encounter and was not a non-believer.  However it did require convincing until this incident.  Now I really do know.  I remained silent about this until now because of the ridicule factor having been a finance company owner.  I have seen... I believe.",2011-02-23T00:00:00,,

While in Scarborough,Ontario at work there. I came outside for a smoke break at about 1:10pm. The day was quite warm and clear blue sky with a slight haze high above. Within about five minutes while observing the sky above my workroof -facing north. Three red rusty round lights  ""materialized"" over my work roof at about roughly less  than one thousand feet in altitude. These lights than changed in size and shape that formed a longer ""band"" in shape. In description they appeared in length maybe 20-50 ft long-in a vertical position  In width would be about 5-10 feet. They were a bright  ""rusty "" red light with a obvious light intensity. I then screamed for a coworker near by to come out and see this display after about  one minute. As the coworker came out and looked up above the roof.He also could see the display of unknown aerial light anomalies. After about 10-15 seconds. We together observed three more appear from nowhere into the group of three. Now the count being six light anomalies above in total. Then after another 30 seconds. Another three-five bands of light materialized before our eyes. Now there are 9 or as many in total 11. Both I and the witnessed were quite in a state of shock in what we were witnessing. Now as we watched this group of rusty red bands of light just sitting still in a  group of 9 bands -maybe 11. It happened so fast in this stunning spectale to observe. Within about 40 seconds later. A small white LOW flying commerical jet came in the direction where these light  anomalies were stationary. Here comes the shocker to this observation of the pure bizarre. As the jet came directly at the light anomalies. These bands of light together moved ahead slowly, as one group forward towards us. The ones in front dematerialized -like going through a invisible door. The rest still visable followed all in about 10 -15 seconds and vanished before our eyes. This happened as before the jet flew directly at them where they once were sitting. My coworker was totally in shock, as he went back inside the workplace. I stayed outside for another 10 minutes and witnessed nothing more. I looked for the witness in our place of work. He was indeed in a DEEP state of shock. He did NOT want to talk about it ANY FURTHER what he witnessed with me. One thing to note that the following work day on Monday -he could not talk. As if he lost his voice. PLEASE NOTE: At the end of the day to go home there was another TYPE of intense white plasma light sighting directly above following me in the car. I will send this to you, as it is another separate report that should be told. It was one of the strangest sightings I've ever witnessed. Sorry it took this long to report this sheer paranormal sighting observed to you. I truly believe this sighting confirms another type of  ""level"" of higher intelligence. ie Craft not included -they did not appear solid. I have to question the timing of the jet 's presence also. Added with it's low altitude over my roof. Did someone know that fast of a possible contact/abduction about to happen on the ground ?  Very strange event to witness for anybody.",2011-02-23T00:00:00,43.77102833099579,-79.24512173913044

While at my workplace earlier to this report. A coworker and myself witnessed 9-11 bands of pure rusty red intense lights  materialize and dematerialize over our work roof about 1000 ft at approx 1:15pm. This SECOND sighting that I'm about to report to you. Is obviously connected, as to complete both parts sent to you. After work that day at 5:00pm to go home. I was at the intersection of Birchmount and Progress to make a left hand turn-north  on Birchmount Road at about 5:10pm. While sitting at the red light traffic light . I looked up through my open sunroof to the sky. My mouth and nerves dropped of what I was witnessing. The sky was blue, yet had haze high above. I could see a ""blazing"" of white light with no form. Like a bright star in the day  It was very difficult to tell how high this type of plasma light was in elevation. Though I'd say 1000's of feet to guess. It stuck out like a sore thumb in the sky-it was simply magnificent to witness. It was like looking at a welder's torch. As I watched in disbelief, a motorist next to me. He looked up to see what I was witnessing through his side window of the driver's side. The traffic light then changed green and I made my left turn. I felt so pumped up with now this second sighting occurring directly overhead  Great now I'm being follow by a higher presence ?  I kept driving north to the next main intersection without looking up, as I was  starting to shake with fright  Until I stopped at the next intersection light at Lawrence Ave/Birchmount at the red light. Curious,I looked up again through my sunroof. This blazing white intense light is still over me. I can tell you there is NO other TYPE feeling than this inside you happening to  anyone described in observation. The fascination //excitement from the first sighting. Brought fright and uncertainty of being NOW followed going home happening here. This was not a solid object or any KIND of light ever I had ever witnessed during  the day. After the traffic light changed green to go. I never again looked up til I got home in Oshawa Ontario. I have seen some strange objects/crafts and other strange paranormal activity  throughout my life. But this TYPE of aerial display really had floored me. As I'm sure it would do to others emotionally if in my shoes as an OBSERVER to all  this unknown aerial display. I truly believe these two reports submitted to you today. Reveals that there are indeed ""LEVELS"" of HIGHER intelligence around our realm here. Again to say it = craft NOT included. Just pure light ~  If you or any field investigator can help OUT in this information-I'm open.

I am a 22 year old male recently back from Alaska for seasonal work.  On the night of November 18th, 2010 at approximately 8:20 P.M, 2 good friends and myself  saw something  about  100 feet away (behind an unoccupied house)and 150-200 feet above the ground hovering.  I was driving home from the store about 1 block south of my home in Millwood.  I did not notice the object first of us three, my eyes were on the road.  I noticed my friend in the passenger seat was looking at something very intently.  He was gazing through the driver side window and practically leaned over me to stare at it, when my friend in the rear driver side seat blurted out “dude what ((deleted)) is that in the sky?”  My first reaction was to instinctively look at the object, but at first only glimpsed it for a brief moment before returning my eyes to the road. At first glance I certainly thought that someone in the area had inflated an advertisement blimp with lighting and let it float over their house attached to the ground via cable. After taking my eyes off of the object my observations had become clear to me, I had indeed seen something floating above the ground, unnaturally. I drove on about 50 feet and made a left hand turn onto my road and stopped after about another 20 feet to better observe the object as it was stationary when first sighted, and still on the left above the ground.  As soon as I stopped to observe it however, the object slowly turned 180 degrees and began moving in the direction that I had just came from slowly. I realized that the object had begun to move and shifted my car in reverse to pursuit. I reversed very quickly around the corner and started to chase the object with my car. As soon as I rounded the corner, however, the object was gone from sight passing behind trees in the neighborhood, and I sped ! down the street to see it again and reached 60 mph before I got the last glimpse of it (I was the only one to see it that last time) speeding across the road in a southwestern direction. I returned home and reviewed my observations with my friends. What I saw was almost blimp shaped- metallic grayish in color- with what appeared to be 3 street lights (or lights with similar color) on its underside.  Rounded like a blimp on the top of it and concaved on the underside.  There was no sound observed by us.  Although we had the music volume turned up, it was reasoned by us 3 that if it were a helicopter or anything man-made than we should have heard it, especially in considering that the object was very close to us.  When the object began to move I noticed that the lights on the bottom side got significantly bright for a brief moment than begun rotating around the object, and at my last glimpse of it I only saw a circular ring of light speeding across the road.

It was Friday,  July 1, 1994, at about 7:28 PM. Myself and a friend were traveling on Easthampton Rd. headed from Northampton towards Easthampton. My friend noticed a low flying aircraft off to the right side of the car, it was coming down fast and moved right over the top of us. I slowed down and pulled off to the side of the road. The entire hood and windshield of my car lit up like someone was shining a spotlight on the front of the vehicle from above.  My first thought was a helicopter, but there was no sound. The light moved forward fallowed by two more spotlights on either side of my car.  The lights moved ahead of us slowly in a triangular formation. A red flashing light became visible under what appeared to be a flat triangular craft with three white spotlights pointing down, one from each corner. As the craft continued to move forward slowly we were not able to hear any sound and I was convinced it was some kind of glider preparing to land on the road.  I let it get about 100 yards ahead of us and then decided to fallow it.  I sped up to about 50 MPH and caught up to the craft a short distance up the road.  I fallowed behind the craft for about a half mile until it stopped and hovered about 80 ft off the ground behind Valley Sport Center on Northampton St. in Easthampton. I pulled into the buildings parking lot and my friend and I both stepped out of the car to observe the craft as it hovered there silently.  The sun had set just below the treeline as this all began a few minutes earlier.  There was a slight haze in the air.  With a few minutes of diminishing daylight left I could see the craft reasonably well. It was a flat black triangle with rounded edges and corners and a non-reflective surface.  It appeared to be slightly wider than the road we had just fallowed it d! own, maybe 75 ft. wide. As we observed the craft hovering a short distance in front of us, I remember thinking it was just close enough that I might have been able to hit it if I threw a rock.  I kept a spotlight on the front seat of my vehicle which I used for my job.  I reached into the car, plugged the spotlight into my cigarette lighter and shined the tightly focused light beam off to the right side of the craft.  The light beam was visible in the slightly dim hazy sky for a short distance beyond the craft.  I then guided the light slowly towards the craft in an attempt to illuminate it.  The light failed to contact the surface of the craft, appearing to simply fade out prematurely as it got anywhere close.  I guided the light back to the right and it reached a little beyond the distance of the craft again.  I shut the spotlight off for a moment then pointed it directly at the craft and flashed it two times a few seconds apart.  The craft responded by returning two similar flashes directly at us which blinded both of us for a few moments.  As our sight was recovering from the bright flashes, the craft began to move slowly towards O'Neil St. We again fallowed the craft which stopped and hovered over a wooded area between O'Neil St. and Lovefield St.  We pulled over on O'Neil St. and stepped out of the car to observe the craft again.  After what seemed to be about three minutes the craft shot like a bolt of lightning across the sky to our right and disappeared through what appeared to be some kind of a circular hole in the sky.  The craft left a silvery streak in it's path and the hole it disappeared through faded away quickly. As we stood by the car for a few moments trying to make sense of what we just experienced we heard some low flying jets approaching from behind us.  Within seconds two A-10 Warthogs screamed overhead at a very low altitude.  The Warthogs passed directly over the position where the UFO had just been hovering and fallowed in the same direction as the UFO had gone until they were out of sight.  About the time the Warthogs were headed out of sight we observed two other fighter jets flying at high altitude east of our position.  At that point in time I estimate that about two minutes had passed since the UFO departed from the area. We got back in the car and I noticed the time was about 7:44 PM.  We quickly returned to my home a few miles away.  A little while after we got back to my home I called the Easthampton police department to see if anyone else had reported seeing the strange aircraft.  The officer I spoke to was politely dismissive of the incident and said they had received dozens of phone calls about a UFO and that it was just the planet Venus which was easy to see in the sky that night.  Fighter jets continued to patrol the sky in the area for a couple hours after the incident. Over the course of that weekend there were thousands of UFO reports across New England. These sightings were widely reported in local media for a short time after the incident.  I don't recall any reports from national media about the story.  For the most part the local authorities and the media made a mockery of the entire situation and blamed it on the usual flares and swamp gas.  The story was quickly swept under the rug and I've heard no mention of it since. I continue to experience phenomena related to this incident but do not wish to release that information publicly at this time.",2011-02-08T00:00:00,42.2903,-72.6404

My eyes locked on it as I tried to come to terms with what I was looking at. I was sitting in my car, engine off, driver's side window down - across the field from the elementary school I attended as a child - smoking a cigarette and listening to the radio. By pure chance, I turned my gaze out the window and upwards as I expelled a plume of smoke from my lungs, and there they were . . . Four reddish orbs, hovering substantially low in the sky, as silent as the surrounding night. They were NOT equidistant from each other but nonetheless arranged in a matter that allowed me to conclude that they formed the frame of an aircraft of some sort. Their placement in relation to one another seemed to suggest, to me, to form a shape of a triangle . . . the lights themselves forming an obtuse angle, stretching from left to right. The four lights were more left to right than up and down, and again, were NOT in a straight line, but formed an angle. Upon first setting eyes on the spectacle before me, I immediately shut off my radio. I have no recollection of radio interference whatsoever. If there had been, I'm sure I would remember it. There was no sound of traffic in the distance, as it was rather late at night and I wasn't anywhere near a main road or highway but tucked away in a residential neighborhood, blocks from my own house. The object was dead-silent and hardly moved, if at all.  The individual lights themselves didn't budge, nor flicker, blink, dim, or brighten.  Their illumination was constant. After staring up in utter awe for a few minutes, I looked away and reached for another cigarette, found my lighter, lit up, and then returned my eyes to the sight, at which point the lights were much further up in the sky, retreating into obscurity (and thus not as bright as they had been), and soon disappeared altogether. My best estimate of the time duration of my sighting is 5 minutes tops. I don't know what I saw that night, and not being a professional in the field of UFOs I don't pretend to identify what I saq but just merely describe what I witnessed.  And I will say this . . . in the faces of all those that might henceforth attempt to explain away my experience as if they had all the answers . . . I SAW WHAT I SAW AND NONE OF YOU CAN CHANGE THAT.

Encounter on a Lonely Desert Road By ((name deleted))   The beams of my headlights seemed to be chasing elusive shadows cast against the desert sage as I drove through the dark moonless night towards Congress, Arizona.  Retired now, a gold prospector with the time to fulfill my quest for the big nugget, my thoughts then were of gold and only gold…that was about to change.  Just about midnight and just South of the middle of nowhere, I had stopped and pulled off the road to relieve myself and take a break from driving, and it was at this moment that I first saw what I thought to be a helicopter with a bright searchlight circling the area southwest of me.  Having served with the U.S.A.F., I have seen many types of aircraft, but this was something I had never seen before. It was a red light intermittently beaming a brilliant, focused white light down to the ground as if to be looking for someone or something, and I thought what or who would be way out there, and why there were no strobe I.D. lights on the helicopter.  I didn’t ! give it much more thought and got back in the car and grabbed a cigarette, lit up and gazed back towards the southwest. The chopper was now circling closer to me and although my window was down, there was no noise…and I thought that was really strange.  Suddenly, what I thought was a helicopter flying at 500 feet was much smaller and much closer; in fact, it was now just on the other side of the road and was about 10 feet off the ground, hovering. I flicked the cigarette out the window.  I rubbed my eyes in disbelief. Am I hallucinating? “What the ____ is that?” My heart beating fast and my mind spinning, I watched as the object as it moved through the sparse vegetation, stopping now and then to illuminate the ground beneath with its powerful beam of white light, and then it appeared to morph into two tiny red lights, like twin LED’s (light emitting diodes) and started to cross the road towards me.  Now as it approached my car, it suddenly morphed back into its former shape:  a spherical orb about the size of a softball, bright red (DOT emergency red, like a tail-light).  Was this military?  Is this a living organism? Perhaps an alien probe?  It was now six feet in front of my car, four feet off the ground, just hovering. What the ____is this thing???  Somehow, I don’t think it’s military…no stars, insignia or guns…(chuckle) I noticed that although the red light emitted from this thing was very bright to my eyes, it wasn’t casting shadows and did not reflect from the surrounding bushes or from the polished surface of my hood.  I could see the surface of this thing seemed to be fluid-   like, and composed of what appeared to be millions of tiny dots of light swirling around very fast and was very hard for my eyes to focus on it.  The perimeter seemed to fuzz out at the edges, like an aura or halo.  The light seemed to be luminous rather than projected, and was not radiating any heat that I could feel. It’s amazing what goes through your head when confronted with an un-known like this… a memory of Dr. XXXXXXXX of  S.E.T.I. explaining that most UFO sightings are mostly swamp gas or weather balloons…Hey Doc!  Here’s one that will fit right up your telescope! At this moment, I was toying with the idea of getting out of my car to approach the orb and try to communicate with it. Suddenly, the orb started to move a little closer to me, and my curiosity was overcome by fear… I felt panic consume me and simultaneously engaged the engine and hit the lights.  The orb reacted by backing away slightly.  Illuminated by my headlights, I could plainly see that there were no mechanical parts or structure. I slammed the gearshift into drive, and floored it.  I wanted to put as much distance between that thing and me as fast as possible.  I warily glanced in the rear-view mirror and was horrified to realize that it was pursuing me down the road at 90 mph. I grabbed my cell phone and hurriedly called 911.  NO SERVICE.  I started laughing out loud.  Who the hell would believe me if I reported being chased by a hovering, glowing red softball?  They would think I was drunk or stoned out of mind! The little town of Congress had already rolled up the sidewalks and turned off the lights, and not a soul stirring…well, it was 1:00 a.m. Arizona time.  I decided to park in a vacant lot near the Fire Station right off the main highway. For the next two or three hours, I watched odd lights moving through the dark moonless night.  I found that my eyesight had been affected by looking at the orb, and I could not focus on any bright light source. Whatever I tried looking at seemed to move away into periphery. Needless to say, I stayed parked there and tried my best to go to sleep and forget about what I had seen. Later, when I arrived home in California a couple of days later, I also noticed that my eyesight had not only been temporarily affected, but it had improved to some extent, and now can read small print without the use of my reading glasses. I have shared this story with a few friends, but I notice that their eyes glaze over and I realize that they don’t believe what I saw.  If someone told me this story, I don’t think that I would believe it myself.  All said, I swear that this report is absolutely true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.

I am able to see the top of the mountain.  Atop the mountain is located a visitor’s booth and skyrail station. Next to the skyrail station is a tower with red lights.  I believe it is there due to the Stone Mountain Airport, which I read today was closed in 1996.  The latter statement prompted me to write this letter. Every single night, I see, what I thought were planes, leaving Stone Mountain.  On the evening of January 31st at around 9pm, I was exiting my home and saw a bright light, as the light on the front of a plane lifting up in the sky.  At first it began to rise straight upward. It was not going up at an angle, like a plane taking off, so I studied the object.  It raised straight up in the air very very slowly at first.  (It was coming up above the skyrail station)   Once the object reached a height where it was still visible but higher than the tree line, the tower, and etc, the object darted off to my right (this would have been the objects left if the light truly was the front of the object).  I followed the object for a few moments, about 40 seconds in my car. It suddenly got faster and faster until it disappeared.  It was as if the object evaporated. While I was able to see the object, begging my boyfriend to take a video  (He was too clumsy and nervous), we agreed that the object was shaped as a triangle.  It had one red light on the right end of the ""wing"" and triangle positioned lights along the object.  There was what appeared to be like a search light on the bottom of the object and it was difficult to tell, but it looked like a blinking blue light was on the end of the opposite ""wing.""  The lights were triangular in location and appeared to number about 8. There are planes coming from there every night.  Planes were even coming towards the object that night but were much higher in altitude and moving slower as it darted and then disapperaed.  I was surprised to hear the airport closed in 2006.   I was even more surprised once I researched UFO sightings and saw 2 exact descriptions online.  This prompted me to add validity to the statements made by the other two people who reported the triangular object with the lights.   I have not studied the rest of the ""planes"" leaving Stone Mountain, but it does not look like they are all ""rising up"" in the air directly.

When taking pictures, we noticed the object to come closer to us.  There was  a large triangular shape silhouetted in the moon light, at least 3 lights surrounding the object. The object seemed far away, then zooming quickly to a distance half of initial proximity.  The lights changed from intense white, to dull red,often disappearing and then quickly reappearing and completing this color changing cycle as we observed. The object then moved quickly off to the side and out of sight. We drove less than an eighth of a mile and saw another triangular shaped, lit object; again flying/hovering lower to the ground. We stopped the car and began video taping the event.  At that time, both triangular shaped objects came into view and began zig-zagging across the sky above and around the car. This went on for approximately 10 minutes.  The lights disappeared.  We drove for another 2-3 minutes and came upon the shapes again.  Video and pictures were taken, In many of the pictures, nothing showed up though was quite visible in the full moon light/reflective snow.

As we got closer to my home, I noticed an unusually bright star.  We continued driving, but then out of nowhere, my friend and I noticed at the same time, that the star was no star.  The light we saw grew even more intense and then disappeared just as fast.  We herd absolutely no sounds what so ever.  We then pulled into a parking lot and continued to watch.  The craft was hovering very close to Ft. Benning.  As we got out of the car, I flashed a flashlight in the direction of the light; it disappeared very quickly, but with a small delay. Thinking it was over, again out of nowhere, no other sounds or lights; the craft instantly appeared less than a mile away, just a couple hundred feet up.  I saw a disturbing sight.  The light was being emitted from the bottom of a craft.  The bottom of the craft was smooth a! nd flat, but tapered to a blunt top, similar to a spinning top.  On the side of the craft, there was a reddish light.  It was sweeping in a clockwise rotation, if viewed from directly underneath the craft.  The red sweeping light never made a full 360 degree swoop around the craft.  It maintained this close distance for less than a minute, and then disappeared again, just as quick.  As the sun was rising, it kept its position in the sky, and would blink as the bottom craft light grew and dimmed in intensity.  We managed to capture a one minute video of it blinking and changing intensity.  And eventually we lost sighting at about 7:30am the same morning.  Again, this just occurred an hour ago and for the amount of time it stayed visible, I’m very sure that my friend and I weren’t the only ones to see it!

Type of UFO:  Triangle or V-shape like geese flying, with V having about 8 well defined, orange-ish lights evenly spaced along each leg of the V. Direction of Flight:  East to West. Approximate Height above Ground:  5,000 feet. Approximate Distance from Witnesses:  5,000 feet. Color of Body:	varied from 'shimmering black' to 'faint white cloud', though the lights on the leading edge V were pretty consistent in brightness and color.  I would have said that it was trying to be camouflaged, except for the lights on the V. Other Details:   1. My wife, my brother and I were in my spa.  We were looking at constellations, and I had just pointed out a satellite that was moving west to east almost directly overhead.  I often spend all of my spa time looking for satellites and meteors.  This evening, after about 20 minutes of spa time, my peripheral vision caught the lights of the UFO.  I immediately recognized it as one that I had seen on TV shows, like History and Discovery....the Triangle-shaped type. I yelled at my wife and brother, who immediately witnessed the UFO and saw it for about 10 seconds.  It was moving quickly, was flying straight and level, and made no sound. As it went over my garage roof, I ran from the spa to my driveway, but a street lamp blinded me.  The event was over.   I called 911 and Constable came out.  We talked for 10 minutes.  He had seen UFOs (2 bright, fast flying spheres) a long time ago.  He was nice enough, but said that they only write up reports if a crime was committed.... My wife, my brother and I all had different perceptions of UFO size, height above ground, and distance from us, but we all saw it. 2.  After the sighting, my wife talked about how the UFO looked faintly white, like a weak cloud.  I then realized that, while looking for meteors that night, I had noticed an odd, faint, stationary white spot low in the sky.  I first thought that it was a faint cluster of stars, but then I realized that I never saw a cluster of stars in that location.  Then I just figured that it was a small, irregularly shaped cloud, and ignored it.  Looking back, though, the odd looking cloud never moved, and it was the only cloud in the area...it was a clear night.  That could have been the UFO, stationary, before I saw it moving.

It had one flashing red  light on the bottom of the craft but was flying extremely low and the craft had lights all along the side of it that were extremely bright.

It began as a story the kids began running and telling us after feeding time, and confirmed by me, many times by now, always at or just after dusk.

It is absolutely NOT a plane, NOT a star.  I have made sure of that because I feel silly enough about writing this.

It seemed to be moving much faster than an airplane and was higher in the sky than I have ever seen an object before.  It seemed to either be lit up on it's own, but was also reflecting off of the sun (as if it were made of metal or a shiny material).  It was hard to tell if it emitted light itself or not, but it was definitely reflecting the sunlight as it seemed to reflect the sunlight periodically as it moved.   I continued to follow it for a couple of minutes until I could no longer see it. I noticed several minutes later an airplane flying in approximately the same location where I last noticed the UFO.

A huge dark thing was floating sideways and up into the air.  I told the person on the phone, “oh that’s odd, kinda’ looks like a metallic balloon has been let go into the sky by someone.  And it did look like that, a grey/black sorta’ metallic looking with an occasional extremely bright light omitting periodically. Rationalizing that it is a balloon I let my attention stray. A few minutes pass and I look to the sky to see the progress of flight. To my surprise, the “balloon” is not where I thought it would be. In fact, it appears to be stationary and not as high as expected. Now it has my full attention. I watch as the dark mass with the bright light glided horizontally towards the North West of the valley. Watching in disbelief and curiosity, after a few minutes, I witness it angle and then turn back towards the SW, towards me. I am now talking to my mom on the phone (trying to direct her view to see what I am seeing), the unidentified flying object is now heading directly towards me. I am sure it was just my perception, but the object was flying then stopped, what seem to be directly over me and then began to hover. A full minute passed and I noticed the bright light was still as intense but the dark matter was dissipating. I realized the craft was now starting to ascend. Several moments passed as it continued to hover and rise. Then it slowly drifted towards the North East. My experience was over. I always believed, just too much credible information not to, I just never thought I would get the opportunity to experience such an anomaly with my own two eyes.

Object disappeared. I have never written anything like this before, but then again, I have never seen anything like this before. I'm a regular person with a regular job, this is not a hoax, and maybe it's not a real UFO-- I don't know WHAT it was, so I'm reporting it just in case because I can't explain it. I work with special needs children, and I was going to ""Family Movie Night"" at an elementary school in Natomas.  It started at 6pm and ended around 8:20.  After it ended (around 8:30) I was on the freeway back to downtown Sacramento, just past the Del Paso exit, when I saw something odd in the sky in the field to the left of the highway (a lot of Natomas is not developed yet.)  I thought it was an airplane at first, but it had a very brilliant blue light at the bottom.  The lighted up part looked rectangular, like a line of really bright, true blue lights.  I turned my head to watch it, and when I did I noticed it had a few other colored lights on it-- then I saw it move.  It was ! amazing!!  It did this really graceful swan dive, and then disappeared for a second.  Then it reappeared and maneuvered very quickly again.  It was almost a gliding motion, like a kite, except for it was way too high up and large to be a kite and I don't know of anyone who flies those things in vacant fields by the highway at 8:30.  I guess it's possible, but I really don't think it was any kind of kite, it just had that really swift graceful gliding motion, nothing like an airplane.  Plus, the lights kept switching on and off (when they were off it looked as if it disappeared, then reappeared when the lights went on), and it would hover, and then move very quickly.  I watched as long as I could, but I was driving, and then it disappeared before it was even out of my field of view.  I called my boyfriend right away (yep, I know, using my cell phone in the car) and he just thought it was funny, but I can't believe I actually saw something like that!  I think it may have been a real ! UFO, and that is just fascinating. I have no other explanation.  Again, I was heading from Natomas to Downtown Sacramento (on I-5 South) just past the Del Paso exit, and I saw this in the sky above a vacant field to the left of the highway.  I was in no way impaired at the time. It was pretty amazing!",2011-04-03T00:00:00,,

At first what I thought I was seeing a helicopter because it had three lights but then I noticed that there wasn't any flashing lights. So it caught my interest.  The object was hovering and then started to move to my right after I noticed that it wasn't a helicopter.  I was driving when I saw it so I just started following it.  I didn't think it would move very fast but it started going so fast that the lights vanished in under a minute.  While I was following one of the lights disappeared and then I could only see two lights. I believe it was because when I first spotted it I was seeing it from the side and as it moved I ended up behind the craft.   As I was following the craft, it seemed as if the whole thing turned over on it's back while it flown away from town.  The lights on the craft changed from being horizontal to each other to being vertical and back to horizontal just before moving beyond seeing distance.  Also, while I was following this first craft I s! aw my girlfriend that was in the car with me saw a different one.  They were both headed in the same direction.  The crafts was in the shape of a triangle but with rounded edges and it seemed to have a dark gray color to it.  The lights were located at each end of the triangle and were halfway from the top and the bottom of the craft.  The crafts also looked like they changed shape while turning over but they were too far to describe the shape it finally formed into.  Right after the little chase one of my headlights went out.  It most likely wasn't from the sightings but I'd just thought I'd add that because I thought it was weird for it to burn out after that.  Russellville has a lot of cops so I didn't drive over the speed limit chasing the crafts, I probably only drove around 40 mph at most.

I immediately put the game on “pause” and followed her upstairs to our bedroom to see what she was talking about.  As she led me to the window of our walk-in closet (which faces north), she was telling me that, with the window partially open, she started hearing a lot of the neighborhood dogs barking so she got up to look and see what was going on.  As she looked out the window she heard a “crackling sound” (like fireworks) and looking north-eastward she saw what appeared to be some strange type of orange “firework” rising from beyond the tree line trailing white sparks down to the ground.  The orange ball, after shedding the white sparks, then moved slowly across the sky.  At which point she ran down to get me so I could see it. As I approached the window, I observed this orange glow in the sky moving slowly in a northerly direction.  As I looked at it more closely, I noticed the single orange glow appeared to be three smaller orange lights hanging beneath something I could not make out and then thought it would be good to try and get a picture of whatever it was.  I ran downstairs, grabbed my camera but by the time I got outside, the glowing orange ball had vanished. After things calmed down a bit, my wife proceeded to call her parents to tell them what happened while I returned to finish the video game I had postponed. No sooner than a few minutes later my wife ran back down the stairs saying, “It’s happening again!” So, for the second time, she heard the “crackling”, looked out the closet window and saw another orange glow, trailing white sparks appear in almost the exact same location as before. This time, by the time I ran outside with my camera, I again only saw the orange glow as it moved north and vanished attempting to take a picture of it but I was unable to focus on it.  I decided that I would prepare my video camera in the event it happened again because the digital camera couldn’t seem to focus on the object.. And, sure enough, it did happen again; but this time, I got to see what my wife was trying to describe.  The orange glow was, indeed, trailing white sparks and there was the distinct sound of “fireworks” but what I noticed is that the sound was more of an electrical “pop”, than an explosive “pop”.  Also, the orange glow, once it shed its white sparks, did not burn out, fall back down or make any sound whatsoever as fireworks should do, this one also continued on a trajectory north as did the two prior orange balls which, again, slowly flew out of sight. (It should be noted that the wind was blowing from the west to the east, so these orange objects were flying in an angle, adjacent to the wind current.) Now, totally unsure of what I just saw I thought to myself, “if it happened three times, it can happen again” I loaded my video camera with fresh batteries, a blank tape, went outside and waited.  As I stood there with video in hand looking toward the north-east, expecting to hear the crackling and see the next odd-orange ball, I turned and looked west and was startled to see two orange balls, a great distance apart from each other, hovering in the night sky.  I quickly turned my camera on and tried to catch them on film they were very far apart and could not get them both in the frame and as I moved toward the back yard pointing the camera skyward and to the west, the orange glow lower to the horizon was already fading into the distance while the other, which was higher on the horizon, had already vanished. Frustrated, I began to make my way back around to the front of the house and as I turned the corner and stood in my driveway, I saw another orange glow over and passed my neighbor’s roof to the south moving north. This is the glow I caught on film for approximately 20 seconds. In the video, as it slowly moves north it appears to turn south slightly before it disappears. Before this is explained away as normal air traffic, I will say that there are planes that fly over all the time.  We may even be near an approach corridor for Midway; however, being very aware of what planes do look because they fly by all the time and are seen in the sky around my house to the point where you are very familiar with typical aircraft, these objects/lights were not typical aircraft.",2011-04-03T00:00:00,41.6,-87.9381

At approximately 10:30 p.m. (central time)we were looking to the south, south east, right above the tree line and suddenly a bright ball of yellow light appears, out of no where.  There were several airplanes (commercial jets) in the distance and the bright ball of light was much larger and brighter than those of the airplanes.  The airplane lights were blinking red and blue but the ball of light did not blink.  It appeared from the south west and quickly moved to the east before fading out and completely disappearing.  The ball of light simply faded out but not as if had gone so far in the distance that we could no longer see it.  It was more like watching a flash light fade from loss of battery power.  The ball of light was probably close to a mile away but no where near as high up in the sky as the airplanes.  My husband saw the ligh! t as well as my 9 year old daughter and our room mate.  The ball of light only appears for 5-7 seconds before fading away.   The object has appeared for the last 4 nights in a row.  The object always appears around 10:30 p.m. central time.  It generally appears in the south east, just above the tree line and moves eastward before disappearing.   Sometimes the object is higher in the sky than others and sometimes the object moves quicker than others.  We could hear NO sounds of helicopters or jet engines (and as you know, the sound of helicopter propellers and jet engines can be heard for miles away).    We (the witnesses) tried to come up with a logical explanation, but the light was like nothing any of us has ever seen before.  The area that the ball of light seems to be flying above is an extremely rural area.  The area has a lot of farm land, wooded areas and hills. On the third night that the ball of light was seen ( 6/1/2011),  the object appeared, out of no where at 10:26 p.m. central time, it hovered then flew to the east before fading then r! eturned approximately 45 minutes later from the south west.    The object appeared as it had the nights before only this time, instead of flying eastward above the tree line, it flew eastward then dipped down behind the tree line and faded away.  We could catch glimpses of the light as it flew behind the tree line through the trees, then it simply faded away and vanished.  The ball of light flies faster than a jet plane at a very high altitude, but not so fast that it looks like a streak of light. It is very startling.   We have caught the object on a digital camera twice, when zoomed in, the ball of light turns from yellowish to an orange/yellow color.  It is a very bright light but almost looks foggy or dull at the same time.It is very hard to explain.  As I said before,the light is much larger than that of the commercial planes you see in the sky.  In the second photo we captured, you can see the object and off to the right you can see the red blinking lights of an airplane.  You can clearly see the contrast between the two.  The ball of light is much more visible than the lights from the air plane.   We are completely baffled and somewhat disturbed from this sighting. We are hoping someone can give us some answers, or a logical explanation.  I got on the internet and looked up ufo sightings in Tennessee.  I found several video clips of the same thing that we are seeing.  One video clip was found on Youtube and it was recorded in Kingsport Tennessee.   We also found another video on Youtube, recorded over a Holiday Inn in Tennessee.  The only difference between what we are seeing and the objects captured on video is that the ball of light captured on the videos is hovering instead of flying.

I was on a visit to my cousin's house @ Mirpur, Dhaka.  The lights went out around 9 o clock (load-shedding).  Hoping for a tempting breeze, I went up to the terrace alone (5TH FLOOR).   As I was roaming around there, I noticed something strange up above.a clump of cloud seemed to be following me...I stopped a while to check it out. First,I thought  I was out of my mind; I even knocked my head, cleansed my eyes, looked it even more closely.  It was REAL!!  The so called ""clump of cloud""/UFO was hovering here & there DIAGONALLY, and sometimes in ZIG-ZAG patterns. I looked around thinking it was some kind of laser show or light projected by someone below.  But believe me,there wasn't. The whole colony was shrouded in black.  Some lights were teaming, but NO LIGHT SOURCE COULD HAVE REACHED THAT FAR!!   Actually,the ""UFO cloud"" was really faint.    Only if one moved his head a bit aside, then it could be seen flying across that path I told earlier... Strangely,the cloud had a some kind of a  light fluorescent green lining across its body, rather than a silvery one. After observing it for more than 20 mins, I was sure that I haven't lost my senses.  I even hailed my two hands at them, they stopped a while, looking straight at me, but then continued its moving or scanning I should say.... I called upon my cousin, and my little brother.  It scared the lights out of 'em.   Then came Dad, even some curious neighbors!  They were oblivious about it, despite being educated.  Dad was startled to see that UFO flying like that. He called the BSS (National News Agency) and informed about the sighting.  Suddenly, after around 30 mins or so, it vanished into thin air, as if it had finished its job of scanning our land.  It was gone.   We looked around everywhere, but in vain... Then again it appeared out of the blue, and disappeared into the dark shrouds of the clouds above. We were left startled.... **N.B- I was convinced that it wasn't a normal clump of cloud because it WAS FOLLOWING A SPECIFIC DIAGONAL PATH,STOPPING TO HOVER AT FREQUENT INTERVALS.  IT SEEMED AS IF IT WERE SCANNING THE LAND BELOW IT.IT WAS AROUND 800~900 FEET ABOVE US (BELOW AIRLINE TRACKS).  AIRCRAFTS WERE FLYING BUT THEY WERE TOO FAR FROM THE SOURCE TO AFFECT OUR SIGHT.  WE HAD A MOBILE CAMERA WITH US BACK  THEN BUT IT WAS TOO DIM TO TAKE A SNAP FROM SUCH A HEIGHT. (((NUFORC Note:  Correct date is 06/04/2011.

Remained for 20 min or more then vanished. I am a 38 year old male Mental Health Professional. I have never claimed to have seen a UFO, nor am I sure what exactly I saw last night.  I've come to this website to see if any other's witnessed what I saw or if there is some kind of reasonalble explanation.  While sitting in front of my home, I noticed a very bright white light whith a red hue low in the western sky.  At first I thought it was a low flying plane, as there is a small airport nearby.  But then I noticed it wasn't really moving. It was hard to determine if it was in our atmosphere or in space.  Then I began to think perhaps it was a very bright star or planet, but it just seemed too big for that and the red hue didn't make sense.  I couldn't really determine what it might be. I called to my wife and a visting friend who witnessed it as well. Star, plant, plane; they came to the same conclusion as me.  I called a neighbor and he and his family witnessed it as well. They had a pair of binoculars and ! indicated that it was round with a red hue.  They could not determine if it was in our atmosphere or not.  We watched it for about 15-20 minutes, and then it made an apparent wobble to the left and the white light disappeared.  You could then see a faint red twinkling hue in it's place.  At one point, about 3-4 min. following the bright light's disappearance, there was another flash or shimmer resembling the largewhite light that lasted about 2 seconds.  I watched the red twinkling hue for another 5-10 minutes before clouds moved in and obscured my view completely.  I live in North Asheville, and called a friend in South Asheville to see if he had noticed the light.  He, in fact, had noticed it while driving home, and had thought it to be an oddly large, bright planet.  He suggested that perhaps it was a large meteor.  I called the local paper shortly after to see if anyone else had reported it, but no one had at that time.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,35.58215752808989,-82.55326561797752

It then split into 2 falling “Fireworks” and continued to fall from the sky at a fast pace.  From the speed it was falling from the sky, I figured it was a meteorite.  All of a sudden both falling lights ran into each other and formed 1 falling “Firework”.  It then stopped and formed 5-6 steady lights that just stopped and stayed in one place.  The lights were not in a straight line.  I then started driving towards the objects in the sky.  It felt like I was getting closer to the objects and I thought I was about to see one of the lights up close but some trees got in the way.  By the time I got by the trees it was gone.

There is an Air force base around the area of where the lights where coming from.  From where I was at, at the time of the sighting, I'd say I was about 10 miles from the Air force base.  The steady lights that I saw were big.  It was not an airplane. I was so curious and so quick to pick up the phone that I don’t remember if I saw 5-6 or 7 lights.  Like I said I thought it was a meteorite at first and didn’t think I needed to video tape it.  And I thought that my mind was playing tricks on me after seeing that horrible movie Battle Los Angles.

They where approximately at 45 to 50 degrees from the horizon. At first I thought  they were meteors. However, I observed them for 35 to 45 seconds. 	  I used my binoculars to take a closer look. The light they emitted were the  color of road flares and were very bright. They would dim slightly and become bright again. The altitude appeared to be to high for a helicopter and was about the usual altitude that airplanes take when approaching an airport. I could see the light appeared to be located at the bottom of the craft and there were no navigation lights on the craft. I have seen fighter jets flying at night and these did not appear to be jets. They were traveling at a speed slightly faster than a commercial jet and maintained a straight course except for changing altitude. I lost sight of them due to ground obstructions.  Approximately 10 minutes passed and I observed one more object flare up and take a similar flight course to the previous 5. I observed this object for approximately 25 to 30 seconds until I lost sight of it due to ground obstructions and light pollution.

I immediately I saw the first object when I stepped out my door.

(The sky was cloudy, but it did not seem like the disappearance was due to clouds.)   As we were on the phone, as I was expressing my disappointment that the neighbor missed it, another came over the horizon and did exactly the same thing, disappearing at the same spot after blinking a couple times.  My neighbor did see this one, and all later objects.  In all, when we were on the phone, my neighbor saw four, I saw five total, spaced about two to three minutes apart.   Each came from the north, heading south south east.  Each one was round, and very bright orange.  There was no flashing.  They were approximately 40 degrees above the horizon to the east.  Each was identical, and about four to five times brighter than a planet, if not more.  When I first spotted each, it was moving very fast, but slowed down as it reached the exact same spot where each blinked and disappeared.    Each object had the same trajectory and speed before fading away.  I could attribute the slowing and disappearance to turning and heading directly east, but I thought it odd that each disappeared in exactly the same way despite being seen over at least 10 minutes when the cloud cover would have changed.  I did grab my binoculars to look at each one and could see no distinguishing features, just large, round,and bright orange.

She recalled hearing the noises of a party at neighbors located directly north of her property (See Fig. 1 and 5) (later determined to be about 1,178 feet distance) and, most importantly, a crowd-like cheer before each of the five lighted objects appeared.  She also recalled seeing the next morning (Saturday) a large, reddish balloon out in Puget Sound in front of her house that was still hovering several feet above the surface of the water but tethered to something that held it down. (See Fig. 6) She estimated that it was three or four feet in diameter and thought that it was a weather balloon. She also said the objects were about the angular size of 1/4th of her thumbnail (arm outstretched) which would be about the same width as a weather balloon would subtend.   It is my tentative conclusion that these identical noctural lights were, in fact, gas-filled (probably weather) balloons with an associated light source suspended below and launched during the party over about a ten (10) minute period of time or longer. At least five (5) balloons were launched. The property has tall fir trees on its southern sides (See Figs. 4 and 5). Any balloon would have to rise at a steep angle to miss hitting them. The party crowd may have cheered each time they saw a balloon make it over the tree line.  I speculate that one balloon came down in the water and was seen the next day by the witness.

Around 9:00 p.m., on Saturday May 28, 2011, my husband, granddaughter and I were having a wiener roast out in our field. My granddaughter had left to go back to the house to get something and while she was gone, I turned to speak to my husband and I noticed what appeared to be a ball of fire in the sky above the tree line height, past our field.  It came from the East and turned to head north.   I told my husband to look and then I heard my granddaughter yelling, ""What are those?""  And then we saw two more flying behind the first one.   It was a cloudy night and they were flying below the cloud cover (on line it said cloud cover was at 7000 ft.) and they were silent.  Within the next minute we observed 3 more.  They were on the same path as the previous ones.  I called 911 to report objects flying over Niangua and they transferred me to the Webster County Sheriff’s Dept.  I would say it was close to 10 minutes when 5 more flew over.  Another minute, maybe 2 minutes, 3 more objects flew over.  Then it was a little longer maybe three to four minutes and 3 more flew over. I left my husband and granddaughter watching while I went to the house to get the binoculars.  It took me maybe 5 minutes.  When I came out of the house, there looked to be 5 flying to the North.  My Husband and Granddaughter said there had been maybe 3 or 4 more. I called the KY3 News out of Springfield, MO and spoke with a Dave Snider; I also sent him the picture my Granddaughter had taken. We live in an area that seems to be a flight path and we see a lot of planes.  We also get to see planes with their landing lights on, preparing to land at the Springfield airport about 35 miles away.  These flying objects did not have landing lights on.   I am not a very good judge of size, but I would say they were maybe an eighth of the size of a full moon.  To me they looked like a ball of fire, slightly elongated.  Slightly.   The color was reddish-orange.  Not much different than the flames of our fire. Like I previously stated, they flew silent.  They had no apparent formation other than they all went the same direction and came from the same direction.

They began to circle around each other for a few minutes. As i drove along i looked to see if the lights could be emanated from the ground.  They were so high up, and the area so rural it seem! ed difficult if not impossible, for these lights to be shining from the ground.  There was not a light trail that would indicate they came from the ground (such as a laser or spot light).

I presumed it was an intersection camera in front of me but when I went through the intersection there wasn’t a camera, I thought it may have been a security light I drove by coming on and didn’t think twice. At approximately 11:30 pm my friend and I were standing outside of the yogurt shop (BTO) that had closed at 11:00 pm talking.  I was facing south; he was facing north when I saw the white flash again, very evidently from the sky this time.  It lit up the entire sky instantaneously without a trail or identifiable direction.  It was brightest in a streak however that had a southwest by northeast direction.  Like the gradients you see in PowerPoint  presentations, it was brightest down the middle and slightly darker along the edges ( the horizon). My friend, a pilot, said, ""What the hell was that?""  I was stunned he saw it also because it was so quick and he was facing the opposite direction.  It was faster than a camera flash, without the residual blinding effect.  I said, ""You saw it to?!,"" and he also said he lit up the whole sky. There were no discernable aircraft, no discernable sounds, no trails or residual proof and this was located north of Davis-Monthan Airforce Base.  There were no clouds visible in the area as all the stars were clearly shining.

As we watched, the object has flickering lights with blue, green, white, red and the object was seen hovering.  At first we thought that it was a helicopter.  Then we took out our binoculars and digital camera.  Viewing with the binoculars, the lights were colourful, blue, red, green and white and the object was hovering.

I'm really unsure what I saw.  I was looking to the south on the ridge line just before dark, I seen what appeared to be a large plane moving slowley to the east along the ridge line flying very low at a best guess I would say maybe 500 feet above ridge line.  It had five large lights spaced along the front of the craft. I thought at first it was a military craft, but I have never seen one like it.  It moved along the ridge line and appeared to be about a 2 football lenghts so somewhere around 500-600 yards long.  It was absoutley silent not sound of engines at all.   I called my wife and told her what I was seeing.  I watched it for about 3 minutes then the craft changed course and started heading due south.  I could no longer see any lights just the back mass of the object.  At this point I would guess it to be about 1 mile maybe a mile and a half away.   I ran to my truck and grabbed my binoculars darkness started to set in, I looked at the object through my binoc's and at this point could only make out lights like a amber or yellowish hugh and could no longer see the craft.  What made me feel that what I saw wasn't a plane was one no sound, and just at dark five fast moving jets raced across the sky from the direction of the my last spotting of ther craft.  I could easly tell that those were planes and I could see the strobing lights along the wings of the jets.   They moved from one side to the other side of the horizon in about 10 seconds and then everything was over. I can not beleive that something of that size and unusualness was not seen by other residents in the community.  The craft appeared at Nickle mountian and  moved along the ridge line due east.  This is an old nickle mine called Hand and Nickel.  Which is now owned by Green Diamond and is where I work and was able to see what ever it was I saw.  It is not possible for me to see a craft that close and not hear the sound of it, I have looked all over the internet for a craft similar to what I had saw but as of yet I haven't found one. I guess best description it was rectangular very long it hade five large lights evenly spaced alonf the front bottom of craft.  The aft of the craft was very unusual as the plane headed due south I could make out aft it was very large and its mass shape was not cylinder but rather more like  2 tear drop shapes. This is the first time I have ever seen anything that I could not explain away.  I have never really bought into the whole UFO sighting.  I am still unsure of what I saw and would hope that it be easy explained away.  I doubt it.  I feel I am a person of good intuition and intellagent enough to know the differance from a plane, Chinook, gunship, jet, or blimp.  It was none of these.",2011-05-12T00:00:00,42.9196,-123.4388

At first we thought it was lightening strikes but I realized that the flashes were not from the sky to the ground but in fact were coming from the ground and shining into the sky. As we drove north along Hiway 29, it actually goes up hill somewhat, so as we gained altitude we could see that the lights were actually coming from behind the foothills, behind the town of Nice along Hiway 20. The lights did not seem to flash with any regularity or pattern but seemed to be very random and the intensity would shift, as if the direction of the craft emitting them was changing angles or manipulating the lights in some sort of search pattern.  There are no roads along the ridge that the lights were traveling; this area is far to steep and jagged for any wheeled vehicles to have traversed so easily and as quickly as we saw the lights moving. The lights continued as we arrived at home in Nice.  At this point we got out of the vehicle and walked to the front of our property and we saw the lights flash several times more.  We wanted to see them but we also were attempting to listen for any noises, like a possible rotary blade ""whooping"" sound, you would expect to hear from helicopters.   We saw the lights but heard nothing. My son spoke with some of his friends the next day and several others from Lakeport to Upper Lake to Nice, all saw the lights but heard no noise.    This is a very rural area with only small towns (the entire county of Lake has just over 62,000 population) and the entire northern area of the county is like a big bowl, so sounds and noise travel easily over a great distances.

It's size and shape seemed to change as it moved around. It is in the general direction of where the sun goes down and just over a bit which would be in the northwest of me from where I am standing looking at it.  My husband and I drove up the rural road and on up to the main highway in that direction this morning to see if there might be a tower anywhere in the area of where I saw it both nights to explain why it was always in the same area the whole time and red.

I turned off all lights inside and outside the house to make sure that what I saw and am seeing again tonight is not a reflection on the (crank-open-outward-type) window (screen located inside) of something lit up inside or outside that could be causing it.  This moving, glowing object I'm seeing at least 5 miles away(?) is fluctuating from what looks like to be treetop level to higher.  I am certain that the red ufo is in fact there in the night sky and is moving around in a darting manner as if searching for something. I feel anxious and cannot go to bed.

I noticed also that it will stop abruptly, stay still for a second and disappear for an instant, reappearing in a different spot very nearby where I last saw it.  It keeps doing this back and forth, up and down in no orderly manner.   I also saw a smaller ufo of the same description over to the left of it higher up and flitting about in the same manner. Hard to judge how far away it was from the other but if I was to hold my arm across in front of my face bent from the elbow looking out at them, it would be that length apart. When I lived at another town nearby in 2008 I saw a similar ufo around the same time of night, hovering, but was a white color, with a faint, unsteady red glow.  On the first night I kept watching for over an hour from midnight onward until it suddenly dropped straight down behind a small mountain where a red glow emminated upwards and all around the whole area where it went down.  The reddish glow was fainter but still visible at dawn the next morning when my husband and I both saw it from our sixth floor balcony. The second night, the white starlike ufo did the same thing, just hovered at the same time of night for over an hour, to my recollection, and then it just suddenly, like a light being turned out,,,,disappeared into thin air.  I did not see it again after those two nights. Again, I was the only one who witnessed it the both nights. I would like to add that the area where the ufo sitings took place in 2008 are very concentrated with uranium mines which are no longer active. My present sitings are located about 35 miles southeast of there. It's now 01:15 hr Tuesday morning, the larger, brighter one is still there.  I am retiring for the night and will look again tomorrow night to see if any have returned.",2011-05-12T00:00:00,46.2,-82.0833

(I have a ruler for this, as I do look at the night sky). At first, saw it with 7 X 26 binoculars while watching planes, birds and the moon.  Then it could be spotted by eye, once I knew where it was, as it had lots of brilliance (white, not metallic - much brighter than the moon).  It was definitely round.  At times the brilliance seemed to change somewhat but that might have been an illusion. I went to get my Celestron SkyMaster 25 X 100 binoculars, and although it was handheld, the view was quite striking. At the time, my wife was in the kitchen, and I went to tell her to come and see - she did see it also, through the 7 X 26 binoculars, after she was told to go “from the moon, then up and slightly yo the left”.  She told me that I needed the tripod, and I showed her the 25 X 100 binoc. and the camera which I also had by then. Photo takes with (cheap) camera - Sony (5.1 Megapixels) DSC-P93A, zooming ~12X. Near the end of the sighting, I had again switched to the 7 X 26 binoculars, and suddenly, it got smaller, zigzagged very fast, became a dot (still zigzagging at that point!) and disappeared.  I kept looking, as if it was a balloon, the fabric could perhaps be spotted, but I couldn’t see it coming down. Please, if you know what happens when a balloon reached a high altitude and blows up, please let me know. Sorry, a few years ago I saw something and regrettably failed to report, so this time, an effort is being made. I am working on a tripod with screw drive mechanism to go up and down, etc., but it was not yet ready today - otherwise, there would be a fair photo, with the camera through the 25 X 100 binoculars.",2011-05-12T00:00:00,50.24746564885496,-119.27319236641222

Well it was pretty hazy/cloudy up in the sky, with clouds rolling in from the West.  These were the type of Clouds that are very ripply, the ones that have been reported as Haarp Generated.  Although it was some what cloudy I could still se stars.   After awhile of gazing, all of a sudden two dim orange objects drifted over my head, going from North to South.  They looked to be in the clouds or above them because they were pretty blurry.  They were probably about 300 feet apart.  (It’s hard to tell being on the ground but that would be my guess)  They were both traveling at the very same speed, which was faster than your normal airplane or jet.  They had no blinking lights and no noise.  One of the Orbs seemed to be rocking back and forth coming closer to the other and then back away.  They did not take off super fast and disappear like most UFO sightings, they just kept on drifting by at a steady speed until I could no longer see them.",2011-05-12T00:00:00,,

Please note that this is NOT a real photo but was drawn immediately after the sighting while my memory was very fresh. At 11:40pm I stepped out on my rooftop deck for a breath of air and to take in the view before bed. The deck faces south and offers a panoramic view of Seattle.  As I am located about a half mile from downtown, the glow of the city lights gave a subtle pinkish hue to the few scattered clouds in the sky.  There was no moon or wind of any kind, nor any sound except the faint drone of city traffic.    As my gaze drifted to the 40 degree Southwestern area of the sky I suddenly noticed a v-shaped squadron of about 8-10 pale whitish objects rapidly emerge from behind a cloud.  They were flying toward the Northeast at a very high rate of speed for their apparent very high altitude.  They caught my attention due to the oddly pale appearance, great speed and lack of any marking lights or sound.  It was hard to tell whether they were self-illuminated or merely reflecting the glow of the city lights as they were so pale.  The squadron was about the size of my index and middle fingers held at arm's length, from the tips to the knuckle.  The point of the V was at the prevailing tip of the formation. After about 10 seconds it reached the 90 degree position, so I turned to continue watching.  At this point I noticed that there were two additional objects of the same color, size and brightness off to the right of the formation.  These two objects were very close together and kept a perfect pace with the ""main v"", and were the distance of roughly five ""squadrons"" away.  At about 140 degrees northeast the objects became obscured by a cloud and I lost track of them as they were already getting very far away anyhow.  The time from the start of the sighting until the end was about 30 seconds. The flight path was perfectly straight and unwavering.  At no time did any of the objects deviate in position at all from the others, which indicated that possibly this could have been one gigantic triangle rather than separate objects.   At the exact moment that the formation disappeared, a passenger jet and small private plane came into view lower in the same section of the sky.  It was instantly obvious that the formation wasn't conventional aircraft because the jet and plane had all the usual lights and obvious sounds coming from them, and they were far brighter and more yellowish in color than the pale and dim white hue of the formation.",2011-05-02T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

From the passenger seat of our SUV, my wife observed an object in the sky, she called my attention to it, as I drove at about 20-25 mph through city streets near our home.  What we saw was a very shiny, reflective, silver, metallic, mostly spherical object, with a somewhat smaller, delta shaped lower section at its base.  It appeared in plain sight, its skin and contours sleek.   The object was to our east, alternately moving through the sky from north to south and hovering.  We remarked to each other that this was nothing like the planes we often see in our neighborhood, which is on the local international airport flightpath.  It also did not look like a weather balloon or anything like a balloon.   The weather was clear and there were few if any clouds and no obstructions to our field of view. The object was moving at less than 1000 feet over the horizon, and its widest, its size was probably about 10-15 feet.   I happened to have a camera in my vehicle, I reached to grab it so I could take pictures, we both turned away for a moment, but the object had disappeared as we turned to look at it again.   The object's altitude was high enough that if it had been a conventional plane, we would have still seen it moving, either descending or ascending over the horizon, as any other plane that flew to or away from the airport. Moments later, looking out to the sky in the southwest, still in our general vicinity, we observed what appeared to be a delta shaped, bottom side of a flying aircraft, maybe a military fighter jet.  The color of the bottom side of the craft was dark or perhaps black and the craft was moving fast at about the same altitude, moving from east to west and appeared to be banking sharply away to the south, in the direction of the international airport.

As I was gazing at the sky, I noticed a string of about 3-4 bright amber lights in what looked like a line formation moving toward us from the west in a northeasterly direction.   I thought the lights looked strange, so I focused on them and noticed several more of these lights coming up behind the others from over a mountain to the west.  I then pointed them out to the others and we all became very excited and inquisitive wondering what they could be.   For the next 10-15 minutes or so, it seemed like an endless stream of lights coming one behind the other.  As they came closer to the east, we listened to hear if maybe they were Air Force jets, but we could hear absolutely nothing.  I’m estimating that there were upwards to 19 or so lights that we counted over a period of about 10-15 minutes.   Everyone agreed that these lights looked odd and didn’t appear to be aircraft we had ever seen before, especially since they were amber colored and had no white or red lights on them that we could see.   As we continued to watch, the lights seemed to change direction and began to head southwest until we could no longer see them.   I turned on the TV hoping to hear something about these strange lights, but I never did.   Were these aircraft from Luke Air Force base or were they something else entirely.

I would not normally report something like this, but on 2/15/11 (two days prior) while traveling westbound on I-40 near Seligman, AZ, a different coworker and I observed the same light formation at approximately 2300 hours MT.  This was the same exact amber cluster, but very low in the sky (probably 5 degrees on the horizon), and seemingly farther away to the west towards Kingman, AZ.  It was only seen one time for approximately 10 seconds total. My initial assumption was a military exercises of some sort, but after the second closer observation, I'm not as sure now.

I had been their most of the night and decided to wait and watch the sunrise. I was starring off into the Gulf when a moving light caught my eye to my right. I looked to see what appeared to be 3 bulbs of rust red light shaped like a large triangle moving at a slow but cruising speed around 400 or so feet above the water. The object was no more than 200 feet out off the beach and made no sound. As the object passed by I could not see any body or frame inside the triangle but it seemed to be 1 object. As the object passed the rust red lights dimmed and then faded away into darkness. It was very strange because the object was still pretty close and it just faded away! As I witnessed this event I knew I was seeing something extraordinary and took in as much as I could. After this happened I sat in amaze! ment and realized I had just witnessed a UFO. The whole experience was about 45 seconds and it was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. I served in the Air force and have been around aircraft, this was not one of ours. As for Air Plane headlights, I know these were not from a plane. It was close, flying low and cruising just off the coast in front of me.

It was not like a big object, just these balls of orange, bright fire balls, not perfectly round.

I noticed up ahead some red lights that I had never seen there before and I travel this road quite often.  At first I thought it was a cell phone tower . But something didn’t seem right about it.  There were two red lights together  to the east over a field.  But as I approached I realized a v formation of lights off over the hwy. as well.  With the point of the v facing west. so it couldn’t be a tower.  It had been over the hwy. the whole time as I was approaching,  it seemed to be hovering.  I pulled off onto the shoulder  and stopped the car. I watched the lights pass in front of me from east to west.  It was dark and very cloudy and  I thought they were separate lights but then noticed some connection between them, so it must have been lights on the bottom of a triangle shaped craft.   The lights were red and solid. Above the red lights were smaller lights either white or light colored. These lights were either flashing or spinning above the red ones.  I rolled my window down to  hear the sound , but there was total silence. The craft must have been between 150-200 ft. above, I could see it’s size fairly well. I’m not good at judging  distance in the sky , so this is only a guess and could be way off. But it was close not way off in the distance. Once the craft crossed the hwy.  It just vanished !!  I thought it might be hidden in the clouds and kept watching to see if it would reappear in the breaks of the clouds  but it was gone  like it never existed.  Another car coming from the opposite direction had pulled over as well and watched as  this craft traveled across the hwy.  I drove down the street a bit, turned around and came back to see if maybe it was still up there somewhere and the other car did the same thing. I did not approach the other car because  I was alone and I’m a woman and it’s night and not much around. The following sat. night I was visiting my friend in Watson  two miles exactly from where I had seen this craft a week earlier. We were sitting inside and the power flickered. I looked at the clock. It was 8 pm. The exact time I saw the craft last week. I later learned that almost all of Watson had a black out. A transformer went out. There were no storms. Who knows, maybe it was caused by this craft. Maybe it was still out there. I reported this to the newspaper but they said they had a policy now that they can’t publish  articles on ufo”s anymore.

I did have binoculars, but could only make out a bright orb.  It moved directly over me as it was performing a wide arcing turn.

I am a Jet Engine Mechanic/Aircraft Supervisor.  I have been in the trade for 12 years.  I’ve worked 15 different model/makes of engines on over 20 different aircraft platforms.  I’ve grown up in a family of aviators.  I have lived in houses since my teens directly in conventional aircraft flight patterns.  I know what an airplane, jet, or turboprop sounds, and more importantly looks like. Around 1730 on the 24th of January 2011 I was standing on my back patio grilling pork chops.  The sky was clear.  The sun was just starting to go down.  We still had blue skies when I began to hear a very deep rumble of a jet engine.  C-130 aircraft are commonly flying over head so it was refreshing to hear a jet engine.  I have watched hundreds of aircraft take off from the EOR (End of Runway).  When I casually looked up curious as to what was there, I did a double take because I didn’t see anything?  I remember asking myself where is it.  It’s not that high based on the clarity of the sound.  I know how the sound of jets can creep up on you when they’re in the air, and by the time you hear it it’s gone.  This was right above me.  After about ten seconds of looking, suddenly right above me, two very bright amber/orange lights came on.  They were easily a few hundred yards apart.  I know what an afterburner (ab) looks like when lit and these were not afterburners, and there! was no sound progression to go with the transition from mil power to ab.  As I watched this slowly move north toward Rosamond CA a third light directly in between, but slightly forward of the two came on, and it was amber as well.  This made a slight triangle shape. I knew what I was watching was something different so I called for my wife who was in the house to come look.  The craft was no longer directly over head as it was moving away from us.  She wondered what it was and referred to the formation of lights as Orion’s Belt.  That’s about the right description. I was waiting for some movement vertical or horizontal showing separation, but nothing occurred.  Then each light began going off to the point all three lights were gone at one time, and the sound was still there.  Then one by one each light came back on and then in between the left and center lights two very fast silver lights flashed two or three times and went away.  To me they resembled a light showing formation of the aircraft.  It was too far away to tell if it silhouetted the craft.  From my perspective they were just between the center and left light.  They never came back on while the three amber lights remained visible.  All together I watched this craft move maybe 20 miles in about 10 min until I lost sight due to my neighbor’s house obstructing it.  I will say during the entire ordeal even after losing sight the sound remained constant.  It was a very deep rumble.  It moved very slowly. I live in a newly built residential neighborhood that doesn’t have a single tree taller than 15ft.  I live near Edwards AFB and waited to see if anything may be flying with it?  I didn’t see any recognizable aircraft come to view.   Nobody was outside lighting off any fireworks or flares.  I am truly perplexed as to what it was that passed over my house?  The whole time I was asking myself is anybody else seeing this.  There had to be?  It was still day light and the weather very nice.  I’ve never reported a UFO of any kind, and kept telling my wife I want to see if anybody else is reporting something?  I only wish I would have run in the house and grabbed a camera instead of being awestruck.

I'm not aware of any radio towers that tall or big.  It was quite large with the base and 3 spirest was big, probably the sized of a small house (800 - 1200 sq ft) base with 3 long spires sticking out the top (sorta like the San Francisco radio tower).  The spires where about the length of an interstate light pole with other things hanging off of it. It was dark grey like a titanium wedding ring color.  I saw from the time it came to view in the front of the window then I leaned forward! and watched it until we went into new cloud bank. It wasn't moving so it was like flying by a building 15 - 30 seconds.  A few people looked  concerned/confused on the plane and I should have stopped and asked the pilot but in all honesty I was a little bit worried about asking around.  I can assure you it was not an illusion or reflection, it was solid as a rock and not obscured.  It was just like staring at a building as you fly by.  There were no flashing lights or anything like that.  I did try and take a picture but my phone didn't boot in time.",2011-01-31T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

It moved at a very fast speed I would considering the distance it covered in the short time it was illuminated, it covered at least 60-90 degrees of the sky in a matter of 5s and like going behind an invisible wall it vanished. Now I will consider that its relative traveling direction was E-SEish from my apartment complex where in relation to an airport just south of me does have heavy air traffic, however having seen hundreds of planes in the night sky travel over my head this was not the normal.  On the contrary no plane at night turns their lights off especially on approach to land.  Besides every plane makes a noise and this was silent making no noise. Having witnessed multiple ""shooting stars"" I can also say that this was definitely not that either.  It was simply too bright, in my example its as if the lights just went out, like turning a light bulb off w/o the afterglow effect, or nothing like the dwindling light of a ""shooting star"".

The stars were visible, notably Orion, which I was looking at while facing East.    At 1911 hours I noticed movement to the left in my peripheral vision.  I was surprised to see a pitch black object moving swiftly from North to South across my field of vision, passing just below the constellation Orion.  While the object was directly in front of me it appeared as an isosceles triangle, the length being approximately twice the width, with the point at the front.  It was angled slightly away from me, consistent with the object's ""wingspan"" being parallel to the ground and me observing it from underneath from the West.  The object disappeared quickly into the haze as it departed to the South. I estimate the duration of the sighting as 1, not more than 2 seconds.  There were no lights on the object, it was completely black against the slightly orange cast of the sky.  The edges seemed very sharp while it was directly in front of me, but it was more vague as it approached and departed.  There were numerous airliners and general aviation aircraft visible at the time which were clearly audible.  I heard no sound that could be attributed to the passing of the object.

I took my flashlight and my dog to look around; not seeing anything I stayed out in the cold fresh air for a bit, looking at the stars.   At 7:40pm I heard the unmistakable deep rumble of the same craft that visited my town last year at almost the exact same day and time.  I kept looking up until I spotted this single pulsating red light flying SE to NW, which is opposite the flight pattern of planes flying into the airport.  This direction is the same flight direction these craft took last year, but last year they flew just over the roof tops of houses where I did at that time get a good look at them...they were NOT conventional jets.  The craft I saw tonight, with the same deep rumble/roar, much louder than a conventional jet, were merely a red pulsing light each.  The first craft, flying at about 10,000 feet I would guess, flew at about the same speed as a jet!   However, there was no conventional flying lights, just the single pulsing red light.   After the first went over, about 4 minutes later, two more came over, flying at the same speed and altitude and direction as the first, one in back of the other, with the same deep rumbling roar.  The loud roar lasted well after the craft had flown over my house and headed NW.  These were NOT conventional jets, in spite of the cover story on local TV news last year to quell the public's alarm.  They were not F-16s as reported.  Even the news man reporting was noticeably nervous and quick in his dialogue when reporting live on Channel 10 TV last year.  Obviously, somebody told whoever or whatever is flying these things to stay higher up in the sky and not do acrobatic moves a few hundred feet over peoples' houses.

I first assumed it was another airliner, but immediately realized it was flying at a much greater velocity than any of the other aircraft. I have observed supersonic aircraft in flight.  This object appeared to be going every bit as fast, but there was no sonic boom, and no contrail to indicate an exhaust. It followed a straight line on a south to north track, with a slight west to east angle.  I would guess the arc it traversed was about 15 degrees in length.  I seemed to be gaining altitue, though I cannot be certain of this.  It certainly did not appear to be losing altitude.  It simply faded into the clear, blue sky.  I got the sense that this object was at a higher altitude than the other nearby craft, but I had no means of veryfying that. I frequently observe passing satellites.  This object was initially every bit as bright as the ISS on a dark night, but I have never seen the space station (or any other satellite) as brightly visible during the full light of day, as this object was.  Nor have a seen a satellite follow that path, even if it was in a polar orbit. It also seemed to be moving faster than satellites do, when observed from the ground, and I believe it was accelerating, but I cannot be certain. I have previously seen a large meteor falling toward earth, and briefly thought it was an aircraft on fire, but this object did not resemble that.  It did not have a tail, nor did it flare or disintegrate. I am a United Methodist minister in the community with a lifelong interest in aircraft and spaceflight.

Ok, I was looking from my bedroom window toward our back yard (northeast towards the tinley park, il) and right above the tree line I could see three lights.  The lights were in a line and then moved to a triangle formation.  They were in teardrop shape and white, may be yellow in color.     We have seen this once before and we reported this last year as well.  I didn't drive to see what exactly it was  this time because when we did drive to see it last year, we could never reach it and then our very new van started making weird sounds like it was going to break down.  When I say we could never reach the sight, I mean those lights were moving faster than we could get to it.  I have never seen anything like it and where we thought the lights were at, there is farm land only.     I hope that explains more of what I saw.

I didn't think much of it until I noticed that it had no visible wings and didn't appear to be moving. I know when you fly in the same direction as a plane it can appear that it isn't moving, but after we made a few turns, we realized it wasn't moving like a plane.  It left no contrail, and it was a perfectly clear, dry Spring day at dusk. I pointed it out to my husband who began watching it as he drove along.  After a minute of us both watching, the object slowly disappeared, as if someone turned down it's brightness, versus it turning in a different direction, or flying off into the distance.  It didn't get smaller, it just uniformly faded. My husband was witness to this event.  We have a major air force base here in town, so I'm not going to assume it was extra-terrestrial, but I've never seen an airplane do that, commercial or otherwise. I suppose you could say it was cigar or cylinder shaped, but in a way it almost looked like a Zeppelin.  It was hard to tell cause as I said, it was at a high altitude.  But as I also said, it really didn't look like or act like a commercial airliner.  It was either white or silver, also hard to tell cause it could have been reflecting (or I suppose even putting off) light.

As i looked up i seen a light to my left, it went from left to right across the sky, (which would of took a plane about 2 minutes to cross) in this case it flew at incredible speed and took 5-6 seconds and in a very straight line.  This was a vast piece of sky and by the time i called my wife who was 10 meters away to confirm this sighting, it had gone.   It was a bright light with no flashing lights.  It was a size of about 20 stars together and the light was pulsating.  It never made a sound as it passed across the sky.  This light was in our lower sky and not in space.",2011-04-03T00:00:00,,

There was an Airshow going on at the Santa Rosa Charles Shultz Airport and as my girlfriend and I were walking out of walmart we were looking in the sky towards the west direction watching a jet in the sky.  Once it was out of sight we got into the car and proceeded to drive home.   Before getting on the freeway heading west on Shiloh road in Windsor Ca, myself and one passenger in my car both witnessed a very strange craft in the sky about 1000 feet ahead of us.  It was flying really low, maybe 100 to 200 feet max. above the road.  It was a cylinder object with a fan looking propeller device at the back end of it. Instead of a propeller on the front of it like a normal looking plane.  It was a bright silver, almost white looking color. It looked to be about 20 or 30 feet long by 10 to 15 feet wide-(about ! the size of a personal 1 to 2 man plane)    Like I said there was an airshow going on so I was kind of looking towards the sky when it happened, and so when I saw it I thought to myself am I really seeing this?- what is this thing flying so low and it seemed to be moving at a good speed but I could see it so clearly.  And as I thought that my friend riding in the passenger seat yelled out ""look at that!"" and we were both in such awe because we think we just a ufo.  It was wierd it looked like something that would'nt even be able to fly.  I had her describe to me what she saw and she explained it the same as me.

I just happened to look up at an aircraft that was heading south (I presume coming from Vandenberg due to its low altitude) and saw the object pass over it.  Round, white but not reflective, no noise and at first I thought it might be a parachute from the aircraft.  But after a few seconds it was obvious it was not an aircraft.  From when I saw it to when it was out of view was between 1 and 1.5 minutes.  My niece was outside at the same moment and she saw it too.  There are storms coming in from the north-west and the wind is also swirling so any balloon or something like that should not have traveled in a straight line.

On this day, the 21st of August, 2010, I and three other people witnessed a formation of between 3 and five bright objects in the sky over Basel, Switzerland. I made the initial sighting while walking my neighbour's dog in the park behind my house, seeing 4 intensely bright white objects high in the sky to the south of my location.  Initially I dismissed the objects as airplanes as Switzerland lying at the crossroads of Europe sees lots of air traffic.   My initial assessment was deemed incorrect on the basis of other aircraft moving across the sky at altitudes that made it clear that they were indeed aircraft (shape, contrails, speed of movement).  The four objects remained almost motionless, until I witnessed a smaller and less bright object break or drop away from one of the objects.   At this point (after five minutes of viewing) I determined it necessary to gather other witnesses.  I went into my house and asked my girlfriend to come outside with me, and to bring a camera.   When we returned outside, the 4 objects were now 3 and we watched them for approximately 10 more minutes before going inside to look for another camera with! a telephoto lens.   The objects moved slowly, and were hard to see against the brightness of the clear summer sky, often fading into the blue back ground and then returning with intensity in a new location making it difficult to judge their exact location.  The objects moved closer to each other over time, one after the other, never at the same time.   I stopped two other passing strangers to confirm that they could also see the objects, which after a moment of searching (again, bright white objects on a bright blue sky) they found and confirmed.   At this point my girlfriend and myself went inside to look for my camera and telephoto lens.  Upon returning outside the objects had vanished.

It is a very small airport that does not handle large aircraft or carrier lines. At roughly 9:45pm CST my wife and I were in our front yard.  We were walking past the front of our house passing south when we saw two odd shapes in the sky, quickly followed by one, then another. My best description is that all four shapes were identical, and looked like fireballs, each of which cast a tail of radiation in its wake that made each object look vaguely like a glove with the fireball at the palm and the fingers (four or five) trailing in the wake (my wife saw something very similar, but not in as much detail).  They were orange-yellow, about the shade of fire you'd see from a campfire. I have no way of gauging their size nor distance from the earth's surface, except to say that 5 or 6 of them grouped together would have been enough to blot out the moon from our view. We initially saw one of the shapes moving directly overhead, due south.  Then another shape seemed to appear directly overhead (or simply fly into our field of vision), then another.  At around the same time we observed the third shape overhead, we realized there was another such shape further off in the southern sky. All four shapes continued rapidly due south until they disappeared from our sight.  They did not disappear over a horizon, nor were they obstructed by trees or buildings, but rather they seemed to fly straight off into the sky until they became too small to see. We initially thought they may be skydivers, but couldn't explain the intense fire.  We also thought they might be hot air balloons, but we both concluded they were moving fast enough that we couldn't hope to catch them in our truck, even if we drove rapidly in a straight line after them.  We heard no sound from them whatsoever.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,41.3926,-88.4455

There was a white light that was blinking fast, and a red light on the rear that appeared to be moving back and forth, I could not hear any sound at all.  I did not observe this through the telescope because of how fast it was moving, and i should also mention the telescope is very heavy, so it is difficult to move it around.

Thinking this odd, but cool, I was amazed when it reappeared in the same location but this time it looked, upon closer inspection to be a huge flock of white birds.  I soon realized that it couldn't possibly be birds as the bird-like objects were giving off a metallic shine, appeared stuck into a shape, were not moving independently and the thing suddenly disappeared again.   I pulled over on the side of the road and parked my car so as not to wreck.  The object reappeared again and this time I was able to see that connecting the hundreds of bird-like shapes, was an almost invisible tear-drop or triangular shaped substance which appeared to be moving and reflecting the sun.  It reminded me of items placed in clear jello or glued to celophane.  Understand that this was not a flock of birds in the traditional V shaped formation.  This was a flock of hundreds of bird or boomorang shaped objects forming a white tear-drop, which suddenly appeared in a clear sky, disappeared then reappeared and disappeared again.

As best as I can, will explain this most definetely odd occurrence.  A friend took me over to his camper located at near Gabaladon & Silva Rd.  At first,what he told me to look at, I took to be a star which was about the size of a head on a ten penny nail.  He next told me to look at it through binoculars.  I did this and this ""star"" was blinking red & blue or green (don't recall if it was blue or green) which stars do not do that I am aware of.  Next he said to look a little below that & I saw what I thought was just a small airplane.  It was blinking red & blue/green.  I watched it circle & land, I guess, as it went out of sight.   Before it landed, I saw an area light up bright for a few seconds. This landing I estimate to be about 2 miles away.   As this object came in to land I saw a motor vehicle going into the ""landing area, & soon coming back.""   This same occurrence happened 3 times before my friend took me home.  He said it goes on every night all night. THERE ARE NO AIRPORTS IN THIS AREA.   This is why whatever is happening is ODD.   From Silva Rd., Belen, NM, I was looking East & slightly North. There are no airports there.  There are 2 airports way south of Silva Rd. named Skywagon, & Burris Ranch.

I got here on the 14th of March and have stayed until the 18th.  Every single night I have witnessed blinking lights outside of my condo, La Finestera.   Every night more UFOs appear and some disappear.  The first night my boyfriend and I witnessed a UFO over the Pacific ocean, which according to the locals has been there for a long time.  This UFO has remained in the same geographic location since I have been in Cabo San Lucas.  The first UFO I noticed was stationary for a while, then we noticed the UFO making circles, sharp 90 degree turns and many other erradic patterns.  This UFO attracted my attention and the attention of other people staying in these condominiums.  It was blinking many colors including purple, red, green, blue, and orange as if it were communicating with the other UFOs in the area.  Initially we only noticed the one over th! e ocean, but over the other nights we have stayed here we have witnessed as many as 7 at a time.  It is still unknown to us if these are satelites, but after the research I have done I have concluded that satelites do not blink colors and are slow moving, which means they do not stay in the same place every night.  These UFOs appear and disappear in the same geographic location every night.  I do not have the utilities necessary such as binoculars or telescopes while on vacation to view these blinking lights.  At first they appear to be the brightest stars in the sky, but after further evaluation you can tell that these are not stars and they are not man made.  There have been clear skies during every viewing of these UFOs.  The shapes cannot be determined by looking at the lights since they are viewed in the night sky, but they are so bright that they are easily seen.  Any information about satelites in this area are of high interest.

They were traveling in a group similar to a school of fish. They weren’t changing directions like fish.  They were just scattered within a group like fish. They made no noise and appeared to be around the altitude you would see a plane.  They were slowly and steadily traveling East to West and were not ascending or descending.  The only movement was horizontal. The lights were steady and did not flicker or flash. We watched this spectacle for several minutes.  When the group of lights had almost passed out of sight, we noticed 2 more balls of blue light traveling in the same direction.  These 2 blue balls of light were traveling faster as if to catch up with the first group.  They quickly traveled out of sight. No one had a camera with them, only cell phones.  Unfortunately, the pictures taken with cell phones did not turn out good. As a side note, we had a Super Moon that night. However, it was so cloudy you couldn’t even see the Moon.

I was walking with our cat in the driveway and looking up at the sky again around 11: 45.  As I turned to go back to the patio at the rear of our home I spotted what I thought was a large star/planet  I was looking to the east and watched it pulse quickly as it moved to the North/Northeast,  I could here no sound from this object but did hear a jet engine from another passing commercial jet traveling from east to west at a higher altitude just south of where I first spotted this object.  The light of the object was a bluish-white color much like twinkling starlight.   The light was bright like aircraft landing lights, but pulsed slowly as the object maintained a fairly straight path as it traversed the eastern sky.  There were NO green or red flashers and only the one slowly pulsating light.  When the light dimmed, I could faintly see a structure that was apparently circular (but this is very possibly due to the limit ! of illumination of the radial light source…the structure could have been cylindrical also…hard to say for sure…but definitely a structure was visible.)  This was not a meteor/fireball/plasma lightening/ natural light source/object.  There was no visible exhaust or condensation trail.  The moon was VERY bright and nearly full, so only the very brightest stars/planets could be seen.  The object was a bit larger than the usual size of Venus when viewed at about 40-45 degrees above the horizon at my lat/lon for this time of year.  It’s magnitude was about that of Venus, perhaps a little brighter.  This is the 4th sighting I have had in my lifetime.  I am interested to see if anyone else saw this object in the Houston/Tomball/Hockley, Texas area.  It appeared to be traveling about as fast as the ISS when it passes over us here, but seemed much closer.  My 15-20 second view covered about 2/3 of the visible eastern sky.

On the night of January 1, 2011 I picked up my girlfriend from her place of work, off of S. Clinton St. across from the Doylestown train station.  The time was approximately 10:25pm EST.  We proceeded to drive south on Clinton street making our way towards Hart Ave.  While continuing down the hill I noticed numerous bright objects in the eastern sky.  It was immediately evident that this was at the least something uncommon or unusual.  We made a left turn at Hart ave. and pulled into a parking lot behind a bank.  At this point we both exited the vehicle and stood in the parking lot to get a better look.  The time at this point must have been about 10:27pm EST.  Initially we saw about twenty of these objects moving relatively slow from south to north across the eastern sky.  They were following a semi circular trajectory, appearing out of the dark in the southeastern sky, moving towards our position slightly while continuing north.  After covering much the length of the sky, they began gaining altitude and moving away from us before disappearing again into the darkness.  They continued in a constant stream like this for about ten minutes, with new ones appearing in the south east as they disappeared to the northeast.  For the most part, at any point in time there was somewhere between 15-20 of these in the sky at once.  They all followed the same general trajectory but individualy they carried there own paths(almost as though they were travelling in formation and connected by a string).  As they made their way across the sky, most of them maintained their relative positions to each other.  However some of them were bobbing around.  ! They all seemed to maintain a constant speed the entire time.  At 10:36 a placed a phone call to mother for her to meet me in town and bring a camera.  At about this time the lights started to appear in fewer numbers.  Eventually dwindling to about 2 or 3.  Finally the last one went across at about 10:40.  Of interested note, shortly before the last one went across the sky my girlfriend and I heard the sound of a jet, but did not visualize any planes. At no point in time did the objects make any type of noise, additionally, they moved unlike any aerial manned objects I have ever seen.  The objects themselves looked like balls of fire.  Some were slightly larger and brighter than others.  They ranged in color from a deep red to bright yellowish-orange.  However all had an appearance similar to that of a campfire at a distance.  They almost looked like bioluminescent deep sea creatures moving in the pitch dark of the ocean.  It is difficult for me to judge the altitude of these objects, I can say they appeared to be flying much lower than a typical commercial liner. Initially when we first exited the vehicle, I freaked out on my girlfriend because she didn't know how to use her crummy camera phone(blackberry), however we did get it working and managed to snap a couple pictures.  The pictures by no means do justice to what we saw, and the actual objects appeared much brigher, larger, and in greater numbers.  I have read stories and seen videos of the chinese lanterns, and though they look similar, I stuggle to understand how they would appear/disappear, change color/size, and follow a semi cirular trajectory.  I am also unaware of any local group that releases such lanterns.  Additionally, there was some light fog with an overcast sky.  It was difficult for me to tell how low the cloud cover was.  About 30 minutes after arriving back home it began to rain.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,40.32416086956521,-75.12223043478261

Last night my parents were having a new year’s party. All of us kids were bored so we decided to go for a walk. We decided to walk towards our friend’s house. He lives just about 5 minutes up the road from my house.  We didn’t feel like taking the road so we decided to take a short cut through the woods. It was pitch black out so we were using our friend’s cell phone for a light.  He had three bars of battery left and we knew we could make it. We were crossing the railroad bridge when we saw a glow in the middle of the woods.   As we got closer, our friend’s phone shut off! The battery had died and it would not turn back on. We kept walking towards the green light.  It kept getting closer and closer and moving back and forth across the woods.   It suddenly disappeared and we saw a shape glowing towards the sky.  We were all afraid and in tears so we headed back to my house. Once we got back we explained the story to the adults and they thought we were crazy.  We grabbed a camera and flashlights to see this time and to prove to the adults that we were not lying. Hoping it would still be there or come back, we headed back to where it was. Once we got across the bridge this time, the glow was hanging in the sky right above us. The flashlights began to flash on and off and then it was gone.  The flashlights went back to normal. We asked our friend to turn his phone on and see if it would work and sure enough he had three bars on his battery and it was back to normal.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,40.8942,-79.5231

My name is ((name deleted)). I am 47 years old and worked in Law Enforcement for 6 years.  I was driving home to Portage, Wisconsin from Madison, Wisconsin. I was driving north on State Highway 51 approaching Johnson Auto Sales (N1255 US Highway 51, Arlington, WI). My Son (14 years old) was in the front passenger seat, my wife was in the back seat. I saw an extremely low flying aircraft in the sky just northwest of Johnson sales.  The object appeared to be moving very slowly to the south, toward my vehicle.  Hwy 51 was busy with traffic, vehicles were northbound behind me and in front of me.  There were also several vehicles passing me southbound. I pointed to the aircraft and asked my son what he thought it was.  My son said he thought it might be a helicopter.  My wife, a Nurse, said that maybe it was a med-flight helicopter. The aircraft continued to move southeast and began hovering just west of my car, right over the Johnson Sales retail store. I slowed way down and could immediately see that the aircraft was not a helicopter or a conventional airplane.  It was hovering approximately 1000 ft above Johnson sales.   My son and I both saw that the aircraft had two distinct white headlamps.  The headlamps had approximately 20 feet of separation.   We also saw a third white headlamp toward the rear of the aircraft... and all three headlamps formed a triangle).  There were two blue lights on the right triangular wing, and two red lights on the left triangular wing.  The body shape of the aircraft closely resembled that of a thin triangular spur. I rolled my window down expecting to hear an aircraft engine or rotor blades, but the aircraft was completely silent. I pulled into the Johnson Sales parking lot.  The aircraft immediately moved silently and slowly to the south, almost as though it knew we were trying to observe it more closely.  My wife was afraid and asked me not to try to follow it.   The aircraft continued to move south and I drove my family home.  My son, 14 years old, drew a sketch of the aircraft and we just can't seem to stop talking and thinking about this remarkable event.  There were many vehicles on Hwy 51 at the time, and I was just wondering if anyone else may have reported seeing this strange aircraft.  If so, I would be interested to know.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,43.3221,-89.36470000000001

Major air surveilance at time of sighting. Two seperate crafts sighted. Thank You for your time. Please excuse this for its minor length. I saw two objects. The first object was heading north bound, actually flying across the little dipper constellation. The second object appeared immediately to the north when the first object flew over the tree line. The sky was clear and bright with stars. A few miles down my road is Historic Camp Milton. I looked on Google Earth a few months back and saw that they have an air strip. It is not uncommon to see helicopters flying a perimeter around the base.  So, I assume the base is active.  But there isn’t much plane activity going in an out of Camp Milton. On March 6, 2011, at roughly 4:00 p.m., I was alarmed to hear low flying planes, so I went outside to have a look. I saw two radar planes, flying at least a mile apart, circling a huge perimeter around Camp Milton within 200 ft from tree level. I also noticed various planes at various clearances moving at various speeds, with the fastest I guessed was moving at around Mach 2. They were peppering the sky with activity. The spectacle of seeing so many planes in the air, with a lot of them moving in formation, was enough to be in awe over, or at least enough to make me question.  It also gave me a lot of things to compare my sightings to. So, I did question. I figured they were looking for something, so I kept looking up, hoping to maybe catch a glimpse of what they were searching for. These radar planes were circling for hours. At around 9 p.m. after checking the scene out a few times, I just stared up in no general area thinking something would catch my eye. That’s when I saw the first UFO. This sighting lasted 3-5 minutes. It caught my attention much as a shooting star would, but it was moving much slower. Light put off was a constant when it was visible, but would fade in and out, much like a comet, but the trail lasted longer. The craft was still moving at a fantastic rate for its altitude. It looked as if it were among the stars. When it would appear, it would be further than I had saw it, but its position did not make sense in relation to its speed. It never blipped or blinked, only faded in and out in no apparent pattern. It took anywhere from 3 seconds to 10 seconds to reappear. Each time it appeared, it looked like a shooting star. I know it wasn’t a meteor shower, because it kept a path. It was a yellowish light that had a haze to it, not a definite shimmer as a distant light might have within our atmosphere. It moved directly north, but after a few appearances, I lost it for around 10 seconds only to see it reappear, heading directly east and over th! e tree line. I was astonished, but saddened that I couldn’t watch it for long. That’s when a bright light caught my eye to the north. This sighting lasted around 10 seconds. The light from this UFO was blue, much like the new types of headlights for automobiles. It appeared and descended a little past Camp Milton, maybe a couple of miles above the tree line, which is within 8 miles from my house. The light was huge. I thought it was a helicopter, but it was moving much faster. The light had an aura, much like any flashlight shined in your eye, then it seemed to dim to as faint as a distant star, never blinking; remaining constant. It curved down, then flew off in a 45 degree angle, away from the horizon, until I could see the light no more. This sighting happened within 10 seconds, so I guessed that this craft was moving at a stellar rate of speed. There were no clouds in the sky at the time, so I was able to see it fade to nothing as it seemed to ascend into the sky. Both sightings combined happened within minutes. I stayed outside and kept watch. I noticed one other thing, which was a blip of light around Orion’s belt, which I dismissed.. But then I saw that blip in the same spot. I could hear the planes circling on until midnight. I went outside for a late cigarette around 1 in the morning and there were NO PLANES IN THE SKY. I sat there for a while to try and see another plane, but there were none to be seen for my duration of looking at the sky. A thick fog rolled in around 3 in the morning. My rational explanation for the first sighting would be that it was a stealth plane. I may have saw its propulsion. I know they move at incredible speeds.  But, for the other, I have no guess. It was amazing.",2011-03-10T00:00:00,30.266904680969628,-81.6163728336584

We never determined where the sound was exactly located. It just seemed to be behind and above our house. Strangely, when my wife exited our bed to look out the bedroom window, the sound immediately stopped. Later, I went to our living room to look around the house, and found our two small dogs in a state of fear. The dog's hair was standing on end. I felt really spooked, as well.

It's late on Wednesday night, and my associate spotted a strange formation of lights outside his window in the northeast sky.  He lives several miles out of town.  When he went to look out a different window, the lights had gone from a horizontal formation to a vertical one. then he lost contact with the craft.  He called a local resident and informed him of the sighting.  He went outside and saw it, facing north towards Davenport over highway 28.   He proceeded to pursue the craft down the highway as it flew in line with the highway at an altitude of 150 feet AGL.  He couldn't see it while driving except for when he turned around, it was vaguely visible in the distance.  He estimates it was 20 to 30 miles away at this point.  About an hour later, an intrigued young man heard of the sighting and accompanied the truck driver to a point near the Star Barn Road which is west on the way to Sprague.  We watched for a while from the field we were in and saw nothing! at first.   After a while we noticed a flash in some large dark clouds. Its about 10:30 pm at this point.  We thought the flashes were lightning but there was no thunder. It was more of a slow strobing light. And it was moving through the clouds in a northeasterly trajectory.  It emerged from the clouds and was the same craft that was spotted earlier. It was flying very low and unnaturally slowly and was perfectly silent.  Especially considering its low altitude and large size.   My associate is a pilot and he agreed that it was no airplane.  It continued flying towards spokane and continued into the distance.  In the direction of spokane we spotted a strange light hovering over the horizon. (separate from the craft.  It was also visible in addition to it.)  There was a strange pulsing red glow on the horizon.  We estimate it was located several miles away.  The original craft appeared to be directly over it. Suddenly another light appeared over the craft and was darting to and fro li! ke a firefly but miles away. the light on the horizon wavered for a moment and slowly lowered until it disappeared.  We drove in the general direction of the lights to investigate when suddenly all the lights disappeared.  After searching again, we gave up and went home.

I walked into the middle of my yard about 50 yards from the house, and saw two bright lights traveling from the WNW travelling East almost directly.  The two lights were travelling at identical speeds with no perterbation or change in speed.  The lights were just white but about 20 to 50 times brighter than Sirius, which was clearly visible behind me.  They traveled at identical speeds about two-thirds through the sky when they faded into blackness.  At that point, they were quite bright, and took about 2 seconds to fade.  As they faded, one faded, then the other as it approached the exact same place in the sky, then faded and disappeared.  As it faded there seemed to be a moment where it appeared (on both lights) that there was a glowing ring that could have been pointing down either toward me or toward the earth.  Bu! t the fade to darkness was strangely slow.  As the two lights traversed the sky, a typical satellite passed right through the line between the two crafts.  I often see satellites in the yard on clear nights.  This light was much much smaller than the two lights that were moving throught the sky.  I could actually compare them as they appeared very close in the sky at the same time. There were planes visible in the sky at the time as well, both far and near.  I live in the landing path of Providence airport and see the planes very commonly.  These unusual crafts were traveling almost exactly perpendicular to any landing planes.  They had no directional lights.  The only thing I can imagine is that the space station and the space shuttle were passing over and were 100 miles apart.  But the way they faded has me completely puzzled.  I checked the website for the space station flyover, and it says the craft would have appeared at 7:14PM...25 minutes after exactly when I looked on the web to check the time of that possibility.  I know I saw this at 6:50 PM give or take a minute or two only. They did disappear at what appeared to be the exact place in the sky.  So I can imagine that the sun's light may have still reached to about 75 degrees above the horizon toward the east.  What is mostly strange is that the light did not change in any way as it flew over, but it wasn't any particular shape either.  It's very difficult to explain.",2011-03-10T00:00:00,41.42817246376812,-71.5353884057971

At about 9 pm, we saw multiple lights in the northeastern sky.  They were moving erratically and slowly and we could hear no sound. One approached and flew a few hundred feet over our house.  As it approached, I thought I saw a spotlight hit the ground not too far away, but it did not remain. As it flew over, from what I could see, there were three lights in a triangular pattern, a red one towards the front and two blinking white ones toward the back.  I actually could not make out the actual shape of the aircraft.  As it flew over, I could hear a very slight humming noise but that was it. Looking up casually, one might have thought they were regular airplanes, but what was strange was that they all seemed to have the same flashing lights pattern, and they were moving too irregularly, too slowly for an airplane, and with no sound.  Also, another strange thing that happened a few times, one of the lights would get very bright, almost brighter than a star for a few seconds, and then the light would disappear and be replaced by the red and white flashing they all seemed to be doing. We watched for two hours and they never left.  They would fly from one end of the sky to the other and then back again (distances of what seemed to be hundreds of miles). It was almost like they were looking for something or surveying the area.  We never heard a noise, not like you would think you would hear from so many aircraft in the sky.

I saw 3-4 four lights, non blinking, red and yellow, can't remember the numbers exactly but I think more red than yellow, it was only for a period of 3-5 seconds, so really not sure of the exact quantity of lights. The size is hard to say as I have no idea how far or close it was, but it moved very fast. The shape I did not see, only lights, and they were shaped in the proverbial oval/circular shape. Here is my recollection,  I was looking out of our sliding glass door, as I do every night while having dinner. I watched these lights come into view and they banked in such a way, my initial first second or two  thought was, something might be blowing in the wind, as we had winds tonight, but then I realized the lights weren't blinking and they went up and out of my view at a severe angle and in my mind I instantly knew this was not a plane or helicopter. I jumped up and went to the sliding door, 8-10 feet away, all the while looking in the same sky area. I opened the sliding door and nothing was there and everything was quiet, ruling out a helicopter or even a plane. It all happened so fast, I have to say, for a few minutes afterward, I wondered what I had seen. But on reflection, all of my moves were instinctual and that I saw something out of the ordinary. It has clicked in me- that this wasn't what I've been looking out of this window for years at, the various planes, helicopters, even asteroids/meteors. This moved very differently, smoothly and then quickly. From my POV, I see the planes that are on approach to land at Burbank airport and I'm use to seeing things move relatively slowly through the sky. If you have ever been to an RC plane park and have seen how fast the planes fly by in the sky, that is similar to what I saw, though, in this case, no sound. If I had anything to add, I would only add that, it was initially moving like how a helicopter would bank on a turn at low altitude, but this bank was still on an upward incline and then the lights rose up at a steep (maybe 45 degree angle) out that initial circular pattern.  I also called the local police and said, just in case anyone has reported seeing something and they said, well you have (hmmmm okay, I guess just me!?)",2011-03-10T00:00:00,34.18714851694915,-118.46126228813559

My husband and I stayed at a hotel in Bay Harbor, MI between 01/28/2011 and 01/31/2011. We had a room with a north facing balcony, overlooking Lake Michigan. On the very first night of our stay, we were enjoying a cold but beautiful view of the night sky from the balcony.  It was partly cloudy, but the stars were still quite visible.  We were looking toward the northwest when we noticed a small flash of light in the distance, right on the water.  The flash came and went, starting and stopping at random, sometimes strobing and pulsing, and sometimes staying lit for a short moment before going black again.  This continued for about five minutes before I decided to try to get it on video.  It looked like a fireball burning on the water, and I was curious as to what it could be. I was fidgeting with the camera, and tried several times to film it, but as soon as I would turn on the camera, or get it into focus, it would go black.  And as soon as I turned it off, or th! e power saving feature would shut it off, it would return. I was so busy trying to get the “Fireball” into focus and on tape, that I didn’t even notice what was going on in the sky just overhead. Not until I looked up at the sky for a moment, and saw three white glowing points of light, forming a triangle. I immediately put my focus on this new development, and zoomed in on what appears in the video as three lights, still in the form of a triangle, blinking green, red, and white. Standard aviation colors, I know. Still, these lights disappeared when I got a little closer with the camera, and returned several times. By this point, my husband had already gone back inside, and I ran in, because I was frightened, as my mind tried to come up for a rational explanation of what I had just seen. I was huffing and puffing, but managed to get the story across to my husband, who wanted to see it for himself. About five minutes had passed before I initially ran in, frightened. We brought the camera along again, and headed out for the balcony. We focused on the same area of sky and waited. At first there was nothing, but after about a minute we saw it again. We got a pretty good look at it, since it wasn’t moving at all. It would occasionally disappear, and reappear, but in the same spot. We filmed it until our SD card got full, which was only about a minute more, but we got a pretty good look at it. The next day I filmed and photographed the same area of land and water where we had seen the U.F.O, and there was nothing higher than the tree line. So this could not have been a tower, or house, or anything stationary, even though it stayed in the same exact spot both times we filmed it, and was there for at least twenty minutes, until we went back in. The temp that night was in the single digits, so it outlasted us. I really don’t know how long it actually stayed there before it left, but whatever it was doing, it took it’s time. Also after I noticed the U.F.O. in the sky, the “Fireball” in the water never came back, at least not while I was filming. The two combined events were just too much to ignore.

They were in pretty much an equilateral  triangle shape.  It went  right over Swami’s Point surf spot paraellling the coastline which is pretty much due north.  I see many planes and choppers fly over this path at apparently the same height & speed  during  the day and  at night so I know this well visually and sonically.  The height & speed seemed about the same. ~100MPH about 100ft over the cliff top & 100ft out from the cliff or 150ft above the ocean so the path is actually  over  the surf zone.  It was very quiet at the time and at this close distance or even if it was much further away and much larger it would be easily audible if it were a plane, or copper (there would also be running lights and the aircraft would be somewhat visible even with all lights out.  The triangle was about visually the size of my fist at full arms’ extension.  If it were 150 feet from me ! (I was about 100ft from the cliff edge) I’d guesstimate that it was roughly 50 ft on each edge of the triangle.  There were patchy clouds from the receding storm about 1,500 feet I’d guess and this thing was clearly below this.  If it was actually at 600 ft then it would be about 600 feet out from the cliff and would be dramatically larger (hundreds of feet on each side of the triangle. The lights were quite dim, about the same as a common star with no flashing or special color (just white).  There were no other lights on it and just a very subtle darkening between the lights.  Again, it made absolutely no sound.  This object would not be easy to notice even at this close distance and if it were much higher it could fly unnoticed over anywhere.",2011-02-08T00:00:00,33.0468724137931,-117.25621206896552

The lights were small and I thought at first that it must be skydivers, but then the lights just went out and there was nothing in the sky behind them.   When I started to see the lights come on I noticed a shape starting to come into focus just to the left of the first lights. The shape was approximately the shape of a human eye with a shiny silver glow over the top and bottom of the eye formation (somewhat like eye liner) and seemed fairly large to me.  The shape was fully lighted in an outline shape and the center was somewhat void of color except for three yellowish-white circles spaced evenly and horizontal across the center of what would be the pupil area.  This sighting lasted approximately 30 to 45 seconds when the lights just disappeared.  As with the other lights I saw the lights of the shape just went out and there was nothing but sky left.  The shape never moved and it was as if someone had turned on the lights then turned them off again.  This object looked as if it was about a little less than a mile away and if I had put up my hand to try to cover it up, in a horizontal manner, it would have extended beyond my palm.  It appeared just to the left, and above, of a rock hill just up-river from my location.  Also in reference to the big ! dipper I could only see three stars of the big dipper formation when the shape appeared, but then saw the whole formation after it blinked out. The night was clear with a three-quarter moon and fairly bright.  There was a small light cloud to the right of the big dipper but it was very wispy looking.

I noticed a beautiful cloud formation to the south (towards the Grand Canyon) at dusk while standing at my kitchen sink.  Decided to run and grab my wifes Canon Rebel XST camera so I could get a few shots of the clouds using a zoom lens.  I was bare footed and climbed on some small landscaping rocks near the pool to get higher so the block fence wouldn't be in the way.  I took a total of eight photos within less than two minutes.  When I downloaded the photos I noticed the first four had an object moving through the photos at a downward angle to the left.  I seemed to be fairly distant as I never saw it with my eyes.  It probably only took me 30 or 40 seconds to take the first 5 or 6 photos because the rocks were hurting my feet and I wanted to get down to the pool deck where I took about two more.  I showed my wife and she thought I might have had something on the lens. If I did it came off quick because the last four photos do not show the object.  I zoomed in on ! the photos to see if I could detect a shape. Two looked oval and the other two appeared to have a saucer shape.  I have no idea what it is but it is strange and I don't think anything was on the lens.  I have the unalterd photos if you want them.,2010-08-24T00:00:00,37.2262,-113.485

My sixteen year old daughter and myself were driving home from dropping her boyfriend off when she  pointed to a bright light in the sky.  It was late dusk, 7:40 PM, and the sky was not completely dark.  We knew it was not the moon; it had been extremely huge and bright the night before.  This was not nearly as large as the moon, and much brighter and larger than a star, although it was the bright goldish white color of a star.  We realized that it could be neither of those, and that it actually wasn't very high in the sky.  We both kept repeating that it wasn't a plane, and what was it? The light suddenly dimmed. We were getting closer to it.  I was driving and the light was getting close to the top of my view from the windsheild.  It had been heading to the top right corner of my windshield when it turned and passed directly over us.  We were leaning forward (I was barely driving at this point) and it flew slowly above us.  At that point we could see very clearly t hat it was a craft but was not a plane. It was triangular and had no wings and no sharp edges.  I'd say it was a triangular disc.  The circular lights went around the parameter of the object and they pulsated from bright to dimmer.  Three of the lights were a lot brighter than the others.  I think there were seven lights in all, the three brighter ones were a bit more of a yellow white than the lighter, whiter ones.  It did not stop; it continued to our left at a moderate rate of speed, lights still blinking as it slowly disappeared.  Fortunatly for us, when we got home and told my husband and sons, they believed us.  I'm not saying this machine was from another planet, but it definatly is not like anything I have ever heard described anywhere other than by others who have seen what they call U.F.O.'s.

I was walking slower than him, as I was smoking, and looking up at the stars. I was looking in a SW direction, at a bright star, or pehaps it is Venus or Mercury; I do not know, but I turned and looked to the East, at the Big Dipper, and then turned back to look again at the bright star/planet, when to the SSW, at approximately a 30 degree angle, I saw 6 evenly spaced white lights, at angles, approaching in a ENE direction, and then make a sudden banking turn left, or counterclockwise, much like a kite might turn, back towards the SW. I got a full view of the bottom of the object, which was triangle-shaped, without the points, dark with single white lights on either side of the three blunt ends, and a circle of approximately ten to twelve lesser white lights about half way towards the middle. The turn was impossibly tight, silent and very fluid; Too tight to be any kind of aircraft I have ever seen, and I have seen many, having spent ten years as a flying crewchief  in the U.S. Air Force, as well as  growing up within a mile of a busy airport. I was able to see the object quite vividly, as it was silouetted in front of a thin white cloud cover, almost like a light fog, moving in from the South, and it actually moved into the clouds, immediately after turning.  I ran to the front door of the apartment house, still trying to watch the object, and called my friend to come back and see it, when someone turned on a fairly powerful spotlight on the ground, approximately SSW of my position, and shined it straight up at the object. The object and spotlight positions could not have been more than a half-mile from where I was standing. By the time my friend got back outside, the object had moved into the clouds sufficiently that it was no longer visible, and the spotlight was turned off, so that my friend saw nothing, unfortunately. We scanned the entire sky, hoping to see the object, or anything else that might be in the area, but saw nothing else. I would like to note that in the month I have been living at my present address, I have not seen any low-flying aircraft, and concluded that there is no airport of any type near this town, but this may not be an accurate accessment.

On January 4, 2011, at approximately 21:00 hours, I was looking at the eastern sky.  It was a very clear evening; there was no overcast at all.  I noticed 3-4 triangular objects in the sky, which I believed were stars at first, but then I noticed that all of them were triangular.  Obviously, stars are not triangular in shape, and I thought it very odd. That same evening, at approximately 22:25 hours, I witnessed three (3) objects in the western sky.  Each was triangular, although no structure was visible, with the exception of three colored lights in the form of a triangle. Object #1 was on the left, or southernmost side of the group.  It was fairly high in the sky … a minimum of 10,000 to 15,000 feet.  From that altitude, I could only detect three (3) lights, which were white in color. Object #2, was in the center of the group, and was very low, approximately 5,000 feet.  This object was the most visible; its 3 lights were rotating in a circular fashion and flashing colors of red, white and yellow. Object #3 was to the right of the group, or northernmost.  It was about the same altitude as the Object #1, and its three (3) lights appeared to be white in color. I watched the three objects for approximately 15 minutes.  All of them were hovering in place, and there was no sound or engine noise whatsoever.  Object #2, in center position, continued to visibly rotate its three lights in colors of red, white and yellow. As I watched, Object #3, on the right side of the group (northernmost) began to depart the group and moved in an easterly direction.  It moved at the pace of a fast moving aircraft.  However, I noticed that there were no strobe/blinking lights, as is customary in domestic aircraft.  And, again, there was no engine noise at all. Approximately 10 seconds later, Object #1, on the left (southernmost), moved out as well, in the same easterly direction and at the same speed as Object #3.  It appeared to be following behind Object #3. Approximately 10 seconds later, Object #2, in the center position, which had been at an extremely low altitude, moved upwards very quickly; it was almost as if it was transported in seconds to approximately the same altitude as Objects #1 and #3.  When it attained the higher altitude, it also moved to the east, following Objects #3 and #1. I was unable to follow the trajectory of these objects because I elected to phone the State Police at this point (approximately 22:40 hours).  When I returned, the objects were nowhere in sight.  I did, however, notice that there were the same 3-4 triangular objects in the eastern sky as I had witnessed earlier, at approximately 21:00 hours.  There was no way for me to know if the three objects I had seen leave the western sky were the same as those I had previously seen at 21:00 hours and again at about 23:00 hours  in the eastern sky. I did receive a visit by the State Police, but they simply laughed the whole thing off and began questioning how long I had been living alone.  In all, it was a very upsetting experience. There was one observer, myself.  I have a background as a 22 year career professional Project Manager for a Fortune 500 Company.  My expertise was in Corporate Tax, Telecommunications and Quality Control. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with witness, and do not know what it was she witnessed.

I looked to the North and noticed a formation of flashing lights not in sequence in a circular formation at about a 30 degree angle of view and a single flashing light trailing the circular formation.  I would say about a dozen lights or so. There was a pattern of the flashing white lights that appeared to be those of white NAV lights of airplanes or helicopters.  The single trailing light was close to the formation at first and as I kept watching for about 3 minutes until the circular formation disappeared behind the trees the single trailing light trailed even further traveling in the same path.  They were moving relatively slow to be airplanes.

The account below sync's with the picture I have attached.)  -Tuesday, March 08, 2011 -9:00 pm EST -West Springfield, Pa. (Just beyond the Ohio/Pennsylvania border on Rt. 20) -Facing Northwest    Heres what happened:  The second witness and I were on her back stoop putting a dog on a chain before we walked down to the barn for the night.  She looked up and pointed to the front of the house next door and said ""LOOK!"" I thought she was looking at the stars which were all amazing, since it was a completely clear night.  You could see every star in the sky as well as very distant and purposefully moving southbound planes. I looked over quickly and my eyes focused on three lights in the shape of a boomerang that were the length of the height of her neighbors' house, which is a two story home. Lasting a total of four or five seconds, the lights continued moving across the neighbors side of the sky, in sync with one another, horizontally.  It was moving fast, what seemed like 65-75 mph from left to right.  As they moved from front of the house (south) to the rear (north), they shifted from flat and horizontal, to completely vertical (like in the picture).  It didn't just slowly become verticle, it snapped straight up in less than 1/2 a second with no sound, and no hesitation.  The craft continued northbound, and when it passed behind the brown porch pole in front of us, it completely disappeared. Poof.  Into nothing.  It didn't get smaller, fade out, or disappear over the trees.  Just gone.  Again, this was all completely silent, aside from the other witness asking where it went. This object was large and by the looks of it, if it were a plane banking at an extremely sharp angle, it would have surely hit its wings on the ground or the trees ahead. I also learned that less than a mile towards the neighbors yard and beyond is a prison that, according to a former prison guard at the facility, is a no-fly zone.  There is no small near by airport there either.  Less than a mile beyond the prison and to the north is a set of railroad tracks and a salt/sand mine and harbor, docked directly on Lake Erie.",2011-03-10T00:00:00,41.936,-80.4715

They were moving very slowly from East to West.  The two objects remained almost 6 minutes in the same position (straight up where I was).  They made no sound, but they looked like very shining stars(abnormally big).  The sun light was hitting them and probably it was increasing their luminosity or light reflection.

This one was a little bit more towards the west than the other two, but still at relatively close distance from the pair straight above me.  The sunshine was making the view of this third object very difficult. I cannot tell how high or big they were, but I can tell with certainty that they were higher up then the commercial planes that  constantly fly this aerial corridor. The sighting lasted for approximately 8 minutes.  The objects quickly fade while moving towards the west, in the sun direction. The wind was blowing contrary to their heading direction. At that time, the prevalent wind was from West (Coast) to East(Mountains).  The whole incident lasted (at least from the time I first saw the objects) from 15:20 to 15:28.

He asked me what object was he seeing and as I looked in front of us (I was looking outside the window on the passenger seat)   I saw a light about 5 or 6 in line.  It was so bright and they seemed to appear to be in one line.   Initially, when my husband said, what is that a UFO?  I dismissed it and said no maybe a light post (because it reminded me of the lights in the airport.  But as we are approaching the light (it is stationary, bright, whitish-yellow in color) I noticed that it was floating.   I said my God this is not an airplane (the lights are not blinking, it is quiet) I looked for my phone camera to take picture of it, but I forgot to open the window and it flashed back to me, we were driving so fast (65 mph) and my husband does not want to slow down, because the cars behind us were driving fast, too.   I was able to look up when we passed by this straight light.  At the back of my mind, I said maybe it is just an airplane, so look at the shape, because the light is so bright and you cannot figure it out right away from afar.     I looked-up and it was round and the lights about 5or 6 are underneath the craft.  It happened this afternoon (21February2011) between 6:00 and 6:05 PM (at dusk).  It was right after or before COOK street in Palm Springs/Indio at freeway 10, we were heading west to our home (Buena Park).   Things happened so fast and I was not able to take another picture of it, but I was able to see it up close (just underneath the craft)  I am sure that some motorists may have noticed this light/craft.  You cannot miss the bright light ahead of us.   I just want to share it.  I don’t know if we have military activity in the area, but I have never seen light that bright and a silent craft that is stationary and I have never seen a round craft before. just wondering what it is.",2011-02-23T00:00:00,,

While we are gazing, we notice something quite peculiar. What we first saw was what we thought was merely a formation of 3 commercial planes, but there was something strange about it.  They were completely horizontal and on the same plain. Also they were the exact same distance from eachother.  They looked liked 3 separate blinking red lights in the sky, off in the distance.  Then we all started to realize that it looked as if it was one huge craft, rather than 3 independent ones. Also it was relatively low to the ground and not going up or down, just staying level and moving forward.  A few strange details are that the nearby airplanes that use the Portland international airport did not have any changes in their flight patterns.  They didn't wait for it to leave or wait for possible clearance to land, which is strange because it was so close to the airport.  But it makes me think that it could have been under the radar. So only civilians saw it. On a last note, we are not the only witnesses in town to see this event.  We got onto a local reporters Facebook website and noticed that someone reported the exact same event as us.  There are many new reports coming out of Portland, Oregon.

At first I thought it was a star, but when we got a bit closer I realized it was too big to be a star and I realized that it was not one light I was seeing but 3 lights in a triangular pattern. I also noticed a green light on the starboard wing and a red light on the port-side wing.  It looked to be a private jet, seemingly stationary at an altitude of less than 2,000 ft.  IF it was moving, (with my somewhat minimal knowledge of physics) I have no idea how that private jet was able to generate enough lift to stay airborne.  I'm sure this plane was a private jet.  Both my friend and I agree that it was a private jet.  The only thing we somewhat disagree on is if the craft was actually moving very slowly, or staying completely stati! onary.  We witnessed this airplane for about 20 seconds, as I was going 55 mph (I know this also factors into whether the plane was actually stationary or not), and I sped up going East, the plane was pointed due West, to get to a gas station so I didn't run out, so we could get back.  Needless to say, when we went back, it was gone. 1:52 am   First of all, I'm sure of the exact time because I had not gone to sleep and had staring at the clock intently since 1:21 am because I thought I had seen my clock malfunctioning and going backwards.  I sat up in bed in looked out my window facing due West and the only words I could mutter were, “There's a light in the sky.”  Immediately, my friend sat up as well and we gazed upon this craft heading towards us heading Northeast.  I noticed it had a green light on the starboard wing and a red light on the port-side wing. This craft as well was flying at an altitude of lower than 2,000 ft, though  higher than the jet from earlier. My friend suggested that I open the window. (Genius.)  When the craft came closer however I noticed that it was white, had very small wings, that looked to be made of a different material than the main body of the plane.  The craft had no visible means of a conventional propulsion system. That is to say that, it had no jet engines, and it had no propellers.  It made a sound, similar to a jet engine, yet more...”controlled”. The sound wasn't as abrasive as a jet engine, and much, much quieter.  The craft seemed not to be flying at the speed of sound yet my friend and I agree that the sound seemed to “hover” right behind the craft.  That is to say that it wasn't going the speed of sound, but the same sonic effect in the air.  I had my little brother ask my neighbors if they had heard a jet go over the house at 2 am.  They replied, that they had heard nothing.  I assume that if a jet was flying over a house, in a town of around 2,000 people, at such a low altitude they would hear it, needless to say, they didn't, yet we heard a distinct sound.  The craft was flat white, that is to say that whatever color was put on the material of the craft was not glossy.  It had two lights located next to the wings either side of the craft 180 degrees apart.  It was triangular in shape (to simply that it was a triangle or triangular doesn't do the c! raft justice I believe) and widened in the back, the rear extr! emity of the ship was curved.   I could describe in greater detail if a return call is received.   Thank you very much, for all your hard work.",2011-01-31T00:00:00,42.2888,-85.385

About thirty seconds into our conversation three bright lights over the 60 freeway in Chino caught my attention.  At first it looked like incoming aircraft far off in the distance, because there were obvious aircraft blinking in the sky.  Suddenly two of the objects seemed to zoom straight into each other and become one object, the third object faded away when this happened.  The remaining object which at the time seemed FAR away looked like it was just hovering when all of a sudden it was right on top of me.  It did not appear to even move fast at all, if I had to explain it I would say that it defiantly was not following our laws of physics.  The object probably had just traversed at least a distance of ten miles without even appearing to move, ending up directly over the 60 freeway and my car.  I explained to my girlfriend what I was seeing and suddenly I could make the object out and it gave me goose bumps all over to say the least. I observed what looked to be a floating upside down white triangle. It almost looked like it could be a different color and the shade of white might be heat emanating from the object because there appeared to be no actual ""lights"" on it. It floated parallel to myself and the freeway for about 10 seconds, I tried to pull of the freeway but by that time it was simply gone. I have always been skeptical of ufo’s, I even believed to have seen one before when I was younger but it was so long ago even I doubt my childhood memories because all kids have a wild imagination right? What I saw tonight changed how I feel about everything, I could not have seen this ANY clearer.

I drove on home and lost sight of the lights but when I went in our backyard, there was another light in the sky. My husband also saw this one. It was not in the clouds like the first two. There were plenty of people here trying to figure out what they were looking at. It was close to dusk so possibly a reflection from the sun.

I took pictures from our upstairs window to show the circles.  This ranch is out in the middle of no where so I’m not sure how to tell when this happened.

The viewing angle was up about 15 to 20 degrees.  Distance to the object was 300 to 600 feet (or more). Closer than 300 would have put it in thick trees, farther out then 600 is possible, but only if the object was extremely large. Viewing time was between about 8 or 10 seconds, looking out a small window, in a door about 4-5 feet away. I was walking up a basement stairs, towards the door. The visible parts of the object were it's lights.  There were around 15 bright lights, red, green, blue & white. Some looked like a car's headlights in brightness and size, others seemed slightly smaller and a bit dimmer. When first sighted, the lights appeared to be slowly rotating horizontally around a fixed central axis. The rotation only lasted a few seconds before stopping.  It turned about 1/4 of a turn or 90 degrees. These lights moved in unison, maintaining their positions relative to each other, as if they were all attached to one solid object, hidden in the black sky. Viewed rotation lasted 2 or 3 seconds. It appeared to be a 'V' or a triangle shaped craft that was pointed directly towards me, and then turned towards the west. It sat still for 3 to 4 seconds and then accelerated toward the west (into Lexington MA). It's speed was moderate. The rate of acceleration wasn't fast, and it appeared to be about 25 mph, when it went out of sight. I believe it got much faster, because it was gone when I got close to the window seconds later. (Or, it's lights went out). I got the impression that I was looking at the belly and edge of a flying wing or triangle. It had a wing span that was a bit larger than the wings of a Gulfstream G350. Since it went out of my field of view so quickly, I believe it was within about 300 feet of me. Had it been farther away, I would have seen more if its slow westward fight, due to the wider angle of view at that distance. This area is a busy air space for the local airport, (Hanscom AFB) many aircraft make their base leg turn to final approach right here. So, the first second I saw this group of bight lights out over the pond, I assumed that a jet was about to crash. But, there was no noise at all.

The deer were running full speed as well as an owl that flew out of the woods in the area that the object had been.  It is my own personal belief that for what ever reason I felt it had awareness about it, as if it knew I had seen it.  I did not feel threatened in any way, just a sense that I had witnessed something phenomenal.  I feel that it is my duty to report such an unusual occurrence.

I was standing in my back yard facing south looking up at they sky.  I was smoking a cigarette cause I do not smoke in the house.  While looking up in the direction of the stars that make O’ryan ((sic--Orion)), when I was talking to my son showing him the stars.   My son then pointed out a light in the sky moving.  He said it looked like an airplane but saw not flashing lights and was way to high. It looked more like a star moving really fast, when I finally noticed it.   I then called my wife out and 3 of my children came out too, we all watched it but thought maybe it’s a satellite. While watching the light moving at a very fast speed, it stopped.  The star the sat in one spot for about 45 seconds.  That is when it started moving slowly in a sort of circle motion but did not complete a full circle, and then just shot in the East direction EXTREMELY FAST!!   Stopped and sat for a few, then started moving kind of longitudinally direction, back and forth about 4 times.  Still have not seen any colors or anything, still looked like a star just had life to it.  It would also move in the latitudinal  direction back and forth, but at a faster speed then longitude.  It was at this time of 7:40 pm on Tuesday, Feb. 22 2011.   That I decided to contact someone.  Unfortunately, it was dark and did not have a video device to capture evidence.

The night was perfectly still and quiet, and the sky was perfectly clear, cold and my friend immediately spotted the object overhead.  My friend is a career retired Delta Airlines employee, worked the ticket counter.   Our location is in the country and about 12 miles from the Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH), so we see flights come and go.  The object was also observed by my wife. The object was traveling slowly from west to east, it was black against a black sky so no outline could be made out.  It did have white lights and a single blinking green light, which is what we saw move through the night sky.  It made no sound whatsoever, it was totally silent.  My friend said it did zigzag slightly, but I did not notice that.  We observed the object for about 1 minute before it disappeared behind the tree line.  Shortly thereafter we saw a commercial jet that had taken off from IAH airport, it was flying much higher and faster than the object and of course, loud jet engine noise.  So the object was probably at about 7,000’ to 10,000’ altitude if I had to make a guess. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via telephone with the witness, and he corrects the date to February 04, 2011.

We were there for about half an hour digging your typical nails and trash no coins yet, then I got a signal on my detector sounded good so I dug out a plug nothing in the hole so I new it was bigger than a coin and deeper, I dug down about 12 inches or so and seen the target it was silver in color so I called for my cousin to come over and look cause I just new I dug somthing made of silver. I took the taget out of the hole it looked alot like a pool ball but more egg shaped it was very light not soiid feeling more hollow. It! had a clear area around the center looked like glass flush with the rest of the object. I had it in my hand rubbing the dirt off when my cousin noticed that the glass area had some color to it that looked like it was moving like liquid and changing from green to red, I rubbed the area with my fingers to get a better look and thats when this thing shot out of my hand and just sat there in the air about 5 feet away from us, we were both screaming like girls for a second but then just kinda like a reaction I swung my shovel at this thing like a baseball bat and it moved out of the way, by this time my cousin had already took off toward the car so I followed him leaving our detectors just laying there. I yelled at him saying I will get them, I ran toward the detectors and thats when this thing just took off straight up in the air so fast and high we could not even see it anymore, needless to say we thought about calling the cops but we thought they would not believe us and thi! nk we were crazy or something, anyway I have a son in high sch! ool and he does not need everyone in town thinking his dads a nut.

At first I thought it might be a passenger jet's landing lights (as seen from head-on) since we live only a few miles from RDU, but after watching it for about 30 seconds, we realized it could not be a plane because it wasn't moving.  A car was coming up behind me on the street, so we continued on our way to our destination. It takes about 5 minutes to get out of our neighborhood and onto I-540 (the outer loop around Raleigh).  As we were pulling onto 540, we again saw the light(s) ahead of us.  As we got closer, we could start making out the details better.  There were red lights on either side of the 'craft', and white lights in the middle.  540 is a very busy road on Saturday evenings, and as we were getting really close to this object, all of the cars in front of us were slowing down to look at it as well.  It was hovering just above the trees at the intersection of Six Forks Road and 540.  It looked like a ""V"" with large white lights in the center and down both ""wings"" with the red lights on the tips of the wings.  It looked to be about the size of a passenger jet, but again it was not moving.  I wanted to get out and take photos with my phone, but we were running late for our event and my wife didn't want me to stop. Anyway, I'm just hoping that maybe someone else took the time to report this as well as I know many, many people saw this.  Maybe someone can check with air traffic at RDU as it must have been on their radar. It was not a plane, nor was it a helicopter (much too big).

Repeated almost immediately.  It is 22:50 hrs Friday night.   From my seated position in front of the computer, with the window before me, I often see the lights of a plane overhead, and sometimes the spotlight of a police helicopter.  Tonight, I was suddenly alerted to a very unusual orange light in the sky moving across my vision.  It looked quite near by.  I have a big view and was able to keep the two objects in  my vision.   The bright light was getting smaller so I guessed they were moving either away into the distance, or what appeared more likely, moving up high into the sky until they disappeared.   Intrigued and puzzled, I started to write an email to my local residents’ group to ask if anyone else had spotted them, when, suddenly two identical (were they the same ones?) objects appeared in the same position as before and repeated the trajectory of before.  They were coming from ESE, I would guess and disappearing NNW.   I live in North London N8 9NX   I raced upstairs to my front door to stand on an open walkway so as to see them better, and also to check if they were making a noise.  There were three teenage boys also watching them up there.  They had no other information to add. I asked myself if they could be planes, but the light was the wrong colour; it was distinctly orange and flared, rather than being a directed light of a plane spotlight.  Outside I listened hard for an engine noise and could hear none. I am 65, a woman, have been a social worker and later a photographer.  I am not religious, and like science.  This is an objective account of something that was truly puzzling.",2011-02-18T00:00:00,,

It was low in the sky and unusually bright, much brighter than any airplane lights, flashing and drifting very slowly.  I took out my binoculars and while looking at it noticed two things.  It was actually several red and white lights flashing together, very bright and had an L.E.D. quality to the light.  The red and white flashing lights were unnaturally pure and bright.  There was also a small orange, glowing, perfectly round light much dimmer (the color was similar to a setting sun but much smaller.  Just a dot) that seemed to be pulsing in concert with the much brighter red and white lights below it.  It appeared as if the small orange dot was pulsing in communication with the lights below it.  This small orange ball was a separate object judging from the distance above and off to the side of the red/white object.   After observing this thru the binoculars for several minutes the red and white lights separated into two distinct objects. One red and one white.  These two objects flew around each other doing what seemed to be impossible maneuvering at an extremely high rate of speed over a very small area.  Almost like two huge laser beam points dancing in concert together.  The red and white objects were traveling so rapidly in close proximity to each other that they appeared at times as one red and one white streak of light ""dancing"" together creating pretzel like shapes.  The whole time, the orange dot was also observed and kept its relationship to the slow drifting red/white display going on below it.  After observing this for about 5 minutes the objects slowly drifted below the horizon behind the tree tops. I continued to look in the direction with my binoculars for about an hour but saw nothing else out of the ordinary.  I will definitely be looking in the same direction at the same time tonight to see if it happens again.",2011-02-23T00:00:00,41.2246,-73.3768

I was able to see this light with the naked eye.  I was low on the horizon from my point of view.   It was a clear night.  I saw stars a lot higher in the sky and none were no where near the brilliance of the light I saw.  At first I thought it might be a helicopter or a plane but it stayed perfectly still.

I was backpacking in Europe and Africa in 1998 and met two other backpackers at a hotel in a town in Morocco.  I was 23, male, American; others were early 20's Scottish and Canadian, both male.  Other witnesses had been smoking hash, I was completely sober.  We were on the roof of the hotel watching a meteor shower.  There was a (wedding?) party a few blocks away from us with big flood lights that were periodically blowing out all the lights in our section of the town, and there were few street lights.  While I/we were looking up, the object flew directly over us, and I watched it travel from almost directly over us where I first noticed it to the horizon. With no reference objects in the sky I can only guess at the size and speed.  If I held my hand above me at arm's length my thumbnail would have almost covered it. It took 5-6 seconds to travel about 60 degrees across my field of vision.  It seemed much lower than the stars, and I could clearly see the edges, so my guess is it was between the size of a single prop plane and an airliner, flying at about 10,000 feet (higher than a prop plane but much lower than an airliner).  The shape was perfectly geometric: draw a circle, cut it in half, then remove two half circles with the ""corners"" touching from the straight line where the original cut was made and that would be the exact shape.  The result if you were drawing it should be something like a rounded boomarang with a point comming out of the back.  It made no noise at all, and had no running lights.  It appeared to have a dull orange glow; the closest thing I can compare the color/glow to is the coil of an electric stove when the coil is just starting to heat up.  I cannot say if the glow was coming from the object or was a reflection from the lights from the party.   In any case, it was not very bright and since it made no noise, I do not think I would have seen it if I had not already been looking up.   I discussed the sighting with the other witness from Scotland and it was evident he saw what I did; the witness from Canada said he was ""not sure what he saw"" and would not discuss it.  It didn't really have a ""haze or aura around the object"" so I didn't check that box, the light was more like ""on"" the object and didn't extend from it.   If someone wants a verbal description or clarification, or can tell me what it was, I do not mind being contacted by phone or email.

Its color was a dark grey, only a few shades away from the color of the sky.  It had three lights, each one close to a point of the triangle.

There is a very nice house built in this field by its self. At 21:00 on 12/22/2009 as I was driving east along the small yard when I noticed threw the tree to the east in front of me what look like to me at the time two sparks from a bonfire rising into the air and rolling over the top away from me like they were gliding on the wind.   I saw this twice before I pass the trees. When I passed the trees and entered the edge of the field looking now south. I saw that what I thought was sparks was to small lights.  They seemed to be flying in perfect formation. One would rise into the sky and the other would follow in perfect sync copying what the other done perfectly. I got out of the car and watch the small lights rise into the sky then roll over and come back down like floating on air but again in perfect sync.  They then did the same thing over the house. They then rose into the sky and started east.  The front light did a corkscrew move and the one behind it did the same corkscrew move.  They then both drop down at the field still I sync! heading still east. Then rose up over the trees and gone.  The trees were on a knoll so when they went over the trees they dropped over the knoll and out of my sight. I did not see them after that.  I didn’t hang around very long either because I was a little spooked. The whole sighting from the time I saw what I thought were sparks till they were out of my sight was no more then a minute total.  The strange thing was these lights looked small. They looked only the size of a person or maybe a little bigger but not much. I could use the house and trees as a reference and to me they looked small. I am no expert on judging objects in the sky and I my be wrong but to me they could not have been bigger then a small car if that big.,2010-08-30T00:00:00,,

The second time was a whole different sighting. I was on my patio in back of the house and it was dusk, sun was below the horizon but still plenty of light. To the west I saw one again. It got darker and was not solid, like a round cloud but not like a cloud within the circle. It was not perfectly round. Sorta like a mortar firework puff. Anyway, it dissipated slowly in the same place. Then another one formed, got darker and looked the same as the first one. But then I saw a little black dot like like a pencil point travel from the cloud that was going away and where it stopped another one formed. It formed there then the dot moved and another one formed.

Energy ""Orb"" Sphere Sighting :: GULF BREEZE FL.  Hi I'm a homeowner / observer from  .... yep, Gulf Breeze FL .  I have a report on a recent sighting that should match up with other reports in the area.  I'm confident at least 50-100 people would have seen the same thing, to include my neighbor as a witness. Taking out the trash at approx 5:40pm Jan 13, 2010..  looking north from ""midway"" towards Escambia Bay, I saw a bright white/orange-tinted ( about -6 magnitude brightness ) spherical light-form traveling East from Garson Point Bridge towards Eglin AFB's West boundary at a rate of approx 500knts.  As it approached the middle of the bay, about 3-4 seconds since I noticed the object, it made a downward 180 degree turn at the same rate of speed.  I dropped the garbage bag in the driveway, and knew that what I was seeing was not anything in our publicly known aviation inventory. My view was obscured from about 15 degrees from the horizon to the top of the tree line to my North. The object would dive below and above the trees moving in a very similar pattern as a dragonfly. After approx. 2 minutes of viewing I was able to signal my neighbor to be a witness.. after about a minute or two the object shot skyward from it's last position below the tree line as if it were staying in ! a particular piece of airspace in the middle of the bay, approx 1/2 mile wide and below 4000ft.  I should also mention there was a thin cloud layer around 5000ft which helped me judge the distance and scale of the light sphere.  At times the object would traverse and incredible speeds, well in excess of mach2-3 without breaking the sound barrier and without making any audible sound from approx 1mi away.  Traffic from Hwy98 was audible as well as several single engine recreational aircraft off in the distance, west and south of the activity, approx 8-15 miles. The last maneuver the object made was from west to east it climbed to approx 4000ft, turned north, “zig-zagged” in an S pattern and vanished after the 3rd “zag”, not to be seen again. Shortly after a single rotor helicopter came on site ( pursuit ) from west to east along the original path of the sphere, and turned north toward Whiting Field NAS.  No other aircraft approached the area except for a commercial flight leaving PNS traveling North-East, which tells me the airspace was not locked down.  I was under the impression that this object wanted to show-off and be seen.  Also another observation was 3 satellites at 90 degrees elevation, magnitude about +4, intersecting directly above shortly after the sighting. I'm still in awe over this observation.  I'm very familiar with military aviation and aeronautical engineering.  This sphere was defying our physics somehow by moving through the atmosphere at those speeds without disturbing the air.

It was a night flight, I’m not sure what time it was specifically, but a lot of passengers were sleeping.  I’m not sure  what area of the country we were flying over at the time, but my daughter observed some bright lights below, outside the plane window. She was 10, an elementary student, at the time, sitting on the right side of the plane (if facing the front), and I was 35, a police officer, sitting on the aisle.  My boyfriend, who was in the Navy over 30 yrs, and a fire fighter for over 30 yrs, looked out the window and also saw these lights.  I leaned over her to look out the window and I too saw these bright lights below at ground level.  To me, the way I can describe it, was it appeared as if transformers on the ground were exploding, then fading…so a bright blast of light, fast, moving along with the plane.  But there were several flashing at once, and in different sizes of flash, some small and some really big, and it was on the ground, and going about the same speed as the plane, just slightly trailing behind the plane. We were probably at about 35,000 feet and about 400-500 knots, the average flying speed and height.  The night sky was clear and the moon was out.   At first we thought they may be a bunch of transformers blowing up below, but there is no way that many would do that, and if they did, there wouldn’t be any other lights on in the little cities/towns we were flying over.  Then I thought maybe we’re flying over a bunch of little ponds and lakes, and it was the reflection of the moon on the water.  But then we’d pass a highway or a large lake, and you would see the lights all the way up to the highway or lake and then they would jump over to the other side, fast.   And the reflection of the moon on the water was distinctly different.  These lights wouldn’t flash over the water or highways.  When we would pass over a tree/wooded area, we could see these bright lights light up the trees.  If we passed over neighborhoods with street lights, you could see these bright lights light up th! e immediate areas where they were. Then we asked some other passengers to look, they saw what we saw.  We even had a retired air force pilot look.  He said he’s seen some strange things in his air time, but nothing like that.  No one seemed concerned, but we all kept watching. This phenomenon occurred for about 30 minutes, that we had timed it, then just stopped.  Who knows when it started.  So, something on the ground, or just above it, was moving fast enough to keep up with a jet/passenger plane, and bright enough to light up the areas around it…and several at once. I just wanted to know if anyone else had reported anything like this that same night.",2010-08-30T00:00:00,,

Looking straight up, I thought I was looking at some strange new form of fieworks over my house.  However, I soon realized these objects were too high up and too large to be fireworks.   What I saw was two large internally lighted spheres traveling in a northeast to southwest direction toward New Orleans from Slidell where I live.  They were identical spheres traveling at about 50-60 mph, in a perfectly parallel course at the same altitude and speed.  Their altitude appeared to be about 1000 to 1200 feet and they were about the size of a small house or about 75 feet in diameter.  The wind was virtually calm and there was a broken low overcast cloud cover. The spheres appeared to be made of translucent glass or ceramic material which appeared glowed pink over-all with uneven blue and gray horizontal bands around them.  They glowed from within and were clearly visible for about three minutes before disappearing into a low hanging cloud bank.  The strangest characteristic was that they had a collar around the bottom of the spheres which was emitting yellow flames in a downward direction which bent back away from the direction of travel.  Looking up into them was like looking into an upside down can of burning Sterno, but much bigger.  The flames were too big to be a hot air balloon and would have set a balloon on fire because they were also deflected up the sides of the objects by their speed of travel. They were also going too fast, and at too constant a speed and altitude, to have been ballons. There were no navigation lights, beams, or other forms of illumination visible.  They glowed with a soft glow from inside them which made them clearly visible in the night sky.  There were no visible windows or other openings to be seen. They appeared to possibly have been man-made robotic craft of some sort, but I know of no craft with these characteristics that could possibly fly in the manner of these two spheres.  For this reason I have to classify them as unidentified flying objects.

I went outside and saw one large green light and 2 or 3 large red lights flashing and moving together. I didnt see a outline of any object just the lights and I didnt hear any sound. I tried to take a picture and video on my cell phone and I couldnt see anything on it to take , yet if I directed the camera to the moon or the other stars I could see those on my phone.

On August 15, 2010, I was at 22:55 hours along one of the bridges in the Temple Bar district, over the Liffey river - Dublin - Ireland when I saw upon the sea which seemed to be a rocket flare or  Orange light.  This has caught my attention because the light never went away. At one point the trajectory of the rocket stands still and begins to transform into a small disk and started approaching the city and the area of observation. I left the area of the bridge and sticked close to a building that could give me a possibility of covered area but continued to attend the same approach. However, the subject held his course, and exhibited an additional light that turned towards the bridges. Returned to walk in another direction, for example, approaching the other side and turned his light towards a monument. When the subject has stopped in the area of observation it was almost over my head. While standing on top of the observation zone, its light (which to me seeme! d a kind of probe) directed her toward the area of nightlife  and then went in the direction of the bridge next to the West . Being the nearest point of observation, I note the discoid shape of the object, brown with a more nebulous area in the base bottom center of the disc, giving the idea that this area is moving. The object was low in altitude, no more than 100 meters. The subject did not exhibit any noise or sound. Returning to move slowly forward until the next bridge, also changing its path. Stopped over this (where many people walked) and drove his light / probe towards the main street and monument of the city. Speeding up and leaned for a moment seemed to gain a little altitude and then dive (giving the notion of sudden loss of altitude) towards the northwest on the horizon of observation (almost like land), disappearing. The observation lasted at least a minute. After this, looking for any witnesses, found no one to look to heaven and once I was in a foreign count! ry and in a problematic nightlife área I kepted to myself.

At around 10:45AM, while approaching Washington, PA on I-70W, a large object in the northern sky caught my attention.  Since there was a bit of traffic and I was driving relatively slowly, I was able to observe the object for approximately 45 seconds. The first instant I saw it, I thought it must have been a very large, low flying jet of some sort, but further observation ruled that out.  The object was long, thin, tapered at each end, with a somewhat thicker section in the middle of the craft. It was a solid white in color and was flying at about 8 inches (visually) above the treeline.  It was at least five inches long at arm's length from end to end, and maybe about an inch maximum from top to bottom at the thickest part. Again, it appeared to be very large.  I could see that it was definitely gliding toward my general direction at a steady speed.  I could not distinguish the exact! shape of the craft as I was looking at an approaching object dead-on. In my opinion, it was probably a large disk or chevron-shaped craft.  There was no sound and I saw no contrail. It was very startling due to the size and nature of the object.  It was unlike anything I am familiar with seeing in the sky.  I was unable to see where it went after I drove past it.

The sky was clear, with a full moon illuminating the sky considerably. While looking at the moon we witnessed a very bright, solid white, orb-like object float into our field of view.  We don’t know where it originated from as it seemed to have simply appeared. As we watched the light, we witnessed it accelerate fluidly and slow down just the same.  The object was able to make left, right, up, and down movements while changing altitudes quickly.  This object was totally silent, and it traversed the length of our house, but must have been at least a couple of miles away.   The light then moved behind the trees just behind our house.  Yet, being as bright as it was, we were still able to maintain visual contact and track its movement.  We were at this point standing on my neighbor’s porch, my girlfriend on my right, when the object vanished.  Simultaneously, a shooting white light shot off into space faster than lightening.  The light trail was almost imperceptible to the eye, and it’s duration a fraction of a second.  Almost like a reverse shooting star. At this point, we were stunned because we knew it was like nothing we had ever seen.  As we sat and discussed the object/light, we continued watching the sky. It couldn’t have been mo re than 5 or ten minutes since the other object vanished when we began to see multiple high-altitude aircraft flying towards the area where the object had been.  These aircraft made no sound, and had blue and red quick flashing/blinking lights.  These lights flashed quickly and they appeared to be set in a rectangular shape or pattern.  One after another, these aircraft continued to appear at what looked like the same altitude and speed; the latter being hard to estimate.  At one point, it appeared these craft were assuming a triangular formation or were flying in a formation directly above where we witnessed the first object. I estimate seeing at least 10 of these aircraft, and I do not believe these were commercial aircraft.  I think it’s possible they were military in nature, and that they also may have been circling the area.  These aircraft eventually disappeared, maintaining the same direction, speed, and altitude.",2010-08-30T00:00:00,36.13170004240882,-86.7768134860051

It had height, width, and depth.

They also witnessed it dim ! until not visible, then fade back in, then faded back out.  Person 3 noticed the light fade back in while simultaneously the other two noticed another light higher and brighter than the original and getting brighter, thinking it was the original. At this point the three thought they were looking at the same light, person 1 and 2 kept saying, “ It’s getting brighter!”  Person 3 noticed that he was looking at a different light because the one he was looking at was getting dimmer then disappeared then reappeared then he noticed they were looking higher up in the sky and had to lean forward to see the other light which was really bright.

I was looking out the window in a north east direction and contemplating taking my telescope out to view the night sky as the moon was very bright in the eastern sky low above the trees. I was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia when there was a bright star that began to descend from the constellation. As it descend it got brighter and very large then began to move in a north eastern direction rapidly.  The total experience was less than 1 minute. Background: I often lay on my couch watching television and look out a 6’wide by 10’ high sliding glass patio doorway.  When looking out the sliding glass doors I am facing in a north eastern direction.  My wife and I live somewhat near the O’Hare Airport and are in the direct line of incoming and outgoing air traffic.  So, I am very familiar with aircraft and their appearance both in daylight and dark night skies.  I have seen aircraft flying low and high and feel I can tell the difference between aircraft and what I saw on 8/26/2010 at 9:03pm. 9:03pm 8/26/2010: I had spent the evening noticing how the sky was clear and how the moon was very bright and low in the eastern sky. At approximately 8:50pm CST I noticed a bright star below the moon and wondered if it was a planet.  I took a walk back into a spare room where I keep my 10” Orion Dobsonian Telescope. But as it was going to be too much trouble to take it out of the storage closet I decided against it.  I walked back to the living room and lay upon the couch and was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia and noticed that from out of view above the sliding glass door a star was getting brighter and looked as though it was descending directly from the constellation. Over the next few second the star got very large, bright white and began to slow its descent. At this point I called for my wife in our bedroom reading a book to please look out the window, as the bedroom window are on the same north eastern facing wall.  She said she could not see a thing, as I assumed she had alrea! dy closed the drapes as she always does. As this conversation was happening the object had gotten very large and stopped descending. It was at a magnitude I have never witnessed before.  My wife did come out of the room and asked what I wanted her to see, as my request was unusual and I was shocked at what was happening and I think she could hear that in my voice.  I continued to observe the object and it got suddenly got very bright and moved in a north easterly direction rapidly.   When she joined me at the sliding glass door, I pointed out the object and she said “you mean that star”.  When my wife said “you mean that star”, the object had already become about an 15th of its largest size and had moved out and away from us. It moved rapidly and then disappeared into the sky in that same direction.  She said it probably was plane, but she had not witnessed the full event. Conclusion: In the two years I have been living here and observing the night sky and passage of commercial planes I have never witnessed anything like this before.  The object I saw was round and moved like nothing I had ever seen before.  It descended rapidly from what appeared to be a small star to a large round object. It hovered for a second before rapidly moving out of sight.  There were no blinking lights on the object like on the commercial craft that fly overhead constantly.  And as this was a clear night I am an amateur astronomer I cannot identify what it was that I witnessed. My only conclusion would be to say that this was an UFO.",2010-08-30T00:00:00,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089

I live near I-75 and the Griffen Road exit in Broward county FL.  The conditions were partly cloudy with a very distant thunderstorm South East of my location approximately 25 or more miles in the area of North Miami Beach. I was on the phone when I noticed two bright light orange redish lights flying! sided by side approximately 10 miles south of my location.  The were flying at what appeared to be low speeds and in the midst of low level clouds.   The lights appeared to be bigger than what you would expect from lights shinning on an airplane at that distance.  They flew for maybe 1 minute heading west and then turned together toward the south. The light was directional for one of the objects and was not for the other.  In other words, as one of the objects turned south, its light turned with it.  The other object seemed to turn the light after it had turned south. They repeated the same flyby another 3 times.  The lights seemed to dim and then brighten as they flew by.  When the lights turned south there were no flashing strobe lights to indicate it was an airplane. My parents witnessed the lights from their car just south of my location less than a quarter mile away. I confirmed they saw and object with orange redish lights and they thought it was an airplane at first! , but my dad noticed there were no recognizable lights that a ! typical airplane would carry.  Still can't explain what it was, but would love to know if anyone else in the South West Broward area saw lights at the same time I did.",2010-08-30T00:00:00,26.0629,-80.2331

Every few seconds more would float up until there were about 20 to 30 in the sky. We pulled over into a nearby plaza to get a better look and try to get some pictures.  Several other people had pulled in to look at them too.  One guy yelled out his window to us ""what ARE those?""   We answered that we had no idea. The objects were completely silent. They left no trails.  They looked like orangish-reddish fire, they flickered, but it was clear that it was not aircraft lights (like red/white of planes).  Also they didn't appear to flash uniformily like a light bulb would.  It looked more like the flickering of fire. After a while the lights started to flicker out.  But my husband then pointed to where one of them was and we saw that we could still see something moving against the sky, it was just completely darkened.

They were absolutely silent and moved slightly sporadically.  The disks were spinning, but not on a perfect axis.  They were not in sync, but they stayed relatively close to one another for the approximate two minutes in which I observed them. It seemed as though they were moving closer and they flew higher extremely fast.   From my perspective, it seemed as if they flew straight up into the sky. I was able to keep an eye on the objects the whole time until I had to travel below an overpass and I lost sight of the objects, which were very far away the last time I had my eye on them. I was a passenger in a car with two other people, who both observed the objects.  Traffic notably slowed down on the exit ramp, as I assume that other drivers noticed them as well. When the car I was in parked at the mall, I got out and saw an unmarked plane, and I am! not sure if it had any relation to the UFO sighting I had witnessed minutes before.   The sighting did not have any physical effects on me or on any of the other passengers in the car that I was traveling in.  As one who takes particular interest in UFOs I was absolutely speechless to observe the sighting, and it has left a traumatizing mental effect, as the images I saw have been in my head the whole day. I am very curious as to whether or not anybody else reported the sighting.",2010-08-30T00:00:00,39.65195779310345,-75.71214262068966

When i went up to his door i glanced around and happened to see a bunch of strange lights through the trees that divided his property from the neighbors property.  My friend was on the phone when he answered the door, and when i saw the lights i became curious and decided to walk back towards the edge of the property where i could better see them.  As i stood watching them i noticed that the lights were moving.  There was a group of about 8 to 10 lights congregated and 2 lights that seemed to be following the larger group from a distance.  The larger group of lights seemed to be spaced apart from one another in a way that formed a kind of half moon shape.  Each light that was in the half moon shape seemed to be at almost a perfect distance from each other.  There were also a few lights around the half moon shape that were not part of this alignment.  As i realized that what i was seeing was something i couldn't exp! lain i decided to call my friend over and point out what i was seeing.  Once my friend saw the lights we continued to watch and follow them on foot as they moved west.  They didn't make any abrupt movements, however some of them moved up and down in the sky and some seemed to hover in one spot while others moved more quickly.  After a short period of time some of the lights began to dim. It was like one of those touch lamps with different settings of brightness on it.  Some of the lights seemed to dim quicker than others, but before disappearing completely they looked white like a star.  There also seemed to be a red blinking light that became more visible as the light dimmed.  The lights at their brightest looked similar to an orb or candle flame if you could control the shape of flame to a circular shape.  My friend was able to capture a short video of the two lights that seemed to be following the larger congregation of lights.  Whatever these objects were they did not give off ! any sound.  Also, at one point one of the lights moved towards one of t he other lights. When the light got close to the other light it dimmed out and disappeared.",2012-03-13T00:00:00,44.2688769005848,-88.41372894736843

Last night I let my dog out in the back yard and earlier in the night I had seen Venus and Jupiter.   I was looking to see if I could still see them but they had set by this point.  When I looked up to the south west away from my house I saw a V shaped object flying from left to right (south to north).  It was a flying V of orangish dim lights with the point of the V being the front.  There were about 6 lights on each ""wing"" of the V.  The individual lights looked strange and more of a halo than a normal light having a dimmer center and brighter ring around the center of each light.  I watched the object for about 30 seconds and tried to pull my phone out and take a picture but was not able to get one, probably because it was too dim.  Within a few seconds of this the object moved behind some trees and I lost track of it behind the bare branches.  I live close to the Bloomington IL airport and am used to hearing and seeing planes.   This was not like anything I have ever seen before and it was completely silent.  I did have the thought that it may be multiple planes flying in formation, but the lights did not look like lights I've ever seen on a plane before.   In addition to that, it would have been about a dozen planes flying in a perfect V formation which does not seem likely.  It was not moving across the sky very fast so it was either low and slow, or at a pretty high altitude.  If this object was moving the speed of a normal jet and at about the same altitude as them then it was much larger than any passenger plane.   I have no idea what this thing was.  The only thing I've ever seen before this that looked anything like it was from a Discovery tv show about UFOs.  I'm not exactly convinced it was some alien spaceship, but I do know it wasn't something we normally see flying around. ",2012-03-13T00:00:00,40.47267919621749,-88.95847375886524

Given the altitude, it seemed too bright and too wide to be the beam of (for instance) the light on a police helicopter.  Furthermore, a couple of the lights turned very quickly at right angles and did not ""sweep"" in the way a searchlight would have moved. The best way that I can describe the 'shape' of the light is to ask you to picture a comet.  There's the head of the comet and then the tail that gradually fades out. These bursts of light were like that, only they were in reverse of the direction that a comet would go.  In other words, if traveling west, the tail would come first and then the brightness would race ahead and then just black out. I can't guess the distance that they moved over, but from the plane window, I would say it covered a good 6 inches, so on the ground, that would have been pretty far, maybe a mile??  The lights were bright white.  Again, a couple of the lights turned in different directions, but the majority of them just went straight. There weren't a lot of people on the plane and I didn't hear folks talking about it as they got off in ABQ.  I did go up and talk to the pilot before the new passengers boarded for the rest of the flight to Tucson, but he didn’t see anything because he was focused on the approach to the airport.

I wondered if my other daughter was downstairs using the cake mixer, but, in the past, the cake mixer never sounded like that, nor did the sound carry upstairs. We decided to get our video recorder and go outside.  That is when we saw a red flashing light.  It flashed like a strobe light.

They were moving so slow.  My wife and I were able to get a good long look at them.  We both quickly tried to dismiss them as some kind of new year lanterns, but their color was so vibrantly warm and completely uniform.  There was absolutely no deviation in their luminosity, no flickering as if the light were to come from candles.  They did not rise in the air whatsoever as if to be a hot air balloon.  They didn't rise rapidly as to be filled with helium or any other lighter-than-air gas. Their were no signs of rockets attached to them.  They were not filled with LED lights, the light almost appeared solid, uniform.  We watched them drift, but with absolutely no wind behind them, in fact no wind at all.  They also made no noise, no mechanical sounds;engines, rotors etc.  Walking back through my home I went out the back door and continued to follow them glide over a neighbors home about two plots away.

The other two remained to slowly venture north never changing in eleva! tion.  I watched them until they could no longer be seen above the horizon.

I have seen several UFOs in my lifetime and reported them here.  But my first experience with UFOs was when I was around 7 years old and did not see anything, but my father did. The time of this sighting is an estimate.  I know where I lived at the time of this sighting and I was probably seven years old.  It happened early in the morning, and I was not in school, so I am guessing it occurred during summer vacation. I remember my Dad and I were riding in his Oldsmobile 88, and we were traveling east on I-85 near Groometown Rd. in Greensboro, N.C.  I know that because we had just left my grandparent’s house on Groometown Rd., they lived just a quarter mile off the highway. It was a very bright and sunny morning, and the sun was shining directly in our faces.  Suddenly my dad became very excited and started shouting, “Look, look!"" and pointing to his right which would have been southeast.  I turned and looked, but I was blinded by the glare of the sun and could not see anything.  I have very sensitive light green eyes and have squinted all my life when in sunlight. I said, “What is it Dad? Where is it?” He kept pointing and said, “Look, just over the trees there!”   Again, I looked in the direction he pointed, but I could not see anything, and again the glare of the sunlight was giving me difficulty seeing. Then, my Dad said, “It’s gone, it flew away.” I asked him what it was.  My Dad told me he saw a bright silver cigar standing vertically come up out out the trees to our right, it leveled off horizontally just above the trees, and then just flew away. It was a very short sighting, maybe ten to twenty seconds at most.  My  Dad was very puzzled at what he had seen.  He described it like ""a rocket"", a long silver cigar object, about the length of the trees it came up out of.  I am not sure how far away it was, but I got the impression it was very close. We heard no sounds. So, I did not see this object, but I believed my Dad.  He was a very serious and sober person who did not often joke around. He was not one to make up stories at all.  My Dad (passed away in 2009) was a very intelligent and educated man, he was a radar technician in WWII and served aboard an aircraft carrier.  He worked as a civilian for the military as a radar technician until he retired, so he was also very familiar with military aircraft. That’s about it, this was my first experience with UFOs.  I saw others years later in Florida where we had moved as a teen, and yet more in Connecticut where I have lived the past 23 years.  But this first experience I did not see anything.

After the jet got out of sight I kept watching the same area in the sky and then all the sudden it was like it came from the ground behind a hill the same orange object rising in the sky.  After seeing it again for about 2 minutes this time till another passenger jet flew over the area it disappeared again.. After a few seconds of that jet getting out of sight I kept watching the same area and sure enough it came up over the same hill again but then a couple seconds more another one came over the same hill in the same path as the first, now there was 2 of them they were just sitting still then started to go higher and then another jet had to fly over the area and they both disappeared at the same time.. I watched the 2 for about 5 minutes... I took a couple photos with my phone but all u can see is the lights against the black so its hard to say what they are in the photo.... I kept on fishing and watching the that area but nothing came back...  Till about 2 hrs later I was on the other side of the lake facing south when all of the sudden another orange light appeared from the south moving north right towards me and much closer and as it got closer the outside edge around the object got red and the inside of it looked like a fireball, it got almost right above me when it made a turn to the west and just disappeared like the other ones...  I watched this one for about 6 minutes and I got a photo of this one to but the same results...  This was the 3 time this summer I had seen these lights the first time was 3 months prier to this and was fishing the same lake, the second time was at my house about a mile from Devils Lake...

The noise persisted and I got a very strange feeling so I went downstairs and out on the deck to investigate more. My little brother said he did not hear anything, and as I was describing to him the strange feeling I had and noise I heard I looked out the window to my right.  The sky looked like it was flashing. I yelled to my brother to get up and come look and he replied that it was lightning, although it was only in one part of the sky (in the North East) directly out the second floor window we were looking.   As we kept watching the strobe-lighted sky, a strange formation of red, blue and white lights rose from behind the trees. It grew bigger, may have been spherical and was obstructed from complete view. we watched i! t silently as it appeared to hover tree level directly at us, its lights blinking in a strange formation.  Seconds later it was gone.  There was now nothing where we were looking, just the normal night sky. I don't know what we saw, and my brother agrees it was very strange, although is skeptical (""There MUST be some explanation""). I am especially freaked out because I just discovered this website randomly the day before. I had a wierd feeling and it led me to this window and what I saw I can not forget or ignore.

When i looked up i saw 3 lights that were blinking red, white, and green. they were zipping back and forth up and down so it couldnt have been a plane or helicopter. at one point all 3 stopped and formed a triangle in the sky and each had two white lights blinking with a red one at the top (thats how i could tell it was triangular) and did this for about half a minute. i then ran inside and grabbed a coworker and pulled him out to look at it. when we got back there were two still there and they were zipping bakcand forth blinking again. then the third showed up again. at this point it was about 9 o clock PM central time and my coworker had to clock out. he went home, but then about 5 more of my coworkers came out and watched it as well. after a while they just stood in place!  2 of them dissappeard gradually one by one until one was there and it was blinking red and white. it then dissappeared as well.

I looked out and saw that there were some kids messing around and they had taken the balloons that are sometimes outside of the office, across the parking lot. They ran west in front of the office and around the corner and then south away from me. As they did this they let go of the balloons which floated up into the sky. I was watching the balloons float higher and higher and lost sight of them, and since I was already looking at the sky, I decided to see what stars I could see. At this time is when I saw what I first thought was a satellite. I quickly realized that this was about twice the size of what a satellite usually looks like, although it was the same brightness as the typical satellite, maybe a tad brighter.  The other thing that I noticed was that it was the fastest satellite that I have ever seen. I have seen hundreds of satellites in my years of stargazing, but nothing this fast. It wasn't anywhere near as fast as a shooting star, but for anything else, it was fast. I would estimate that it was going 2-3 times as fast as a quick moving satellite. I looked away from it for just long enough to raise the blinds the rest of the way up, they were half way down, when I looked back where it should be, it was either gone or turned off.  Almost forgot to mention, it was heading due south.  I also checked on Heavens Above and didn't see satellites for the time I saw it or any going from North to South. It also was not the ISS. I've seen it many many times and know that that was not it.  The ISS is much brighter than what I saw and also much slower than what I saw, not to mention that it had already passed by this area at at 9:07pm, and went from WNW to ENE, so it was well to the north of me.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,47.29995649484537,-122.18088288659793

I also noticed a much fainter reddish star which seemed to be moving.  As I watched it picked up speed and arced behind the trees.  The distance seemed to be substantial but I could not hazard a guess.  I’m guessing because the object was very small and faint and could easily be missed. Then I saw another one and then another and another.   Probably happened 7 or 8 times when I went inside to have my wife look,(to make sure I wasn’t crazy). She came out but we only saw one more. I looked again on Thursday night but it was after 11pm and I saw nothing. On Friday night, I went out at about the same time that I saw them on Wednesday and sure enough, I started seeing them again. They seem not to move fast at first but then accelerate rapidly and usually arcing either north or south.  At least one did go in a straight line from approximately north to south.  Whether one craft reappearing or several I do not know. This morning I went out and checked my landmarks and came in and brought up goole earth.  When I run a straight line from my position through the direction I was looking, I end up over McChord afb. These lights did not look like planes to me.  I saw no blinking lights and if they were over McChord, they were much faster than any type of plane, military or not, that I’m aware of.   Maybe some kind of flare but that doesn’t account for their pattern of flight nor speed. I’m a skeptic on ufo sightings but do think there are real sightings of things that cannot be eexplained.  I think these probably have some sort of military hardware explanation but I’d like to know what it is. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Continued from my other report. Went out about 10 after 9 tonight and they were there again.  I then looked in a more southerly direction and they were over in that direction also.  Most start at a point in sky and angle down from right to left.  Some were going straight up and some actually did loops.  A couple of times I'd see them appear to stop and turn sharply and go the other way.   Trees still block lower sight. Then I went out into the yard and to my surprise I was able to pick them out almost everywhere I looked. This made me think that maybe they were bats or birds with town lights reflecting but bats wouldn't and they just don't fly like birds.   Tried to imagine they were moths but they sure don't fly like moths either. Don't know how many nights it may continue ((END ADDENDUM))",2011-10-10T00:00:00,47.1054,-122.0457

The aircraft appeared to be ~15% lower in altitude than the jetliner and a few miles at most south-east of the jetliner when the course change happened.  The jetliner was rapidly approaching the position of the triangle aircraft and they all were heading generally eastward though the triangle aircraft group course did appear to be converging on the airliner's course and after the bank to the south they appeared to be diverging and dropping altitude.  None of these aircraft were above 20000ft AMSL.  From my location the aircraft were in the northern sky and 50-60 degrees above the horizon (less than 8 miles away). I had not noticed the triangle aircraft until they had changed course, when they banked into the down and to the right curve, the apparent color of the underside of the triangles brightened enough to become visible against the clear blue sky. The triangle aircraft were large though the jetliner was larger and moving faster.  They did not make a visible exhaust trail and I didn't hear anything.  The flight path and mode appeared to be ordinary gliding. When the triangle aircraft leveled off again, they disappeared to my eye by once again becoming the same color and brightness as the sky.  It was as if it were possible to control the brightness and coloration of the underside or entirety of the aircraft.  I would have dismissed my observation as being motorized hang gliders if not for this fade-away. I continued to watch that area of sky for a few minutes longer and didn't see anything more.

My window was a big bay window.  At the time my aunt had a car that was very loud, like the engine was loud. I was laying in bed and heard what I thought was their car in our yard so I sat up to listen.   At that moment the woods and the side of the yard my window faced, was illuminated light that I would compare to a florescent shop light color.  I sat there and was thinking some idiot was trying to drive down the trail thinking it was a finished road.  Then in a southeast to northwest direction came this circle possibly oval shaped light in the sky.  I was beeping and moved in a zigzag fash! ion. to see this go across the sky took 3 seconds.  I did not try to look out my other window, I was so scared I covered my head and froze until I fell asleep.

I don't remember why we would do such a thing after dark out on a country road with no lights or houses around, but we did.  After we arrived at a certain spot the four of us got out and took a couple of blankets and some sandwiches and drinks out of the car and went down the embankment.  We ate and talked for about 20 or 30 minutes.  The two men got up and walked towards the river's edge and were throwing rocks in the water, when I noticed a bright light across the opposite side of the river and some distance away over the woods.   The light was moving towards us and getting larger.  They guys thought it was a star at first, then realized it wasn't because of the size of it.  Then the light shown on the water.  We thought it must be a helicopter.  It moved quickly towards us, getting larger and ! larger as it approached, heading directly for us and flying very low – maybe 60 feet or less above our heads. The odd thing was that there was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  As the bright white light came over all of us, we ran up the embankment, intending to get into the car.  At that point, my memory is a blank.  All I remember after that is getting back to the house at about 12:30 am and not knowing how we got there.  With time to drive to the location and eating it should have been one hour before we headed back, so we should have arrived at the house at about 10:30 pm.  So we had two hours of missing time.  I spoke to my husband and our neighbors about it the next morning but all they said was it must have been a helicopter.  No one had a good explanation for what happened and none of them wanted to talk about it anymore.  I often wondered what happened that night and since then asked my now ex-husband about it two or three times since our divorce in 1981.  He claims he remembers nothing at all – not even going out to have a picnic that night. I lost track of the neighbors so can't ask them about it.  I had a regression done by a licensed therapist recently and found out that we did not get into the car when I thought we did.  The light stopped right over our heads and there was a large cylindrical craft hovering above us. We were taken up into the light and onto a craft, where I saw each person take to a different room by short, grey beings.  I was not afraid or trying to get away during this experience.  I was allowed to look out of a window as the craft moved away from the Earth, and watched as the Earth got smaller and smaller.  Then the craft took off at a high rate of speed and I could no longer see objects out of the window.  I was taken to a room and sat on a table, where a couple of these beings placed needles in my arms and calves.  They didn't hurt.  They had me look into some type of eye examination device that had a bluish light inside of it.  I couldn't focus on many details in the room – or perhaps there were none to see besides what they brought near me.  ! I could hear talking in an unknown tongue, but also sensed that there was some type of telepathic communication between me and one of the beings, who stayed near me the entire time. I don't know if they were male or female.  They were muscular, thin framed, short (about 4' tall), had no body hair or hair on their heads.  The heads were large, and the being with me had a larger head than the others did and he had a more whitish tinge to his skin.  I remember seeing his mouth move.  He had big eyes with large irises that were a strange lavender color.  I remember thinking that must be why I am leery of people with lavender eyes. I was then shown a planet outside the window that did not look like Earth. It had two moons, with one larger than the other and farther away than the smaller one.  We did not land on this planet, but the being told me some things about it that I can't remembers.  We were shortly taken back to our vehicle.  I did not see how they got us to drive or get! to our house. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2011-10-10T00:00:00,39.3777,-93.4775

The restaurant was located approximately two miles from my house.  In the summer of 1955, we, me and my two friends, were half way home at approximately 11:30 pm on a Saturday night walking and discussing which girls in my town were pretty and their physical attributes and the ones we would like to makeout with.  I mentioned this about the girls just to let you know that UFOS were no where near my thoughts at that time.   I was thirteen and half, my first friend was fourteen and my second friend was fifteen.  That night the sky was chrystal clear for my town had no street lights that could have distorted my view of what I was about to witness.  As I stated, we were half way to my house when a sparkling object 90 degree angle to my left caught the corner of my left eye.  The sparkling white object was about fifty feet off the ground and about a quarter mile away and the size of Venus from my perspective located over or beginning of the negro quarters as we called it at that time.   When I turned my head to look at what had gotten my attention, the sparkling white object begain to move rapidly toward me, but not in a straight line instead it corrected its course to the right and swoopped around the backside of the rock dump then corrected its course to come to hover about twenty feet above my head the object size had grown from the size of Venus to the size of a beach ball and and the color changed from white to translucent yellow to translucent orange then there was a slight pause in the color change maybe one to two seconds then a stark color change going from traslucent orange to a cloudy smokey flat black to black the pause of flight was over it went up veritical at a rapid rate out of my sight.   Let me point out that once the object began to move, the sparkle stopped, but the object was white until it paused above my head.  When the size and color trasformation occured.  The object never emitted a sound at any time from movement to pause.   After the object disappeared, I turned to my friends and ask,""What was that"", and their response was ,""What was what"". Apparently I was the only one to witness this event. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",,,

In the very early spring of 1966, my senior class was on a biology field trip to Bowman Springs Park on the southwest shore of Lake Arlington just north of Kennedale TX. About an hour after we arrived, maybe 10:30 AM, a classmate looked up to the northwest toward the direction of Ft Worth and exclaimed about a odd aircraft and which we all took notice. Just over the tree line of the opposite side of the lake at an elevation of about 25 degrees and an angle of northwest by west of our location; moving in what appeared to be a northeast or easterly direction; was a large object, cylindrical in shape, silver shading to gold in color. Distance made it difficult to determine its size. The mind wanted to say it was just an jet airliner viewed from the side glowing in the east rising sun. The more I watched and listened to the comments made by my contemporaries and our teacher Mrs. Adams, the more I became convinced it was far too large and moving much too slow for it to be any type of air lift craft in current use. Suddenly the craft seemed to spin in place on a central axis in our direction and began to rapidly fly in an east by south direction. The speed in which this happened was astounding. In fact it seemed that the craft moved from the far distance over the horizon to where we were and past in the space of a few short breaths and was gone. At no time while observing this did my mind think I was seeing anything other than a solid physical object moving without obvious means of lift. The speed with which the craft moved was beyond anything I had ever seen or have witnessed since. For what it is worth I think the craft was in no way compatible with known human science at the time or aircraft manufacture of the mid-60s.

A few minutes later I heard a low whirring sound, sort of like a washing machine spin cycle in the distance, but it sounded stationary and above our house. I went out the front door and looked up followed by my father, he said to get the camera, but it was out of film. What I saw was about 30 to 40 feet wide and about 15 feet high with an amber row of square windows around the center. It was saucer shape, the same angles on the top 1/3 as the bottom 1/3 with the window section also about 1/3 high and straight vertical. It appeared flat on top and bottom.

My mother seemed concerned as did my father.  When we children asked what was going on, my father just said that there were some funny lights in the sky.  I looked around and noticed that more than half of the cars around us had the adults standing outside them looking up at the lights.  We all got out of the car to look and at that point the movie was turned off.  Some people were yelling for the drive-in to turn off the lights so that ""they"" would not see us.   We watched for over a half hour as a long, cigar-shaped object that blocked out the clouds illuminated by the moon.  It ca! me in parallel to the ground and then proceeded to turn upright so it was standing on an 'end'.   Then over 10 shiny disc-shaped objects shot of the bottom and zoomed around at all directions and ""danced"" in the sky.   After about 20 minutes they all shot back and came to a dead stop, stacking up like plates and then ascended up into the larger cigar-shaped object which then rotated again to be parallel with the ground and then it took off at a rapid speed and was out of sight in seconds.   I distinctly remember my father referring to the large craft as a mother ship.   We immediately left the drive-in and I listened to my mother and father talking about what they saw.

I have often thought about going to a hypnosis and find out more about what happened to me but it will not do me any good as I think in my mind to know what happened unless there was cause to be alarmed as to why this would happen to a young girl as bright and happy as I was when I was a child.. I do NOT remember screaming for my mother or my father.. I tried to scream when I was a kid for MY Mommy but The creature would not let me.. I know it was a female creature as she smiled at me as to say its ok before she disappeared into the morning. I have never opened up and told this story only to my family who thinks I am nothing but crazy only MY oldest sister doesnt think so for she remembers being takien as well but did not know I went with her.. I guess this will be something I have to live with since the Government doesnt care what happened or why or what this is all about and they think we ar! e nuts the people who have been taken.. I am one of them and I know for sure a child would not lie about something so tramatic that happened in her life..  I only wish I had someone to talk to about this as it is time to come out.. I am 53 years old now and things are coming to me all the time about this little girl that was taken and who knows what they did to me.. BUT today is the day to let the world know that children are also not safe and they too can be taken by these Aliens as I was.. I DO hope that someone would email me as I sure could use a support group of people who have been through what I have.. it is a thing I will not forget they were clammy and rubber feeling why I do NOT know.. I know nothing more than I remember as I was a child.. But this is the truth and nothing but the truth.. Thanks to all of you who actually care and who ever wants to know more please email me with who I am to talk to about something that happened to me in the 60's not sure of the dat! es just put down what I remembered as far as I could.. I was so young. Thanks again for listening.. I do hope I get a email with a support group of people who have been through what I have.. Gerri",,41.9597,-72.7961

I was taking US Army advanced individual training (AIT) at Ft. Lewis, Washington in the summer of 1967, and was practicing setting up a squad perimeter defense at night.  A buddy and I were assigned a ‘foxhole’ and told to watch out for the ‘enemy’.  We were basically just lying around in the depression that was our ‘foxhole’, listening and watching for anyone approaching.  It was a clear night, and there were no lights or vegetation, other than grass, nearby, so the sky was broad and full of stars.  We saw at least one satellite go across the sky, i.e. a point of light looking like a star, but traveling in a straight line and a constant speed.  Then we noticed, practically straight up, three points of light that came from different directions approaching each other.  They looked very high, and no different than the satellite or the stars.  They stopped at equal distances from each other, sort of forming a triangle, and hovered there.  After a short time, they each streaked off in different directions.  My buddy and I agreed not to say anything about the sighting because we didn’t need or want any hassle from the Army or anyone else.  I’ve always just told myself that we saw what we saw, and I didn’t need anyone telling me we didn’t see it.  I’m reporting it now because I’m getting older and might die at any time.  I just thought other UFO followers would like to know about it.  I don’t have anything else to say about it, here or at any time.

A younger brother and myself (ages six and twelve respectively) stayed with him then in the months of July and August.   One night (I don't remember the exact date), my brother and I were in our sleeping bags talking and looking up at the sky before falling to sleep.  My best estimate of the time would be 9:30pm. As we were talking, I noticed three non-blinking lights in the sky, in an equilateral triangle shape and traveling West to East (paralleling the islands length).  It was just off the South shore and about 400 feet above us.  I believe it was about midway in size to a small plane and a 747.  It made no noise.  The lights were not overly bright.  They may have been amber or a dim white.  I could see no stars within the triangle shape defined by the three points.  It appeared to be moving slower (perhaps by as much as half) the speed of a conventional aircraft. I directed my brothers attention to it but I don't think he paid much attention since he was immersed in his conversation.  When I asked him about it a few years ago, he didn't remember it.

I was serving in the Army in Viet Nam in 1967 and was in the field at Dakto attached to the 4th Infantry Division providing radio relay and carrier support as part of a detached team from the 167 Signal Company.  In all of these years, I have never reported this event nor told many people about it.   I am retired now, but had a long career in public service and can be vouched for by many for being a conservative, level headed and highly credible individual.  I stepped out of the shower (directly to the outdoors as the shower was simply a wood frame with a 55 gal drum on top filled with water and a spigit to release the water) late in the evening so it was dark (and almost no ambient light in the Viet Nam boondocks) and the night sky highly visible with no cloud cover.  The Viet Nam night sky is almost devoid of stars except for a few scattered along the northern horizon and the moon was either not out or not bright.  In that type of setting, I always look up at the sky as I do anywhere I have a good view of the night sky.  I am a habitual night sky watcher, but not in any amateur astronomer sense, rather just looking at the stars and the Milky Way when I am where I can see them and watching for satellites (I think having been able to watch Sputnik pass overhead when I was in high school had something to do with that).  When I looked up, all that was in the sky was an object that was about 40 degrees above the northern horizon at about my 2:00 o’clock as I stood facing northwest.   The object looked the way a satellite looks in the night sky in terms of size, shape and reflected light, but that is not what is was.  Rather than moving in a straight line across the sky (although satellites can look a little wobbly at times, which this did not) it was moving in a sharp zig zag pattern, while at the same time making forward progress at a rate much slower than a satellite moves across the sky.   Although the forward progress was not fast, its sig zag movements were very quick.  The sig zag movement was very sharp and precise in the distance it moved right to left and in the angle it moved forward with each sig and zag.  This movement was not erratic in any sense of the word nor was the object wandering in any way.  Although the object moved side-to-side in a sig zag movement, its forward progress was in a straight line across the sky, moving from my right towards my left.  I stood and watched the object for about ten to fifteen minutes.  During that period of time, the object moved from about my 2:00 o’clock to about my 12:30 and was now around 70 degrees above the horizon.   In that period of time, a satellite would have traveled all of the way across the sky and disappeared (actually in much less time).  This was no satellite.  As the object reached about my 12:30, it suddenly stopped and then shot straight up into the sky at an incredible rate of speed and just disappeared.  I stood there for a minute in sort of a dumbstruck daze before walking back to my tent.  I have no idea what I saw, but had a strong feeling that I had observed something that was not from this world.  I didn’t say anything about it to anyone and as I said above, have hardly ever spoken of it to anyone in all of these years.  But I have long wanted to report what I witnessed (and unfortunately I was alone with no others near at the time) and so I now have (and also to MUFON).  If it is possible, it would be great to hear back any thoughts regarding my report.

Certainly strange things happen in Nevada as they do elsewhere but with Nevada being home to area 51 and a history of nuclear programs and black projects it's notoriety for strange happenings puts it at the forefront.   Small communities generally have little to do for kids except school sports for those interested in them and cruising up and down the streets in their cars. To afford the expense of having cars we had jobs at various businesses providing cheap labor for the owners. It also would supposedly keep us out of trouble. For the most part we stayed out of trouble but, we were teenagers after all.   My friend and I played sports and each of of had jobs at gas stations at opposite ends of town. Back then they were called service stations since we actually washed the windows, checked the oil and filled the gas tank.  One school night in 1973 or 1974, I don't recall exactly, we planned to meet  after work at the stationed I worked at and do a little cruising and drink a few beers from the six pack we had. My friend closed the station he worked at a few minutes before 9:00 and came to the station I worked at which was open 24 hours a day. We got into my car and drove north out of town. We both opened our first beer and listen to the radio and talked.   It was a nice night in late summer and we had the windows down. I had been driving around 35 miles an hour for about 20 minutes or so and noticed the road in front of us appeared white. As I drove into the white area of highway I saw it was snow and I stepped on the brake and slid off the road. Fortunately I had slowed down even more so I wasn't off the road much. I turned back on the highway and headed south towards town again. I pulled off to the roadside and stopped just past the snow line on the road and turned the car off.   We got out of the car and went to where it was snowing. What was interesting was the snow was creating a slow moving line on the pavement. It was like a wall of snow and we could step into the snowy area and step out. We made a few snow balls and threw them at each other to have a little fun since snow was uncommon to see in our area.   I noticed the snow had reached my car and I figured I should move it forward some since the windows were still down. I pulled it forward on the side of the road about 30 feet and turned it off again. We had both finished our first beer and my friend had walked to the car. We both decided to take a leak before heading back to town. It was about 20 minutes before 10:00. We both had 11:00 curfews so we had plenty of time to get back to town with time to spare.   It was dark out and quiet. As we stood there we looked up and saw a series of lights. It appeared as though they were on something circular shaped and slowly rotating since one would go out on one side while one would appear on the other. It didn't seem to be moving other than it's rotation. Whatever it was, it was huge.   We were both really frightened and quickly went towards the car. That's where our memories end for a period.   The next recollection we have is almost like coming out of a sleep. I'm driving and in front us us are the lights of town. I asked my friend what time it was and turned on the dome light so he could see his watch. It was almost 11:30. I took him back to his car quickly and dropped him off. We both hurried to our homes since it was beyond our curfews.   The next day at school when we saw each other my friend asked, ""What the hell happened last night.""  I responded, ""I have no idea but it was something weird.""  He said, ""Do you think we should tell someone?""  I said, ""If we do they'll think we're crazy.""  We left it at that and over the years when we have spoken the subject has come up but neither of us can recall what happened during the lost time.   It's always bothered me that I can't recall the events of that night but I always kind of left it on the back burner, until recently.   I was having shoulder pain from a torn rotator cuff in my right shoulder and went to see a surgeon to take care of it. He did some x-rays at his office and came to the room for the consultation. He asked if I had been in an accident or had a knife tip possibly broken off in my shoulder. I told him nothing like that had ever happened to me and asked why he would ask such an unusual question.   He said the x-ray showed a triangular shaped object medial to the rotator cuff tear but it was not what was causing the problem. He said he couldn't tell if it was metal, glass or plastic. He said it definitely wasn't bone and suggested I get an MRI done.   It wasn't the first time I had an MRI done, just the first time for the shoulder. During an MRI you can communicate with the technician. It seemed to be taking much longer than they had told me so I asked if there was a problem. The technician said, ""There is something in your shoulder that is distorting the magnetic field and I can't get a clear picture.""  Before the surgery I asked the surgeon if he was going to remove the object and he said he was not because it wasn't close enough to were he was going to do the rotator cuff repair. I never quite felt the same after surgery. I can't really explain how except I just have never felt the same.   Two years later I was still having pain in the same shoulder. I went to a different surgeon and he also sent me for an MRI. During the procedure I asked the technician if he was getting a clear picture and he said there was no problem. I asked him if he had the prior MRI report and he did have it. I asked if he could see the same object that the prior report detailed. He said it was no longer there.   So far that is the extent of my story. I would love to find an individual that can conduct regression hypnosis so I can fill in the blanks. If you can be of any help I would truly appreciate it.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2011-10-10T00:00:00,36.9086,-116.7592

Well, here it goes, I am a 41 yo who had a heart transplant in 2001 and a stroke which left my right side partially limited.  I was living in San Jose and had a fantastic position with an international hi-tech firm doing project management in Palo Alto.  It was a great future in store for me, and I was very excited to be a part of it.  I am living north now in McKinleyville, CA. From what I can remember in the past:  5 years old:  I was climbing on the outer railing when I fell off the second floor and right before I landed on my back on the tiles, I felt my body being set down very slowly.  Being five I thought that was really neat and ran into the kitchen to tell my Grandmother who got angry and scolded me telling my ""You're full of ""cazzata"" which translates to ""Bull S****"" and scolded me to my room. I never forgot that moment even for a second. At the age of 24: I was away at collage and living in an old c.1894 house with four other students.  For about two months at least 2 mornings per week I had a series of waking up and being completely unable to move anything except for my eyes for approx 30 minutes.  Another thing was the ""weight"" that heavily pressed my body into the mattress, it felt like someone was on top of me. That was a disturbing times but it ceased at two months.  Not ever was I into 'ghosts' but that made me serious about wondering if they really exist.  I searched the old house at Humboldt State University's library and found that the 1894 house was built right over the ashes of a previous building.  The wondering about a ghost faded as I was in an intensive program that needed my focus. 2 years ago: I woke up in my bed and looked at my watch seeing that three days had passed with no recollection of anything. I was extremely upset about it and went to my Doctor who took a blood test and everything was normal.  I did not tell him about why I was so frazzled.  In addition I had multiple dreams where I was unable to move except for turning my head.  It was a very strange room with two other tables with people laying on them and again there was a being 8-9 feet tall wearing an outfit with a hood and shielding for the face working on the body to my right.  I can recall turning my head to the left where small rectangle windows looking down at Clam Beach from I guess around 7000 feet, just a guess.  During the two years I had multiple dreams like that. The last week:  The last night for the third time in the past week I dreamt of being in an underground 'lab?' or some kind of very large underground facility 'people' of two types.  One type was 8-9 feet tall and the other was 'human-like' who can communicate using their minds.  (I feel like I'm going crazy.)  They were very calm and 'loving.'  There are dozens of windows in the rock where the 'humans' would live, they would open into the rock.  I would wake up and fall right back into the same dream.  I have noticed new skin-marks and two new tiny scars. I live alone, my family is in So. California. That's my story and you may do what you like with it, but again, PLEASE DO NOT USE MY NAME.

From where I was posted I could see nothing but most of the other post reported a ufo over the tower.  I was friends with the sargent who kept the blotter for that night and he reported the sightings in the blotter.   When I came off duty that night K-9 was just getting to headquaters.  They reported that on the way back from the weapons storage area their dogs went crazy they stopped their truck and followed their dogs into the forrest.  They found a large circular area where the brush was crushed down. All of this went into the blotter.  The next day when we went to work we were told nothing had happened and 2nd Air Force had the blotter destroyed and my friend was told to make up a new one minus the ufo reports.  Soon after I was sent to Texas for further ! training.  When I got back to Loring the people there told me that while I was gone there had been many sightings.  It was so bad the helicopters where bought in to chase the ufos and the security forces had been issued M60 machine guns with orders to only fire in self defense.
