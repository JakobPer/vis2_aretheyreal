It was flying towards me and when I slowed down to get a good look at it, it quickly pulled a sharp U-turn and went the other way.  Planes do not do that either.   Very cool indeed!

I am a marines fiance I am sure it was not a normal craft.  it followed me Hello I hope you are having a good night, I am the fiancé of a marine who’s MOS is Mechanics for large helicopters and planes.  I am familiar with a lot of air crafts because of it.  I live in Ohio.   I was traveling from the Kent University campus to my parents’ house in Uniontown, Ohio.  I was taking a lot of back roads and highways that cut through the countryside, it was mostly corn fields and trees with the occasional house.  Neither of which was lit. I had been on the road for about 5-6 minutes after leaving the Kent campus when I saw the ufo.  I first passed it off as a plane with its headlights towards me (the ufo was a fair distance away at this point so it looked small enough to be a plane)  The only thing that initially made me think its flight path was weird was that it almost seemed to be hugging the tree line from far off, I thought that was low.   I was stopped at a stop light at the time, and I made a choice to ignore it.  But when the stop light turned green, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the object shoot across the sky at a speed I’ve never seen before, and it stopped about what I’m guessing gave it about 5 miles of distance between me and it. That fast movement scared the crap out of me.  I immediately gunned it and took off down the road.  I would occasionally glance around at the sky to see if it followed me because it scared me, but I thought I lost it for a while.  I didn’t see it again till I turned onto the road called Switzer street in Uniontown.  It was sitting dead ahead of me all the way at the end of the road.  It looked like a very bright light at this point I couldn’t make out the shape of the craft because of it.  I just saw the giant ball of light.  At this point it was about half the size of a full moon. I gunned the gas again and made it to my parents’ house and ran inside.  They knew I was coming so the door was unlocked. I didn’t tell my parents about it initially.  I didn’t want them to think I was crazy but when I was leaving the house later, I asked my dad to walk me to the car because I was still unnerved.  He agreed to.  As we walked it showed up again between the tree line.  This time my dad saw it first and told me to look in its direction. “What ((words deleted)) is that?” my dad asked, as he walked a bit closer to the edge of our property. “I think its probably just a plane.”  I responded.  I really didn’t want to call it a ufo at that point I was honestly freaked out and was trying to explain it away. “That’s not a plane, it’s just sitting there not moving.  Planes don’t do that.”  He said, exasperated. No sooner did he say that did the air craft slowly start moving so it swung around and stopped above our back yard.  Still at the same far distance. My dad was spooked at that point and told me to go back in the house with him.  I refused, I wanted to get back to Akron.  I did not want to stay in the country side anymore.  He argued with me, but eventually let me go, if I promised to call him as soon as I got back.  I agreed and climbed into the car and locked the doors.  I watched dad run back inside.  When I looked up at the sky again the ufo was gone.  It was a clear sky tonight. that shouldn't of been possible for it to just disappear like that. I felt a pit in my stomach I did not like what was going on one bit.  I pulled out of the drive way, paranoid, and still watching the sky.  I took off and turned on to a road called Cleveland, Heading back towards Akron. It was a few minutes before I hit my first stop light. It was a red light again. That’s when the ufo showed up again this time it was close!  It was directly above the powerlines that were running up the side of the road.  It turned out its big light and it was replaced with a bunch of small red and blue ones that traced the length of it.  It was very long, almost cigar shaped but thinner.  The lights were evenly spaced out.  Thanks to the lights I could see the ship was about as big as two commercial planes put together.  It had to be at least be 1000 feet in the air still.  Which only leads me to believe it If it had landed, it would have been a crap ton bigger. I gunned a red light to get away from it.  I didn’t see it again till I was merging on the highway.  At that point it was around 10:40pm ish.  I saw the same bright light as I did before, only this time it was at the same distance as it was when I first saw it.  I nervously watched it, it moved out of my sight again, just as I was getting on to I77.  I did not see it again. I called my dad when I got home and explained everything that happened and he gave me your organization's number and told me to report it. I was also asked by the man I talked to on the hotline to give the ufo’s point of elevation.  I am not sure what that is, but I will ask my fiancé when he is off duty.  He is stationed in Japan right now, and they are 14 hours ahead of us, so he’s in the middle of his work day. But I will include the point of elevation in an email along with a drawn picture of the ufo.  I just need to find a printer to scan it into.  I was unable to get a physical picture of the ufo because I was driving for most of this sighting. I hope this was helpful!  Have a Good night!",2017-04-20T00:00:00,40.9611,-81.4326

I watched it move for a few seconds while I was walking, and I stopped and pointed it out to my dad.  We were watching it for about ten seconds when it stopped, grew brighter, and then it quickly got smaller and smaller like it dimmed out (my personal theory was that it warped away).   I am certain it wasn't a meteor or a comet because of how slow it was moving, it didn't have a tail, and the fact that it stopped dead.  The whole encounter was probably about 20 seconds.  The thing that really freaked me out was that it seemed to disappear after we stopped and watched it, almost as if it was watching us.

Approximately 20 miles west of Roswell we spotted 3 large, very strange lights in the northwest sky.  We immediately knew these were not normal.  These orange lights hovered in the sky as they sort of whispers or danced with each other fading in and out.  We could not make out any physical shape that was generating the light.  There is nothing out here.  We've travelled this route several times. It was extremely dark at the time.  We could see that the stars went down on the horizon as to rule out the lights being on top of high terrain.  Additionally, there are no radio towers here.  This experience lasted about 15 seconds.  My wife and I both saw this. The second instance happened once we arrived in Ruidoso just as we passed Ruidoso Downs.  We pulled over to get water from the cooler for the kids.

This is the first time in my life that I've reported a sky-borne object sighting.  Because it was in the western sky, some people will think ""oh, Venus"" - fine.  I'm not an astronomer, but I've spent many a starry, planety night gazing at this sky from my hot tub, and have never seen anything like this.   Tonight I had just stepped out onto my back deck, and this brilliant ""fire in the sky"" caught my eye, so I paused to watch it.  It was higher than local planes fly, but seemingly lower than the cruising altitude of a international jet.  It was moving slowly in the way that satellites do ... I always have fun looking for satellites in the sky because they're more-common to spot than shooting stars.  But this was lower than a satellite.  It was BRIGHT ... so bright that it almost hurt my eyes to look directly at it, but it was so fascinating that I made myself look anyway.  The color of the object itself was yellow-orange, nearly exactly like fire, but the light coming from it towards the earth was a white light, which did not seem to be ""panning"" or searching ... it just seemed to be emanating.  There was no flickering or blinking. In addition, there were a few shafts of brilliant blue-green light coming from behind it as the object slowly travelled toward me (from west to east).  These almost neon blue-green rays were nearly obscured by the bright orange body of the object itself, but were colore! d so intensely that if you stared at it, you could clearly see them.  If one were to speculate, one might think that they would appear as they did if they were part of a propulsion system.  The object made no sound.  It was fairly high in the sky, at about 65 degrees.  Its path of direction was not constant, as a standard satellite's would be.  It slowly tracked closer to my home (a rural area, with few houses), then it seemed to stabilize its location.  I went inside to do some internet searching of such phenomena, looked out the window about 10 minutes later and it seemed a bit further away to the west, and about a half hour after my initial sighting, I looked, and it was gone.  (And at that time, I also noted Venus in the sky, looking much further-away and much like a planet, like it always does.)  I am not so informed as to discount the possibility of extra-terrestrial visitors, but it seems much more likely to me that such an object could be military / government in origin.

This was obviously not a plane or helicopter because of the lack of signal lights and the absolutely incredible speed. My first thought, after ruling out planes and helicopters, was perhaps that I saw a *huge* meteor; but, the object was different enough that I couldn't rationalize a meteor.  For example, it did not appear to travel like meteors I have seen in the past which appear high up in the atmosphere and quickly burn out.  In terms of assessing the possibility of larger, lower flying meteors, the object did not have the characteristic ""burn trail"" or ""tail"" that a low burning meteor typically has (at least in my experience of seeing photos of low meteors).  This object was clearly moving horizontally across the sky at what appeared to be a constant altitude with no trail. The object was an intense blue/white light ball, and it appeared to have a very slight haze near it, but this ""haze"" could have been an optical illusion, given the brightness of the object and the speed with which it moved.  Any ""haze"" that was present was no larger dimension than the diameter of the light ball, so it did not seem to fit with a meteor trail. I first saw the light ball when it was just about the center of my windshield as I was driving.  It moved to my left, traveling southeast, and across the sky to the horizon or tree line in an elapsed time of only about 3-4 seconds.  So, this light ball was clearly moving at an incredible speed whether low in the sky or higher than I suspected.  I estimate it to have been lower than 500 feet, but that is clearly only an estimate, as I have no way of knowing its true size or altitude. Again, unlike a meteor, the object did not burn out - it simply moved out of my sight at great speed.  Regardless of what it was, it was a fascinating experience.  This is the second time in the past 2 years that I have seen a fast moving object in the general area of central NC, once it the daytime (a ""craft"" of sorts previously reported here) and this bright, nighttime ball of light. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport, In response to your questions (my answers are given in brackets): As you faced the object, what was the approximate direction you were looking  [I was on the road, so I only know the general cardinal direction, assuming a line between Chapel Hill and Monroe, NC.  I did not think to look at my car direction indicator, so the best I can say here is that I was driving Southwest and generally looking in that direction.  Unfortunately, given the nature of winding roads in the rural counties, I cannot confirm the absolute direction of my vision] ..and the angle of elevation above the horizontal plane [I had to move a bit to see it past my visor in the car, so it was up past 30 degrees for sure, but it was not by any means 90 degrees from the horizontal.  My best estimate would be about 45-55 degrees from horizontal line of sight] ...Was the object in the northern sky, or the southern sky, from your vantage point, [Southern] ..and was it traveling from your left to right side, or right to left? [the latter, right to left] Sorry I can't be more exact with some of these questions.  The entire event took me by complete surprise.  I am pleased to know that others reported this event.  I would love to know what you find out about the light, if indeed you are able to identify it.  Is there a means by which I can stay abreast of any updates?  Would you publish any such findings? Thank you and best regards, ((END ADDENDUM))",2017-04-13T00:00:00,35.68614224137931,-79.81482500000001

Emitted a pulsating light and would go from a distinct star like dot to a chevron, went from pin point light to chevron changing with pulses to a fainter much less intense yet larger oval transparent light which would blip and fade away- but it kept coming back into view.  I kept comparing it to the stars to convince my self it was different and it definitely was.  The most interesting feature was the way it moved, it seemed to pulsate to the point it seemed as if it was shaking and it would distinctly move west to east, south to north, at times it would move in semi circles, then hover in a semi Circle or crescent.  It would intensify to a dot and left right up down but stayed within the rectangular view of my iPhone 7+ on video.   Oh yes- I have about 10 minutes or more of video and photos.  The photos on the iPhone r shot in 3 second moving intervals.  I got pics of the intense dot, the larger vapor like semi transparent glow and I even got several vapor like streaks with the camera- something I did not see with my eyes, but the camera picked it up.  This thing would appear, move about in eradicating movements, fade in, fade out, go from the intense dot to the larger semi transparent glowing circle or oval, etc.  This went on from about 3:30 am to 4:10 or so.

My wife and I were walking down the beach just outside of Platanias star gazing.  It’s a small village West of the city of Chania on the island of Crete in Greece.  I saw something out of the corner of my eye to the right (on the land side not over the ocean) and it was some kind of craft clear as day.  It was odd shaped.  Definitely closer to a saucer than any other shape but much wider in the middle than the stereotypical ones you see in movies and the edges were more rounded.  It was covered with lights around the middle and on the bottom but they weren’t the same.  Some of them were brighter than others and some were clearly different colors.  I distinctly remember seeing some shades of red but it was mainly yellow light like from a light bulb. I was in the Army a long time and have seen many different aircraft and it wasn’t anything of ours.  It’s hard to say exactly how far away it was because it’s hard to judge the distance and size of something when it’s in the air at night, but if I had to guess it appeared to be maybe 3 or 4 city blocks away, approximately 100-150 feet off of the ground, relative to the houses down below.  If you were to take your index finger and thumb and measure about 2.5 to 3 inches between them and hold it at arm’s length away from your face.  That would be about how big it appeared.   My wife and I stood there for a second very confused and then the lights dimmed and it was gone. I didn’t see if zip away or anything, the lights just dimmed to black over the span of a second or so and it was ‘’gone’’ or perhaps just hovering in the dark.  It made zero sound and there was no wind that night to carry off the sound of a chopper.  There is nothing it could have been confused with.  Trust me I’ve tried! my hardest to debunk it.  There are no mountains behind that area and the shape was very clear. The whole event lasted only a few seconds, but I got a very good look at it.  I tried to report it to the government but they don’t accept these things apparently.  I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately and came across this site. I know it’s probably not of any use but I just had to tell someone.  Maybe you collect data to look for patterns or something.  I’m not familiar with this type of stuff.  This isn’t exactly the kind of thing you share with family or friends unless you want them to think you’re nuts.  I was completely sober by the way and I don’t use drugs of any kind.  I hope this helps in some way. Sincerest regards ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2017-02-03T00:00:00,,

Hello...  Firstly, I ""discovered"" Coast to Coast AM 2 years ago or so by total accident, as I had no idea it even existed, and I'm very glad that this is an excellent alternative to the worldwide ""status quo self and government-serving"" mainstream media...  Anyhow, on January 10th, although still daylight here, around 730 pm Sao Paulo time, 430 pm Miami time, I was in the ocean for my daily dive...  The sky was 90% clear but with a very thin patch of cloud directly in front of where I was swimming, around 20 km away and 3,000 meters high or so judging from an island that is located 18 km offshore directly in front of where I normally swim... The town is called Itanhaem, in southeast Sao Paulo State Brazil...  While in the water I looked up towards that cloud and I saw a semi-circular distinctly white object moving very slowly northeast from the clear sky part towards the cloud...  The object was definitely not a plane or helicopter or weather balloon, or some drone type object, and it obviously it was way too low to be a satellite... When this whitish object reached the inside of that thin cloud it actually stopped moving completely, but it was still clearly visible...  I stayed watching it for a few minutes... However, when I looked away for just a few seconds to avoid a bigger wave from hitting my face, I then looked up again at the object and it was gone... I looked around 360 degrees for a couple of minutes to try to spot it again somewhere, but it had vanished completely...  No trace, no trail of smoke or any other sign that it took off suddenly, nothing!... I have no idea what that object could have been, and how it could have vanished like a light switch being turned off!... I just thought that this was worth mentioning to your program on sky phenomenon people call in to report...  Thank you for your attention...  Itanhaem SP Brazil",2017-02-03T00:00:00,,

My friend was getting into his car at around 8:30-9:00pm, when he noticed something flying in the air.  He called me over and pointed toward the object he was watching and my eyes immediately fixated on it.  The object was very high in the sky and I live near the Fort Lauderdale airport so I know most aircrafts do not reach those altitudes when preparing to land or even after taking off.  Most airplanes I am familiar with never reach altitudes past 60,000 feet but the object had to have been up at least 100,000 feet.  The UFO appeared as a seemingly small, circular, reddish dot in the sky, it did not flash or glow.  It was traveling at relatively high speeds but that was the least interesting thing about it.   After we stood watching it for almost a minute, I pulled out my phone in an attempt to get real footage of what we witnessed.  I had an iPhone 6s Plus and the quality of the camera along with the height of the UFO made it impossible to capture due to the time ! of night.  (This has made me into more of a believer than before knowing that even modern day technology is barely capable of capturing something so astonishingly high in the sky.)  It made no audible sounds possibly because of its altitude.   We watched the object continue across the sky until we noticed another exactly similar one!  They were flying towards each other until they got very close to one another.  I knew this was beyond human capability, because one UFO (the second one to be spotted) came to an abrupt stop.  The UFO we originally seen continued on after they had crossed paths for approximately 5-10 seconds.  We watched in amazement and curiosity as the second UFO stopped moving as if it had spotted us!  It shot a white, star-colored dust into the air which dissipated very quickly, which after deep thought, we believe to be a thruster of some sort because the second UFO vanished moments later.   In total, we witnessed about 2 minutes of seemingly unexplainable activity happening thousands of feet above us.  My only dream now is to make contact with those potential life forms as I find humans intolerant or ignorant to the concept of extraterrestrial life inhospitable.  Please do not take this as a joke, there is clear, consistent evidence of extraterritorial contact being covered up by governments around the world.

I know this is going to sound crazy... it sounds crazy even as I type it.  But, I'm sure that you've heard it all.  I swear to you that this is not a hoax or some psycho bullshit.  I am a VP of Communications for a bank and I never truly believed in UFOs until my best friend and roommate showed me the video she took last night on my camera.   Last weekend, I saw something strange in the sky, but quickly blew it off because I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. It was stationary... it looked like a very bright star, but every once awhile it looked like it was changing color and glowing a bit red.  I asked my friend at the time... do you see that?  Is it my eyes?  Does that star look like it's glowing red?  She dismissed it pretty quickly and said, ""Maybe it's Jupiter.  Sometimes you can see Jupiter in the night sky.""  Okay.  Sounded plausible to me.  So, I stopped looking, continued to enjoy the fire in our firepit in our backyard and didn't think about i! t again. Well, last night, I wasn't feeling well, so I went to bed early.  My friend had one of our other friends over for company and they were out back at the firepit.  They were looking at the night sky and commenting on how pretty it was because it was so clear and they could see so many stars.  It was then that they saw a bright glowing object that was moving in an odd way.  They continued to stare at it and realized that it definitely wasn't a star.  It also was not a plane. It looked like it was changing shape slightly and it would get very bright, then start to dim and they could also see the faint changes in color. She ran into the house to grab my camera. I have an expensive Canon camera that will zoom in 80x. It also takes video.  When she zoomed in and started the video, she could not believe what she was seeing.  And neither could I.  I am still stunned as I type this. It's so hard to describe without you seeing it (we are trying to figure out how to download it from the camera and upload onto YouTube), but the circular light would start to flash colors that weren't visible to the naked eye... you could only see it through the camera lense when it was magnified. It would flash colors and then look like it explodes - or radiates out - dissipates and then forms back into a bright circular light.  Almost like some sort of strange emanating force-field or something.  It would also move straight up, back down, to the right, the left, etc.  It's the most amazing and strangest thing I've ever seen in my life.  She caught several of them on camera last night. She and our other friend started looking early this morning online to see if there were other sightings and they only found one mention... oddly enough, it was happening at the same exact time they made their first sighting.  The videos are posted on YouTube from a family in Washington state.  You can clearly hear how shocked they were to be seeing what they were seeing.  I think they were taking their video from a cell phone and couldn't zoom in nearly as close as we could, so you could see the same type of circular bright light, some of the faint colors, and see it moving, but you couldn't see that weird emanating force-field thing that we experienced.  But, other than that, it looked like the same type of thing we were witnessing.  This couple (and their child) were seeing the same thing at the same time in Washington that we were experiencing right here in New Jersey. I swear to you this is a not a joke and we have something really incredible on video tape. We need to figure out a way to get it to you... and we also wanted to ask if you knew of any reputable places that could analyze it.  We hesitate to send it to NASA after our research today - especially since apparently last night, they cut their live satellite feed when six unidentified objects flew past it.  So, why would they cut the feed? This is all just too strange. And, like I said, I know it sounds crazy.  But, I know I'm not crazy. I know what I'm seeing on my own camera and I know what my best friend is telling me that she saw with her own eyes and I believe her.  Our friend who was over works for the Department of Agriculture for the State of NJ and he couldn't believe his eyes either.  He had never seen anything like it in his entire life and said that he's going to be researching it today with whoever will listen to him and talk to him about it. All I know is that we saw something.... something that definitely is NOT from this Earth, I can guarantee you that.",2017-02-22T00:00:00,,

The sound zooms over my house, so I get up to look out the window.  I see a red light (shown in the video I Emailed).  It moves slowly toward East and stays there for a good 30 min.

She said it was a Continuous knock that caused her to wake up.  We asked what window and she said the one by her bed, NOT the one I was recording out of.

I glanced up and was looking at the long trail produced out the back of one of the planes, when I noticed what looked like a very bright star in the east by southeast portion of the sky.  It appeared to be above the 33,000 foot cruising altitude and was slightly bigger than the planes which were flying their typical daily routes.  It just stayed in one place.  I pointed it out to my kids because we had never seen  a stationary star in the daylight before.  The rest of my class gathered around us and we all stopped and watched it.  It seemed to slowly shift and elongate.  In other words--it went from a star to a white cylinder shape, and then back to a star as if it was maybe rotating like a baton.  It would remain a star and only occasionally switch to the cylinder only a few times (3x).  A couple times it completely disappeared, then would reappear in the same place.  It moved very slowly to the center of the sky at a barely legible speed over the course of 15 minutes, and then completely disappeared.  My class was excited and freaking out to each other.

January 28th, 2017, at roughly 12:10 a.m., my boyfriend called me outside to see something, telling me to hurry.  As a smoker, he is outside rather frequently.  I dropped the late night dishes I was working on and hurried to the back door assuming he had spotted an owl.  He pointed at the sky and said, “WHAT is THAT?”  Frankly, I started to say helicopter but I got this out, “heli…” as I took in the sight and realized how large, how bright, how pulsing, and how it was NOT moving like a helicopter.  Furthermore, helicopters don’t use shockingly green, pulsing lights.  The very bright, and I mean bright, neon-electric green blob shot in 90-degree angles multiple times where I heard myself blurt, “What IS that?”  Just like my boyfriend had done.  It gave me the impression it was darting from place to place like it had not prepared a logical route and had to backtrack frequently.  I’m sure that’s not true but that is exactly what went through my logical, planning mind.  I would plot a course and have a plan of action, not dart and backtrack all over town if I was trying to accomplish something. It flashed, I really should say pulsed, this green light but it wasn’t logical pulsing like an aircraft does.  I live near a very small, businessman’s style airport, RL Jones in Jenks, OK and having lived here about 15 years, I know what the airplanes coming and going look like and what they do night and day.  Additionally, my former step-father of 10 years was a pilot for American Airlines and I’ve been in his open-cockpit airplane, a private jet he flew and have detailed experience being in and around aircraft.  This was NOT an airplane. This thing was brighter than anything in the sky.  If I had to compare its brightness to something I would go with something in Las Vegas.  One of their casinos.  That bright.  Bright enough that when my boyfriend pointed it out, I didn’t have scan the horizon and search or squint.  My eyes snapped right to this green flashing light. It made no sound I could hear.  The pulsing lights it had would flash very quickly but not in any discernable pattern, and then turn off for a split second.  When the lights would return, all but once it would have moved a decent distance.  At one point it shot so far away, it became a pinpoint of green light, but then it immediately shot back to where it had been. Like I said, this pulsing, vibrant light had no logical sequence of illumination I could detect and I got the visual feeling that the lights were rolling upward, sideways and down to create the undulating, pulsing type light I was witnessing. Right as my boyfriend returned with his phone to try and record this thing, the light went out for about 1 second.  It illuminated again still in the same spot, and then the object moved a great linear distance over the rooftops in my field of vision.  It was gone in a second.  1 single second after traversing what is visually to me at least two miles.  Probably more like three as we sit on a bit of rolling hill and can see very far from our vantage point.  It disappeared after it made that long, inexplicable stretch. The trajectory it took generally takes the airplanes I see a couple of minutes to cross.  I watch airplanes take the similar route daily and I can watch them for minutes.  This was a singular second.  I have to assume this object was large to be where it was and so visible, because typically those aircraft are 747’s when they are at that altitude, or much lower and loud if leaving RL Jones and obvious.  I can see airplanes from both airports from where my house sits.  This thing was markedly brighter, like incomparably bright. You might be tempted to assume it was a Friday night and we were drinking.  First, I’m 48-years-old and so is my boyfriend.  Secondly, he just got out of the hospital with diverticulitis.  One of his antibiotics he must take is alternatively used to help people quit drinking and will cause vicious migraine headaches if the patient attempts to drink.  The pharmacist heavily warned him not to dare drink anything alcoholic while taking this antibiotic, so not only was he not drinking, I wasn’t.  We don’t take drugs, either.  Neither of us has mental disorders of any sort, nor would be so insane as to take time out of our day to write a fake report. I actually was very unnerved.  I said prayers, to be frank, for a good while before I went to bed about 30 minutes later.  I didn’t get a happy E.T. feeling.  I got a hair-raising, yuck, I-don’t-like-that-thing feeling.  I’m not a fearful person.  Yet, my arm hair stood on end several minutes after coming back inside the house. It was a clear night.  No clouds, no weather, if that matters. Anyway, thank you for letting me report this.  I actually came to this site to check your information hoping someone else saw this.  With the hills we live atop I shouldn’t have been one of two people to see it.  It was over the Arkansas River a good while, so I assume people on Riverside Drive on the east side of the river, (I’m on the west side of this river) which is still Jenks, could see it.  As far as it darted it also spent some time (seconds that I saw, no more) over south Tulsa, and when it took its pinprick size, long distant jaunt for that second, I would say it was over Glenpool but it went so far it may have crossed into another small suberb. (I’m on the Jenks/Glenpool border.)  Thanks again.",2017-02-03T00:00:00,36.0027,-95.97749999999999

We were seated outside, and near the end of our meal, I glanced around the sky.  It was such a beautiful and clear Southern California day, especially after the recent storms in the area.  While looking around, I noticed a twinkling white light to the north, about the same height in the sky as the top of a street light pole on Ventura Blvd from where we were seated. I first thought that it was a very bright and early star, but the twinkling was too bright to the naked eye, and I immediately observed very slow movement.  My next thought was a potential satellite sighting, but no straight flight path existed — movement was somewhat erratic, though slow at times.  This was easily confirmed due to the light’s position just to the right of the street light pole, which allowed me a point of reference in the sky. The light was far too high, to my observation, to be commercial aircraft (best guess was 150,000ft or more) — it was too erratic and slow for a satellite path, and it also didn’t appear to be any type of rocket (to my knowledge) due to it’s start-stop movement.  The emitting of light (or glinting of sunlight off of the object, which was another thought) also had no pattern and seemed to be random, almost as if the object was spinning about — at times it became so dim to the point that I’d thought it disappeared, then it would randomly shine bright seconds later, as bright as a star in the early evening or early morning sky.  The level of brightness was observed changing drastically without obstruction as the light slowly pinged about the clear blue sky. A second white light holding the same characteristics was also observed momentarily, further up in the sky and to the left of the first light I fixated upon.  To confirm, my wife and I both observed these objects and all of the mentioned movements/lights.  The only further detail I observed on the main light was the emission of tiny, nearly invisible, red lights — these seemed to be ejected from the object and quickly disappeared into the blue of the sky.  This detail was very hard for me to see, but I know that I did observe this. I captured iPhone video of this sighting, and upon review later in the day, both white lights (along with their visual characteristics and movements) can be clearly seen in the footage.  This entire event lasted over 3 minutes.  I captured over 2 1/2 minutes of footage, but I did have to stop recording because we had to get going about our business.",2017-02-03T00:00:00,34.138264772727275,-118.39205681818181

Multi day event. Monday February 13, 2017 about 8:00PM,we were walking out from our barn to get our horses to bring them in the for the night.  I looked over at a small softball park that behind our property, it is closed for the winter.  I saw close to the ground a red glowing orb.  I thought at first it was someone with a dim flashlight, but then it appeared to flicker out like a flame.  Then reappeared, and then disappeared again.  I can't pinpoint exactly where it was, since I was looking across several acres, and trees.  No one else saw this. Wednesday February 14, 2017, we were again walking out to retrieve our horses.  this was around 7:30 PM.  My husband said something and stopped.. I stopped and backed up to see, a cluster of these glowing red almost rectangular in shape lights, that were up in the air, through the trees.  There were at least 7 lights, that randomly came on and off, and would reappear in other locations. These lights appeared to be dripping something.  It appeared as if there were burning embers dropping from these lights. Also amongst these, were white sparkly lights, that would come on and go off randomly.  We had a helper who ran out of the barn, to see what we were seeing, and he too witnessed the lights.  I then thought to take out my phone and record, and I did get a small white dot, that came on and off, but it is hard to see much from it.    A 4th person came out of the barn and also witnessed some of the lights.  By this time they were drifting north and getting further way, and all we saw at this point was the white sparkly ones.  We watched until they disappeared. Thursday February 15th, 2017,  this night we did not have to bring the horses in, as they stayed in most the day, but we did decide to go out and see if we could see the lights again. This was at 7:00 PM.  We saw them immediately in the same area.  Same red glowing lights, that soon went out. We ran toward the back of our property to get beyond the trees, and were treated to many white sparkly lights, and clusters of pulsating white lights, that we thought at first were airplanes.  However, I mentioned that there were too many, too close together to be airplanes, and they were not traveling, they were staying stationary.  Then we saw for just an instant, a row of red round lights, that lit up one at a time, till a row was visible, and then they went out just as they lit up.  3 of us witnessed this.  By this time the white strobes slowly drifted north again, leaving one loan red orb, hovering over the trees.  This was very far off, but we could see it.  It would move left the! n right, go up a ways.. over, and then back down. This stayed for at least 10 minutes.   My husband saw one that was a small solid light (silver/white), that he thought at first was a satellite, till it came to a complete stop.  It sat stationary for about 10 seconds, then it moved straight down, stopped again, was shining for a minute or two then went out.  We watched all this take place over about 15 to 20 minutes.

Sighting 6:40 pm 1/31/17 Mechanicsburg, PA  I was driving east on US RT 11 locally called the Carlisle Pike at about 6:40 pm I noticed unusual lights in the sky to the right South of my location about 50 degrees off the horizon.  The lights where four orange yellow lights in a downward sloping angle about 15 degrees.  The lights appeared to be round.  It was well above the tree line but too low for a commercial aircraft unless it was landing in Harrisburg, the location seemed off in regards to a plane landing and the lights were solid not flashing as planes normally do.  The lights appeared to be stationary and not moving as a plane would. It's important to note that the Moon was behind me and that while Venus is currently just to the right of the moon and Mars just above the Moon forming a triangle this was not in the area of the sky where this sighting took place. Mechanicsburg is in the middle of the Cumberland Valley part of the Great Appalachian Valley just west of Harrisburg PA.  Two major highways pass by Mechanicsburg to the South the Pennsylvania Turnpike and just to the North interstate 81.  I reference this because the Turnpike is used as guide into Philadelphia International by planes coming from the West, it's also the flight path of the local medivac helicopter from its base in Carlisle, PA.  There is a large amount of air traffic that flies high over my neighborhood daily. As I drove I tried keeping my eyes on the object and the road as traffic was flowing  steadily for post rush hour so I didn't have an opportunity to pull over.  I made sure to note the time and reached for my cell phone to try and get a picture.  When I opened my camera app on my iPhone the camera app malfunctioned giving me a screen of green bars horizontally and up and down.  During the process of closing the app restarting the app and driving the lights disappeared. Mechanicsburg is home to the Naval Support Activity Mechanicsburg, a 806 acre facility with over 150 buildings, including a Department of Defense rail yard including Nuclear Cask railroad cars. The area of the light anomaly was over the area occupied by this installation. I'm a special education teacher by degree and career.

Planes coming and leaving La Guardia airport continued to fly in their usual paths.  They were distinguishable as planes. This object was indistinguishable.  It did not sparkle, but its colors shined with a twinkling quality, and its colors of orange and red rotated or mixed like lava.

The debris appeared to be liquid, like molten lava.  It dropped about 20-30 feet and disappeared. The orange and red sphere was only a sphere.  No tail, blade, or landing skids could be seen, which would have been illuminated had it been some kind of aircraft on fire.  At this point, my husband began taking a video with his iPhone. I became very alarmed, thinking, if it were a helicopter, it would be going down, without question, because for that much debris to fall, the interior of the helicopter would have to be completely aflame.  But there was no smoke and no actual flames.  Just the look of something hot and burning, which grew slightly in intensity.  The sphere seemed more to be emitting light than on fire.

On a clear day, you're able to see signage on Sprinkle Road 7 miles away, so I'd say visibility is at least 7-8 miles from the balcony.  It's a great place to watch sunrise, watch the clouds pass, or watch the air traffic over Kalamazoo:  either the helicopters landing at one of the two hospitals or the planes coming into Kalamazoo International Airport, etc.  In other words, East Hall has a great view of the entire city of Kalamazoo and its airspace.  For more info and a photograph of the balcony area of East Hall go to: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Campus_(Western_Michigan_University  7:05 p.m.-7:09p.m. As soon as I walked up to the wall/railing at the edge of the balcony area and looked out (see photographs), I immediately noticed an unusual, featureless, solid black, roughly acorn-shaped/spherical object on the horizon, completely stationary, approx. 1 thumb's width above the tree line, due East of the balcony area.  I'm 5' 8'' tall and from where I was standing, the object appeared to be at eye level with me.  I immediately began taking pictures.  The black object appeared to be hovering, completely stationary, in between Kalamazoo and Battle Creek (26 miles due east of Kalamazoo).  I was not able to gauge the exact distance, but the black object looked to be well outside the city limits of Kalamazoo, possibly as far east as Battle Creek.  (Perhaps it's worth mentioning there's a military base with an airstrip in between Kalamazoo and Battle Creek: Fort Custer)  The stationary, black object clearly and instantly stood out as unusual against the grayish clouds behind it.  I've watched all sorts of air traffic from East Hall for years:  helicopters landing at either hospital, air traffic coming in to Kalamazoo International Airport, hot air balloons, drones more recently, etc.  This didn't look like any air traffic I've ever seen before. 7:09p.m.-7:16p.m. est The black object remained stationary for ~ 4 minutes, before I called a friend in Galesburg, MI, (in between Kalamazoo, MI and Battle Creek, MI, 7 miles due east) and asked her to go outside and scan the horizon.  She didn't notice anything unusual in the sky.  During this time, I began pacing the length of the balcony area to get different vantage points of the object and during this time it very gradually ascended a very short distance (less than a thumb's width) and traveled a very short distance in a northerly direction (moving less than a thumb's width to the left).  Its motion was so subtle that I really wasn't able to see it with my naked eye, rather, repeatedly returning to the spot where I initially spotted the object to judge its progress.  When the black object had finished moving (more or less coinciding with the duration of the call) the object was less than a thumb's width away from where I spotted it initially, having moved very slightly to the north (to the left)! and ascended very slightly.  The object's size did not change during the duration of the sighting. 7:16p.m.-7:23p.m. I ended the call with my friend in Galesburg and began looking for a phone number for the Battle Creek Police Department, eventually finding a number for Calhoun County Sheriff's Department.  The object remained stationary during this time. 7:23p.m.-7:28p.m. I called the Calhoun County Sheriff's Department to see if they were aware of any hot air balloons, large drones, etc. in the air over Battle Creek or the surrounding area.  They were not aware of any.  Almost immediately as I was put on hold to transfer dispatchers, at approx. 7:27p.m. the object began making a very gradual descent dropping straight down, until it dipped below the tree line and completely disappeared from view by 7:29p.m. ""It's descending! It's descending,"" I said to no one.  By the time the next dispatcher came on the line, the object had dipped below the trees on the horizon. 7:28p.m.-8:14p.m. I remained at the location of the sighting for almost an hour and the object did not reappear.  During this time, I spoke with you, NUFORC, and made various calls to the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Airport Unit and the Kalamazoo International Airport, in an attempt to check for any balloons, drones, statotinary objects, etc. tracked on radar in the area.  The airport did not immediately return my call and the County Sheriff's Airport Deputy was unaware of any balloons, drones etc. in the area. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and found him to be quite eloquent in his description of the sighting, and serious minded.

It appeared to be a small aircraft but appeared triangular...it was spewing out what appeared to some sort of liquid...as portions of it were clouds but denser portions were dropping...very similar to a plane dumping water over a forest fire...which I have witnessed many times while living in Colorado/NM.  This was different as the craft was climbing vertical as it was spewing this whitish liquid.  The contrail's base was flared and narrowed as it came closer to the craft.  I decided to get my camera w/ telephoto lens.  Went inside to get it...approximately 30 seconds...came back o! utside and the contrail and the object were both gone.

It was smoothly and silently headed southeast east, but as I went out to get a better view of it, it moved in a very smooth arc due east, out toward the bay and open ocean.  Its speed was constant, faster than a small prop plane, but not quite as fast as a jet.  I had the impression that it saw me take notice of it.   That's when it changed direction from SE to E.  There were no flashing lights, just the solid bright white light.  It was very similar if not identical to others that I have observed over my house in the past several months.  All were headed east or southeast, from the west or north west.  This flight direction is opposite the flights of airliners from Greene Airport in Warwick, RI, where they fly on a northeast-southwest line over my house. I am about three miles from the south shore ocean of RI.  Others I have observed faded out soon after I saw them moving, though their dark outline remained...darker than the sky.

I knew it would be a matter of time until I spotted another; it had been a few months since last seeing one.  Because of the chance encounters I have had and their numbers, it makes me conclude that either there have been several or many more fly overs at different times that I have missed, or they are making their flyovers when I'm actually out and looking!

Both men very clearly saw activity around the brightest star of the handle portion of the Constellation.  The star Alioth appeared to have 3 objects orbiting in a similar manner protons orbit a nucleus.  The objects stayed the same relative distance from each other as they chased each other in opposite proximity. For instance, one object would be above and the other below, or east while the other west.  The objects moved in their orbit at a speed similar to a candle flickering.  The objects orbit covered about one or two degrees of sky or similar to making an inch with thumb and index finger and extending one's arm as a scale. The activity may have been ongoing prior to the witnesses sighting as the event was viewed as it ended. The time of witness and end was approximately 30 seconds.  The objects broke the orbiting pattern and moved away from each other about 3 degrees before flashing and fading out. The fade away left visible tales or streaks in the sky and faded away.

That was disappointing, but when I asked her about the first time she saw an airplane she claimed that it was not as impressive because she had seen “ships sailing in the sky” as a child in Oklahoma. I was thrilled by this statement.  When I pressed her she went on at great length, claiming that everyone in her county had seen these red lights dancing in the sky over a period of a week or so.

As a teenager, I went shopping at Northshore Shopping Center in Danvers.  Started to head home at dusk, taking a left out of mall onto Route 114 -- but then pulled over within a couple of blocks to the side of the road to take a closer look at this low level hovering disk shaped aircraft  There were 4 other cars pulled over already and I joined them-- we all looked at the UFO and discussed it for several minutes.  Meanwhile normal mall traffic continued on 114. The object was hovering silently and low nearly above us.  it was disk shaped from where we stood, but saucer shaped seems likely as there were lights around the bottom of the craft.  I guess that it was 500-1500 above us, slightly to the right and away, moving gently.  Occupied maybe 25 degrees of view and with arms outstretched looked about 20' across-- which would make it perhaps 200' in actual diameter?  Large enough to be a plane-- and it had lights, was solid and disk-shaped, may have been silver, but no other similarities. AND IT MADE NO NOISE!!  At least not that we could hear.  Also it did not disturb the air or have any affect on ground from any air or em disturbances which was really hard to understand at all.  Lights 'rotated' around the bottom and it was in no hurry staying their as we speculated out loud and verbally eliminated all possibilities of  helicopters, balloons, planes or especially any 'natural phenomena'.   After a few minutes, it suddenly accelerated to the left and up, rapidly disappearing after a few seconds. None of us had much more to say and didn't think of anything to do-- just got back in our cars and left,  I so wish we'd at least exchanged names and phone numbers.  I went home to my family and siblings.  Though I told them several times I don't think anyone listened much. It has been nearly 50 years and though my memory cannot be sure of exact year never mind exact date (it could have been 1971 or 1973)  I do know the time of evening, that it was comfortable outdoor weather and have a clear memory what we all saw and discussed.  I am somewhat fuzzy though on the particulars of the lights on the bottom of the craft, which I remember as either moving or rotating around the base and I think were multiple colors. For that summer I spent a lot of time looking for anything else in the skies but never saw anything more.  But I've never forgotten and know what I saw could not be explained by any technology known by public.  To this day I cannot think of a technology that could do what we saw this craft do.  And I am a scientist  (geophysicist and geologist) with decent knowledge of potential mechanisms--but none that allow free movement outside of electromagnetic field and with no sound or movement of things around them. A follow-up is that my mom-- who is now 87 -- had a similar experience in the same general area 2 years ago and told me about it.  She was on Route 495 a few miles away and described a similar disk with lights.  Made me curious and I decided to add my report to your database.  We don't know everything that is for sure.

Though some time has gone by, this is my story... I know it's been a while back that my sighting took place, but the experience has always stayed clear in my head.  With it being in the 1970's when it happened, I did not know of any one to tell and that was way before computers. I was in my 20's and living with my mother at the time.  We lived about 5 miles from the nearest town.  She was gone that day.  I was an average country boy, no drugs, very limited drinking. It was a very clear day, bright sunshine, no wind, unusually still.  I decided to lay in the sun out next to a small pond that was about a quarter of a mile from our house.  The pond was surrounded by a wheat field and there were no trees near it. I had just gotten comfortable on my back lying on a towel near the water.  I closed my eyes and shortly after doing so I opened them because something briefly blocked the sun. When I looked up there was a large cigar shaped object, dark grey or black that had just passed over me.  It was amazing!  I kept my eyes on it as I stood up.  I did not see any windows, no lights, just a large dark cigar shape slowly passing over in absolute silence.  From its appearance to its movement, nothing about it looked familiar.  I wasn't afraid, but I was so curious and shocked by what I was looking at that I ran to follow it as far as I could, but couldn't keep up.  It stayed ahead of me passing over our house. The house was 2 story and the object was either very low or very large because it didn't appear to be very high above the house & trees. It's difficult to explain its movement because it didn't spin nor did it move like a balloon or airplane. Movement was  - Imagine dangling a pole with cord tide in the middle of it.  The pole is suspended vertically.  Then you tap one end of the pole to make it turn. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I have never reported this story and have only shared it with my closest family and friends.  Those who know me well enough to know I do not lie nor do I embellish stories. Between August, 1976 and May, 1979, I attended Fernwood Junior High School, Pass Road, Biloxi, Mississippi 39531 for my 7th, 8th and 9th grade years.  So It has been nearly 40 years since my UFO experience.  That being said, though I am a little vague on the exact date or time  the circumstances are still as clear in my mind as if they had happened yesterday. One evening I was among a group of kids who had just finished band practice.  There were probably 7-9 of us waiting for our parents to pick us up.  If I remember correctly it was for concert band and it had to have been at least 8:00pm or 8:30pm, maybe a little later than that.  After practice was finished we were all huddled at the back of the school where it looked over the  football field.  On the other side of the field was an area of woods and past that lie the beaches.  It was completely dark outside and I don’t remember being cold so I believe it was in the late summer or early fall sometime between September and December.  The sky was completely clear and illuminated by only the stars and the moon, with a faint glow from some street lights on the front side of the school (north of our position) and from the businesses which lined Beach Blvd, approximately a mile away on the other side of the woods, to the south.  Biloxi was east of or location and Gulfport was to our wes! t.  Also lying east of our location was Keesler Air Force Base.  My father was stationed there.  We were all gathered and just talking.  When someone in the group noticed a bright light that appeared at the top of the trees.  Since it was on the other side of the field I estimate it was approximately 200 feet +/- away from or location and based on the its position above the field I estimate that it had an approximately diameter of 40-60 feet.  It was a bright white sphere that was completely silent and slowly glided just above the tree line towards the direction of Gulfport until it was out of our line of sight.  It only took about 30 seconds for it to disappear past the tree tops. After a moment of silent disbelief, a buzz of talking occurred, with questions about the source of the light but what happened next really sent the conversation into a frenzy.  As I said, the sphere was completely silent but approximately 20 seconds after it disappeared a group of helicopters came into view at the top of the trees to our east.  They were not in a straight line but in some kind of formation spread out from the tree line towards the beach.  We heard them loud and clear before we even saw them (which squashed the point that the Sphere was too far away for us to hear) and they followed the same exact path across the top of the trees, east to west, hurriedly scanning below with search lights, along their path, as they passed the school.  About that time we heard our parents blow their car horns and we went running up to the front of the school.  We loaded into the car (I was riding with a friend) and excitedly began to describe our experience.  We were headed East on Pa! ss Road towards home.  I lived in Thrower Park, which was base housing.  No sooner had we started driving down Pass Road when 4-5 police cars, with lights and sirens blaring, sped past us in the direction of Gulfport.  This only fueled our speculations.  The next day I looked in the newspapers for any word of the events of the previous evening, but there was nothing.  Of course we spoke of it at school and I kept watch in the papers for several weeks, but eventually gave up on finding out what happened that night. Over the years I have thought of our experience often and wondered about the truth but in my mind I have no doubt about what we saw.  During my father’s 20 year career in the Air Force he worked on mission specific equipment for aircraft and I was in and around aircraft frequently when I would visit the hangers where he worked.  Some of the mission equipment he worked on was for the Hurricane Hunters and I was very aware of what a weather balloon was and what it looked like.  So much so that as a child I wanted to grow up to be a weather person.  I was captivated by weather and the Hurricane Hunters.  We had also lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and been to the hot air balloon festivals on several occasions, during my childhood. I wish I could say I remember the date and the names of the other kids who were present that night, but other than my recollection of the experience and a few nicknames I am at a loss.  How I wish we had the internet then.  I may not have been able to find any information back then but I have never forgotten and would love to know if there is anyone else out there, who went to Fernwood Junior High during that period, and who has not forgotten either.

The [light bar] began imitating,or responding to his lights by flashing brighter and softer. We drove past the part of the woods where the object was and it began to slowly parallel our travel, while maintaining it's same distance from the road.  I urged my friend to attempt getting in front of the object, so we accelerated and got ahead of it about 500 yards on an east/west road.  We exited the truck and stood behind it whispering excitedly as the lights came closer and closer to our location.  It actually seemed to 'steer'towards our direction,as it approached.  When it was about 75 yards away it stopped over a small pond and just hovered there.  We could then see that it was a disc shaped craft approx. 30 feet in diameter. It began to move towards us once more after a minute or so,and flew directly over our heads,I'd guess about 50-60 feet above us.  There was a smaller circular light area on the bottom of it and it made a barely audible whooshing sound as it passed overhead. Here is where it began 'showing off'.  It was almost past us overhead when it suddenly shot forward about a half mile then stopped, then shot forward again maybe another mile and stopped,once more skipped and stopped then shot out of view in an incredible display of power and speed. This is the strangest part of all,the whole encounter seemed to take 15-20 minutes, but when we got back in the truck,almost 4 hours had gone by.

I was a skeptic and, frankly, thought they were full of crap. But I followed them outside and down the long front lane (about a quarter-mile on flat farmland) and looked towards the sky.  Sure enough, there were three glowing orbs of neon-green light high in the sky, at least 10,000+ feet up.  They hung suspended, motionless; but soon began to loop around each other, as if playing.  One would drop a few hundred feet straight down, in a matter of a half-second; then zoom in one direction, stop on a dime, and reverse in the other.  All the while, the other two orbs would be doing the same thing, only in differing speeds and directions.  I swear, it was like they were playing. Call it what you want.  I don’t call it much of anything; but I can’t deny that whatever they were, they weren’t of human origin.

It was so high that I could see no details, and I don't think I would have seen it at all if it had not been perfectly perpendicular to the direction of the sun, whose light reflected brightly from its entire length.  Holding a ruler at arms length, the needle measured between 3/4"" to 1"" long. At first I thought it might be a jet, but all I could see was that single line of light, very straight and bright, no other details at all --no wings, no curve, and barely moving.  Yet a commercial jet's wings are approximately as wide as the jet's fuselage, and there were no wings visible, nor any interruption of the straight line of light where wings ought to have been. It was moving so slowly across the sky it appeared to be barely moving at all. I continued to watch it for about ten minutes, until the angle between it and the sun had finally changed enough that it no longer reflected any light in my direction. I'm an engineer who has flown commercially many times.  I know about how long a city block appears to be from cruising altitude -- tiny!  I also know how to calculate image length versus distance. So if this aircraft was at normal jet cruising altitude (7 miles), then it was at least 1100 feet long, more than four times the length of a Boeing 747 commercial airliner. Yet its apparent velocity was so slow that it appeared to be moving barely as much as its own length each minute, while jets cruise at 175 times their own length per minute. To stay aloft with wings at that height, it would have had to move at least 22 times its length per minute. So if it was human in origin, it could not have been flying with wings.  Therefore, it must have been in orbit. But if it was in orbit, then just how big was it?  That depends on how far away it was. If it was in low earth orbit (1,200 miles) then it was at least 37 miles long.  Which strains credulity.  Also, it moved much more slowly than any LEO satellite I've watched in the night sky.  But if it was just below geostationary orbit (22,000 miles) - say, at 20,000 miles?  -- Then its actual length was at least 625 miles long.  Which is ridiculous.  More -- In order for its surface to reflect enough light to be seen in full daylight, it must have been a mirror-bright cylinder.  And in order for that cylinder to have a wide enough surface for the reflected light to be very bright and obvious in full daylight, its width must have been at least 5% of its length.  Back of the envelope -- a craft only two miles long and 500 feet in diameter, with inner shells 20 feet apart, an inner core 100 feet in diameter, and assuming that the outer surface of each shell is the ""floor"", has over 100 MILLION square feet of space.  Depending on how efficiently the ecosystem is organized, a ship two miles long could easily support 10,000 people, perhaps even more if the decks are closer together and the food/air/recycling farm fills its decks from floor to ceiling.  If the ship was actually 50 miles long and 2.5 miles in diameter with a core that was 0.5 mile wide, then it had 264 decks 20ft in height, with a total usable area of 62,000 square MILES.  The outermost deck all by itself is 392.5 square miles.  If the inner core were dedicated green space, it would provide over 78 square miles of park-like grounds.  The line of artificial suns running through the center to light the core park would be 1,300 feet overhead -- about the height of the Empire State Building.  Ridiculous for any purpose except colonization.  So, let's assume that it had anti-gravity to keep it aloft and stationary.  In that case it could have been at any height, though for the sake of discretion it would have made sense to be well above airliner cruising altitude.  In that case it might have been only 15 miles high, less than half a mile long, only a few hundred feet in diameter, less than 10 million square feet of decks, maybe a third of a square mile. Bear in mind that all the above calculations are extremely conservative.  In every case of ""between low A and high B"", I chose A or less rather than an average of A and B.

We were talking when I heard a very soft (all most inaudible) hum.  Recently, tornadoes had gone through my county and I was quite weary of storms so I walked to my back door and opened it to check the weather.  There was no sound outside but a lot of cloud to cloud lightning in the distance.  I stood there a moment and noticed something moving above my tree line (A hundred yards or so away).  I couldn’t see it very well at that moment just a black silhouette against the lightning in the back ground (no thunder).  It was shaped like a black domino, the size of a few football fields, floating silently, horizontally at the speed of an ultralight, perhaps even slower but much bigger, its altitude must have been as high as two or three fully grown pine trees.  The object was directly in front of me traveling from my left to my right.  One of my friends walked over to me and ! I asked them what they thought it was.  After a moment watching it we could see the rear of the object (I’m assuming the rear since it was going away from us now) there were two red/orange lights like engines from a Star Wars movie, no glow just the color, like it was a red/orange sticker stuck to the rear (I don’t know if they were engines though) they were the complete height of the object which I’m guessing was about a two-story building.  As if you put your thumb in the center of a rectangle and to the left and right side of your thumb was red/orange light and where your thumb is it was black like the rest of the object.  My friend looked at me and we both agreed we never seen anything like that before (Warner robins air force base is about 30 minutes away so we see planes and the such all the time.)  We watched as it tilted 45 degrees like a plane banking left but it stayed on the same course it had been on.  We watched the back end of it (the engines) until it passed behin! d some trees (we could only make out the shape of the object with each flash of lightning in the distance of which there was an abundant amount).  Awe struck we walked back to the living room and started to explain to the two-other people hanging out what we just saw. I was ecstatic telling them how I’ve never seen anything like that before. A few minutes later (less then five) while we are describing the object I heard the same vague hum. I asked if anyone else could hear the hum, they could not. Excited I ran to the back door but there was nothing there, disappointed I walked around to the front of my mobile home to take a look and to my surprise there it was, a giant black rectangle moving very slowly, about 5 acres away, across my field, above more tree lines. Coming from my left to my right again (as if it had circled my property while we were inside). It was very large, completely silent (I could only hear the hum both times inside the mobile home). The object was horizontal again and I could see the front since it was so far to my left. ! There were no lights of any kind on the front, bottom and side. I watched it slowly crossing my field. A few minutes passed and I realized the other three had come out side and they were watching it, not saying a word. The object made a slow turn to the right (never banking) as if it was following a giant half circle. Realizing I was not alone and others were witnessing the same thing I began jumping up and down screaming “What the expletive is that? What is that? Do yall Expletive see that” No one said a word. We watched it for a few more minutes until it was going away from us and disappeared over another tree line, in the direction of Warner Robins Air-force Base that’s when we could see the rear and there were the red/orange engines again. It never made a sound and moved way to slowly to be able to stay in the air for its rectangular shape and size. Perhaps it was some weird blimp I’ve never seen before. The next day my friend that saw it the first time with me refused ! to talk about it saying over and over it was just a C-130, tho! ugh it m oved way to slow and C-130’s are super loud that close. The other two swore it was an alien craft (One friend, my future wife, claimed to be very frightened during the whole ordeal) which made me laugh (though it could have been, not doubting that possibility). I didn’t even think about aliens, I was thinking it was some piece of technology the U.S government had that we have not been told about yet, something similar to how people thought the stealth bomber years ago was an alien craft. I never felt endangered the entire time.  I just find it so odd that a day or two later my friend (that saw it with me first) was so reluctant to talk about the experience saying it was just a C-130 even though all the rest of that night he was flabbergasted as the rest of us.  That was in 2009, at the time of me writing this it is 2018 and I have never seen the object again. I apologize for the description being so lengthy.

On this day the weather was very hot and dry as Santa Ana weather gave way to clear unlimited visibility and a cloudless bright blue sky.  I was laid on my back on the sandy beach so naturally I was looking skyward.  My feet were pointed straight to the surf so my body was aligned northwesterly looking out to sea.

The spot was roundish, stationary, and had the washed out white color the moon has on a sunny day.  This lead me to think I was looking at Venus or some other celestial object though I was skeptical as I have never seen any celestial object in the bright day sky other than the moon. For the next several minutes I stared at the spot for a short while and then look away for a minute and look back up again still puzzled at what I was looking at.  Each time I looked back up relocating it took a few moments as the small spot was difficult to see against the bright blue sky so I figured I should point straight at it so I could better relocate it the next time I looked away.  I pointed about 20 degrees to my right and about 20 degrees forward (from my laying down position). I then looked away for a short while and looked back up to relocated the spot but I did not see it. I pointed my finger in the direction I had just pointed a moment ago but the spot was gone.  Now I became very curious. I scanned the sky for a few seconds and I located the spot.  The spot was stationary but was then about 15 degrees to my left. Now my attention was peaked. Now I could rule out Venus or any other celestial object.  I stared intently at the spot for about 10 or 15 seconds when suddenly it appeared to move very slightly.  Slight movement was hard to tell against a bright blue background, so I extended my left hand and finger to try and gauge movement.  In the next few seconds I confirmed the spot was moving slightly, grew in brightness, then dim and vanish.  End of story.

It was about 2:00 am when my cousin and I were bored at my house, so we decided to go for a drive out to lake Okeechobee.  Belle Glade is a small town surrounded by miles and miles of farm land and to get out to the lake we have to drive on a road between the fields. I was I think 17 at the time but I was driving my truck out to the lake with my cousin riding in the passenger seat, about halfway down the road you have to make a left turn.   As soon as I made the turn we both noticed a bright green light sitting in one of the sugar cane fields about 100 yards away from us.  We both didn’t say anything, we just kept our eyes glued to this light and after a few seconds the ufo shot up into the sky about 100 feet within the blink of an eye and it sat there hovering for about 10 seconds, which was enough to makout what it looked like.  It looked to be a disk shaped object with green lights all the way around it.  After a few seconds of it sitting in place, it finally ! took off into space so fast that the green lights turned into green streaks across the sky.  My cousin and I sat in silence for a few minutes with the most shocking look on our faces and the first thing both of us said was “please tell me you saw that” and we both did, we still talk about it to this day and I’m 21.   I’ve worked on a farm my whole life and I’ve worked in the same field that the ufo came out of, which shocked me even more.  I went to that field the next day and some of the sugar cane was laying on the ground and it was in the shape of the object I saw.  Every once in a while I can see some fields that have had crop pushed down only in specific spots with no explanation at all.  That memory will forever be burned into my mind.  I’ve also had 2 other encounters, one of the encounters happened a few months after that when I was taking a shortcut through the farm to get home late one night and I saw about 6 red lights in the sky following each other at a fast rate of speed and then they all just shot off into space, one after the! other e xtremely fast.  The other time was when I was about 12 walking down a dirt road with 2 of my cousins (one of them was the one that saw the green ufo a few years later) and there are cow pastures on each side of us with barbed wire fences.  The fences were about 40 yards apart from each other with the dirt road we were on right in the middle of them.  As we were walking we see this almost human like creature that was about 7 feet tall, slender body, with 2 arms, running on 2 legs but it’s legs bent the other way like an Ostrich and it was running very fast.  All 3 of us were watching this thing run across the cow pasture and when it reached the fence in one jump it cleared the first fence, all the way across the road, and over the other fence.  All in one jump and hit the ground running the same pace it was going without even trying it seemed like. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

A single engine plane was moving North to South at between 1 and 3,000’ and because it was about to enter a lone cloud I advanced the camera to an anticipated interception point beyond the cloud, that is when the object came into view.   I immediately asked my wife and son if they could see the object (not wanting to lose sight due to its faintness at 400 mm focal length).  When they denied seeing it I asked my son to hurry over and grab the beverage as I was holding in my left hand.  It took approximately 5-10 seconds for him to take the beverage from me and during that time the object did not appear to move.   I then steadied the camera and took the picture.  Next I then dropped the camera to preview what I had just photographed which took about 10 seconds then returned the camera vertically and never saw it again.

This investigator received a call from a neighbor on the following incident.  I have known my neighbor for several years, a former Vietnam combat Marine and former police officer. His wife gave me the following statement of her encounter of the early morning of April 30th, 2017. WITNESS WRITTEN STATEMENT; ""I got up around  4:20 am Sunday April 30, to let the dogs out, and use the restroom. As I was in the rest room looking out the window, I noticed a light flash on above the trees... This was odd, as there was no lights indicating that it was a Airplane,  it was to low, and stationary right above the tree line. The object lit up  for about 2-3 seconds,  then went pitch black. It was about  200 yards away to the northside of our house. And it was close to 150yds off the ground.  I waited for close to 15 minutes after the light appeared, it didn't turn on again. The object looked the color and shape of a golden raspberry, with a red glow around each light. I didn't have the colors to match what I saw, but this is as close as I could get. The size from where I saw it, would be compared to a large  truck, dodge ram, or a large tractor. That's about all I can say about it, it was dark so I couldn't tell if it had moved away while not lit?""  INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY; I interviewed my neighbor's wife on her encounter a couple of days after her sighting, she pointed to the NNE area where she spotted the lights about 20-25 degrees off the horizon hovering above the Ponderosa trees which average about 75 to 100 feet. She stated the object was hovering just above the trees at a distant of 200 yards at most then as close as 150 yards. Both the witness and her husband are active sport shooters and can estimate distance very well. Again, the size was that of a large truck or tractor. The area is very rural, sparse houses in area, fields and trees, and mostly ranching. The cross roads would have been Elde and Chukkar with the main road east which would have been Sprague River Road. No sound from the object, witness stated object lit up for about 2-3 seconds, I then asked her could it had been a reflection in her bathroom window, she said ""No, because it lit the tops of the trees up!"" No one else in the general area came forward as to seeing the lights, but the husband of the witness said he had seen a 'white orb' silent moving across the sky in which he could not explain a few days after his wife's sighting. Kingsley Field which houses the 173rd Fighter Group in Klamath Falls, Oregon does night training as well as day flights, but witness was sure this was not a USAF fighter plane or a civilian aircraft. This area is also known to have military helicopters fly missions, it was not helicopters she said.

I was flying way north of the west to east zone and perpendicular to the south to north zone; crossing the southwest to northeast zone.  Next its ""landing lights"" were pink, not white or yellow.  It also did not have any navigation lights flashing.  The craft was moving rather slowly then came to a complete stop for about a minute or longer.  Then it started moving again.  It disappeared into the clouds.  The entire time there was not a sound of any kind made not even my dog.",2018-01-12T00:00:00,39.74512637220715,-104.95934593826682

Corner of 29th and S. Douglas Blvd.. I was driving home from work when I had stopped at a red light on the corner of 29th and S. Douglas Blvd near Tinker Air Force Base.  Many multiple dark, ball shaped (what I had assumed were balloons)things were slowly floating in a westerly direction.  I had seen a small convoy of school buses go by, so I just thought that maybe the school had just released a bunch of balloons for some celebration and didn't think much about it.  They looked exactly like what you see when a large amount of helium balloons is released....just floating slowly.   I looked down for what couldn't be more than a couple seconds and then back up to check if the street light had changed when they were all gone from sight.  There is no feasible explanation for their disappearance.  Even if somehow every single ""balloon"" had popped at the same moment, they would still be falling to the ground.  There was absolutely nothing to been seen.  They either flew off at a high rate of! speed, or just vanished.   This is a fairly busy intersection, and there is no doubt that at least a handful of people seen this event.  They were floating what seemed to be about a half block north of 29th St over South Douglas Blvd.  They were maybe at a 20 degree angle from my vantage point.  A couple of drivers began to honk their horns at the same time, and it didn't appear that there was any reason warranted due to anyone's driving.  Hopefully some people will come forward to share their experience too.   The date is probably not correct, but it's close.  They were there one second and then just popped out of existence... It sounds silly, I know, but I have been around many aircraft, and not a single one I know of could fly off that fast...or be so slow in the air (besides helicopters of course).

December 14, 2017 @ 4:32pm   This investigator called the Independence Police in Independence, Or.

We live in Buena Vista about 7-miles south of Independence and we see different craft with various light formations.  The most common is as described in the second message you sent me.  They are either clusters of red lights or actually appear to be in a square or rectangular pattern.  There are others that are clusters of both red and white lights but none have green.

It was taken just outside of Independence, Oregon, on November 21, 2017 at 7:05 pm  The next three were December 8th at 5:34 in the evening.  The light at the bottom is a house.  The large light in the sky state stationary for a long time while another small light (seen best in most distant pic) circled it. This last one was one of the red cluster lights but it was so far away I didn't get a great pic.  This one was taken Thursday December 14th at 6:57 pm.

It's so hard to judge distance, not knowing the size but that night I thought it looked like, ""a big one"" so he stopped the car and took the picture.  Now as I look at it, I'm feeling as though it was much closer than I thought and smaller than I was thinking. This one had a combination of red and white flashing lights and I did not notice the shape until I saw the picture. The other two were also taken from Buena Vista Road only they were moving slowly from just south of Independence, over to BV and then across the Willamette River heading towards Jefferson.

I am not surprised that you know others who have seen them.  Honestly, we've been shocked that more people don't because as I mentioned they seem to appear very regularly. I do find an interesting correlation in our work and their constant presence in our skies around our home.

As the witness had seen these strange lights on several occasions, the most objects at one time was 3.  One large light in the sky had small lights circling it.  At one point beams of lights seemed to connect the smaller ones with the larger object. The encounters were silent, no sound was from the objects.  Military helicopters were seen and heard in the areas on one occasion.  There was also a surge in power outages in the area. On the December 8th sighting, besides the 2 witnesses that had pulled over to the side of the road, three other vehicles had also stopped and individuals exited their vehicles to watch the lights.  The main witness did mention that he could see 'figures' in the windows of one of the craft. Witness estimated the closest craft was maybe 1/4 to 1/2 mile in distance.  The longest duration of any of the sightings was estimated at about 15 minutes. Investigator's closing notes. I am familiar with that area in the Willamette Valley, farm land, cattle, small ranches, logging and a country community.  For years I have heard stories and even myself witnessed un-explained lights in the Falls City vicinity in 1979.  So, this area of the Willamette Valley has been a 'hot spot' of un-explained lights in these areas for years. What is interesting about this witness report is the square windows and or lights seen in their encounter. When I just posted a photo on my Facebook of one of the photos, another cousin came forward and said he had seen some lights that same week in December, either the 5th or 6th hovering out over Salem as he was looking west.  What is intriging about his sighting was that he mentioned 'square lights' just as the witness in this report did. (My cousins report will be filed later this week)  Military bases in Oregon. Kingsley Field, Klamath Falls, Or. home of the 173rd Fighter Wing. They fly the F-15c, as does Portland Air National Guard out of the Portland International Airport. Home to the 142nd Fighter Wing. Coast Guard Air Staion, North Bend, Or. Search and Rescue... their aircraft is the Mh-65c helicopter. Umatilla Army Depot, Umatilla, Or.  this base is projected to be completely closed by 2021 as their permit expires that year.  No flying mission. Mount Hebo Air Force Station, Hebo, Or.  Home to the 689th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron.  This operation closed down in 1980. The military does fly training missions all over Oregon, as in my region near Klamath Falls, the F-15's do day and night time training. So, what did these people witness?  Doing some research I came across a drawing done by a grandmother from Florence, Or.  Her encounter from March 9th, 2015 witnessed by her and her grandson is uncanny in its similar appearance with the 'square windows'.  This was on www.midnightinthedesert.com website. Another article written by Tyler Rogoway twitter.com/Aviation_Intel, November 15, 2017 reads; ""Airliners and F-15s Invovled in Bizarre Encounter with Mystery Aircraft over Oregon.""   This article stirs speculation as to what was in the skies on Oct. 25, 2017 as an object was seen between California and Oregon border and involved multiple pilot eyewitnesses. Confirmations between both FAA and NORAD that it did occur. Another article by Jamie Seidel November 16, 2017, with the News Corp Australia Network wrote about the incident also. As did Micah Hanks on November 17, 2017. On the National UFO Reporting Center website, a photo from Rosarito Beach, Baja California, Mexico, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 @ 8:30 p.m is similar in the light formation also. On November 23, 2017 I wrote the Public Affairs office at Kingsley Field on the above incidents, but never heard back from their office.  Nothing was reported in the mainstream media on these UFO's over Oregon.  Although a couple days ago, both CNN and FoxNews started running stories on UFO's in general. Could these incidents over Oregon be related to the sightings in Independence and Buena Vista, Oregon?  Possibly.  Other factors to consider is the 'Geminid Meteor Shower 2017' which was December 4th through 16th with peak period for viewing 13th -14th of December. But this does not explain the 'structured' craft and the way these lights moved and operated in our airspace and the photographs taken by this witness.  (See photos submitted with this report.)  So, at this time these objects are 'unknown'...  This investigator will be planning a trip in the spring to the area of Independence, Oregon, after the snow is gone from the mountain passes!

It closed at very high speed until it covered about two thirds of the distance between us and the eastern horizon- at which point it appeared to explode.  I have watched a number of meteor showers- and this did not resemble any meteor I have ever seen. We initially thought it was probably an aircraft catching light from the sun, which was at that time not far below the horizon.  At the point where it appeared to explode, the contrail abruptly flared into a very large white cloud covering about 20 degrees, from which two glowing spherical objects with visible discs emerged with no further trails. One went northeast at a high rate of speed and rapidly vanished; the other hung in the sky for about three minutes and then moved southeast, with less acceleration than the first ob! ject. Efforts to take pictures (we were catching a sunset with a P-900 and a D-5500, both Nikons) yielded fair shots of the cloud, but not the spheres- there were no discernable details visible by eye or digital images.

The orbs gradually disintegrated as they traveled slowly across the sky, leaving an enormous weird shimmery aura-like cloud around each orb.  As the orbs themselves slowly disintegrated, the clouds around each orb grew larger, the front one larger than the one behind.  The whole event took about ten minutes or so, the orbs ultimately leaving a huge jet stream type cloud in their wake.  Many people in my neighborhood saw this, and many took pictures.  I expect there is a down to earth explanation for this  phenomena, but what in the world are disintegrating guided missiles doing over the skies of Hemet, CA ?

It was Friday, December 22, in Torrance, California, around 5:30 pm.  The sky was already dark (just after twilight).  I was stuck in pre-Christmas traffic driving North on Crenshaw Boulevard just east of a local Torrance Airport.  I looked toward west from my car window and saw a bright light which appeared to be a small airplane emitting contrails, but it looked odd since it was much brighter.  As I stared, what appeared to be contrails got thicker, and as the airplane (or what I thought was an airplane) gained its altitude, contrails became massive almost exploding, leaving a bright white gas in the air.  As I observed the object which kept moving in the direction of south east, it looked like it split into two separate objects which moved together.  It almost looked like the object in front was pulling the object in the back.  It was difficult to identify since both objects were super bright or surrounded like some kind of energy field.  The object which appear! ed to be being pulled kept emitting something because whatever it was, it was shooting out some kind of white gas or energy, making circular ripples in the air.   Other drivers were also looking up and taking videos or pictures (turning around by this time, since we were heading north in the opposite direction). Since traffic began moving,  I could not see what happened after that, but my husband and I both witnessed the incident along with many other drivers, and the objects were not airplanes.  They almost looked like they were floating, and no sound of engine or jets could be heard. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD))",2018-01-12T00:00:00,33.83267537437604,-118.33263344425957

I had never seen any craft fly in such a strange pattern.  I noticed the shape of the object was a fluorescent diamond, and the blinking light (that looked to be on top) was a yellow - orange color.  I quickly ran out the front door to get a better view. I noticed there was NO sound! The object seem to be ""floating"" instead of flying.  It was as if it were weightless. It floated vertically up and down, and shifted horizontally a few times. It then stopped, and it's as if it ""twinkled out"" or took off at an alarming speed.  It's hard to say exactly what it did, because the object was so different than anything I had seen before. I walked back into the house, and then looked out the kitchen window a few minutes later. I noticed the object was back once again.  It flew exactly the same way and pattern for about two minutes and then banished.  By banish, I assume took off at a high speed or some function unknown.  It's very hard to explain in nature how this object appeared and ""banished"". I thought about what I saw that evening, but came to no conclusions.  I thought maybe it was someone playing with a remote control plane or UFO; some toy a child may have got for Christmas.  It couldn't have been, because it was floating way too high in the evening sky to have been a toy.  Not only that, but the wind was very rough, and I can't picture someone out playing with a remote control toy plane or UFO.  Again, it floated way too high to be a toy. I thought maybe it was a drone, and I googled and YouTubed drones to observe how they fly.  It was NO drone either! It was too big, and it didn't fly like a drone. The object I observed didn't ""fly"" anyway, it ""floated"". It was no airplane, helicopter or anything of this nature either.  Only conclusion of what the object was, is a UFO or something the government may be testing. I'm a perfectly sane, sound person.  I have NEVER seen anything fly or float in the way this object did.

It started coming from West towards me (East) made various quick slight changes of direction (not following typical air traffic of Selfridge or Detroit Metro traffic) would say at first I thought perhaps a plane in distress.  Than pulsed bright again only to fade out and move quick and suddenly towards South East.  Was faint again for 15-20 seconds than pulsed again in a direct South and became faint and watched object travel extremely fast continuing in same Southern direction. The speed always was faster than normal jets from Selfridge would slow for moments still faster than normal jet. At the end when it moved “extremely fast” I would compare to shooting star speed. I did a hand sketch of flight pattern which I will email (in pdf form).",2018-01-12T00:00:00,,

In July 1973, I was 18 years old and was hiking the High Sierra Trail in the Sequoia National Forest.  I was camped at a place called Lake Hamilton, alone.  I remember in the afternoon, standing at my campsite looking to the opposite end of the lake and observing a bright spherical light, low near the shore.  The next memory I have is of me sitting on a log in my campsite startled by a big buck deer jumping up right next to me.  I remember being amazed how close this deer was to me and not seeing it.  I remember being confused why the sun was setting and wondering where the time went.  Strangely, the following day a group Boy Scouts came hiked into camp.  One of the leaders was Bela Lugosi Jr. Later in my life, I would have other experiences which led me to understand that I was an abductee.  In the early 90's, I joined a support group and met others who shared equally strange, confusing experiences.  I appeared with Budd Hopkins in a Disney UFO Documentary.

On the day of Sunday, October 20th, 2002, @ 5:31pm EDT in Manassas, VA, (about 35 miles WSW of Washington, DC), when  I saw what appeared to be a balloon in the eastern sky heading over the trees to the SW.  My 22 month old son can be heard in the background.  I used my Sony 360X to record this 30 second clip.  I also had the film stopped (later) at .07 second intervals and will send some of those still shots. One of the interesting things about the timing of the event is that it was during time the snipers were running around the greater DC area, shooting people at random, including a shooting in Manassas, only a few days earlier.  Also, this was on the heels of the 2001 attacks on the Pentagon so for two autumns in a row people were on edge and were hunkering down.  Hardly anyone was out and about and I was flabbergasted as to why someone would throw a birthday party (where I thought the ""balloon"" was coming from) knowing that they (the snipers) were targeting children as well.  After forgetting about this for nearly a decade, I dug out my HI-8 take from this time frame and decided to take a second look. I looked back and the weather for that day and temperatures were in the 60s with a light wind and  it didn’t look like any atmospheric phenomena or temperature inversions were in the area.  It was completely silent and I lost it behind the trees.  If you slow the film down, it looks like a football inside a gyroscope trying to right itself for a possible take off.  To me, it looked/acted like a plasma.  If you see some of the files in succession, the leaves on the trees are effected as if there were some kind of ionizing radiation or magnetic field was being given off. As I mentioned in a previous report, I worked on NASA contracts and possess a BA in Physics with a Graduate Certificate in Space Operation. I currently teach Physics in another state (my family and I were living in Virginia at the time).",2017-10-19T00:00:00,38.74820707831325,-77.53053840361446

It was about 11 PM so it was dark out.  Her Dad walked inside ahead of us and her and I both stopped and looked up (I don't know why because we didn't hear nor see anything to make us turn).  Above her barn was this bright light, like a sliver in the sky.  I had no idea what it was.  As we stared at it, it very slowly got bigger and bigger.  It was very hard to tell how far away it was in correlation to its size because it glowed in the strangest way.  It didn't blink nor did it have lights that I could see.  More like it was just made of light.  The shape was like a smooshed football, kind of like () if it were horizontal and thinner.   It seemed to me like it was right in front/above us, it started out small above her barn then got very large as it traveled straight towards us, and due to it coming straight towards us like that it seemed like it grew in size (it didn't grow in size it was just the illusion).   It hovered in front of us for a little while and after a minute or so this thing zoomed straight backwards so far it disappeared/was too small to see anymore. Like this thing zoomed back and blinked out of existence.  The speed it zoomed back and how far away it got was like nothing I've ever seen before.   While I watched this scene, I was awestruck, I didn't feel anything at all, just watched it with no emotion.  I'm a very scared/cautious person, but I just stood there and watched this with no feelings towards it whatsoever. Once it disappeared my friend turned towards me and said, ""Did you see that?!"".  I replied, ""Oh thank god you saw it too!"".   We proceeded to go inside and tell her father and he said, ""Oh you crazy girls, you have quite the imaginations!"".

My wife, daughter, and I had just returned from a trip to Florida.   The car was parked in the airport’s long term parking and the sky was clear.  It was probably around 5-7pm, so still light out.  We had just left the winding highway roads around the airport and were driving east on I-90 towards Chicago.  Directly in front of us, in the distance, I could see a low, bright light over the highway.  I remember thinking, “Interesting that that plane is flying directly in parallel with the highway and so low.”  I assumed it was just an airplane lined up to land at the airport and that it would quickly turn off from the seemingly straight path it was taking above the highway.   However, as I continued to drive, it seemed to continue its straight path directly towards us.  I mentioned something about it to my wife, but she didn’t seem interested (I think she was distracted on her phone, maybe texting her parents that we were on the ground heading home).  As we got closer to it it remained in ! place, and I remember thinking, “Wow, that is low!”   As we got closer, I noticed it was not moving but stationary above the highway, with cars zipping along under it in both directions, as if nothing were there.  As we drove under it, I looked up, leaning up a bit to look through the windshield in front of me.  As we passed under, it was approximately 20 feet above the highway, and it looked as if it were man-made.  By that I mean it had large pipes, or ducts, and other mechanical-ish type looking parts.  It must have been huge as I only was able to see a small part or section as we went under.  After this, the strangest feeling happened.  All of a sudden, I had this feeling of elation and felt as if I was the best and cleverest driver in the world, with the ability to quickly, and without effort, maneuver the car in and out of traffic like a pro (almost felt like flying).  I think I looked back in the rear view mirror a couple times as the light diminished as we drove further from it.

Thank you for your review. I lived in Monsey a few years ago while doing religious Jewish studies.  In religious practice, some men go to a ritualistic bath everyday called a Mikva.  The Mikva is considered to wash away some degree of spiritual uncleanliness which has affected the body as well.  Women do this also after menstruation.  Men typically go in the morning, during the day.  Anyway, one day, I had missed going in the morning and decided to go late at night about 11:30pm after bowling with a friend.  It was the summer so my friend sat outside the house with his windows down.  While waiting he kept his car running with the headlights on, which were bright up against the side of the house 1 foot in front of his car.  I went inside the house, which was a religious high school with a Mikva in a section of the building.  I couldn't find the light switch in the dark, so I propped the door open.  After dunking in the Mikva water, I was standing at the shower to rinse off.  I was warming the water up with my he! ad looking sideways.  In the passage of light which spread through the small room from the hallway outside the propped door, I saw a person walk by me very quickly.  His body was covered in light.  From my side view, not the ""corner of my eye"" it was obviously a person.  I assumed it was my friend coming in.  I started talking to him.  When there was no response, I looked in the corner of the room where the figure walked into a few feet from me.  There was no one there.  I felt terrified being 100% certain someone walked next to me and who I saw as what I would call a body of light.  I threw on my jeans, grabbed my underwear, shoes and other belongings and ran outside nearly naked.  When I got to our car the windows were closed, the headlights were off, and doors were locked.  I banged on the door to open up quickly. When I got in my friend was equally frightened and nearly hysterical.  We kept cutting each other off trying to explain what happened.  He related that whil! e he was sitting in the car, windows down, headlights bright against the wall of the house, that right in front of the car he saw a person, a body of light, run in front of the headlights.  It sounded identical to what I saw inside.  He was so frightened he closed the windows and locked the doors. We kept telling over the details and drove home all shaken up.  When we got back we told friends but they sort of chuckled.  It was impossible to tell anyone with any degree of seriousness.   When I bring it up today with my friend who experienced this with me he also chuckles and says, "" yeah that was freaky"" when I bring it up.  Not much to say, and in fact it's awkward to talk about. I have always felt crazy telling anyone, but it was unforgettable and real. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The amber colored crafts began to dodge the jets and move in ways that I have never seen any aircraft move.  They would be flying in one direction and then change direction instantly without a second of delay.  One of the crafts suddenly shot out several smaller ones and they began to run across the sky scrambling with the jets.  The jets then began to set off flares and it was close enough to hear them popping.  And as soon as this happend the crafts began to disappear and the jets flew away.

Eagle, CO. is 6600 ft above sea level. My living room faces N.E. and is on the 10th fairway of the Eagle Ranch golf-course.  I was sitting at a couch having a cup of tea about 10:40 pm.  All the lights in the room were out as it was a fairly clear night, yet with only a few stars in view. The couch where I was sitting faces N.E. (I have three fairly large windows) where the night sky is easily viewed. In that the airport is 12 miles West--there are times when airplanes can be seen preparing for landing. I do not know the 'exact' above ground landing preparation distance (ground to air height) as a plane would fly over the golf course coming in for a landing, but I can guesstimate it to be only a few hundred feet or so. In other words when planes come in from the East or the N.E. preparing for landing they can be easily noticed. I mention this because what I am about to describe 'came in' from the N.W. at approximately the same height / distance that an airplane readying for landing would be above the ground. As I was looking out the windows I had a clear view of a wide-sky and the top of the mountain peaks. The orange fire-ball appeared to arrive as if it were entering the atmosphere. It was quick-abrupt; in the sense that what is depicted in a Star Wars film (just viewed the latest: The Last Jedi)-where crafts would go to hyper speed and then abruptly hyper-drive and then appear at their tended location. The orange-fire-ball came into my view from the N.W. exactly like that. When it appeared before my eyes however, it didn't stop abruptly and stay, but stopped for a nano-second and then very slowly continued to travel a very short distance. During this time the fire/flame surrounding the object evaporated and the orange ball proceeded on a S.E. direction then made a very slight turn more eastward--the orange object then lost its complete 'orange color' as it glided towar! d the S.E. where a very small red light was noticed at the tai! l end an d just enough of a very faint outline of an indistinguishable total form would be difficult to describe. Yet, I could see a non-round/ball object in that it was definitely no longer a 'ball'. That's the only way I can describe it. However, it did appear to have more of a 'widened-non-ball' type of shape as it awesomely 'glided' toward the southeast and vanished--taking no longer than about 60 seconds or so as the small red light that seemed, when first noticed, to be at the tail of the object couldn't be seen anymore. It was awesome as it glided into the distance with a steady faster than an airplane's speed would be noticed when coming in from the E. or N.E. to land at the Eagle airport. The reason I saw some distinguishable area of the form was that as I was viewing it from behind there was a very thin yellow-white light that appeared to be a outline of the underbelly of a type of 'wing'? that gave me a reference point to watch it smoothly glide away! This is all I can rea! lly describe. The 'glide' was a kind of smooooooth straight and then light bounce type of motion that then just kept its path. It was very real. The reason I waited until this day (Jan. 7 2018) to post the siting is that I have the 'flu' for just over a week.

Early morning (from approx 12:45am -1:45am intermittently) New Years Day, 2017, I witnessed an unexplainable series of light events, in the sky of NE Portland, Oregon. And then, something on the tarmac of the Portland International Airport. This all began at approx 12:45am. I was standing on the sidewalk with a friend, in a cul de sac on NE 14th Place, near Killingsworth St. There was a set of 2 & 3 story houses and store type buildings immediately to the North of us, and while my friend and I were chatting and wrapping up a social evening for New Years. Notably, it was a very low key night, my friend doesn’t drink, and I’d had just one light beer, well before midnite… So, as we were chatting, and I was about to get into my car and head home, we noticed that a very odd light had been emanating intermittently, in approx 20-30 second sustained pulse outputs, from well behind the buildings to our North…but spraying the sky with light over us. We also noticed a distant “bzzzzzz bzzzzzz bzzzzzz” electrical energy sound that accompanied the sustained light bursts. At first, I didn’t think much of the light flashes.  Neither of us did apparently, because we continued talking through the first 2 or 3 of them…  Additionally to note: it had been very cold those few days.  And I believe that high winds/heavy rains had been in the forecast.  I don’t remember the specifics at this time of the forecast that night…  But I do recall, that the conditions were that which can lead to the occasional power surge/exploding transformer, because I remember power outages due to the weather of the night, being a concern in general… along with fallen trees and such. My friend who was a former electrical engineer with Intel, years prior to this time, and who was now a leading advisor/consultant on state and federal energy efficiency for government agencies, began to find the situation as odd as I did. We agreed to move ourselves quickly, a few hundred feet, to the end of the street to see if we could catch a better view of these lights, in what would next be, the fifth or sixth 30 second sustained pulse of light and sound…  Another odd aspect of this “light show” was that the lights that were constant for the 20-30secs, yet pulsing in intensity, and sometimes “beaming” in a broad spray of faintly focused beams —they were also changing faint colors during the burst, pulsing reds, greens, blues… all of this detail happened faintly, but distinctly enough to be recognizable as separate colors… these bursts and broad beams were also fanning out of the north east direction to our location… from where we were located, and my guessing/calculations of the height of the light and the brightness, combined with my lifelong familiarity of the area… led me to estimate, that if I had to make a guess of the origin point, I would estimate that the light was coming from somewhere between us, and the Portland International Airport. My friend recognizing the lateness and his lesser curiosity to find the source —agreed that the whole event was very odd, but that he was calling it a night.  I told him that I was going to investigate this further on my way home… that I would watch the sky, head into the direction that I believed the lights might be originating from, and see what I could find. I didn’t know of any power station between us and the airport, but I was accepting of the idea that possibly there was one, and that maybe they were having some massive power surges at a local power station, and these sustained 20-30 second bursts of light and buzzing sounds of electrical energy, might be coming from something like that. Of course he said to “text” him, if I found anything. By approx. 1:15am, I had driven Northward through NE Portland, watching the sky and seeing nothing further… until I driven approx 4 miles by road (probably less than 2 miles as the crow flies) to a location along the Columbia River, parking myself at a high vantage point at the M. James Gleason Memorial Boat Ramp, which is situated and Western most point of the Portland International Airport…  I sat there with my eyes intently scanning the horizon, looking back in the direction of NE Portland from where I’d just come… seeing if the event would occur again, back in that direction, or if it were to occur again, would it now be behind me further to the North?  Or what?  I texted my friend, told him where I was parked… and that I’d seen nothing yet. If anything changed, I’d let him know in the morning.  (He was not a late night guy really, so I wanted to check-in and alleviate any concerns he might have for me, still being out…)   Then, at approximately 1:40am —a brilliant green burst of light flashed on what I estimated to be Rocky Butte.  Which is basically one of a half dozen elevated hilltop/mounds around the Portland area.  These small hills resemble Lava Cones in Central Oregon…  They might be big enough to top out 400-600 ft above the average ground level around Portland, and they might host 50-100 homes and acres on them, give or take…  My point being, these large ground mounds are elevated enough, that from my vantage point, Rocky Butte was positioned just South Easterly, approx 3-4 miles (as the crow flies) from my location, and I was looking almost directly OVER the Portland Airport, at this new light burst, mid way up Rocky Butte…  Now, I’m no expert on exploding transformers, but THIS event, was much more like what I would have expected an exploding transformer to be, as I had seen an alleged transformer explode once or twice in my past, and seen the light in the sky, followed by a power outage…  But this was in stark contrast to what we had seen earlier.  This particular burst as I said, was bright green.  It was a flash of bright light, similar to looking at an arc welder (which I know you shouldn’t look at) but my point is that it had a distinct light source at it’s core that was very bright (like an explosion) and it was strong flash of green light, maybe lasting as much as five seconds…but definitely not longer. This light event did NOT seem extraordinary, BUT, it made me feel like my waiting had paid off, as I had been sitting there almost 30min waiting for SOMETHING to happen…  But this felt like a more mundane event, than what we had witnessed earlier. I decided to wait another 5 mins and see what might happen. Then just a few mins later ——— wow.  Just wow. I’d like to note here, Portland International Airport is home to an Air National Guard squadron (my father flew F102’s out of that base in the 60’s), and it’s also home to some of the top US Air Force Pararescuemen and Combat Controllers in the country.  I had spent a few years working in the special operations community and I had the honor of working with these local guys a little bit over the years, and becoming familiar with the base itself. The next “light event” occurred what I estimated at the time, right outside the hangars of the USANG area… granted I was probably at least a mile away, but what I saw was incredible!  A VERY bright green light began to emanate from this point on the base, it got brighter and bigger and sustained itself between approximately 60-75 seconds, an eternity it felt at the time!  This light had something of green diamond shape to it’s light formation when it had reached full intensity after about 10-15 seconds…  I could not believe my eyes… I was running through rational explanations in my head: “it's not an explosion, because it’s sustaining itself… it’s not some search light…because…I’ve never seen ANYTHING like it, and it’s just emanating light, it’s not searching or moving!”  And then, after approx 60-75 seconds… a green beam of light shot straight up into the sky! like a laser…  I can’t explain it, beyond associating it to something you see in the movies… after a few seconds of this sustained green laser beam, directed straight up, I don’t know how far… the burst flashed OUT with an intensity that I can’t really describe.  But when it flashed OFF, it created a ripple of light that rippled southward from there, like an EMP (electro magnetic pulse) wave, that I could see ripple in the sky to the south, OVER the clouds (or through the clouds I guess???) the sky was full of reasonably heavy cloud cover that was present everywhere in the sky… as I had said earlier, it had been heavily raining and very windy that night. After the burst, it was business as usual in the area.  Airport lights were all on. Nothing seemed amiss.  There was NO ACTIVITY in the area of the event……. So I decided to wait a few minutes and see if there would be a response on the tarmac, on the base side of the PDX Airport…  I waited a good 5-6mins patiently, for the show.  The response to this. Nothing came.  There was not any sight of activity or change in the area, from my mile away vantage point.  So — I decided to go closer and investigate. I began the drive around the airport, on the back road to Columbia Blvd, and down the back streets, the back way to the gates of the base…  All the while, keeping my eyes open to the sky for more lights, and keeping my eyes out for any emergency response vehicles…  When I had covered the approx 3 mile drive around to the base, which took maybe…10mins? I found nothing going on there. No vehicles moving on base.  No excess of cars parked inside the fence line, as if excessive amounts of personnel were on duty that weekend… in fact there was not even any increase in visible gate security. I was very confused. I drove on around the outside of the fence line on the street that parallels the base and passes the entry points to the base, which also has access to the airport tarmac… I drove to a point where I had triangulated my sight line, to where I believed the event had occurred, in relation to specific buildings/hangars and flood light sources on site…  I parked along the gate and got out of my vehicle and stood there a moment. It was silent.  It was nearly 2am on New Years Day, and there was nothing happening there at all. I couldn’t believe no one was there supervising whatever it was.  Or responding to it. I then drove on around the base, to another vantage point on 82nd Ave, which is a public street that feeds traffic to the Portland airport…  I pulled into the gravel on the side of the road, at a position which would now place me just East of where whatever I saw happen, happened…  I looked everywhere, and i saw nothing…  By now, maybe 15min had passed, since the described event. I look directly up.  And I notice a HUGE circular opening in the clouds over the airport. All of the clouds above the airport were gone.  I could see the stars.  And it was like a giant circle had been cut out of the clouds… maybe a mile across?  Maybe more…  But the sky over the airport was now completely clear. I can’t explain any of it further than I have. I went home.",2017-10-19T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

But , we chose to take a drive anyway, maybe more for the memories of times past  then for us . We figured we take a short drive and go straight to the high end neighborhood of Traditions , with their multi million dollar homes and see what they had.  We drove through their neighborhood and realized that folks just were not decorating the way they use too.  Dissapointed, we decided to head back home , on our way home I noticed a house on a side street that had a nicely decorated house and decided to take a side trip and get a look,  It was a sub division with one way in and one way out , basically just a big loop, we admired the house lights and continued! driving and realized we were coming back around to the entrance road,  That's when my wife noticed a light over my left shoulder and said ( look ! what's that ? ) as I looked over my left shoulder I saw the biggest red ORB ever, it was 9'-12' across, moving around 100 mph from east to west , about 50' off the ground , I tried capturing it on video, but my camera wouldn't capture the light, I was able to get off one image as it was heading away, ( p.s..)

Today I used google earth to plot the direction and the local Ionia prison is about 45km away on the same degree heading. Maybe I saw prison yard lights but at that distance they were so high in the sky I don't know how that is possible.

In mid January (15-20,)*, 1966, while enroute to Guam aboard the U.S.S. Wedderburn (DD-684), I was the Quartermaster of the Watch (QMOW)(Asst. Navigator) on the midwatch (0000-0400) Midnight to 4AM.  I was using my 7 X 50 binoculars scanning the clear sky and enjoying the “dome effect.”  We were on Independent Steaming heading for Guam as part of our WestPac assignment.  I initially sighted a formation of five white lights in a vee formation at 90 degrees overhead.  Our course was approximately 250 degrees.  The formation was very high at satellite level approximately.  I “chewed out” the lookouts above me for not reporting them.  I contacted CIC (combat-information center) to see what they had on radar.  These objects were moving slowly heading in the same direction towards Guam so I assumed maybe it was flight of aircraft.  I immediately logged in the sighting in the ship’s log, standard procedure.  At this point CIC contacted Guam Air force base to see what aircraft they had coming in, standard Navy procedure.  By now, one to three minutes had passed both Officer of the Deck (OOD) and the Junior OOD were observing the objects along with the Boatswain’s Mate of the watch (BMOW) and the two lookouts. Guam radioed back that they had no aircraft returning and to check with Tachikawa Air Force base in Japan to see what they had in the area.  They in turn suggested we contact British radar in Hong Kong to see who might be in the area.  All the responses were negative, at least five minutes had passed.  (We were in a flurry of activity).  As we observed this formation it suddenly conducted a 90 degree turn, without hesitation and literally “took off’ they disappeared in a blur! I was calling out, “Dead reckoning” to establish where they might have gone.  We all lowered our binoculars slowly and looked at each other.  I asked the OOD, who at that time was the Operations Officer and a very serious individual, “What was that speed Sir, Mach 25, 30, light speed?”  My next question was how was I to log that in officially?  He looked at us and stated:  “Gentlemen, I believe we would call those UFOs” then he looked at me “Quartermaster log it as we saw it.”  So in the ship’s log, I stated that the five objects in a vee formation executed a 90 degree turn without hesitation heading South at an extremely high speed, Mach speed unknown.  Witnesses consisted of the two officers, two lookouts the BMOW, the messenger of the watch, our sound-phone man and myself. I stated “satellite level” due to the fact we were aware of the “Echo” satellite at that time  and we knew where and when it would be over us.  We often used it as ruse while training officers in using a sextant, claiming it was an “important fast moving star” vital to our position. Satellites never change course.  That ship’s log disappeared.  I know this because I was in charge of storing logs that were filled and I wanted to keep that particular page for myself as evidence.  So when I went to the storage area on the ship to retrieve the log it was gone, someone had “removed” it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",,,

In 1968, in Los Alamitos, CA, I was waiting out in the car for my mom to finish a quick visit to a neighbor.  I was 14.  It was night and it was winter. A ll of a sudden I just became aware of a massive deep sound like a sine wave going up down up in pitch.  I looked around and saw nothing.  Then I leaned forward and looked up from the front seat.  Hovering above me was a craft.  I got out of the car, excited but also intimidated.  I stood between the open door of the car, one hand on the car and one on the door.  In the air directly above me was a large bright laser red orb, about the size of a small house, about 100 ft up in the air. Orbiting around it was the same bright red light which looked just like radar - it circled the orb, then there would be a fraction of a second when there was a gap, then it blipped on again and orbited around again.  Just like how radar looks on the screen.  No wind.  No exhaust. And though the sound was massive it didn’t hurt my ears or rumble my intestines.  Also, this was a heavily populated suburban tract and although the sound was huge, no one was running out of their houses to see what was going on.  My mom and sister had finished their visit and came outside and started yelling excitedly.  Her friends followed her out. All loudly responding to this thing.  This happened in a matter of minutes.  Then it took off straight up to a very distant height and from my perspective it was now small as my fingernail.  In just seconds it went that high.  It hovered way up there for a few seconds, then flew down into the distance and I couldn’t see anything because it was below the level of the houses.  Then a few seconds later it took off at a specific angle, like 45 degrees, and moving at tremendous speed it climbed into the sky using the entire expanse from my view, until it was up and out of sight.  There were multiple jets in the sky at the time and they looked like they were moving as fast as tricycles compared to th! is thing.  We lived near a Naval Air Base.  The brightness of th! is craft was glowing so that it only looked like light, similar to a lightbulb, where you can see the glow but not the glass. I was directly below it with a belly up view and that is how I know the orbiting thing wasn’t a single entity, but a radar type energy orbiting dizzyingly fast around the orb.

Biloxi, Mississippi, between 1976 and 1979. I have never reported this story and have only shared it with my closest family and friends.  Those who know me well enough to know I do not lie nor do I embellish stories. Between August, 1976 and May, 1979, I attended Fernwood Junior High School, Pass Road, Biloxi, Mississippi, 39531, for my 7th, 8th and 9th grade years.  So It has been nearly 40 years since my UFO experience.  That being said, though I am a little vague on the exact date or time  the circumstances are still as clear in my mind as if they had happened yesterday. One evening I was among a group of kids who had just finished band practice.  There were probably 7-9 of us waiting for our parents to pick us up.  If I remember correctly it was for concert band and it had to have been at least 8:00pm or 8:30pm, maybe a little later than that.  After practice was finished we were all huddled at the back of the school where it looked over the  football field.  On the other side of the field was an area of woods and past that lie the beaches.  It was completely dark outside and I don’t remember being cold so I believe it was in the late summer or early fall sometime between September and December.  The sky was completely clear and illuminated by only the stars and the moon with a faint glow from some street lights on the front side of the school (north of our position) and from the businesses which lined Beach Blvd, approximately a mile away on the other side of the woods, to the south.  Biloxi was east of or location and Gulfport was to our west.  Also lying east of our location was Keesler Air Force Base.  My father was stationed there. We were all gathered and just talking.  When someone in the group noticed a bright light that appeared at the top of the trees.  Since it was on the other side of the field I estimate it was approximately 200 feet +/- away from or location and based on the its position above the field I estimate that it had an approximately diameter of 40-60 feet.  It was a bright white sphere that was completely silent and slowly glided just above the tree line towards the direction of Gulfport until it was out of our line of sight.  It only took about 30 seconds for it to disappear past the tree tops. After a moment of silent disbelief a buzz of talking incurred with questions about the source of the light but what happened next really sent the conversation into a frenzy.  As I said the sphere was completely silent but approximately 20 seconds after it disappeared a group of helicopters came into view at the top of the trees to our east.  They were not in a straight line but in some kind of formation spread out from the tree line towards the beach.  We heard them loud and clear before we even saw them (which squashed the point that the Sphere was too far away for us to hear) and they followed the same exact path across the top of the trees, east to west, hurriedly scanning below with search lights, along their path, as they passed the school.   About that time we heard our parents blow their car horns and we went running up to the front of the school. We loaded into the car (I was riding with a friend) and excitedly began to describe our experience. We were headed East on Pa! ss Road towards home. I lived in Thrower Park, which was base housing.  No sooner had we started driving down Pass Road when 4-5 police cars, with lights and sirens blaring, sped past us in the direction of Gulfport. This only fueled our speculations.  The next day I looked in the newspapers for any word of the events of the previous evening but there was nothing.  Of course we spoke of it at school and I kept watch in the papers for several weeks but eventually gave up on finding out what happened that night. Over the years I have thought of our experience often and wondered about the truth but in my mind I have no doubt about what we saw.  During my father’s 20 year career in the Air Force he worked on mission specific equipment for aircraft and I was in and around aircraft frequently when I would visit the hangers where he worked.  Some of the mission equipment he worked on was for the Hurricane Hunters and I was very aware of what a weather balloon was and what it looked like.  So much so that as a child I wanted to grow up to be a weather person. I was captivated by weather and the Hurricane Hunters.  We had also lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and been to the hot air balloon festivals on several occasions, during my childhood. I wish I could say I remember the date and the names of the other kids who were present that night but other than my recollection of the experience and a few nicknames I am at a loss.  How I wish we had the internet then.  I may not have been able to find any information back then but I have never forgotten and would love to know if there is anyone else out there, who went to Fernwood Junior High during that period, and who has not forgotten either.

We are both 65 years of age.  Please Respect that?  On Aug. 25th, 2017, at approximately 8:30 PM my wife and I were looking forward to getting to a location where we could get settled in for the night.  We were riding in our 37 foot Diesel Pusher at a speed of about 60 miles per hour, slightly downhill, travelling Southeast on highway 550, and a few miles south of Napeezi, New Mexico.  We had been talking about how the roads had changed 2 lanes to 4 lanes since the last time I had driven.   Out of nowhere I saw a light flash in front of me, it had come from my left.  I instinctively looked to my left and I saw 2 creatures setting about 2 foot apart, very bright craft which was at my eye level while setting in the Motorhome. I instantly seemed to take a mind picture of what I was seeing.  At that time we were maybe 80 feet and gaining on their position. My first thought was is this real, the closer we got the more positive I was that what I was seeing was real when I made eye contact. Some points I saw was; The craft did not appear to have a windshield. The panel in behind the creatures gave off a very bright light, as did the floor and ceiling.  It was as bright as a operating room under full lighting.  There was as small stem that came up from the floor in front of the creatures.  It stood about 40 inches out of the floor.  It seemed to support a  small control panel that was thinner the a carton of cigarettes.  The guy on my left had his gopher looking hand resting on it. The moment I saw them, the individuals were looking down the road as if looking for something to arrive.  There was a truck coming up the hill toward us and about a 1/8th of a mile away.  The craft seemed to swing and rotate from the shoulder on the other side to a lane away was at my side and maybe 20 foot away.  Once they rotated enough that their faces was 180% to us, he saw us and disappeared.  As we drove on down the hill I looked in my mirrors and side camera and didn’t see anything related to them after that. A description of the creatures we witnessed: Both individuals had a skin tone about the same as mine, I’m a white male. They had large heads in a upside down teardrop shape, very large black eyes, a small mouth and 2 small holes for a nose.  There were holes for the ears but only a nub for ears.  Very much like the drawing you would see in Roswell, accept not green, but green uniforms.  The one on the right had a very smooth face. The one on the left appeared to be older with facial lines.  The one on my Left wrinkled his right side of his mouth when he saw me, but they were talking when we interrupted them. I made eye contact with the one on my left and looked directly into his large black eye.  His eye was the finest surface I had ever seen.  The eye had no abrasions or scratches , no dust or mucus.  I noticed  that under the surface of this perfectly clear outer surface of the eye was a grid of many individual eyes, like a Fly’s Eye’s but much smoother super fine glass surface. Their bodies where skinny and were illuminated with a greenish glowing uniform.  Also there was roll type cuffs  that also glowed, but was a beige. They reminded me of stick people.  The arms and the torso were slender and about the diameter of a very small child of 6  or 7 years of age. The hands reminded me of the shape of gophers.  But these creatures are large in height and reach, that hand appeared to me to be a lethal weapon. Their torso was long and skinny and appeared to be weak if depended on.  But I believe the suit they wear is their body strength. The back wall is very hard to explain because I believe however they traveled was behind that wall.  The wall was very brightly illuminated.  It appeared to be divided into about 18 inch cubes but wasn’t, it was a flat surface.  The light seemed to be boiling along the edges of each panel in the colors of light greenish, blue, violet.  But the power heaved with its changes it seemed.  The back panel was incredibly beautiful and something I’ll never forget it. We could not see the outer body of the craft because we were looking into very bright light. As for hearing anything, I felt I heard them communicating when we approached",2017-10-19T00:00:00,,

It was a steady bright white light moving very fast with no sound, and none after.  At first I thought it might be the space station because I have seen that before on nights when the news reported that it would be flying over.  This seemed smaller and slightly less bright than the space station and moved just like a satellite.  The boys both witnessed this with me. As the light moved to the south of us it went out and reappeared further south a few times which was strange because there was not a cloud in the sky and stars in the vicinity were still visible.  Then it did a sudden 90 degree zig zag type move at a speed that a plane or jet, even military would not be capable of.  At least not one that I know of.  It was something out of a science fiction movie the way this light was zig zagging,  The distance and speed and angle of the turns was Like nothing I have ever seen.

They spread out some then the one to my right went straight up.  It was a clear night with high cirus clouds and it made it into the clouds in I'd guess 5-8 seconds.  No sound from either one.  I was hoping a car would come by so someone else would see it.  I saw a man walking away from me and I yelled at him to look up.  He came over and we watched waiting for the other to also go up into the clouds.  It stayed at I'd guess 1500 feet for another minute or so then it also went straight up into the clouds.  I had a hard time keeping the other man's attention on the orange lights, I typically carry a pistol and he kept wanting to talk about my gun.

We are 98% sure this was not an airplane or helicopter due to the fact we live less than 5 miles from the Camdenton airport and can constantly see planes landing and taking off from our house.  We watched the craft or orb track slow and all of a sudden vanish.  As I said before we are by an airport and saw at least 4 planes within a half hour take off from airport and could see any which direction the flew on that clear night and coul follow the planes blinking red and green lights for a long period of time.  This one single slow moving light was lower than a commercial airliner and simply vanished.  Wife and I saw it at same time and she has always been skeptical on all paranormal but said to me this was quite an unusual happening.

While we were looking to the sky, west of where we were standing, we both saw a very bright orangey-yellow light flying upwards from behind a couple of trees.  It wasn't very close, it seemed to be a few neighborhoods over, and we were just watching it fly up.  An airplane was flying at the time and I am very familiar with airplane lights, so when my cousin assumed it was an airplane, I assured her that it was not.  It was extremely bright and sort of round, so it could not have been an airplane.  I only saw one, and in order to rationalize it, I thought that it could have been a paper lantern someone had lit and released into the air, that's how bright it was.  However, it started getting higher in the sky and closer! to where my cousin and I were standing.  If it was a paper lantern, in a couple of minutes it should have caught fire and burned up.  The light started dimming and that's what I assumed it was doing under the paper-lantern theory, and then it disappeared.  We were still out there waiting for the friend, and after the 3 minutes it spent in the sky, I noticed it started glowing again after disappearing.

Afterwards, I thought they might have been fire balloons -- until I saw the one photo that came out.  Those wild orange swirls are the motions of the orange dots within the second it took to snap the photo. They are NOT the result of camera motion because 1) they are not at all the same, and 2) that bright green squiggle in the lower left is a string of Christmas tree lights across the street, and it's absolutely unblurred and crisp.

They were about 500 feet above us and did not make a sound, as we shut off the boat motor, thinking they were helicopters. No sound.  They hovered over us for about 15 minutes and then two of them went straight up turned 90 degrees, went around the one still hovering and then stopped. After watching for about another 10 minutes, we decided we had better get back to our camp.  The discs followed hovering above us. Once back at our camp, the discs went straight up until they were about the size of quarters. They then came straight down.  They seemed to come down in a clearing about a thousand yards away, as we could see the lights through the trees. This un-nerved us to the point were we sat outside our camper with our guns ready, watching the lights to see what may happen next. After about ten minutes, all three discs lifted straight up from the trees and once above the trees, went 90 degrees to the left and then went straight up until they disappeared from view.  The speed they left was amazing, faster than any jet I have seen. We waited another 5 minutes to see if they would come back, but they did not. We talked about what we saw and when we got home, my father contacted colleagues back at the Cold Lake Air Force Base to see if any flights, weather balloons, or any other objects were in the area about that time of night. Nothing was reported. After that, we didn't discuss with each other, or anyone else. About 20 years later, I asked my father about the incident and we agreed on what we saw that night.  He also mentioned that he didn't discuss the incident, as it had un-nerved him, as it was nothing he had ever encountered. I have not seen anything like that before, or since.

At that time I was 13 years old the other person who may have witnessed this was by great-grandmother who was suffering from severe dementia. My mother and I were caring for my Great-Grandmother at her home in the countryside.  One evening she began telling us that little men were looking in her window at her and that they were walking on her roof.  We didn't think anything of it other than her mind was playing tricks on her. She died peacfully, later that year, from natural causes and we eventually moved to another state.  Years later, either 86 or perhaps 87, I saw a book on UFO's.  I picked it up and as I was thumbing through it I saw an artists rendition of a what is commonly refered to as a ""Grey"".  I was immeditaly flooded with terror and I flashed back to possibly one or possibly two events that happened to me in Iowa on my Great-Grandmothers farm.  Both occurences happened to me when I was home alone and early in the evening and when I was asleep. I say possibly two events because I ""feel"" like there was at least two incidents.  I ""know"" there was 1. I woke to find at least 2 greys looking at me through my bedroom window.  That window looked out over my Great-Grandmothers roof, her room being an add on to previous construction.  They lifted the window and walked around the bed to myside which was opposite the window but closest the door.  I remember I was trying to yell but I could only croak and groan like my brain no longer understood language.  I was in a waking sleep state.  One of them stayed at the foot of the bed and the other came over to stand beside me and the memory of THEM suddenly ends. I clearly remeber two nights when I woke from nightmares I could not remember with my mothers headlights shining into my room when she topped the hill, returning fron town with my Great-Grandmother. It could not have been late because of my grandmothers condition and I think it was fall because it was pitch black outside and I dont recall the chill of spring. To this day I feel like this actually happened and was not a simple nightmare. What convinces me is how vivid and sudden the recollection came when I saw the picture of the grey. On a side note there was a movie with Mel Gibson several years ago that happened to be about ET's in Iowa that I watched and experienced great primal fear from. I am a retired Sergeant from the US Army and was a professional bounty hunter for years, and this memory still causes me to feel uneasy. I was moved to write because I read a recent article about Navy Jets chasing a UFO and the Pentagon's recent program to investigate. Do not post my email address publicly.

High altitude surveillance or intelligent plasma balls? I noticed two small objects at a very high altitude, slightly east of where I was standing in Louisville, KY.  I was facing northeast and looking directly up while recording video on my iphone.  When the objects began moving closer overhead, they gained altitude.   I ran in to get my phone and recorded for a couple minutes, then I got binoculars and watched them remain overhead for about an additional 6-7 minutes.  Viewing with the naked eye they appear to twinkle very brightly, as though someone were reflecting the sun with a mirror; much brighter than the reflection off an airplane, and not like a flashing light but more of a shaky erratic effect and far brighter.   Through the binoculars they were very different.  They didn't appear to be reflecting light, they were just a bright citrusy yellow, like a tennis ball.  They were spherical with no wings.   The reason they appeared to twinkle is because they each seemed to be made of two spheres attached to each other, but rolling around each other in a rapid undulating and random orbit with no space in between the two parts.  This effect caused them to look elongated for short moments as the two spheres that made the individual objects were sometimes next to each other instead one on top of the other.   I tried to search for other reports of similar objects, but most were at night.  Some web sites talked about plasma orbs but I am not sure because the color was consistent.  Whatever they were, they seemed to be intelligently driven, because they stayed together and once they were overhead they didn't leave, as though they were looking back! (no voice to skull technology or other communication used on me, sorry)  This is not the first time (I assume by the naked eye view) I have seen one of these.  A few months ago, also during bright daylight, I saw one while walking into a gas station.  I watched it for 3-4 minutes, twinkling brightly but not moving at all, until a cloud covered it.  The two on the recent occasion disappeared behind chemtrails that were drifting.  A cold front had just moved through and we had surprisingly clear skies (still have today).  The chemtrails have been very heavy here for months, lessening on most weekends.  I also captured an excellent shot of a sun halo, which I have seen many times in the last couple months.  If you have any information or insight, please respond.  If I'm going to keep seeing these things I'd like to understand their nature better.",2017-11-03T00:00:00,38.21121446765155,-85.68918456444217

October 18th 5:10 AM Pyramid Lake, Reno, Nevada  While walking the dog, I saw a flash of light out of the corner of my eye and assumed it was a shooting star.  I expected to see it burn up upon entry into atmosphere.  Instead there were two bright vertical lights in the distance over the lake.  They appeared to hang there for several minutes.  As the lights approached I could see there were actually three large landing type lights in a vertical row.  As the ‘thing’ turned I could now see several red flashing lights and a couple of green pulsing lights behind them.  What was odd was that they were all vertical and nothing horizontal.  There was not a sound coming from that direction.  As a commercial airline  pilot for 36 years I could not imagine what kind of aircraft could have this light formation and move so quietly.  It traveled horizontally across the lake from south to northwest over the Sierras at a fairly rapid rate.  As it was totally dark out, I could not discern any shape behind the lights.  The distance and altitude would be hard to tell although I could see a glow on the lake from the lights, like you can when the moon is bright and shining on water.  I could also see a faint shape of distant mountains behind and above the object.",2017-11-03T00:00:00,39.50650741150443,-119.8174511061947

It flew from behind a tree in my backyard, then i saw it for about 4-5 seconds, then it went into the trees and dissapeared.

Nothing we have.  Personally, i am a UFO enthusiast and i know plently about eveything, so i could accept it and easily identify it as A triangular craft.

As for the pictures, my friend who took them said objects were orange and low in the sky. When she saw pictures they look far away and are white.  She said they looked like they had tails.  She doesn't remember any sounds. I hope this helps and I'd like to know if any other sightings we're reported in the area. ((END ADDENDUM))",2018-01-12T00:00:00,41.66651057471264,-83.59862988505748

I went out and started to walk towards the field.... I saw Lights coming from behind trees and I thought it might be some sort of Farm machinery. It has been known for the Farm To a work late at night.... Why I went to investigate I can not explain as I have never done that before.  I just had a feeling I had to go and look..... The lights where about 10ft apart and not very bright. They where about 5ft wide and about 5ft high... The shape of the ship was roundish dome and appeared to have a dull grey finish but it was dark... For some reason I did not feel afraid and looked at it for a little while, I suppose I thought that it may have been a military aircraft as we are not to far from a base.... The total size was about 50 to 60 feet across and the hight was about 25 to 30 feet and it did not seem to be touching the ground..... Somehow I found myself inside  the craft. I have no recollection how I got there.... The interior had very dim lights and had a very strange smell of almonds.... There where about 4 or 5 small humanoid figures in the  shadows...... I could not hear any voices but they seemed to be conversing with each other..... It was hard for my eyes to adjust to the light.... I was on a floating table that was moving around... It felt like I was there for only about 5 minutes..... but I was there for about 90 minutes..... I found myself by the path by my bungalow about  How I got there I don't know, the time was around 1.00am...... I don't recall seeing or feeling anything being done to me. But I did feel very light headed for around 20 minutes afterwards.....  I told my  my wife when I got home what had happened,  She did not believe me at first....  She did go looking for me about 20 minutes after I had gone to investigate but did not see me or any ship.....  The whole thing was very traumatic and I am certain what I saw and experienced......   I have had three dreams since that experience that have me in a room and again on a floating table. I don't remember much apart from being surrounded by small ( about 4 to 4 and a half feet tall) humanoid beings......  They don't seem to be doing anything to me but I do feel restrained by my wrists and ankles I am not struggling to get away and strangely feel very relaxed....  The beings have heads that are out of proportion to the rest of there bodies. They have 4 fingers on each hand with a gap between the middle of their fingers.. They have very large eyes that did not seem to have pupils of any kind They had no ears or what I would call a nose.  No hair anywhere and  grayish in colour with very smooth skin. They did not seem to be wearing any clothing but the lighting was very dim as if strong lights would have been uncomfortable for them...  The lights inside where oval in shape and about 3ft in size. There where about a dozen or so..  I was coherent for about 10 or 15 minutes  I would have put this down to dreams but they have all been exactly the same and on one occasion I woke to have marks on my wrists like strap marks I do have pictures taken by a friend...  I can't explain any of this but I do not want to know what if anything has happened to me for personal reasons..  I have reported my experiences to Mufon but the have not followed it up because I don't want regression therapy.... ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter  Thatyou for your reply  I did report the incident to Mufon at the time but they wanted me to undertake regression therapy at a cost to myself, this would have cost hundreds of pounds and when i declined they did not seem interested anymore. I did not report it to any law enforcement as i new i would have suffered some sort of ridicule. The incident happened a while ago now but i thought that i would report it to you so it may have the recognition that i feel it deserves.

At 2:37 pm, I was driving back to their old house to pick up the next load, when I noticed a stationary black object in the sky above the tree line in front of my car.  The jet black object caught my eye because it stuck out conspicuously against the crisp blue sky.  I immediately realized it was something out of the ordinary.  Excited and perplexed, I stopped the car and fumbled to get my phone out to capture it on video.  The object hovered silently and motionless in the sky.  It appeared to ascend slightly and very slowly at one point.  Otherwise, it did not move at all.  (A close review of the video suggests it also may have rotated along its vertical axis, like a spinning top, but I did not see any rotation while watching it with my own eyes).  It made no sound.  It was shaped like an upside-down cone or pyramid.  It had a distinct, sharp outline against the sky.  It looked dense, heavy and sturdy, and not made of flimsy or lightweight materials.  It definitely was not a natural object (e.g., a cloud or bird).  It looked mechanical, like some sort of machine.  But it did not have any discernable features of an aircraft (e.g., wings, propellers or a tail) or anything else that can fly.  It had no visible propulsion system or other means of flight.  It appeared shiny and shimmered somewhat, which I believe was sunlight reflecting off its surface.  Otherwise, it did not emit any light.  I asked a family member driving behind me if he saw the object (he did) and knew what it was (he did not).  He was not as interested in the object as I was and drove away.  After filming for about a minute, I also drove away because we were on a tight schedule.  I continued to watch the object as I drove and realized it was much higher up and farther away—and therefore much bigger—than I initially thought.  I recorded three videos.  The first one at 2:37 p.m. is through my windshield and, unfortunately, does not keep the object in the frame very well.  I captured the second video through my open window at 2:38 p.m., a few hundred yards down the road.  I stopped again about a quarter mile farther down the road to record the third video at 2:39 p.m.  After that, I continued to look at the object while driving but lost sight of it around 2:42 p.m., when trees along the road obscured my view of the sky.  The last time I saw the object, it was still hovering in the same spot where I first noticed it.  I have speculated that the object could have been a balloon, a kite or a drone.  I ruled out the first two options mainly because it did not behave—e.g., sway, pitch or pivot—like something that was tethered to the ground while flying.  Although a drone is the most plausible explanation, I do not think this was a drone.  The object was too high (~300-1000 ft.) and too large (~5-20 ft. tall) to be a drone, at least one available to the public.  It was also too motionless, for too long.  It did not drift or tilt in the wind; it simply did not move.  Even an experienced drone pilot probably cannot keep one completely still for several minutes in outdoor conditions.  I do not contend that the object I saw was (or was not) extraterrestrial.  I honestly do not know what it was or where it came from.  But I definitely saw something—a tangible object—in the sky that I cannot identify or explain.",2017-12-21T00:00:00,37.558607538635506,-77.50798002261591

About 15 minutes east of Casper, WY, I was in the slow lane, there was a truck approaching me to the rear, he was faster than I, as I can only run 67 mph in a 80 mph.  I was on the phone with my co-worker in South Dakota.  I was talking through my stereo and just took a sip of my Pepsi and as I was looking up from setting it in my cup holder, I saw a, what looked like/resembled a human, standing either on the road in between the yellow line and the edge of pavement, or just standing off of it by the snow reflectors.  It was all the way to the left of the left lane traveling east bound.   As I looked up from my cup holder, I see something, looked as to it was standing straight up from bending at the waist, was facing  at a 45 drgree angle to me.  It was looking SE, I saw the back and then the right side as I passed.  When it was almost straight up, its left arm shot up and stayed up, a lot quicker than it stood up.  It was not fazed, that I sped by, like deer and antelope are, just kinda looking somewhere, doing something.  It was all grey, flat, medium, dull grey.  I thought about ppl on stilts, Halloween, etc. .  Didn't see the hands to much, but the fist or whatever that shot to the sky looked big and clumpy.   What I described to my co-worker on the phone as, was a really tall Statue of Liberty.  Saw the left hand/arm, looked like was holding something, but clumpy and blurry from my speed.  I got the worst hair raising chills ever, in my life.  They were pulsing and in waves with every hair on my body standing up for about ten  minutes.  And that's just not me,  I prey for zombies, but this scared the crap out of me.  As I was approaching the first turnaround, I told him I was going to take it.  He talked me out of it, and past the next 2 turnarounds.  The truck that was fast approaching me from the rear, over the next hill I saw that he was about 3-4 miles behind me i! nstead of 1.  He musta slowed down, these trucks take for ever to stop. When I got back to my baker dock that morning, I stood next to my drivers door.  I'm 5'10"" and the bottom of my semi's window is over 6'.  I saw the 'Grey' then, and to see his shoulders and head as I passed, taken in corporate for height and distance, ten feet to left of my truck, it had to be 7' + tall.  It looked like the Liberty Tax ppl that stand outside of the shop on tax season with their arm in the air.  With the foam hat and all waving their sign. Again, this all happened in a matter of seconds.  I got talked out of turning around, as per company, we are only 'allowed' to carry knives.  But if it was a split second sooner, I coulde of stuffed my brakes and recorded the previous 11 seconds to the following 11 seconds and had it recorded.  I did not see any overturned cars in the median or off to any side, that night or the following nights, as this is my current nightly route.  There is quite a few more dead animals than normal with in maybe 2 miles both ways on the eastbound lanes than normal, but it is hi tins session.",2017-10-19T00:00:00,42.95549591836735,-106.3505193877551

On Wednesday morning, October 4, 2017, at approximately 6:05 a.m. I had to take one of my three dogs outside on a leash due to major surgery he just had.  Normally, I allow them to go out by themselves because I have a fenced back yard. While the other two dogs were running around the back yard, the dog I had on the leash just stood in the middle of the driveway looking around.  While he was doing that, I was noticing how nice the stars were and the little dipper was visible.  The cold front had not moved in yet, but I did notice some light clouds moving in. Something caught my dogs attention and he started to walk down the driveway to the back yard. We were headed North on the driveway.  That is when I noticed a bright ball of light arcing from about ½ a mile from my driveway on the East side.  It was about 300 feet in the air arcing East.  Then it literally stopped for a few seconds in mid-air, and then flew straight up into the sky until I could not see it any longer. From my location the ball looked to be bigger than a soft ball and as bright as a led light.  When we all went back inside the house 40 minutes had already gone by. The 40 minutes that passed from us going outside and going back in again is confusing. Our morning journey outside usually lasts 10 minutes. After we went inside I heard a helicopter near my house.",2017-10-19T00:00:00,42.56675797546012,-83.15395782208589

In my windshield it was about the size of a dime, maybe smaller.  Pretty intense unique glowing orb or sphere, could not see any solidity to it, whatever it was it was big, and powerful, and seemed to be stationary.  I checked my blind spot, changed lanes and it was gone.  Nothing in the sky at all, this was too high to be any sort of land based object, too late in night and gloomy to be a reflection.  I wish I never took my eyes off it because now I will never be able to piece together what I saw or where it went. I cannot believe it was not on the news, or posted online somehow.  This sighting seems similar to some other sightings, but this was not any sort of misidentified jet or craft, no blinking or anything like that, just an intense ball of light..............I am baffled, maybe someone else will come forward, I feel alone on this one.

Three (3) soft glowing orange lights appeared over the tree line of the island.  Trees are approximately 30-40 foot tall.  The lights were pulsating between each other.  They were close enough to reflect light off of the water below and within 100 ft of where we were standing in the room.  The episode was completely silent. This position lasted approximately five (5) minutes with them taking turns ascending and descending while hovering at the tree line.  Then all three of them lined up in unison ascended across the tree line and quickly shot into the sky at a 9 o'clock 12 o'clock and 3 o'clock direction.  They ascended high enough to appear like airplanes and shot back and forth in a chaotic flight pattern at which time joining with numerous other lights we saw that were also in an erratic flight pattern.

It never occurred to me at the moment that fighter jets don't usually have all their lights off, save for a singular blinking red light.   Then seemingly out of nowhere, right next to it, I saw a yellowish ball of light appear for around four seconds, flying adjacent to the jet, and then it disappeared.  I kept watching the jet to see if the light would reappear, and then the ball of light came back for the same duration as before and disappeared again, then it came back again for a total of three times... It didn't look like any man-made aircraft I had ever seen before, and it did not make a sound like two jets do when flying in unison.  It didn't have any blinking lights on it when the large yellowish-white ball of light would fade out.  It wasn't very bright and didn't give off a lot of light, but it was clearly visible, and bigger than the jet and a little faster than the jet itself.  It seemed as though jet was chasing it.   Two more fighter jets appeared no more than five minutes after the sighting heading in the same direction.

PA I was out fishing with my father that evening, and we were returning home, when noticed a super bright white light hovering across the street from our home--I would 100 to 150 feet away.  We both initially thought it was a helicopter with a search lights.  These lights were white and were arranged in a single row of three.  They were so bright that you could only look at them directly for a very short period of time.  Also, because the lights were so bright you could not see the object that was emitting the light.  We initially stopped our car on the road in front of our home and watched the lights from inside the car for about 5 minutes.  After the lights went out I quickly pulled the car into our driveway at which time we both got out of the car.  I then looked in the direction which we see the lights and I then spotted a 30-40 foot black triangle--all sides were the same size.  The triangle had 5 pinkish/orange lights (close to the color of a sodium vapor street light) on each side of the mid-section of the craft.   The craft started to move very, very slowly towards us like it detected our presence.  As the craft got closer, I ran to the side of the road, and it was at this time directly the other side of the road.  The craft was only a two lane road without shoulders away and it was just about the telephone poles.  It was so close I could have thrown a stone at it and hit it.  While it was directly across from me I could see the top and bottom of the craft was flat/non-reflective black in color and I didn't see any seams or joint.  The mid-section was a flat/non-reflective; dark grey color and the pinkish/orange lights were being emitted from hemispherical globes maybe 3 or 4 foot in diameter.  The mid-section also had narrow, vertical ridges which were cylindrical in shape and were as tall as the mid-section, which I would estimate to be about 8-10 feet in height.  The lights were steady and didn't blink or change intensity.!  The craft continued to move slowly following the edge of the! road. I walked with the craft following it from the other side of the road until I reach the edge of our property.  The craft continued to move down the road until it took a right turn, which the craft did not bank or change speed.  I saw the craft go on the far side of my neighbor’s house and head out over a field that is behind my house.  I stood on a little berm a watched the craft make its way out over the field-the speed or its altitude never changed.  After it made its way out over the field, when it was approximate 200-250 feet away, it just blinked out.  It didn't zoom away at a high rate of speed, it just simply disappeared.  I was dumbfounded by this and stood there in total disbelief for another 10 minutes or so.  The craft never reappeared, it was gone.  I never felt scared at any point, I felt totally calm the entire time.  I had the awareness to check my watch from the very beginning of the sighting and the event lasted roughly 15 minutes and there was no missing time involved.  This event occurred on April 20, 1995, between approximately 1:15 - 1:30 AM.  The craft emitted no sounds, no smells, and no heat.  I didn't see anything that looked like a convention aircraft engine.  The craft's motion was very slow and fluid, no wobbling or jerkiness.  Even though the sighting occurred 22 years ago, until this very day I cannot get that event out of my mind.  Whenever I get idle time during the day or night I automatically start thinking about it.  I often times have dreams involving UFO sightings, which seem extremely realistic. I have had other strange events happen to me after that sighting which I'd rather not discuss at this time. In closing, there is no doubt in my mind what I saw that night.  This craft was literally only a few feet in front of me; it wasn't a mere light in the sky.  I'm not claiming it was from an alien world, but if our military has this kind of technology and if it is that big of a secret, why would they being flyin! g an ultra-top secret craft like that directly across the stre! et from my house, which makes no sense.",2017-12-04T00:00:00,40.4051,-75.88330000000002

This was not an elaborate firework display, but enough to entertain young children.  Some of fireworks would shoot up higher than tree line, explode, and dissipate as they were falling.   While watching the fireworks, I noticed there were some lights just above the last explosion that did not fall or dissipate.  In fact, they were not moving at all, and remained suspended in the same spot above the children.  The unidentified lights, or orbs (3), remained suspended above the area of the fireworks for few minutes, and then moved in a straight line above the deck where I was standing.  It was clear they were not fire works.  There was no doubt they were moving together with intention and direction.   I yelled out to the group to see if others were watching them.  We were amazed and baffled.  Then the orbs proceeded! to move over the house, rising up to scale the roof line.  Their movement made no sound.  They were round, perhaps less than the size of a racket ball, and bright enough to be initially mistaken for light exploding from the fireworks.

I recently contact other members of our Boy Scout troop to see if any of them remembered this instance, and at least three of them did in great detail, one in even better detail than me.   In the Summer of 2009, we were camping at Buffalo Trails Scout Ranch near Balmorea, Texas.  It was most of our Boy Scout troop, probably around twenty boys in all, camping there.  Our Troop was accompanied to camp that summer by three of our Scoutmasters, NAME 1, NAME 2, and NAME 3.  Now on one of the days there wasn’t much going on at camp, Scoutmaster NAME 3 had planned a long hike through the desert, and had selected about six of the oldest and best-ranked scouts to accompany him.  He checked us all out of camp and we headed south along a pre-planned route of hiking trails up Mount Livermore. We drove to the base of Mount Livermore and parked our van at the last shred of road before shouldering our hiking gear and starting what was supposed to be a twelve-hour hike up the mountain.  The hike went pretty much as planned, though our progress was slowed by the rain, and by the time we reached a suitable spot for dinner, a cliffside overlook out into the valley below with the city of Fort Davis twinkling below us, the rain had paused but not yet left us.  As we sat eating, watching the lightning flit about the stormfront in the valley below us, NAME 3 broke out his binoculars for a closer look, as did my friend NAME 4 and a few other Scouts. Suddenly, a cry goes out from NAME 4. “What is that?!?” he asks.  We all start paying attention, and several of us note a craft, lit clearly and gleaming silver from the setting sun, playing about in the stormclouds.  It seemed to move with precision, darting back and forth, up and down, as we watched it move about the stormclouds for about ten minutes, then it darted straight for us and flew more-or-less directly overhead. There was no apparent engine sound, it sounded like a lightning-crack as it passed overhead, and it moved too fast for us to get much of a view, but there were no blinking lights, no wings, no obvious engine nor windows.  We all agreed it was the strangest thing ever seen. During the encounter, I had an old hand-held digital video camera on my person, and I did my best to film some of the encounter, but nothing can be seen because of the great distance involved (by most of our estimates it was between two and five miles away), and I put the camera away shortly thereafter.  It’s hard to tell the size of something rapidly flying directly above you, but I’d estimate its size to be roughly half that of a 747, meaning that it should’ve had a radar signal. Also interesting to note that this was about twenty miles northwest of Marfa, Texas, a town that is well-known for UFO phenomena.

When scanning from the right side of our house to the left side, you could clearly see they formed a semi circle around the area.  Since there were some trees obstructing our view outside, we ran inside to a large window in the dining room on the side of the house.  From there, we were able to get a very clear view of the lights to the right of our house.  None were moving, all appeared to be hovering.  We questioned if they were perhaps planes, but again, they were not moving and there were no additional lights on them.  Also, I'm sure planes would not even be allowed that close in proximity to each other.  I assume being that clo! se they would be considered in each others air space.  We sat there and watched them for about 20 minutes and then they abruptly disappeared.  They did not fly away or dim, they literally just disappeared.  My husband took video from inside the house which did not come out good, likely due to the window glare.  Shortly after they disappeared (about 10 minutes), another appeared by itself.

By by I was unaware of this during filming and still shots.  Ft Note deer running off in background.  The footage although not witnessed by the photographer at the time, doesn't seem to be related to the panning movements of the camera. There are also ""sparks"" in amongst the grass some of which are apparently in shaded areas during the sunset. At one point the object seems to illuminate the surrounding area. In the still there are at least three ""blobs"" underneath the main object which first is seen to the right of the sun, then in the second shot it is above the sun and appears to a darker form above it.  I was wondering if it isn't an optical aberation, if it might be something stranger. This event, if a real strange phenomenon occured during a police search for a missing person who unfortunately had passed on and was discovered in the undergrowth in this vicinity. Just to add, many people love and cherish this person always. Any educated views (optics expertise/ ufology/ orbs?) would be greatly appreciated.

I was in attendance with fiends at a private function in Miami the evening of December 6.  I was aboard the Nobel House, a 50 meter yacht hired for the event celebrating Miami Art Basel. At approximate 11:00 - 11:30 PM I was on the third deck of the yacht and noted what I thought would be terrific photo of an American flag atop the harbormaster’s office.  I raised my phone to take a few photos of the flag.  I noticed in my phone a white object in the distance that was moving both quickly and abruptly.  I was puzzled because I could not see the light when looking into the sky directly, but could only evidence it looking through my iPhone. I decided to videotape what to me was stunningly strange event.  With the surreal party music from the event behind me, and the object far ahead in the distance I captured approximately 10-15 seconds of the moving object before it shot off into darkness. Feeling somewhat overwhelmed by the visual experience, I shared my phone with two friends-both accomplished pilots of many years.  Both pilots shared my surprise and uncertainty, and had no explanation of the nature of the sighting. The only comment that was additive to the experience was from one friend who said, when observing my video, that the light appeared very far off in the distance.  It certainly seemed that way to me. CNN aired a report tonight speaking to new revelations about a government program researching UFOs.  Watching the report, I went back to my video and then, for the first time, went to my still photo of the object.  When I enhance the photo on the screen of my phone, it appears as if it’s a rounded diamond shape, with light emoting around it -similar, say, to a high school science book’s rendition of a neutron, only instead of a circle in the center this looked more diamond-esq. I have no idea if this was a byproduct of my phone’s lense system, but there seems to be no immediate plausible explanation given my phone (a new iPhone 8) operates perfectly, and the experience hasn’t replicated itself. What’s most interesting to me about the whole bit, is that I couldn’t see the light when looking into the sky.  It was only through the lens of my cell phone. I’m a liberal arts major, not a science or math guy-so I have no idea what this was and look forward to any thoughts or observations that you might provide.",2017-12-21T00:00:00,25.804495805142086,-80.13392828146144

We saw a blue-green moving across the sky from east southeast to west southwest.  The sky was clear.  There were 2 airplanes visible in the sky at the time, which is normal, since we live close to NAS-JAX. The object looked very similar to a bright star, but slightly larger and brighter.  It did not blink and did not appear to twinkle at all.  It was larger and brighter than any stars visible at the time.  I would estimate that from our point of view, it appeared similar in size and brightness to the north star.  We did not hear any sound.   It moved very quickly but did appear to slow down for a few seconds one time before resuming its previous speed.  The object stayed on the same path making no turns for the full time it was in view.  We were able to see the object very clearly from the time it appeared on the horizon to our east all the way through its path to the western horizon, until it became too faint in the distance. We have a lot of military and civilian aircraft traffic in our area and are very aware of how they behave in the sky.  Any aircraft that was close enough for its lights to appear this size and brightness would have been very easy to hear.  The speed of the object could not be matched by any of the fighter jets that we commonly see.  Any aircraft capable of this speed would not have been silent if it were flying low enough, and close enough, to appear this size in she night sky.  There were no additional lights as would be expected on a plane or helicopter either.  An object with this speed and brightness flying high enough to be inaudible would have to be absolutely massive.

December 13, 2017.  At About 9:00 PM Pacific Time December 13, 2017 in Vancouver, Washington, I saw what I strongly believe to be a UFO.  I was outside to watch the meteor show when I saw an object moving from West to East.  I was looking north.  If you were to hold up a ruler at arm’s length it travel about 18 inches.  Without slowing down it then made a very sharp turn south maybe a 90 degree turn and if holding a ruler at arm’s length I could see it travel about 4.5 feet. If you held up a dime at arm’s length that would be about the size of the object, maybe slightly larger.  It appeared to be round but not sure if it were a true round object as I was watching this at about a 70 degree angle from the ground which would give it a slight appearance of being oval.  But I would say it was round. They were few clouds out that night and there were no clouds interfering with my view of the object. The best way I could describe the object is as follows.  Picture a perfectly round fried egg and hold it up at a 70 degree angle.  That round egg now looks slightly oval which is how I saw it.  The background that the object was seen against was night time black. The whole object was not bright but very faint as if there were clouds beneath it, but there were no clouds beneath it as the stars in the same area were brite.  The entire yoke part of the egg would look an orange/red color, but more orange than red and faint.  The entire white of the egg look like a translucent aura with the same color as the yoke but much more faint as it did appear to be translucent.  I could not see any dome or any other geometric shapes.  So there were no distinct individual lights just this faint glow. It travel in a perfect straight line going from west to east, and when it made that sharp turn to the south.  It also traveled in a straight line.  It did not move up or down, no other objects were seen with it.  There were no flashing lights and no other color then the color describe above. It made no noise of any kind.  Aircraft from nearby PDX could clearly be heard but no sound came from the object.  There were no other aircraft at that time that may have covered up any sound coming from the object I was observing. It was traveling at a speed I would say somewhat faster than aircraft landing or taking off from PDX.  If it was a UFO I would say that the speed it was traveling at was a good cruising speed for a UFO. Also when it turned south it would have been heading toward PDX or near PDX.  This object maintain the same altitude the whole time I observed it and it was not in any typical landing pattern for PDX. There were no trails of smoke or haze it maintain the shape of the egg and everything I observed about the object stayed within those perimeters. It was not somebody on the ground with some kind of light shining up into the sky.  There was no beam of light going up into the sky plus anyone on the ground would not have been able to shine a light for the distance that I saw this object travel.  A light coming from the ground would have been interrupted by houses and trees.  It also was not a weather balloon. There are four very distinct attributes about the object I observed.  1) Appearance was larger than any aircraft I have seen flying overhead.  2) It made no sound.  3) The aura that completely went around the object. 4) It made a very sharp turn.  All other aircraft I have seen have to make a curved turn, this was a sharp turn like the corner of a square. I will be 71 years old in February 2018 and in my life time I have never seen anything like what I saw, or anything closely resembling what I saw.

Saturday night, myself, my two kids, my boyfriend, and two friends went camping in Williamsburg because we had heard that there were strange lights out there the last couple of nights.  We didn’t actually expect we would see any- we set off with binoculars in hopes of at least seeing some meteors from the peaking meteor shower.  We did see some meteors and one glowing orb that we could not explain. Witnesses were comprised of a librarian (myself), my 11-year-old son, a civil engineer, an in-home care provider, and a college history professor.  My 12-year-old daughter was also present, but in the car on her phone and not witness to the object.  The engineer has a coworker who lives and deer hunts this area and he is the one who shared the strange experience with us so that we could investigate on our own.  None of us had ever seen an unexplained object before Saturday night. The object was an orange-red orb that was slowly traveling through the night sky.  At least, it was slower than a plane we saw pass by in the vicinity.  Overall, it traveled from left to right over top of the house (XXXX Bass Rd. Williamsburg, OH 45176) across the road from the field we were parked in.  While travelling left to right it also bopped up and down sometimes, almost as if it was following the coils of a giant invisible slinky.  A few times the light blinked out a few seconds and then came back on.  There was some cloud cover that night but it was to our backs, not in the area we were viewing. I have sent a screenshot of the google map where we were to the email indicated on the online form.  I would be interested to hear back if anything else was seen in our area, or nearby areas, that night.   I hope this is helpful.",2017-11-03T00:00:00,,

But then another flash occurred a short distance away, bright with the intensity of plasma or phosphorous.  This time as its flash died down I could see the faint glow or an object moving as if being blown, or floating in the wind.  It can only be described as an orb maybe no bigger than a car or a basketball and moving about at a passenger planes cruising altitude.  From my vantage point it appeared directly above Redlands or Yucaipa and ""pulsed"" a brilliant white at random intervals, staying on for 1-4 seconds then going faint for 5-20 seconds, appearing much like a wandering satellite.  However, this was no satellite or plane as they fly over constantly and are easy to spot because of either indicator light! s (planes) or a uni-directional flight path (satellite).  The objects meandered, pulsing, performing figure-8's while moving from the west to the northeast of the sky, fading out of view over Joshua Tree.

I was looking straight ahead thru the clean windshield, about a mile out, tracking tail lights far ahead.  I was staring right at it when it appeared; a strong lime green glowing light.  It was triangular, like a flattened isosceles triangle, at about a 30 degree pitch.   It had gradations of color so that the innermost edges were whiter.  The outermost edges were a more intense lime green and emitted a long starburst glare effect at the 3 corners and shorter spikes at the side of the triangle.  The object or light held a perfectly fixed position, then suddenly swooped down and left at about a 30 degree path in a perfectly straight line.  Then it stopped and vanished well before reaching the horizon.   The whole event took less than 2 seconds but I was in the perfect position to witness it.

We live in Farmington on a few acres with very large old oak trees.  It was about 8pm and we were letting our dog out when we spotted the aircraft.  The thing that first caught our attention was that the craft at first seemed to be hovering.  As we watched, the aircraft began moving very slowly from north to south across our field of view.  The craft had multiple lights.  I first believed the aircraft to be a plane but could hear no sound and had too many lights for a normal plane.  As the aircraft moved across in front of us, I began to suspect it might be closer to us than first expected and at that point I thought it might be some sort of drone.  I had a bright flashlight which I pointed at the object for a few seconds then decided that might not be a good idea in case it was a helicopter.  Right after turning the light off the object began turning towards us.  As it approached,  I thought for sure it must be a helicopter based on the slow speed and low altitude, flying just above the old oak trees.  As the object got very close to us you could hear a deep low humming sound but none of the normal ""helicopter"" sound.  The object appeared triangular. The object approached until it was directly over us.  The sound was still very quiet for an aircraft.  I doubt that it could be heard more than a hundred feet away.  It was moving at about the speed of a helicopter that seemed to be approaching for a landing but when directly over us turned to th! e north and flew off very slowly.  The object seemed to be flying at about 75 feet high.  The appearance was similar to a stealth bomber and the size seemed to be about the size of an Apache helicopter.  As we watched it fly away slowly the sound quickly faded, not able to hear it at all after it was maybe a block away. I'm not sure what this was but it was nothing like anything I have seen before.

2 glowing football field sized cigar shaped craft seen during sunset moving away from each other.,Hampshire,IL,2018-01-05T16:50:00,light,3 minutes,"Occurred : 1/5/2018 16:50  (Entered as : 01/05/18 16:50) Reported: 1/5/2018 3:56:08 PM 15:56 Posted: 1/12/2018 Location: Hampshire, IL Shape: Light Duration:3 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/138/S138278.html,"2 glowing football field sized cigar shaped craft seen during sunset moving away from each other. I was facing south driving and Witnessed two elongated cigar shape craft that were self-illuminating near the middle of the sunset which was to my right (west).  One was hovering to the west going northwest direction lower to the ground moving horizontally slowly. The other was simultaneously moving in opposite direction faster.  Was identical size and also self-illuminating. No blinking lights on either looked like giant glow sticks but did not have a bright aura.  No wings, gear or trails. Just long glowing cigar like craft rounded off on each end.  The 2nd one was going south-east bound moving from the first one. It was moving faster and on an angle going upward away about 40 degrees.  The first one remained on a horizontal pattern moving north-west. I tried to find a place to pull over from the highway but various trees kept blocking and no room on side of the highway. I knew of a parking area at the next intersection so chose to drive there to pull over o! n rte 20 and IL-47.  I watched the 2nd one moving at the 40-degree angle start to speed off and then all of a sudden it moved so fast it was gone.  I could still see the first one moving northwest but it also started speeding up but slowly.  I turned onto the next street (rte 20) and then pulled over into a parking lot after the gas station.  As I got out of the car to take a photo now facing westbound towards the sunset and Rockford, IL there was nothing left in the sky except the sunset.  I scanned sky from north to west to south and back again. Nothing.  No streaks, no lights, no planes.  The distance and size of these things in the sunset is hard to estimate but one thing is for sure is they were huge.  Football field length or larger. The glowing self-illumination is what shocked me.  They were like a bright yellow-white light with pure white in center, no blinking, no radiance outward just self-contained.",2018-01-12T00:00:00,42.0681,-88.5095

It was already dark and as I pulled into my garage I saw a light out of the corner of my eye in my back yard.  It caught my attention right away because I don’t have any lights in my back yard as I live in a wooded area with only a few lights from an adjacent street that are visible. The light seem to appear to be silently floating around near the creek about 30 feet or so up in the air and as I got closer I saw there were two lights that appeared orange in color and seemed to be very small.  I started recording with my phone and as I got closer one became bright very much like a small, but intense LED as if it turned to face my direction.  I couldn’t tell if it had a light in front and perhaps rotated or if it just changed and became bright. Both ended up doing this off and on and continued to float through and around the trees from East to West. As I went back toward my house to get my wife to witness I saw a couple more in the neighbor’s field on the other side of our property as well. They were completely silent and ranging from about 20 – 40 feet off the ground, all moving from East to West.  Although I heard no noise, I later found watching the video that the microphone did pick up a strange clicking type of noise when it was at its closest. I was a bit freaked out and went inside and asked my wife to come out and verify I was seeing what I was seeing.  My behavior was scaring her a bit but when I pointed them out, she saw them and was also surprises and a little scared.  I went back outside and to the neighbor’s house to show him as well. Over about an hour a saw perhaps a dozen of these lights. I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. Afterward I went back home and became very tired, falling asleep on the couch.  Although I didn’t experience an loss of time nor did I touch or make any physical contact, my wife and kids told me the next day I was moving and twisting around on the couch hitting my head with my hands and that my head was sweating profusely.  They said they tried to wake me but couldn’t.  I felt like I slept very soundly and don’t recall any of that.",2018-01-12T00:00:00,47.7543,-122.1635
