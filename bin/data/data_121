Flashes of light with orbs.,Manchester,NH,2018-01-22T18:20:00,flash,4 seconds,"Occurred : 1/22/2018 18:20  (Entered as : 1/22/2018 18:20) Reported: 1/23/2018 10:45:00 AM 10:45 Posted: 1/25/2018 Location: Manchester, NH Shape: Flash Duration:4 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/138/S138556.html,"Flashes of light with orbs. This all started a long time ago in 1985 when my Grandfather told me to film Mars when it was closest which was like very early fall of 2003.  He told me to watch for an object he had seen that traveled up instead of down.  This being an asteroid of sorts or perhaps a bolide.   I did as I was told and set up my tripod and said a prayer that it would bring honor to my grandfather.  Early on in the shot I got tired of filming just Mars and decided to film the moon instead.  Not long after a brightly lit object that was potato shaped flew from left to the upper right at an upward angle lighting up in the moons halo as it went.  Keep that at the back of your mind. Then in 2008 I got a report that the Bali volcano was about to erupt so I was watching the live camera.  I saw something that looked like orbs but paid no notice of it.  Then a news agency told me that an earthquake struck the region.  I know from past experience that orbs appear after earthquakes, so I went to see the live camera again and much to my amazement the entire shot was nothing but wild crazy orbs flying in all directions. The critics didn’t like the film and said for me to film one in doors at my home so I went and did just that.  On the first day of filming I shot three orbs traveling fast in my home appartment in Manchester.  I missed the first orb in the kitchen because it was fast and the lighting was too bright which led me to believe that the object wasn’t worth my time but I remember it just the same. Then some time went by and nothing much appeared on the night vision camera.  I’d been working hard in my office and it was getting late.  I was about to go to my girlfriends house and I typically have that room in the dark.  I noticed my phone light up but it wasn’t coming from the screen or the back of the phone.  It was more like my pocket lit up. I thought nothing of it and went to open the door to go outside.  Just as I turned the key the entire lock assembly lit up in a bright pleasant white light that was radiant like neon white.  It flashed twice and I left the apartment feeling somewhat befuddled.  I told myelf its all good and thought nothing of it. I then returned to my apartment very early that morning around quarter of six and my apartment was still fairly dark.  As I went to shut the lock the same thing happened but my phone didn’t light up this time.  Just the lock did and this time it was one blink and was located much closed to the inside wood.  It was not my normal standard lighting and I decided to call someone to report it. Now...  My mother was nearly killed by a serial killer back in the day when she was young and a bright light saved her life.  I guess the killer lost his nerve when the flat desert like sand of western Kansas (there abouts) lit up bright as day all around his pickup truck.  So I knew from stories I’d heard that this was not the “first” time it had happened to my family. Lastly on August 10th, 2005, I was working in a basement in Plaistow, NH, at a friend's house when the two of use decided to sit down.  All of a sudden a bright ball of energy flew out of the fruit cellar in front of us and traveled right past my left side.  It then bounced off the hot water heater, turned slightly then went across at a fast wobble at about eye level when it then traveled out a window.  I said to her “you saw that, right?”  she said yes. I am including a link to the only evidence I have and that is of the 3 orbs I filmed.  The film is a composite so that the video is shorter.  The times on the video are wrong the rest is accurate.  Here is the youtube link.  The orbs were spotted on December 27th, 2017, at around 7pm. https://youtu.be/NlKTSc2mK94   Lastly the snow looked strange on the day of the 23rd of Jan. 2018, so I photographed that.",2018-01-25T00:00:00,42.972094248608535,-71.45090269016697

The sky was perfectly blue but I noticed it had rivers of chemtrails.  They were not clouds.  I counted at least 2 ""planes"" initially spraying the chemtrails.  See photos for how robust the trails were.  The ""planes"" were spraying and then the trail was dissipating and flowing like a river in the sky. After picking up my kids, I parked the car in the parking lot to get a better look at the planes.  This was about 3:12 p.m. The ""plane"" closest to us looked to be right overhead, and looked white or metallic and very bright.  It was spraying a chemtrail and then it ran out of spray and continued flying in a straight line heading back into the blue sky over the school.  I thought it looked more like a TUBE than a plane.  It also was low enough that I would have expected to hear an engine noise, but it was silent. I looked away for just a few moments to get my camera phone from the car.  My 14-year-old daughter, in the meantime, had her phone camera and was snapping shots.  When I looked back up at the sky, the ""plane"" had completely disappeared and was nowhere to be seen in the expanse of the blue sky.  It just vanished. With 3 kids in the car, I started to drive home, and on our way, saw several other ""planes"" in the sky--I counted about 6 of them in the distance, in close proximity to each other, all spraying straight chemtrails.  I pulled over to the side of the road to observe them and pointed them out to the kids.  I asked my daughter to get shots of the many planes, but she was unable to capture the shot with all of the planes, but she did get the chemtrails in criss-cross patterns. With the kids in the car, and very astonished, I decided to drive around the corner block and return to the point where I could view the planes again.  It took us no more than 2 minutes to drive around the block to the same spot.  By then, every single plane had completely vanished, just like the other one.  This was simply not possible. We caught the photos and now see that the vehicle closest to us did not look like a plane, but a SHINY, METALLIC, TUBE WITH OVAL SEGMENTS IN AN ANT-LIKE SHAPE and there seems to be some kind of black tubing wrapped around the side.",2018-01-25T00:00:00,35.20580084001527,-80.82639156166476

Thinking it was possibly the ISS coming over, I told my neighbor to look also, but about 4 seconds later, we saw a much smaller flash about 2.0mag followed 6 seconds later by another brighter flash as the object moved very slowly from WNW toward the E. I went inside and grabbed binoculars while my neighbor tried to capture it on his Android phone. When I looked at it through the binoculars I realized it was actually two objects!  One following the other and both flashing at irregular intervals.

The dimmer object continued E also flashing at odd intervals until it moved past 90deg above us and began quickly fading as if it was going into the earths shadow.

A check of the satellite databases showed no objects matching the magnitude, altitude or azimuth observed for the time frame.

From left to right the sky was full of them, I would say about 15 to 20 orbs, but each was staggered behind each other, all at the same altitude, approx 1,000 to 2,000 ft above my location, and approx 75 to 100 feet apart from each other.   As soon as I saw them, I went back into the house and yelled for my wife to come out here, she came immediately and saw what I was seeing.  As they flew by the last ones about 4 or 5 of them started to go dim and then they went totally dark, it was mind blowing, they had no sound and were very bright orange they had no red, green or white nautical (sic.  navigation?) lights on them.   About 5 or 6 minutes later, I called 911 and reported what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere, and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a highly reliable witness.  PD))",2018-03-08T00:00:00,35.20580084001527,-80.82639156166476

It was a small, circular in nature, shining very brightly, and did not move.  It was a reasonably clear evening and we kept an eye on it for at least 30 minutes.  The entire time it did not move.

Due to the fact that this location, Board Camp Crystal Mine, near Mena, Arkansas, has been the site of ongoing phenomenon and investigation since the February 18, 2017, MUFON investigation, this event was not publicly reported online until now.   The reporting parties are the property owners and/or witnesses of the numerous ongoing events at this active location and are reporting for the benefit of public education and scientific research.  In recognition of the one year anniversary of this event, which was featured in the October 2017 issue of The MUFON Journal, as well as featured on “Expedition Unknown: Hunt for Extraterrestrials” Episode 4 on Travel Channel, the witnesses (and property owners of the location) are officially publicly reporting this sighting as follows:   On the night of February 18, 2017, at the property known as Board Camp Crystal Mine, near Mena, Arkansas, the 3 eye-witnesses (2 of them being the property owners) were standing on a hill gazing out over the crystal mine property.  About 10 pm, about 900 feet south of where the witnesses were standing, the witnesses saw a glow of white light appear at the treetops of the horizon silhouetting the treetops from behind.  Three large white vertical beams of light appeared out of the glow, seeming to be 30 feet wide and seeming to shoot up to about 300 feet high above the ground.  The beams were described as being flat across the top, and appeared for a duration of about 10 seconds, then disappeared, and the glow receded back into darkness.  There appeared to be no lights at ground level and no sound of a vehicle or animals.  The witnesses were astonished by the sighting, thinking it was man-made, but not understanding how it could be, as it would be difficult for a vehicle hauling 3 large spotlights to enter the fenced rural 40-acre property without being noticed.  Although a small airport is located about 8 miles west of the location, directly south of the Event Site, there is nothing but undeveloped land, no roads, etc.  The next morning, thinking they might find evidence of a human visit such as footprints or tire tracks, the 3 witnesses visited the crystal mine pit where the sighting occurred.  To the witnesses’ surprise, there was no evidence of a human visitation, but all metal objects such as fence posts and tools were noticed to be affected, characterized by movement of the objects from their previous positions.   MUFON was contacted by a third party and the witnesses were phoned by Arkansas state investigator Race Hobbs. Because of the credibility of the witnesses and the strong physical evidence left behind after the Light Event occurred, MUFON sent the SAT to investigate, led by Chase Kloetzke.  Race Hobbs accompanied the SAT. During the SAT’s examination of the metal objects with various devices recording readings for radiation and! electromagnetism (EM), it was confirmed that the metal objects at the Event Site were not only magnetized, but also polarized, and EM and radiation levels were increased.  Soil and rock samples were obtained and all information was forwarded to various labs for professional analysis.  MUFON has since issued a full investigative report.  Other affected items (narrative): All metal objects at the Event Site: fence posts, a large metal sign, plastic bucket with metal handle, hand mining tools, were affected, either moved from their prior locations or positions, were magnetized, and also polarized when readings were taken by MUFON investigators, and continue to be to this day, one year later.  Other metal objects, introduced to the site, since the event, when left touching the ground, became magnetized and polarized also.

So it starts when I go home from school.  I walk to my car.  Feel a bit off.  Saw a normal-looking helicopter flying off to the North-East.  On my drive, this is what I saw. It was some type of aircraft. It was white, and was hovering around. No trail, no noise. Just kind of slightly descending for a bit.  Then in another direction.  The movements definitely seemed deliberate, and from the photos I've seen they look nothing like a weather balloon. Normally, I'd probably brush that off.  But here's the issue.  I cannot describe the shape in one word.  It had at least 3-4 ""wings"" which were different sized spikes, long, and jagged.  It looked incredibly bizarre.  Nothing like anything I've seen before in my life, especially in the damn sky. I saw it about 4 times within 5 minutes.  Each time, it was going in a totally different direction.  The last time I saw it, it was very translucent, and it was glowing a pinkish-reddish hue.  It really wasn't that high up in the sky; it was high, but low enough that I was able to be pretty damn sure of what I was looking at. After that, I had about 10 more minutes of driving.  I saw that same helicopter that I saw earlier going NE, except this time it was going South to South West.  Then a minute later I noticed a big black helicopter.  It looked like one some type of police force or military would use.  It went very fast, I lost sight of it within 10-15 seconds. The final part was when I got home, I parked outside. Looked up in the sky again hoping I'd see the original object I saw.  There were about 3-4 very tiny planes.  Just white with wings, kind of like a drone considering how small they were.  I don't know what to make of that. I did take videos, but my damn camera made it very blurry; cell-phone cameras really are not able to produce clear images of objects 100-500 feet away.

Many years have gone by without me mentioning it at all however, now in my adulthood, and starting about a year or so ago,  I have come more open to discuss what I and others witnessed and the feelings it left me with. I was 12 years old.  My mother and I had gone to Woodbridge mall.  After time spent at the mall we left and started driving back on route #1 South, towards the older Menlo mall. After passing the light on Ford Avenue I seen what I thought was a blinking star very high up in the sky just as you would normally see a twinkling star.  As we continued driving, I kept watching the star and to my surprise, it seemed like it kept becoming more visible. I told my mom that it was following us and she told me don't be silly.  It's just a star.  As we approached the next light, it was clear that this was not a star, but something else.  At that point it also gained my mom's attention.  We decided to wait until our turn off exit on N. Lafayette Rd., whereas there was and still is a 7 Eleven store.   We, along with other people, stopped in that lot, while others, including police officers, pulled off along side of route#1.  The exact location where 'White Castle' stands today.  It was apparent this was a craft and now extremely clear to see.  It kept descending until it reached maybe 200 ft above and just hovered there.  I remember everyone getting out of their cars and looking up at this massive round craft.  The strange thing for me was that after a few minutes, no one said anything and we just stood and stared at it.  It rotated ever so slowly with a very slight mechanical hum.  It had a row of 'White lights' and a row of blinking lights which I shall say were similar to that of the kind of lights you would use for Christmas. What we all seen next was amazing.  As it turned almost completely around, you could see what appeared to be an observation widow with beings just watching and pointing at the crowd.  Becouse of the distance, you could not really see facial structure but could see that these beings were human like with blondish color hair and a blueish light as a backdrop from inside.  Still no one said anything. Even I remained Quit. It's hard to say how long this occurred but in my mind it seemed like forever. In reality I guess 15 maybe 20 minutes.  Then this craft began to raise up higher and as if suddenly, everyone got back in their cars and just drove away. It left me with a very satisfying feeling which I'll say was spiritual like. What I don't understand is there was NEVER any mention of this anywhere as my mom looked through many local papers at the time and found nothing.  Now many years later there is still no mention except for someone who filed a report in this same agency and documented it 7/20/1974.  However, what I seen very clearly did NOT spin on its side, turn upside down or etc.  I hope and wish someone else will come forward as there are definitely others who witnessed this but will not speak about it.  WHY?  Please come out and file a report.  It is a happening which should be known.....I feel, possibility these beings had communicated with us (all of us who seen it that night) telepathically because there was an absence of lost time as the entire event felt much longer then my listed 15/20 min. I need to say this, there was never any frightening feeling.  The feelings which it radiated were very enlightening as I've stated above.  Although, I've felt these feelings then during my youth, they have indeed become more evident within these past few years and I don't really know why.  Again, I hope others will speak up about this event.  It happened, I was there and happy to have been a part of something simply amazing and Spiritual… ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.

After this event I no longer had epilepsy.  In the summer of 1975 my family and I had seen UFO'S in Crabbapple, Georgia on our way home from Marietta one evening.  This intrigued us to watch the premier of the movie about the alien abduction of Barney and Betty Hill.   As we were watching the movie, my older brother asked me if I thought UFO's were real and I reminded him about what we saw in Crabapple that one evening, but he asked about the ones in the movie,  I answered if they are real may God send them here tonight and cure me of my epilepsy, which of course upset my mother.  We continued to watch the movie until it went off and the 11 o'clock news came on.   As we were watching the news a bright light suddenly appeared over the back of the house over the end of the patio.  My mother told my sister to turn off the back patio light, but I sat there in wonder because the light wasn't coming from outside the kitchen door and it was to big and bright to be the light on the back of the house.  The moment she told my mother the patio light was off my older brother and I ran to the front door and out of the house.  We immediately looked above the big oak tree and we could see a disc like object above the tree with light beaming behind the tree and house.  There was the sound of the leaves moving like wind blowing on them in the top of the tree but we couldn't feel any breeze at all.  My mother came out after us and she too was trying to make out what this object was above the tree then I looked in the sky over the front pasture and a gray metallic disk about 12-14 ft diameter just like on the movie was hovering in the sky about 15 ft past the fence.  We all looked at it and could even see the alien pilot through a window in the craft.   It hovered there for about 2-3 minutes after we saw it then it speedily sped across the road Hwy 76 and a mountain range.  I looked back at the tree top and that craft was still there with the light on.  I could not see the mother ship; it was attached to until later on after the 3 discs had attached to it and it began to move but I'll get to that later.  After a minute or two after the disc flew South over the road it appeared to fly back from over the ridge two houses East of where I thought it went.  It came back and hovered in the same spot as before and hovered there for about a minute or two then another one came racing from the East on our side of the road and the disc which was hovering in the initial spot shot to the East chasing the other disc and they flew Southwest and out of sight.  A few moments later the another disc came flying back from over the road and ridge and hovered in the same spot as before.  It sat there for over a minute then it eased toward the craft over the tree and attacked itself to a craft I couldn't see.   About a minute later the two discs chasing each other raced back from the East and one of them returned to hover in the initial spot while the other one sho! t back over the road.  It eased over my head and attached to the opposite side of the invisible craft making a triangular pattern with the other two discs.   About a minute after that the last disc came back from across the road and eased above the left above me and attached to the invisible mother ship in line with the discs on the left forming a backwards check. I wondered if another disc was going to come and complete a triangle, but it didn't.  Instead the last disc moved slowly to the East forming a diamond of all 4 discs.   Afterward the ship started easing to the right and there was a reflection of stars rolling across the bottom of it which made me realize that I had been standing directly under the mother ship the whole time.  As it lifted up and to the East, I watched in total amazement because this part wasn't included in the movie.  It rose to about 25-30 ft, and before it shot off, I remember the pyramid or triangular shape in the back but underneath the 4 discs were in a diamond formation.  But before it even moved to take off it turned off the light over the back of the house and I could clearly see the disc on the front bottom of the ship and it too put out a golden light like the other 3 discs.   That weekend my father came home from Marietta.  He watched the same movie and his mother's house.  How we found out was at the dinner table while having supper.  He asked us who moved all of the cattle from the front pasture to the back pasture.  Nobody including our ranch hand had moved the cattle.  So my dad asked us how the cattle got moved Mom and I explained what she, my older brother and I saw until the point her and my older brother came back in the house.  I had to explain what I saw afterwards.  He asked my mother why she didnt make me come back in she said I refused because I thought they were going to heal me from epilepsy.  The next day I went with my dad and ranch hand to look at 3 dead head of cattle.  We lost 2 heifers and a bull to mutilation.  I was sworn to secrecy by my father not to even tell my mother and! siblings about them other than I had to say I saw claw marks like bear marks to support my dad saying the cattle was killed by a bear, but in reality there were not claw marks and the cut marks on the face of one of the heifers was precision.  Our neighbors the ((name deleted)) had some of their cattle mutilated and I broke my silence to a member of their family in my class and my family going to their house for dinner one day our fathers agreed to tell everyone who asked that their cattle were killed by bears.  We were sworn to secrecy because my father did not want us being held on a military base and me and other members being government guinea pigs.  In 2005, I saw a show about UFO's and saw footage of one being chased by a US fighter pilot.  It had 4 discs underneath and reflected the clouds like it has a cloaking device in Star Trek.  The pilot claims he tried to fire on the object but his weapons wouldn't work. You can pass word to him that he isn't alone seeing that craft.  Those! circles underneath it are saucers that detach separately but  are smaller discs than others I've seen, even though they look similar.",2018-03-02T00:00:00,34.882,-84.1935

I was looking North at a break in the clouds.  I could see green farmland below through the clouds, the clouds were thicker on the East & West sides as the break in the clouds gave me the ability to see the ground below.  The plane was approximately 25,000 feet up.  I would not have noticed anything if the object didn't move at this very moment, it was stationary right next to the West cloud, then it moved forward some, then to the right then forward again to then hide in the East side cloud edge.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  The object was oval but it had depth and the top surface was pure white.  This oval was the shape of a track & field track, so parallel in the middle with rounded ends.  But the top surface was perfectly flat, and pure white. I would not have seen it, if it didn't move.  The sides were a grey/white color,  I could see very thin vertical black striations.  The object was rigid, the top white surface came to a very obvious edge, then 90 degrees straight down.  The vertical drop was what appeared to be about half what the short length width was.  The object had no obvious propulsion mechanism, no observable heat waves, no radiations, no light emmissions that I could see.  It did not tilt to move forward, did not tilt to the side, then did not change its orientation to move forward again.  It just moved, I believe  I would have missed it if it didn't move at all.

While visiting my former home town of Trail, BC, I had the strangest experience on the evening of Tuesday, January 23, 2018.  We were in a house in the Gulch, along Rossland Avenue, near St. Anthony's Church.  Two of us were seated on a couch watching television.  Starting around 9:30 p.m., my viewing was occasionally interrupted by intermittent flashes of bright blue-white light shining into the bathroom window, which faces northwest.  The television is next to the hallway leading to the bathroom.  The light would flash in the window for a second or two, then stop.  A minute or two later, it would do it again.  It kept doing this at irregular intervals. At first, I thought it was a neighbour playing a prank with a bright spotlight, and I found it quite irritating as it repeated several times, sort of a sweeping motion or flashing.  But then it occurred to me that the light was shining downward toward the window, and I thought that it could be someone playing with a light on the hillside below Highway 22, or possibly lights high on a vehicle (like on top of a truck or snowplow) on the highway, except there are a lot trees that would be in the way and it would be an incredible inconvenience for someone to be hiking up there in a snowstorm.  In addition, the lights were too bright to have come from vehicles as far away as the road.  As the flashing persisted, I then realized that the light was coming from much higher than that, as if from the sky.  That piqued my curiosity, so I went to the back door of the house to see if there was some issue with the power lines. It had been snowing heavily all day and evening, so I wondered if the storm was shorting out wires or flashing over insulators and causing arcs.  I stood and looked at the lines for about half a minute, but seeing no further flashing, went back inside.  By then, it was a little after 10 p.m. Shortly after returning to my place in front of the television, more lights flashed through the window, brighter than previously.  So, I went into the bathroom to look through the window to see if I could find the source.  Still, I couldn't see where they were coming from. My wife, who had seen me check outside and then check the bathroom, asked what I was doing, and I described the flashing lights I had seen.  She then explained that she could see lights flashing on the bed throughout that time.  The lights seemed to be coming in the bedroom window, which faces southwest.  The ceiling light had been turned on with the dimmer switch turned down low, so she had assumed that the dimmer circuit was somehow causing the light to flicker brightly and creating an optical illusion.  From my vantage point, I couldn't see into the bedroom.  From her vantage point, my wife couldn't see into the bathroom.  Neither of us thought to mention the peculiar lights to the other. Around 11 p.m. our area of the city began experiencing power outages lasting up to about 10 minutes each.  I'm pretty sure they were caused by the heavy, wet snow that was accumulating, and not in any way connected to the flashing lights.  However, each time the power went out, I looked out the windows to see how much of the neighbourhood or the city was affected. But at no time did I see any more blue-white flashes.  They had ended by about 10:30 or a little earlier. The next morning, while I was shovelling the previous night's snow from our walks, a neighbour asked if we heard the ""weird noises in the sky last night.""  I asked her what the noises were like and she described a type of whirring or trilling sound that was unlike any she had heard before.  She said that this was around 9:30 when she went to have a smoke on her porch.  She didn't see any lights, but she said that the sound was overhead and frightened her enough that she cut short her break and went inside for the rest of the night. When I was outside and when I looked out the windows the previous evening, I could see that the overcast sky was low on the hillsides, below 500 meters (we were at about 425 meters elevation).  If there was something up there shining lights, it would have to have been pretty low to penetrate the heavy cloud cover and snow.  I wonder if anyone else in the area saw or heard anything. (Please note: I filed a similar report with ufobc.ca after returning home from our trip. This is a copy of that report, edited slightly for clarity.  The ufocentre.com website was not working at that time.)",2018-03-02T00:00:00,49.0998,-117.7022

The other boy only saw one craft around the plane because of the trees blocking his view as the plane and craft vanished over the mountain.   School was in process and the one boy that witnessed the split into two after leaving the bathroom to return to class in his first few steps looked up to see a round craft heading very slow southbound with 4 holes underneath 3 w one red hole in the center he claims looked like a red laser (maybe power source) though couldn't describe the beam he said came out that didn't hit the ground like a laser beam but more of a laser light.  Red anyway and was very low above the huge redwood trees and was directly over his head no sound either like it may have been 30 ft dia then it shot straight up and disappeared.  He said it vanished before it went high enough to disappear.  The first oval object had no holes underneath had to be traveling 60 mph plus and he felt when flew over was 20 ft in length and 12 ft -15 ft wide.  To me this was an amazing account claims of sighting.   I have throughly questioned these boys to see if the stories changed or if any inconsistencies on two separate days. They have not told anyone or kids at thier school as afraid of ridicule.  I asked-the one boy that had the first craft fly over him low what did he think and he replied he thought it was a huge drone.  Then he thought it was some craft from Lockheed which they have a facility within 3 miles  up the mountain in Bonnie Doon in the near west direction.  Then he felt they where trying to attack the plane.  And ! the round craft he said it was mostly blocked by the tall tree! branche s.  He didn't get scared e was just trying to make out what he was seeing.  No others witnessed that round craft that shot up.  I went to the school with these boys and they explained their sighting and all made sense.in perspective accounts of the observation points.",2018-03-02T00:00:00,37.1615,-122.1514

While driving North on Alaska Highway 1 at 8:49PM, I seen what I thought was a radio tower that had red lights, abouts 2 miles in front of me.  I thought to myself when did someone build a huge tower out here by the Y junction?  I was confused with what I was looking at while trying to drive on the icy road. As I approached closer I then observed that there was no tower and just 9 red lights that were aligned in a row vertically.  My first impression was someone is setting Chinese flying lanterns.  I then began to observe the lights were moving about & 8 turned color to a amber orange color. I noticed another vehicle coming my direction in opposite lane. I slowed to about 25mph and pulled towards the shoulder of the highway. When the vehicle passed I then thought about getting my cell phone and stopping to take pictures or video.  I changed my mind because I had my 2 children asleep in their car seats. So I kept driving slowly, and and kept looking at the lights which are now within 400 yards of my van. I remember looking at my dash display and it read -1 degrees outside. Visibility was unlimited and it was cold and clear out.  I could see the stars out & these lights were definitely not stars.  These lights were not drones. I've seen drones and it was below zero.  Who would be flying 9 drones in frigid weather anyway I thought. As I passed the lights, I noticed a red light just above the trees that began to travel upwards moving in a intelligent manner among the other amber orange lights.  I kept driving until I got to a pullout at the Y junction. I got out of my van and looked at the direction I came from.  Now I can only see 1 red light that is going vertically up into the night sky.  I lost track of it and then got back inside my vehicle. I then called my family in Seward and described to them what I just seen.  My sister was going to check Facebook to see if any one else put it online. I counted 5 other vehicles coming and going during this period.  Another black pickup was parked above me and what appeared to be viewing this also. I continued North towards Anchorage and I haven't heard of any one else making a report of the lights that night.

Hoping to get a better look at the thing, I pushed through the pine boughs.  Standing approximately 1,000 feet from the shoreline, I watched as this airship cruised about thirty degrees above the horizon.  It was cigar shaped, and it must have been 100 yards in length—about the length of a football field, and I would estimate it was several hundred feet in diameter. At first sight, this thing was lit up like a Christmas tree.  Red, green, blue, yellow, purple, all these colorful lights were shining in every which direction.  Some of the lights appeared to search the far side of the shore, while other lights were pointed skyward and remained motionless. As it continued to move slowly westward, above the north shore of Harlan County Lake, I distinctly heard some sort of mechanical sound.  The sound had an industrial quality, although I couldn’t see an engine or propellers or, for that matter, any moving parts.  But, after several minutes, a dull gray super-structure became visible.  Dotted with numerous cupulas or transparent domes, several of these looked as if they were illuminated. By my watch it was 7:31 PM, and I must have watched for twenty-five minutes before it disappeared into overcast skies.  The temperature was about 30 degrees and there was a light breeze from the north. Lately, I’ve made it a point to take this route back to town, but I haven’t seen the airship again.

Something uncommon caused me to have a glance back.  Approximately 1.5 miles to the west, above Los Olives, was what appeared to be a blimp.  These do fly the coast rarely.  The shape, however, was closer to resembling a large jet without tail or wings.  I immediately pulled over to get a better look.  Upon closer inspection it became clear that this was neither blimp nor jet. Distance from me estimated at 1.5 mi. The shape was long and cylindrical, cigar style. The velocity was approximately 10 mph horizontal and northbound towards the mountains. The elevation estimated to be 500 ft. The color was indefinable neither light nor dark. Overall length estimated to be at least 1000 ft. It was much longer than its elevation. There was no noise associated.

It was 23:15 hours and our back yard faces southeast. I noticed an unusually bright star in the sky and showed my husband. He noticed that it didn’t blink like the other stars do.  It was very windy and clear that night. Later on (back in the house), I grabbed binoculars and looked at it again before I went to bed. That was around 00:30 hrs. The star was in the same position as earlier and through the binoculars it looked like 2 stars very close together. I told my husband I believe the star seems so bright because it is just two stars very close together. We left it at that and went to bed. The next night ( February 16) we came home from the late movies and went in the back yard to smoke. It was 01:10 in the morning and we immediately spotted the bright star in the exact same place as the night before. This time I took a picture with my I phone 6 and then decided to zoom in on it ( in video mode) to see if I could get a better look at it that way. When I zoomed in and started filming I saw that it was two lights very close together. They were both round and reminded me of headlights of a car but like I said before, very close together. In fact they were so close to each other I could not see where one ended and the other one started. It looked in shape like a sideways number 8 shape, made of two bright lights that touch each other. What I saw made me quiet unsure because neither me nor my husband had an immediate explanation for that “thing”. What we do know for sure is that it was about at least 5 miles away from us and a couple thousand feet high in the air. We live in a new built area with not much around us yet so we’re sure that it was no lights from anything on the ground. Also, my husband who is active Air Force is very good at estimating distances. (This is because he was a weapon instructor for 8 years and is used to estimating distances due to that job.) We are not the kind of people to jump to conclusions but the sighting left us both with the wish for a rational explanation. Also not being able to explain the sighting left me so antsy that night that I could not go to sleep until after 02:30 in the morning. I checked one last time around 02:30 hrs to see if that “star” was still there and it was, again in the very same position as before ( and the night before). On both nights that we saw it, it seemed stationary in the sky. Neither one of us ever saw it move. Lastly I wanna say that we both had not been drinking any alcohol. We were absolutely sober on both nights. We are very rational people and that’s why we’d welcome a logical explanation for what we saw. Please let us know what you make of this.

The drive also catched many other unidentified flying objects.  The video mist be watched to be believed. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I reported a cloaked ufo by our water tower in Mattoon , Ill. The event happened on 2/13/2018. I believe . I have attached a screenshot of my report in your site.      This sighting has been debunked by myself.  It was filmed with a negative filter and recently I learned to reverse the filter and the cloaked ufo is in fact something on the windshield.  Hopefully you can take this down or mark it as identified.  I had some crazy captures on video of various things . And I've spent hours upon hour frame by frame on them. Most often finding more going on . But , the water tower (thankfully) has been debunked. I racked my brain dealing with that video and all the questions and reality checks that come with a capture of any kind.  Last thing I want is to hurt myself credibility and the ufo community as a fake video when it is actually just a mistake. The Alton Il news paper , in 2018,named Illinois  as the Hotspot for that year. And it reprinted report from your/our website. Im not from that town.  Never even been there.

While driving northbound on Ohio 7, my roommate and I spotted two diamond shaped craft stationary above the highway.  The two of us were returning to Ohio State University at Proctorville, when two amber colored diamond shaped objects caught our attention. After stopping on the highway shoulder, it appeared that both of the objects remained motionless in the vicinity of Ohio 7 and Irene Road, which was our exit.  The two objects appeared to be the same size, approximately 25 feet in height and equally as much in diameter.  Both of us counted three sides on top of the objects and three sides on the bottom of the objects.  The objects appeared to present the same face to us.  So, I’m assuming that there were the same number of sides on the reverse, or the backside of the objects. The objects could not have been more than 500 feet above the highway exit, and, considering that it was approximately a half hour after sunset, both objects illuminated the ground beneath them.  The color was amber to gold, and there were times when the intensity became momentarily brighter.  Both of the objects swayed slightly from side-to-side, accompanied by a slight increase in altitude, before they returned to their original position in the sky. As I later recalled, neither of the two objects had made any sound.  But, as we had made our way north toward the highway exit, the radio broadcast in the car had begun to crackle. In fact, the broadcast had momentarily quit before it came back to life. After twenty minutes, both of the diamond shaped objects became noticeably smaller.  Without taking my eyes from them, they became smaller again.  That’s when it became apparent to me that both of these objects were backing away from us—stepping back towards the horizon, where they disappeared from view. As the objects receded on the horizon, I remember being startled by the blast of a police car siren.  It appeared to be a state trooper, who accelerated at great speed over the hill, heading east in the direction of the funeral home and the university—and the two objects that had hung over the highway.

I went into my backyard, as I always do, and I looked up into the sky,  (I am a long time respected investigator/researcher, citizen scientist)  There was a light storm approaching from the West, with light broken clouds . I immediately noticed 2 white balls of light moving perfectly together (when I held my hand up they were about the length of my hand from light to light), but then I saw there was a third light forming a triangle and this was coming from the East over Badger Mountain and flew over me going West into the storm,   Then I noticed another one, 3 lights forming a massive triangle these were moving fairly slow but perfectly in unison with each other, then right next to it there was  another one and behind it another one, there were about 5 to 6 giant triangles that I saw  all moving together heading West over the twin peaks area,    I ran inside and grabbed my camera and tried to get a picture of the formation but could only get 2 lights in the pictures I took, when I zoom in on the lights there seems to be more than one object and   very strange forms . I look up into the sky every night and this is the first time I have seen these massive triangles over the Wenatchee area but I have also seen some very strange lights at out cabin on the summit of Badger Mountain and I saw a U.F.O. during the daylight while I was building our cabin and I reported it here   .",2018-03-02T00:00:00,47.37553137254902,-120.35481633986927

We spotted a 3rd and then a 4th object and could see these were flickering lights.  I drove the immediate area and spotted a family launching Chinese lanterns from their backyard so the experience was explained.  We watched two more lanterns rise, taking the same path up and northward as the previous ones. All spheres were a flickering orange color while below 250 feet elevation but changed to white as traveled further away.  I was amazed that these lanterns followed the same path of flight and even wondered if they were powered by drones, but my husband felt they were getting too far out of range from the family for this to be.

I ran thru the house to my front door, stepped outside and attempted to capture video, but wasn't able to capture what I was seeing accurately.

I yelled for my fiance, who also witnessed the strangeness of this craft. We watched together for about 15 minutes but decided to go back to the garage where we watched it until it changed direction again, now moving Southeast until it was hidden from view by a large tree.  We went inside to go to bed. I've never witnessed anything like this before.

Lights were grouped into a loose formation, several in front, a large group in the middle, followed by several in the rear.  I watched the formation from the driver’s seat of the truck. They couldn’t have been more than 3,000 feet in front of me, and 300 feet or less in altitude and climbing. I’d say they were all about the same size, fifteen or so feet in the middle and a little higher length-wise.  Many of them were a translucent amber color in the midsection, tapering to a hazy brighter white color at the edges. In all my years driving 74, hauling scrap from the shop, I’ve never seen anything like them.  Watching them drift away, it was as if I had startled them.

The object was also about the altitude of a aircraft (or higher) as it flew out over the cascades and disappeared out of my sight.

It left no visible trailings or tracers behind it.  It did not appear to be a fire ball, as to what most people report as meteors.  It didn't seem to fizzle out or burn up.

This object was traveling from west to east, and from my left slowly banking to my right.  It went straight for a while before it made a small angle to the right like it was bending to the right, and then up into the clouds.   It was long, black, and cylindrical.

And as I looked up, I would estimate from my steering wheel to the left corner edge of my front windshield when I first noticed it.  I didn't hear any noise, so I am assuming it was pretty high up, which made me think of a jet but as I watched it, and the road as I was driving, I thought it was odd, no wings, no lights.   South Dakota is wide open spaces and we see a lot of jets overhead, you can make out wings and blinking lights and this had none. Also...in western South Dakota is the Ellsworth Air force base.

As for the size, I thought it was the size of a airliner?  I had to look up sizes of airlines, bigger than a private jet, smaller than a, say United Airlines plane...I know there are various sizes.

I stepped outside for a smoke last night at exactly 8:33pm, and when I looked in the sky, I saw a light moving from the eastern sky, moving tward the north, about 20-30 degrees from the horizon.  I then noticed that ther was another one coming up behind it. Then came another, and another, and they just kept coming. They where just bright, orange (almost shimmering) bright lights.  There was no flashing lights, and there was no landing / take off head lights on these.  Then there was two, almost on top of each other, and the one on top moved up and away (much too fast for conventional aircraft) and then I couldn’t see it.  But I could still see the one below it, moving at the same speed as before.   Then, to my amazement, one of these things shot down (out of nowhere) and stopped right on top of one of the lights (that was following the same path as the rest of these) and continued at the same speed as the one next to it.  Again, no conventional aircraft can make t! hese movements. I know how fighter jets, and helicopters move, very well. It was not any of those. Now, I saw these lights just minutes before a snow storm started.  It actually started to snow just seconds after I saw the last light disappear.  So, since it was extremely cloudy, with a very low ceiling, these objects couldn’t have been too far away, and they where completely silent. In fact, it was strange how quiet it became when these where passing by.  I say that, because I live near an Airforce base, and after I saw these objects, I could hear all kinds of military jets flying all around me overhead, but I could NOT see any of the lights from the aircraft flying over me.  The air base is only about 20 miles from my house, and they are very low when they fly over.  It's very strange, that I could see all of these lights, with no sound; and then right after, hear jets over me, but not see any of the lights from them. (Just minutes apart) I did take a video with my phone, but it’s very poor in the dark, and you can only see bits and pieces of what I was seeing. After I came back inside,  I went through the video, and at times when my camera picked up the lights, I went through frame by frame.

My attention was drawn to the west by a steady orange light in the sky.  It caught my attention because of its orange color and lack of any apparent strobe or beacon that normally would be seen on an aircraft.  I caught a brief glance of it as I was walking and then a tree came between me and the light so that I temporarily lost sight of it.  When I cleared the tree a second or two later, I noticed that the light was either climbing in altitude, or coming towards me (or both), and that it was a steady orange glow, almost like a landing light on an aircraft but way more orange.  I was kind of fixated on this light, expecting at anytime to see a beacon or navigation lights which would have given it away as an aircraft when it started to fade and then disappeared completely.  Not behind a clou! d or anything, but just faded out within the span of about a second or two at most.  There might have been a second light behind (closer to the horizon) the first light, but, as I stated, I was transfixed on the brightest light, and only noticed a second light that disappeared along with the first light at the same time.  That second light might have been an aircraft, as LAX outbound traffic is frequently in that vicinity of the sky, but I can’t be certain as I was only half aware of that light. Anyway, as I was contemplating what I had just witnessed (I was stopped a few doors down from my apartment at this point, staring up at the sky), an object came “tumbling” by at, what seemed to me, just above treetop-level! It was moving in an easterly direction and, for lack of a better word, tumbling.  It remind me of a semi-translucent, roughly spherical object with a very dim, orangey glow.  There seemed to be a darker patch on the object that rotated with it’s apparent tumble, this is how I could see it’s rotation. It moved at a steady, quick pace; I’m bad at estimating speed, but I’d say maybe between 20 to 35 mph.  It made no noise and was visible to me for approximately 5 to 8 seconds, I’d say.  It moved eastward and looked to be descending as it crossed my field of view, but I could be wrong.  It had a steady glow, no flickering like a candle or anything.  I thought initially that maybe it was a bag with a candle or something in it, but I’ve seen flying lanterns before, and this didn’t look or move like the lanterns I’ve seen in the past.  It had been a windy day in Long Beach, but when I saw this object, there was no wind that I could detect. One other thing--as I was driving home about 10 to 15 minutes before my initial sighting of the original light, I had noticed a couple looking up at the sky rather intently on the sidewalk of the street I was driving down.  Now I wish I had stopped and asked them what they were looking at.  Maybe it was related to what i saw…",2018-03-02T00:00:00,33.79002328838174,-118.17310534232365

I turned left on Jefferson and drove toward it.  I was watching it in the sky for 15 minutes, not moving, just hovering as I continued to drive toward it trying to get a photo.  It was blinking, still hovering, and appeared to be changing shape.  It was not a helicopter, airplane, or balloon.  That was obvious since a helicopter was circling around  near I-40 in the south west distance.  I don’t know Albuquerque very well, so I was turning left and right all over trying to get closer.  I ended up on Indian School and parked in a church parking lot.  My crappy phone camera still couldn’t see what I was plainly seeing at that point.  It was a very odd shape.  If you have Microsoft Word (version 2007), go to insert a shape and under stars and banners the fist couple shapes is what I saw.  I don't know how else to describe this.  It was red and blinking…or maybe shimmering.  It seemed to be changing colors a bit. It was so strange.  Just hovering, not moving.  Others pulled over in the church parking lot.  I know they saw what I saw because we were parked all horizontal in the lot just staring at the sky.  I tried again to take a photo…so frustrating…nothing.  Looked like a speck of dust on my phone even though what I was looking at was large.  I decided to drive further and try to get even closer.  In doing so, I must have ended up under it because I lost it.  I watched this object for a total of 20 minutes while I drove.

I am about 30 minutes from a major city, but I figured someone must have seen these lights.  I came across this site while looking for information online.  I have never been on UFO websites before, but I felt like I had to report what I had seen.   Honestly, when I saw the amount of lights in the sky, my first thought was ""invasion"", but in a joking sense.  I would have taken a picture, but my phone was broken.  If it happens again tonight, I will be taking pictures and video.",2018-02-22T00:00:00,,

I live in Friday Harbor, WA on San Juan Island, north Puget Sound. Strong winds had blown all night long making the early morning sky clear and dark, with the early morning stars and planets extra visible and a few of the larger ones were tinted orange-ish in color. I was driving into town on my way to the gym.  With mornings like these, I love looking up at the sky.  Because it’s so early in the morning there are no other cars around me.  Town is empty.  I always try to look up at the sky anyway because when I was about 16 years old, (roughly 1992) my father and I experienced a real UFO sighting together out in Palm Desert.  That one was a major experience with an actual craft that moved like a shooting star after hovering in place for about an hour.  My point is – because I look at the sky a lot, I’ve seen a lot of anomalies that I felt could have some explanation, and none of which were remotely similar as to what I saw that night out in the desert with my dad -- until this morning. I was driving slowly down Second Street, as I mentioned, looking straight ahead and up towards the clear black sky.  Suddenly, right in front of me was this very, very white light that flashed in front of me and my initial response was that it was a shooting star.  But there were two things that went with this that made me second guess the whole shooting star thing. First, the way it moved.  I didn’t see where it came from but that it entered my field of vision from the right moving towards the left.  And it moved just like a shooting star but into a upside down ‘U’ shape and just vanished ---not vanished from my field of vision like behind a tree or behind hills or a building--vanished.  Disappeared.  As if there were a tiny little pocket waiting for it and it dove into that.  There was a trail of light and then there wasn’t. The second thing is that if it were a shooting star, it was way too close to the earth.  We have small, single engine, prop personal planes, puddle jumpers and sea planes coming in and out of our tiny airport here.  It was a similar distance to one of those little planes about to land.  Like most islanders, I’m very familiar with these planes being around and what they look like when they are landing or taking off. This thing I saw moved and looked like a shooting star but was very close to the earth and moved in an arch shape before disappearing into a seeming pocket in the sky.  A white light, no pulsating and no other lights, no other colors of light. I’m open to explanations! I would love to know your opinion on the matter.  Sorry I don't have a photo, it happened too fast. Thank you!",2018-02-22T00:00:00,48.5372,-123.06789999999998

PD))   The first page of this report was submitted on 02/12/18 but I have been observing the lights for an additional two weeks now so I kept notes with the original statement and am now submitting notes on the entire 14 nights of observation.  Please, if possible, do respond to me as offered in the Center's voice message, these appearances are growing disturbingly unsettling and no one else can offer any advice or explanation. Last night, Feb. 12, 2018, I was watching television in the back room at about 7 p.m.  When through the window I noticed an unusually bright star in an unfamiliar area of the sky.  As I watched, the star seemed to move back and forth quickly and repeatedly.  My curiosity was aroused, so I went out to the front porch and turning off the porch light, stood looking at the unusual star. In the full darkness (we live in a rural area) I could also see that the star was giving off faint alternating red, yellow and green glows.  It would remain steady for a time and then suddenly, with no warning, shoot rapidly off to one side then without visibly stopping, shoot rapidly back in the direction from which it came.  It did not turn around, it simply reversed direction midflight. And it was very fast, like a ball hit by a bat!  My curiosity grew and I got a pair of binoculars to get a better look as the star was, of course, distant.  Although it was very dark, with the binoculars I could see that the glow I was glimpsing was comprised of a double row of lights which appeared to encircle what I was beginning to suspect was an aircraft of some type.  I went in and called the Sheriff's Dept. and reported the sighting and asked if anyone else had reported seeing the object.  The dispatcher said they had received no other calls but suggested I contact the Military Training Center located near my home. I called them and was told that they weren't doing any aerial maneuvers that night and no one had mentioned seeing the unusual light in the sky.  It was shift change and I was not able to get anyone to go out and look into the sky to see if they could see it. (I called again later and the person I spoke with just advised me to call local authorities as the light wasn't appearing over the base, so was outside their jurisdiction.)  I continued watching the light until 11:00 p.m.  During this time it became much more active, shooting rapidly from a motionless position sometimes straight up, sometimes horizontally, then, without pausing at all, reversing direction and returning to its original position. It never appeared to turn, it simply reversed itself on its existing plane without slowing, one moment it was going east and then suddenly it was going west!  Eventually the light began traveling in a wide arc around my house, passing over the town of Selah and disappearing behind the leafless branches of the trees in my back yard.  As it made these passes it seemed to come much closer, with the binoculars I could make out a faint gray shape, somewhat like a clamshell form with lights circling the middle. It didn't come close enough to see clearly even with the binoculars because it was very dark and I could only see the vague shape due to the illumination from encircling lights it carried. Over the four hours that I observed it, I didn't watch it constantly, just kept checking every few minutes to see where it was and what it was doing as it had begun to make me nervous, it performed many odd maneuvers.  A few times it would dart back and forth in an “invisible” perimeter, similar to a “superball” slamming wildly about in every direction inside a translucent globe.  Other times it would unexpectedly shoot straight up until it disappeared and then suddenly reappear in the distance exactly retracing its upward path on its return.  Sometimes it would suddenly disappear, like turning off a light bulb, then reappear somewhere else in the sky, usually at a distance but unmistakable because of its shape and colors.  Once or twice two other smaller lights appeared and darted around the original for a few minutes and then disappeared.  The smaller lights moved just as quickly and deftly as the larger but didn't give off any colors apart from their “starlight” glow.  As the h! ours passed the original light seemed to grow larger and more vivid.  By the time I went to bed at 11:00 p.m., It was much easier to make out without binoculars, looking like a tiny burst of fireworks high in the distant sky. When I first spotted the light I called my sister-in-law and her husband outside to view it as well, they saw it and commented on how odd it was, how quickly it moved and we all wondered what it was.  I also called a neighbor to see if she had a phone which could snap pictures or take video of this light.  I walked over to her house and pointed it out to her, she commented that she had seen odd lights once or twice before in the area.  She tried to film it but her phone wasn't capable of capturing a viable image, in the distance it just looked like a star and she didn't have video capability. 02/13/18 –-The light is again in the night sky in relatively the same spot it was “based” last night.  It moves around but always seems to return to the same spot.  At first it appears to just be a very bright star, one among many in the sky just brighter and slightly larger than the others.  But after a few seconds observation it begins to move, always returning to its original position in the sky.  It is very high, far above the flight path of passing airplanes and MUCH faster than the planes.  With binoculars you can see that it gives off an alternating red and green glow, sometimes the glow is barely visible without binoculars.  It is cloudy tonight but the light and some stars are still visible although at times they are partially obscured by the clouds but the bright moving light is visible as a glow even when obscured by clouds.  The light blinks off and on at times as well as occasionally giving off the alternating red and green glow. 02/14/18 – Light again in the sky tonight, neither as bright nor as active as the past two nights but still moves around, then returns to “base” and remains immobile for 5-20 seconds then begins to move again.  At 7:14 p.m. it suddenly erupted into a miniature “fireworks” display for about 30 seconds – a burst of cascading colors which in the distance appears to be about the size of a pencil eraser. Again tonight I checked on it sporadically for hours and it is always there. 02/15/18 – Very overcast tonight, can’t even see the moon much less stars or the strange light. 02/16/18 – The object is again in the sky in its usual spot, as each time before it is motionless until I watch it for a few seconds, then it begins to move.  Honestly this is beginning to disturb me, it is almost as if it remains motionless until it becomes aware of me either inside at the unlit window or on the back porch.  Does it remain motionless when not being observed?  If so, how does it detect observation from such a distance?  I wish I could film it to see if it only moves when being observed.  I have wondered if it is an illusion, but I asked Mark and Karen to come to look as well again tonight and both of them remarked on how quickly and obviously it moved and how agile it appears to be.  They are not small movements, it goes both short and long distances but always eventually returns to its “base”.  It is very obviously not a plane.  We are near an airport and planes pass by fairly regularly, the light is far above them, moves much faster, can stop completely an! d remain still and performs maneuvers that a plane could never do and I suspect neither could a helicopter.  What is this thing?? 02/17/18 – The light is not as active tonight as usual, also it has moved its “base” slightly to the west. I have tried looking for it during the day but it only seems to be visible after dark.  I have gotten up at odd hours, midnight, 3:00 a.m. and 5 a.m. and since it is still dark it is still visible and as usual is motionless at first then after 10-15 seconds it begins to move and it moves a great enough distance that even when it is not as active as usual it is clearly moving a fair distance, usually in a straight line, back and forth or up and down but occasionally zig-zagging, it always seems to simply reverse itself without pausing, never actually “turns around”.  It has never again come down as far as it did the first night I observed it when it descended and seemed to go east around the back of the house and disappear reappearing almost instantly back at its “base” on the south side of the house high in the sky. 02/18/18 – heavily overcast again tonight, light not visible. 02/19/18 – The light seems to have returned to its original “base” tonight to the southeast of the house.  It is quite active tonight and there are three others moving around as well although they are not quite as large as the original.  I didn’t notice them at first, I was just looking at the large one and then one by one I caught the smaller ones moving in my peripheral vision and realized that there are more of these things!  What are they?? 02/20/18 – Overcast with light snow, can’t see anything, not even stars. 02/21/18 – Still overcast, not even stars visible. 02/22/18 – There are two large lights tonight, one northwest of the usual spot in the southeast and one to the southwest, both moving and flashing. 02/23/18 – Tonight there are three of the lights behind the house and one to the northeast, near the Firing Center – the local military training base.  All lights are large and active. 02/24/18 – I did not watch lights tonight, it is really beginning to disturb me.  I have called the Firing Center a few times now and been told they have had nothing in the skies at night the last few weeks and it could not be drones as the lights are too high and besides, they said, this area near the Training Center is federal air space and no civilian drones would be allowed.  The Sheriff’s dept. has just referred me back to FAA or Training Center. 02/25/18 – There were a total of five lights out there tonight, all blinking and very active.  The original (it’s usually in the same place and the same size, so I guess it’s the same one) and four smaller lights.  As before, when I first look out nothing is moving, after a few seconds they begin to move.  I find it disturbing that there are a growing number of these lights, I wish I knew what they are!!! 02/26/18 – Multiple lights tonight, all active.  I called the local news station – KIMA – tonight to see if anyone had called them asking about the unusual lights in the sky, they had not.  Although various people had suggested I call the news station it made me uncomfortable, I’d rather not draw attention to myself, I just want answers!!!!  About 4 a.m. I noted a large light near the perimeter of the Training Center again, active but not immensely so.  Karen watched them briefly with me again at my request, this is so bizarre it makes me question what I’m seeing! 02/27/18 – Called Sheriff’s Office again, told to call Training Center or FFA.  It is quite overcast tonight but I spotted a small flashing moving light briefly high in the southern sky in a momentary break in the clouds, far above the normal airplane flight path. 02/28/18 – 9:56 a.m. I called the FAA office in Spokane (509) 532-2340 and spoke with Jeff Holtz.

He did not want to speak with a local newspaper journalist.  We suspect a hoax.  PD)) UFO Breaks The sound Barrier Twice? Last night two of my friends wanted to come over to my place to hangout to have a usual guys night. We did what we always do, go out to get something to eat, have a few drinks, and come back to my place to crash.  My one friend was having some family issues so he decided to drink a little bit more (a lot more) than usual.  He then laid down in my bed when we got back and went into a deep drunken sleep.  While my other friend and I decided to stay up play some video games and talk about some things.  It was about 4:30 am when heard a very loud BOOM.  One that shook the house so hard that woke my very intoxicated friend right out of his deep slumber.  He wasn’t all there so he didn’t know what was going on.  My other friend and I on the other hand quickly looked out the window to see if there was a transformer that blew or something along those lines . We then heard the fire department sirens from down the road go off.  At that point we just assumed it was a blown transformer, but shortly after the first boom about 5 minutes we then heard another big BOOM just as loud if not louder than the first one and then saw multiple lighting bolts shock their way into the sky along with an object that shot up along with it almost as if it were some form of projectile.  Curious to see what was happening the three of us drove around by the fire department to see what was going on.  A volunteer fire fighter that I went to high school with a couple years back then told me that these loud booms came from the woods up on one of the mountains, and that they went up to see if there was a forest fire.  Some of the residents that they talked to said that they also saw the lightning bolts shock their way from towards the ground into the sky.  To top this all off the women that owns the antique store said that her dogs were acting strange, barking at nothing moments before the first boom and that her son that lives across the street were doing the same.  The fire! fighters also stated that they could find no evidence of a lig! htning s trike no smoke, fire, nothing from where the lightning originated. It makes me wonder where this ETC came from.  After processing what happened I think that this UFO broke the sound barrier as it was entering the atmosphere and did the same as it shot up and left the atmosphere. I can’t give a certain description on what this “ufo” looked like because I thought it was a spherical shaped and my friend said it looked like the shape of a cucumber.  I’m not sure if its because this object was going fast or if it was because it was the beginning of the morning and was a little dark for us to get a good look.  I would like to know more about what happened so if anyone might know feel free to get ahold of me.",2018-03-02T00:00:00,41.8311,-76.5638

Soon after, the second light that was slightly more to the east of Sirius also dimmed to a point and then disappeared entirely.

It was a clear night but generally not a lot of stars visible where we are.  I was staring up in a southern direction, around the area of Orion’s Belt. I noticed a star to the immediate right of Orion's Belt that was twinkling more than the others.  It was white, same as any other star or light you would normally see at night.  As I watched, it started to actually flicker like a dying light bulb.  Very rapidly and erratically on and off.  There didn’t seem to be any sort of pattern to the flickering.  This went on for maybe 15 to 20 seconds. There was then a quick brighter burst of white light, then it flickered out completely.  Didn’t see it again.  About 1 to 2 seconds later, looking to the right of the first light, I saw another small white light flicker on out of nowhere.  Wasn’t as bright as the first light and that was followed almost instantly by an orange burst of smaller lights.   Very faint but I would say it looked like an explosion.  There were multiple, smaller orange lights emanating from the second light.  Like something hit it and orange pieces flew off of it.  They moved out very quickly in a seashell shape, with the small side coming from the second white light – the orange pieces were moving back towards the spot of the first light.  The second flash that was followed by the orange burst was visible for maybe a total of 3-4 seconds? I was looking up in the sky for a few minutes but once I notice the first light flickering, the entire event took 20-30 seconds? I couldn’t tell any shapes other than they looked like any other star in the sky.  The first white light was same size, color, shape.  The second white light was smaller and fainter as were the orange pieces. Totally guessing on distance here.  I’m 6’2”.

The three lights were oriented so as to form the three corners! of an oblate triangle.  They shown for a few seconds then went out again.  We watched the sky a while longer but never saw them again.

As it rose slowly up in the air, it didn't really go straight up at first, more like in slow, diagonal, jerky movements at times, while it rotated on it's axis.  It had a spot about as bright as the sun on it (maybe even brighter, it's what caught my eye)and the sun was reflecting off of it, but the sun was above it, and the light rotated in a fixed spot on the craft, rotating with its axis. It was probably about 50-60 feet wide and 25-30 feet tall!.  It also seemed to be distorting its shape at times, like it was distorting or changing its shape or stretching and contracting.

In the early morning hours of January 6, 2018, I got up to go to the bathroom.  I then looked out a back window to the view over our lakeside home (Lake Murray near Chapin, SC).  I viewed the lake and sky.  I saw a bright light in the sky, larger than visible stars.  It was not the moon!  I watched for a period of time and it did seem to move a bit downward and to the right.  I observed for a period of time to ensure this was not an airplane or jet (or normal one at least).  This viewing was approximately 5:00 a.m. and in a SW direction from the back of our home.  Distance could not be determined - it seemed to be a good distance away. After observing for a period of time, I got my Panasonic DMC-FZ70 and took pictures through our windows - it was very cold outside.  As I recall, there was no moon visible.  I took a series of pictures from 5:15 a.m. to 5:24 a.m. Of course, at first, I thought my eyes or imagination were playing tricks on me.  But, I really believe I observed something really unusual.  I called for my wife to get up, but, she refused.  I continued to watch to about 5:30 a.m. and then went back to bed.  When I quit viewing, the strange light was still visible. I had thought about calling the Lexington County Sheriff's Department at the time of sighting or at least the next morning, but, I did not do this. Today, on January 18, 2018, I finally downloaded pictures from my camera.  I had forgotten about these pictures.  I do have a collection of 15 pictures - this camera has a relatively long focal length and some are at 215mm.

I’m still having trouble processing what happened. I am composing this perhaps an hour or so after the incident occurred.  So, a little prior to 01:00 I’m sitting on the couch reading a book.  I noticed that the video I had on which was a (Bach Concerto) starts going in and out, along with the power.  I really did not think much of it until my laptop started acting strange as well.  My lap top was opened, running and unplugged, not connected to any power source.  Yet the power was effected somehow, I’m assuming it was an Electromagnetic Interference of sorts.  I proceeded to look out the front door to see if I could identify the light from my neighbors TV’s perhaps going in and out similar to mine, as many of my neighbors let their TV go all night, and you can see the glow projected on the curtains or blinds fairly easy.  Didn’t see anything out of the ordinary.  I happened to hear a crack (like a stick breaking) in my back yard.  Keep in mind this is a City setting, lots of houses VERY close to each other.  So I walk outside around to my back yard, and noticed my hair standing up.  The best way I can describe it, is that it was a similar sensation you would get from the static electricity you’d get from a statically charged balloon. Looked around, didn’t notice anything in particular. Looked up and saw what I can only describe as a black triangle with 3 red lights just hovering approximately 400ft above my house.  Completely quiet, there was no noise whatsoever.  If I would not have look up towards the sky, I would never have even known it was there.  So there was an odd electrical discharge that would occasional present itself then dissipate directly under the craft right in the middle.  Similar to the electricity you would see from a stun gun, just not as bright, I don’t know exactly what it was but thought I would mention it non the less.  Additionally, I heard some rustling way back in the yard and from behind my shed (could have been anything, even an animal) so I went back inside to get my pistol and a phone (because it has a camera), and by the time I got back outside (about 50 seconds) the object that was hovering above my house was gone.  I’m still processing this. I thought I had only looked at this! thing for about maybe a minute, but after all was said and done somehow about 20 minutes had gone by.

First observed from the downtown Naperville area, a small red light that appeared stationary above a Walgreen's located at the intersection across from the parking garage where my car was parked for the evening.  It was about 5:50 P.M. on a clear evening; no stars were out yet and no planes or other aircraft were observed for the evening.   The light was clearly artificial, but there hadn't been any typical air traffic; the light was out of place.  I was across the street from the Walgreen's, waiting for the traffic light to change so that I could get to my car in the parking garage, observing.  It wasn't moving when I first observed it, yet the light was blinking to no apparent rhythm: sometimes it would blink rapidly, other times it blink once, then stop blinking for several seconds before starting again.  It would flash red, then appear to vanish, only to blink red again.  I was curious, and flashed the flashlight on my phone at it, mimicking its own flashing.  It flashed back, and then stopped flashing for an extended period of time.  When the light finally turned (after I took a quick series of photos) I crossed the street and headed the down the block towards the garage.  However, I noticed something odd; the red light wasn't behind me as it should have been if it was still stationary.  If it had just been hovering I should have passed it by, leaving it behind me. I should have had to look behind me in order to keep it in view, not in front.  Curious, I stopped walking abruptly.  In that short instance of my pause, I caught it moving a few degrees more to the west before it stopped.  I took more photos and kept walking. In front of the garage, across from the municipal center, there is a relatively empty, small parking lot.  I stopped there and flashed my flashlight once more in a series of rapid bursts at the light; there was no response this time.  Once more the light was stationary.  I took the stairs up to the fourth floor (where my car was), and looked out the gaps between the floors.  The light was still there, stationary, blinking slowly. I took another series of quick photos. Leaving the downtown area to get home,  I hoped out loud that I wouldn't see it coming after the car. I don't recall seeing it after I left.  I don't know if it was still there when i pulled out of the garage, but I know for sure that it didn't follow me back to my house.  I’ve seen a lot of air traffic in my neighborhood, but I have never seen anything like it.  This light was way too high in the sky to be a plane or a helicopter, not to mention that I’ve never seen one act or move like this light did. Later discovering a video I took with my phone that I hadn't noticed before, I saw another object come out of nowhere during the last two seconds of the video.  Green, and flying out of nowhere exactly that I pinpoint, it was much larger than the red light, didn't blink, and wasn't noticed while I filmed.  I don’t recall seeing that object/light before the viewing the video.  Zooming into the photo shows a weird green shape.",2018-01-16T00:00:00,41.766329451137885,-88.14466599732262

Going from left to right (W to E) from our perspective, it was zipping across the top of the San Gabriel Mountains. As crazy as it sounds, once it just got passed Cajon Pass, the oval-shaped object split into two.  When this occurred, the second object became red and both the yellow/orange and red object looped around in a full complete circle. Once the object meets up with one another during the course of the loop, the object became one again only making the yellow/orange oval shape visible and flew back westward towards Mt. Baldy.  When it got past Mt. Baldy, the object seemed to have vanished, not to be seen by our eyes any longer.

The light obviously was coming from above us.  Within 3 to 4 seconds, we both opened our doors and jumped out of the car.  The light went out about the time we were getting out, maybe right before.The incident lasted no more than 3 seconds.  We scanned the sky but heard nothing and saw nothing.  No airplane, no helicopter, nothing?  I’ve spoken to my friend about this several times over the years.  He remembers it just as I do but no explanation.  To this day, I have never forgotten this incident or have I ever come up with an explanation.  I keep telling myself that it must have  been a helicopter but,  It’s hard to live with that explanation because we both were looking to the sky for an obvious aircraft but there were none and no sounds could be heard.

I don't have a word processor.  I used to be an avid coon hunter.  I have spent more time outside at night than most people I would assume.  In all that time I never saw anything that was unexplainable.  We watched planes very regularly as they get in line from all over above Washington county in order to land in Louisville.  I got good enough to where I could use stars to navigate back to my truck as we would often end up several miles away from our starting point.  My ex wife and I had 5 kids between us.   One evening it was clear outside we had enjoyed a rare kid free day, but used it cleaning and organizing our house.  We lived way out in the country and realized around 11 pm we was going to run out of cigarettes.  There were no local stores open this late so we decided to take a nice evening drive to Harrodsburg to a store we knew stayed open til midnight it was about a 25-30 min drive from our house.  We went and on our way back I was driving we had the radio on n! ot real loud though.  We was quiet listening to music.  We was on the stretch of road about 6 miles long that connects macville to willisburg.  All of a sudden it was pretty far in the distance but this fireball shoots across the sky and it was good size but traveling at a very high rate of speed.  Immediately, it was so odd that it ran cold chills and goosebumps all over my body.  I was in shock this object appeared to look like the tip of a sparkler on 4th of July.  I wasn't going to say anything to my wife, but she said oh my God did you see that?  And I said yes I wasn't going to say anything because I wasn't sure if you seen it.  She said no I seen it.  Then she said oh my God look and I looked out of the passenger window and it had reappeared above a field this time much closer and this time it was hovering.  I was looking back and forth to keep from having a wreck.  She was freaking out and very afraid.  Then she turned around and said oh my god, it's right behind us  I couldn't see it at this point I was too afraid to turn and look out of fear of having a wreck this is a very dangerous road as animals are always a problem.  I had this overwhelming feeling we was being followed and watched.  We made it home and ran in the house we both couldn't believe it and was both afraid.  Nothing else happened but I will swear this to be the truth and I will never forget this.  This was not a shooting star plane comet although I thought it was until I seen it hovering.

As I tried to drive and watch at same time, the three bright lights lined up perfectly together.  I then thought hmm. this is looking more like possible flares.  Suddenly the lights changed formation in unison into the shape of a large triangle. I said well that's not right. I found a place in the dark to pull over on a farm out in the countryside.  Turned off my car, turned off all my lights.  I said, well if these are planes, they will come forward or turn or get bigger, if they are flares they will fall and burn out.  But no.  They kept changing formation!  From a large triangle, back to side by side in a straight line, to a smaller triangle, back again to even brighter lights as a large triangle, then the lights all at the same time converged together into one light, changed from orange to white, then separated again into a triangle formation. I picked up my phone to call my daughter to tell her what I was seeing, as soon as I picked up my phone, one of the lights went out, then within a few moments appeared on opposite side of the sky. Slowly over the next few minutes, the lights went off one by one. I know it was not flares, they can not change formation or zip around the sky.

This morning around midnight, I awoke a few minutes before I heard an incredibly loud aircraft pass over my home.  I live in what's considered ""Old Metairie"", Louisiana, near the Causeway and there's quite a bit of noise outside--day and night.  With the highway being so close there's constantly the drone of cars and 18-wheelers passing, not to mention I also live about 15 minutes from the airport so I'm used to hearing planes as well.    Last night was different though. I woke up a couple minutes before it happened in a short coughing fit (it's flu season and I'm getting over it now) and laid in bed in silence with my dog before I heard what, at first, I thought was a helicopter approaching.  I say it sounded like a helicopter because it was almost a pulsating whirring instead of a steady building of noise like an airplane.  But my heart started to race because it seemed like it wasn't passing at all and instead was getting closer and louder until I certainly thought, at the volume it was at, there's no way it couldn't be right above the neighborhood.    I couldn't bring myself to look outside and see; for fear of seeing anything other than a plane or helicopter, and instead I laid there holding my breath waiting for the noise to subside.  After about two minutes or so it did but not without me trying to justify in my head what would have taken it so long as any other aircraft takes only seconds to pass no matter how close it sounds.  I'd like to add that I also grew up on a military base so I'd consider my ears incredibly accustomed to the noise of training exercises and transport at all times of the day, but I couldn't shake the feeling last night that it was something I had never heard here before.",2018-01-15T00:00:00,29.998805633802814,-90.17318112676055

He acknowledged it immediately when the plane and object were in a line - the plane directly above the object, then passing by. It did not change into V- shaped formation while he was observing, however it did remain linear and seemed higher and a bit farther away.  The howling had also stopped and he made a remark about an experiment gone and urged me to go inside before it began again.

It showed a double formation of orange(ish) lights near Parker, Arizona.  The event had also been videotaped separately near El Central CA on the same evening. I was camping near Chiraco Summit, CA, (I-10 near Joshua Tree) on that night and saw a blue fireball move toward San Diego from my position.  This fireball was also discussed by the video observer and apparently some TV news organizations.  Some minutes later, I observed two formations of amber lights moving from the vicinity of El Central, moving N and slightly E.  From my position looking East, they would have crossed the Chocolate Mountains (I-10) between Desert Center and Blythe, CA, and were pretty much headed right to where they were videotaped at Parker, AZ. I see on your website (California sightings) from April 10th, 2017, (a busy day) that at least one report came in from Calexico regarding this formation and another from San Marcos, CA, describing the blue fireball seen just prior to the formations coming into view. Just wanted to give any interested folks a ""head’s up"" that this particular footage on the website is very probably the real deal.  I do not endorse or know anything about the objectivity of the UFO site(s) where the footage is shown!",2018-01-14T00:00:00,,

Sighting began with two lights flashing, similar to commercial aircraft lights in size and brightness but not in that kind of repeating pattern.  One light was brighter than other as if facing opposite, then a large light came on between the other strobe type lights, dim then brighter in a matter of seconds and seemed to illuminate bottom of large ship ... wish I had another way to describe it but honestly similar to what we have seen in Star Trek stuff.  Big light went off and smaller lights came on, as noted, inconsistent flashing so not same as commercial plane.  Big light came on again, several times, illuminating underside of large ship or craft.  This was at high elevation, guessing edge of atmosphere because many commercial planes fly thru that space of sky, guessing Phoenix to Chicago route, and this was higher than those flights, which occur dozens per night and I have watched them 100s of times over 10 years now from a clear sky area out in desert near City of Rocks State Park.   The only portion of sky where these lights were seen was about the distance of sky that is relative to little finger tip to thumb tip when holding hand out at arms length towards the sky, almost vertical.  I thought perhaps a hot air ballon but why did it turn lights on and then off especially when near an area of heavy commercial traffic as well as the Grant County Airport, and I say hot air balloon because of the speed being much slower than the many, many commercial airlines flights I have seen through that area of sky, so I have much to compare these lights to and they were absolutely not ordinary air traffic.

I had to assume that possibly the changing viewing angle had something to do with shape change although at times the object(s) seemed to either be vibrating or rotating.  That object suddenly appeared and was very slowly moving towards the ocean and back nearly directly overhead just above where I live.  As I continued watching I noticed another object moving very slowly, coming directly out of the setting sun direction and moving very slowly in direct horizontal line towards the first object in what looke! d like a collision course.  The first object seemed to stop and just hover while the other approaching object drew closer.  As the two got very close the second flew past the first above it then as they got further away from each other they began to move in tandem, then going from perpendicular to a horizontal position and moved from north-west to south-east in tandem then they seemed to break off formation and slowly spread one to the west while the other seemed to more or less hold its position at about a 50-80 degree angle to my viewing position.  These objects went from a white color to sometimes a shimmering metallic or reflective mylar look but it wasn't solid looking when it began shimmering it seemed to flash as if it had multiple surfaces.   As I continued to view the two objects I watched a third that seemed to drop down from above my focus to an altitude similar to the other 2 objects and north of them again the three maneuvered back into a horizontal line with quite a bit of distance between each other.  After that maneuver, they then b roke the line and moved closer to form a triangular formation and slowly moved out towards the ocean and then back towards my viewing position. After watching these slow manuvers for some time I noticed a 4th and 5th object materialiing or moving from very high in the sky down towards the other objects and as these other two became about the same size as the others they all formed another horizontal line from north to south, evenly spaced, and kept that formation for a short while then the orginal two pretty much stayed at the same altitude and eventually moved appart and one went west into the sun set and flew into a contrail that was left by a passing aircraft while the other stayed in my viewing location at anywhere from 50 to 80 degrees angle to my location.  The other additional 3 slowly moved west outside of my location viewing as roof lines and trees blocked me from following them and by this time my arms were getting tired of holding binoculars plus it was getting darker and the red filters were losing affect and just darkening my vision.  Also when I tried viewing without the red filters or with just my naked eyes but without the filters, the objects weren't visible to me.

Durango and ""The Lakes"" community w/ poltergeist activity. 2:35 am	  Awakened by her cat; went into kitchen to get the cat some of its food from refrigerator; she remembers considering taking her morning medication extra early (but didn’t).  Returned to bed. 3:30 am  	Awakened by a rustling noise in the kitchen/living room area that sounded like the dog prancing around when he gets excited.  She thought maybe the dog & cat were playing.  She called the dog, and he came into the bedroom in an excited state with his ears perked up and his attention was directed towards where he had come from. She continued to hear the rustling sound (sort of like fast, small footsteps) coming from the kitchen, and assumed that it must be the cat.  She moved her body, and realized the cat was actually laying on the bed.  This cat normally reacts with curiosity when someone outside the family comes in the house, but she uncharacteristically decided not to investigate the noises, although she clearly heard them too. Realizing she can’t blame the noise on any of the animals (and her son is asleep in bed with her), she became afraid that an intruder was in the house.  She actually considered getting her gun. Just after having that thought, an extremely bright light coming from outside brightened up the room, completely taking her mind off the mysterious kitchen sounds.  Lying in her bed and looking out her window, she could see the underneath side of an enormous UFO that reminded her more of the Star Trek Enterprise because of its detailing and multiple shapes rather than the stereotypically shaped UFO.  It was grayish cream in color with many white lights.  Her position made it impossible to see the entire craft until it moved away. The round sections had inner soft, circular contoured bevel (like molding).  The square section was outlined with lights, and its inner part was flat and non-descript.  There was a hazy appearance around the ship. She recalled having the presence of mind to think “I have to try and remember lots of details, because Mom will ask a million questions.”  And “Lots of people have to be witnessing this!”  It was hovering very low when she initially saw it, then it moved in a very slight eastward direction before it stopped.  It remained stationary for no more than 20 seconds allowing her to see the entire underneath side of the ship. It then shot off at a tremendous speed in a southeast direction with a slightly increased altitude, causing her to sit up in bed for a better look.  Where and when it disappears from sight, she witnessed a distant lightning strike & flash/halo of haze and light around the area where it disappeared.  She mentioned that even if this was actual lightening, her perception was that it was far enough away that she wouldn’t have expected to hear thunder. While this was going on in the sky, she heard moaning off & on outside as if someone was in pain. Time?  	Everything went back to normal.  She wanted to check the kitchen, but oddly fell back asleep.  Her sleep was fitful, because the largest knuckle on her index finger of her left hand started hurting. 5:50 a.m.	  Woke up and took her thyroid medication which was on her nightstand. 6:00 a.m.	  Her alarm goes off.  She turned the TV on in her bedroom expecting to see a news report about the UFO.  There was none, and this frustrated her, because it was so large (football field size); people had to witness this. 6:50 a.m.	  Got out of bed and went into the kitchen (which is extremely small in dimension and just enough room to turn around).  A lower cupboard door is wide open.  She could not have missed this detail on her 2:35 a.m. trip to the kitchen.  Neither of the animals could have done this.  Her son never woke up during the night. 9:30 a.m.  	Took her jacket off at work, and the motion made her finger start hurting again. She can feel a very small bump.  It is slightly purple and feels like bruise.  It continued to hurt at the end of her workday and the time of this writing. She claims to have had the intuitive feeling during the whole episode that this experience “wasn’t for her”.  But, if it wasn’t directed at her, she wonders why something was happening in her kitchen.  She said that she has never experienced anything like this.  She tried to reason that it must have been a dream, because it is too preposterous to be anything else.  At the same time, she knows it happened.  She said that her odd reaction of easily going back to sleep was disturbing, and that she felt like she had experienced psychological gaslighting.",2018-10-25T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

We had flown over the Millenium Dome and was somewhere between that point and a sea wind farm, I can't be too specific as we were high up and the last point of recall was the Dome.  I recall noting how tiny planes were landing into London City - inches.  I also recalled an unusual shadowing on buildings when there were no clouds in the sky.  I was looking out of my window thinking about the clouds and wondering about different levels when I saw a bronze sphere which was, I can only assume, static.  It was approximately ten feet away - I could only guage from the wing - but was large enough that it could not be missed.  I do not know if anyone else saw this  - but I have no doubts that the pilots would have seen it.  I have never seen anything like it before.  I saw it,  I think it would be approximately ten feet if not more in diameter.  The sky was clear - I can only think it was static as I had a good view as our plane flew past it.

Location and conditions:  Carbondale, IL, 09/21/2018, time 1:30 PM (about).  Sky partly cloudy, visibility very good, temp about 85 F.  Slight breeze from the north which the weather channel had reported as 5-10 mph. I was traveling east on the University Mall Drive, approaching the Post Office.  I happened to look up and saw a black object moving from, approximately, North to South at about the speed you would expect a helicopter to travel about 60 mph.  We frequently have medi-vac helicopters in the area as there is a local hospital 3 miles west of that location and I am used to seeing them in the air.  In fact I used to be one of the ride-along RNs many times in them so I am used to watching them.  I estimate the altitude at about 800-1000 ft. or so.   This was not a helicopter, I am certain.  Because of the unusual characteristics of this object, however, I continued to look at it as best I could while driving. Although the altitude and speed were similar to a helicopter, as mentioned, no other aspects matched.  There was no noise, no tail boom, no skids, no windows, and was a completely different shape.  This appeared to be sort of an elongated, many-sided polyhedron.  As it moved, the sun would reflect off a shiny facet now and then as if it had a glossy surface. It did not move like a balloon.  There was no bobbing or slight irregularity in motion as one would expect from a balloon.  Its course was steady.  Also, the speed at which is was traveling, as above, estimated at about 60 mph, was way above the surface wind speed by a lot.  I do not have a wind report for the altitude the object was traveling at (800-1000ft), but there was at least one vulture aloft also in the area, about 300 yards further away than the flight path of the object and I judged, from the steady circling of the vulture, that winds aloft were not very high.  That is, there was not a noticeable southward drift of the vulture's pattern that could match the speed of the object. I pulled into the Post Office parking lot and got out of my car to get a better look.  My cell phone was in a zippered bag and I was concerned it would take too long to retrieve so I just continued observing.  It came directly over IL Hwy 13, the major East-West route through town, passed the Post Office and appeared to make one course change from about SSE to about due East, then head in that direction at a steady speed.  This would be unusual behavior if it was a balloon because the course change happened cleanly with no bobbling or turbulence as one might see if a different air mass intercepted the object.  The course change looked to me like I would see a helicopter perform, but, as I mentioned, there was no noise, no tail boom and no other characteristics like a helicopter.  I watched it until I could not longer see it due to buildings and trees behind the Post Office. The most striking features:   1.  Silent and swift with no apparent lift surfaces or engine sounds. 2.  Steady course with one course change.  Stayed at same altitude during period of observation. 3.  Nothing like anything I have ever seen in the sky.  This I knew within seconds of spotting it.",2018-11-30T00:00:00,37.71955416666667,-89.20173333333334

Sunday, 11/18/18 Time frame was approximately: 9:35am – 9:50am.  We entered the Oregon beach from Nehalem Bay State Park at sign post 23.  It was a perfect blue sky day with not a single cloud in the sky.  Upon entering beach, I noticed an odd shaped object above the distant hills directly south of the beach.  The object looked like a boomerang in the sky.  It was positioned such that it looked as if the rings of Saturn were chopped off the planet and were hanging in the sky. I was with my boyfriend, best friend, her young Labrador retriever and our dog.  I dismissed the object as a weird exhaust cloud left over from a plane and walked south along the beach watching the dogs play, the ocean, etc.  We were probably 5 minutes down the beach when we saw some surfers and stopped to watch them.  I happened to look up and notice the object had not changed shaped nor had it dissipated.  I began watching it more closely.  I had on polarized sporting sunglasses.  My boyfriend and best friend did not have sun glasses on.  I pointed the object out to them and said it was, “Not normal”.  They could see it but they were staring into the sun at that time of the morning and it was difficult for them to watch it for long periods of time. Through my sunglasses, the item still appeared boomeranged shaped.  It was a bright white in color similar to looking at the moon in the daylight but brighter.  It would then take on a white-gold hue.  It did not glow; have any flashing lights or other colors.  I became mesmerized by it.  I was waiting for it to fade away like a cloud and it didn’t.  I would look away briefly to watch the dogs.  At one point when I looked away and then back to the boomeranged object, it was positioned lower in the sky and had turned from the boomerang being a slanted parallel position (of the chopped off rings  of Saturn) to a V position.  The shaped still had not changed and looked distinctly like a boomerang. I was even more mesmerized.  It dawned on me if it was a UFO there would possibly be military jets after it. I looked directly East to where I knew the Portland Airport would be.  This is where our National Guard Jets leave from.  I saw in the far off distance an F-15/F-16.  It looked to be heading directly south.  I looked at the object again and it was still there. I looked back at the jet and noticed it was now head directly for the object.  I kept thinking in my head, “The jet is not fast enough.”  When the jet was almost three quarters of the distance to the object, the object started leaving.  I looked away from the object, to the jet, back to the object.  The object was now a gold circle heading south.  Its movement was fluid like, not labored like the jet looked.  The circle became smaller and smaller and it disappeared within 5 or 10 seconds.  The jet was nowhere near objects originating point at the time the object left.  To compare the size of the object to the jet in the far distance is difficult.  It seemed much larger than an F-15/F-16 jet, possibly 2-3 times the size of a typical airline plane.",2018-11-30T00:00:00,45.7046,-123.8618

After awhile they broke into 6 per group and came together with 5 of the six forming a U shape with 6th one in the middle, after hours of observing the orbs they all broke formation and lined up individualy in single file from one end of the sky to the other like if it was roll call as the lone orbe came over and after a few minutes some went back in to Triangle formations while others broke into pairs and zipped through the sky like if they were rubber balls jerking left right up and down like a streak of speed.  I noticed several falling stars throughout the ! night and also noticed when air craft pass by they dim out and as they pass get bright again.  We observed alot of unexplained events the entire night such as 3 bodies standing in the road visual only to the video camera but could not see them in plain view.  The middle one was about 8ft tall like a floating shadow with two shorter being standing on each side in white clothing just standing there then i noticed the video didnt save but started recording again and caught them moving across the ground in a blue color haze to the left of us.  Then seen what seemed bright head lights coming of the hill side coming straight for my uncle and i, we had atleast 20 sec to discuss who it could be clear out here, maybe fish and game, maybe rancher, spot lighter, or bird hunter when it got about 20 yards away it turned the lights off and i instintly grabbed my head light switch turning on my lights but didn't see any road off the steep rough mountain side and there was no vehicle to be seen.

Seconds later it was near us and we acknowledged that it was a round object with white/yellow lights and a red light on the bottom.

I was northbound on Illinois I-94 at approx. 5:15pm CT, near the Dundee exit, in/near Wheeling, IL.  Traffic was fairly heavy, I kept to the right-hand lane.  Initially, a white semi- ahead of me appeared to be having difficulty staying in the lane, drifting onto the shoulder every so often; I remained substantially behind him for a mile or so, eventually he pulled onto the shoulder.  [It occurred to me later that perhaps he'd also seen the UFO and was dumbfounded or panicked and might be communicating via CB.]  Shortly thereafter, I glanced to my right and observed a triangular craft for several seconds, solid black against the night sky, with very large globular (warning?) lights at the apices, these emitting a fairly bright but dark red glow [Wikipedia: approx. 650? nm], easily seen against the night sky.  The form appeared to be equilateral, with no reflective qualities; impossible to gauge its dimensions.  I could not discern any sound. My velocity was approx. 55mph; the object appeared almost stationary but seemed to be traveling southbound because of it's orientation, i.e. it was 'pointed' southward, and seemed to be paralleling the highway.  I have been attempting to guesstimate its size -- at best I'd say its elevation was 100 to 150 feet and perhaps 100 to 150 feet on a side, but I could be off significantly, there were no reference points.  What astonished me most was the size of the globular 'lights', they were quite large, possibly the diameter of a quarter held two feet away, so that the distance between a fore- and aft- light may have been 20-25 such diameters?

Recognition was immediate [have been a Coast fan for 20 years and am familiar with Peter's reports of similar craft].

For the first 3 minutes of my observation, I was trying to figure out what the heck that was. Myself as a private pilot flying small airplanes, I immediately knew it's not an airplane, since its orientation and the configurations of the colors did not match an airplane’s wing tip colors, and again at times it was stationary, neither was it a chopper because it had absolutely no sound,  it was flashing multiple red beacon lights, and at times it introduced some other colors like a greenish yellowish in a shape of a ball.

I was fascinated and couriers so I took out my  phone camera and started filming.  As I was holding my phone against the object of course I did not have a steady hand because at the same time I was also watching it with my eyes.  Now 15 to 20 seconds after starting my filming, it started moving very very slowly like inching away towards the north direction, and suddenly, literally like a lightning strike, it just sped away as fast as a blink of an eye.  Again as I say as a pilot I knew it's not an airplane or a helicopter, and then I was definitely convinced that it wasn't a drone either. I couldn't see where it went since I have an overhead roof as  I was facing south and the object left in the north direction.  I thought maybe I should report it to the law enforcement or to the FAA, so I called the Miami ARTC but I did not get an answer.  I then called the Miami Control Tower and no answer either.  I was also trying to get in touch with the Miami Approach or Miami Center, since it was originally hovering over the Miami international airport East departure route, but I could not locate a number for them. So I called UFO Reporting Agency perhaps they may inform the FAA in that  jurisdiction. It was definitely a strange phenomena which I have never actually witnessed before.. In total time I probably observed it 3 minutes prior to filming. I will send you a link of the video footage if I'm successful in doing so through my mobile device. I will leave you my number  in the event you want to connect with me for any reason. ((name deleted)) 718 XXX-XXXX please do not publish this number anywhere !!

I'm 86 retired.  One of the things on my bucket list is to disclose information about an UFO that was seen hovering over Lajes Air Base on Terceria, Island, Portuguese Azores.   I did not personally see it, but from my position in the overlooking Headquarters building, I and others saw 500 Navy personnel in a ceremonial formation on the tarmac suddenly break ranks pointing skyward.  A scurry of activity followed.   As the Base information officer, I fired off a message to the Military Airlift Command.  The reply was disappointing.  I was told in no uncertain terms to keep the sighting quiet.  I was successful. In the 60s UFO sightings occurred to the extent of interfering with the mission. On December 17, 1969, the Secretary of the Air Force announced the termination of Project BLUE BOOK, the Air Force program for the investigation of UFOS. From 1947 to 1969, a total of 12, 618 sightings were reported to Project BLUE BOOK. Of these 701 remain ""Unidentified.""  The project was headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, whose personnel no longer receive, document or investigate UFO reports.  My report, kept quiet, is not included. I can recall that the only newspaper in Angra (CORREIO DOS ACORES) reported that two guards on duty at the highest point of the volcano island, a weather station, described their encounter with two aliens and their spaceship.  The aliens appeared clad in silvery attire. The guards said they were knocked unconscious by ray guns that streamed brilliant white beams.  Otherwise, they were not hurt.  The aliens were not diminutive, the guards said, but about 8 feet tall. Investigators found clear indentations in the volcanic soil presumedly caused by the circular space craft. I cannot vouch for the accuracy of my remembered descriptions.  It was 51 years ago.  The most expeditious source of accurate information is to contact the Angra newspaper.  The story and perhaps follow-up information should be in their archives. I found it intriguing that the Azorean waters is up to a thousand meters deep.  Good place to hide.  The fact that no other sightings were reported at the time in the vicinity of the remote Azorean Archipelago have caused me to wonder.

I was 13 years old at the time.  I went to fill the bathtub and get ready for school the next morning.  While filling the tub, I went to close the window shade. This was about 6:30 -7:00 in the evening and was still daylight outside.  As I looked out the window my attention was drawn to a metallic looking oval object in the distance, moving very slowly along from my left field of view toward the right.  From my location on Maple Avenue in Metuchen, I could see this object was gliding slowly above the train tracks, power lines and tree line that run parallel to what was then the Pearl Street parking lot.   I called for my mother downstairs to come and look.  At the same time another identical object appeared on the right, moving slowly left toward the other object.  They both slowly came to a stop in front of one another, then simultaneously shot straight up at such a speed that only streaks of light were visible - similar to the “hyperspace! ” effect now seen on Star Trek.  Both oval metallic looking objects had no other features that I could see, and I had a clear view.  My mother did not arrive in time to see what I was shouting about. I attended Franklin Junior High School in Metuchen at that time.  My homeroom teacher, who I believe lived in Union, posted a photo of the same image on the classroom bulletin board. He said he photographed it from his backyard which overlooked a reservoir.  I remember looking at it and seeing the date of August, which would have been a month after my sighting.  Years later I wrote him and left a phone message asking if I could have a copy of the photo, however I never received a reply. The only other possible related incident occurred when my parents' next door neighbor - a retired policeman - phoned them to come outside and look at an object above Campbell School which was the next street over.  I was at a friend’s house and my mother phoned me to come home right away. She said the round object moved back and forth in a sort of zig-zag motion then “took off”. This happened around the same time, but I don’t know the dates. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",,40.5411,-74.3632

Then, about one minute later, it shot over the ocean and into the sky very fast.  Then a group of jets flew over as if they were trying to follow the UFO.

In the early morning hours of August 8th, 1988, around 01:30, my friends and I were heading southbound on Interstate 79.  Because of the late hour and the lack of lighting on this stretch of road, it was difficult to see anything other than our headlights. On a stretch of dark road around exit 23 (Marianna/Prosperity), we saw a large circle/ball of light to the east that was shining a very bright beam of light all around:  over the ground and along the low hills.  We pulled over to the side of the road and one friend and I got out of the car to investigate.  (My other friend remained in the car, screaming.)  At first, it seemed like a search helicopter due to the fact that it could stand still in the air and sweep its light around.  However, we were surprised because there was no noise whatsoever. The other thing that confused us was that it seemed as if there were nothing behind it.  I’d compare it to seeing lights from a billboard and being able to detect the shape of the board beyond the lights.  There was no hint of any craft or body emitting the beam, even when it faced away from us. We finally got spooked when it slowly started working its way over toward us.  Before it could sweep its light over us, we jumped back into the car.  It never shone on us, but rather abruptly shot back eastward into the night sky and disappeared.  After we started driving again, the radio was first ‘static-y’ and then it auto-tuned to a stop.  We heard a commentator say “…further evidence that there is life on Mars…’ and then it went back to static.",2018-08-10T00:00:00,40.0512,-80.1577

I could see four round, port-hole windows on the bottom of each craft.  There was green light shining through each window like it was just the interior light and not a beam or external light.

They were completely silent.

I'm nearly 40 years old now.  I witnessed this craft when I was about 11 or 12.  I never told anyone and just recently found out about this reporting site. It was on or around July 4th early 1990's, I can't remember exact year.  We were at my house having a BBQ with many friends and family members.  We were all in the backyard(about 30 or 40 people).  Very clear skies.  From our NE to SE was visually wide open as there was a decline in elevation in that direction.  I estimate the field of view was easily from 020 TRUE to 160 TRUE. I was standing in the back of the at the food table facing South, and a friend of my father's was right in front of me.  This is when it happened. I first noticed a bright flash to my left (SE direction).  I first thought it was a reflection from a car mirror as it was driving past the front of our house, but oddly, when I looked there was no vehicle in sight coming from either direction.  This is when I saw it again, the flash was bright in the very distant SE sky.   Suddenly, before I could really process what was going on, a saucer shaped space craft zoomed in and appeared to hover from what I estimate to be about 30 feet above my basketball hoop at the east end of our driveway(so pretty close). I remember this in vivid detail.  This was a silver-ish flying saucer looking craft. Not quite chrome, but a lighter shade of silver.  The bottom half was bowl shaped, with a dome shaped module on top.  The dome shaped module was not quite the same circumference as the bottom half.  I remember seeing what looked like jet black port hole windows around the dome shaped area(about 3 windows).  I couldn't tell if the craft was spinning, but it was deathly silent.  Even the party seemed to be silent in my memory. Suddenly, just as fast as it appeared, it zipped off into a NE direction until out of sight.  I remember flashing back to reality and looking at the guy in line in front of me.  Him and I were facing the same direction and the look on his face let me know that he too had just saw what I saw, but we never spoke of it.  It seems as if no one else there had witnessed it either.  We just continued in line and got our food and went our separate ways. When I think back to this moment, it seems as if this all happened in about 1 or 2 seconds, but as I try to recall the event it just seems like much more time had passed.  How was I able to gather all that detail and feel like time was frozen as I observed this.  Who knows, maybe it was able to transplant some memories to me. As I grew older, I was fascinated with this topic.  I joined the US Navy as an Intel Analyst and have been around the world a few times, always searching for something more.  I can't go into detail because of classification issues, but the US Government, along with other countries, are well aware of these types of occurrences and have well documented files.  I have have tracked anomalies in real time...for example, once in the South China Sea,  I tracked an aerial contact from roughly 300 miles away come directly to our position at 220 knots, but simply disappear. Anyways, that's some of my experience and thought it'd be good to share it with you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2018-08-10T00:00:00,,

I was able to watch it for about 150 more yards ! (ground distance) before I lost sight of it.  Still there was no sound, nor variance in speed or formation.

One night, the ceiling started to shake, so I went running to my parents, thinking it was another earthquake.  At the time we used to get a lot of earthquakes during the day as many as 30 earthquakes during a single day, strong earthquakes that would topple the poorly constructed houses and it was said that the worlds end was near due to all of the earthquakes.   Now going back to the night of the incident we noticed that only the ceiling was rattling but the ground wasn’t shaking.  So we were baffled by this, all of a sudden we see a bright light through the window, the light was so intense that it looked like if the sun was out, but it was night time.   At the same time we can hear commotion going on outside, so we all ran outside.  When went outside we see the light right above our heads and indeed it looked like daytime.  Literally hundreds of people were witnessing this, some in panic or other like me and my family just looking at the light about 3 or 4 stories high above us.  Around it, we could clearly see the shape of the object which was rounded and only a humming sound we could hear, no wind or propulsion.  It stood there for at least 5 minutes just hovering and it suddenly took off upwards so fast that if you blinked you could of missed it and still no propulsion or wind.  We all went back to our houses and it was never talked about it ever again, we were so poor the only thing to talk about was about if we were gonna have food and all other things related to a dangerous poor area and the timing which the country was going through with the cocaine wars.   Also, the people were so poor, I’m sure no one had a camera to take pictures or maybe too scared but a lot of people witnessed this ufo.

This sighting happened during the summer and a few years after the passing of my father, which would put it in July or August of 1997.  I'm thinking it was August because my initial thought, when I saw this UFO, was that it must be a bundle of helium balloons that must have gotten away from someone at the Kentucky State Fair (KSF).  The KSF normally begins in mid August and last about eleven days.  The sighting happened about four miles to the east from the KSF, which would put it down wind.  I wanted to take a picture of it so I ran in our house and grabbed a 35mm disposable camera.  Fortunately, the object was still there when I got back, and I was able to get a photo of it. The object appeared to ""Boil"" in slow motion or constantly changed shape.  It continually drifted east as I watched it, and after a minute or two a jet airliner flew past and at that moment the object instantly vanished.  The closest thing I can compare it to was the ""Nellis AFB UFO"" video that's out there on YouTube.  The object seemed to be about 1,000 to 2,000 feet in altitude.   I'm starting to get older and just wanted to share this with the world.  I'm e-mailing a photo image called ""UFO1.jpg"".

We were both processing what we had just observed.  My father, with hesitation, asked, ""Did you just see that?"" ... I confirmed by suggesting it looked like the SR71. Though there were some clouds in the sky, we had a direct line of sight to the full moon.  The UFO passed swiftly, though, the pace was slow enough for a positive visual.  The UFO must have been enormous, as the object was larger than the moon from our position.  To put this in context, if a person were looking at the moon and used their hand to simulate moving an object past, an almond may relatively portray the size of the SR71/UFO - which, of course, was in space.

I climbed out of my car, I was facing North, and saw the Big Dipper sitting maybe 30 degrees above the horizon.  There was a very bright object hovering below the Dipper and it looked just like Venus does to the naked eye!  It was also clearly outside of the atmosphere!  The light I saw was probably reflected sunlight.  I looked back East and confirmed that Venus hadn't moved and then looked back at the object.  It suddenly started darting back and forth....as if the operator was getting the feel for the controls. The object then LEFT......REALLY.....REALLY FAST!  It left a light trail reminiscent of the Starship Enterprise without the rainbows!  It did not 'blink' out of sight, it just sped away and its trajectory, from my perspective looked like it was headed for Marek, the lower right star in the Dipper.  This is the event that convinced me 100% that interstellar travel IS possible and IS occurring!

I was traveling north on State Road 37 on the evening of March 21, 2005.  Beginning at about 8:35, I saw three dark red lights in the west three times over the course of fifteen minutes.  They were slightly above eye level, hazy around their circumference but roughly circular and about the size of taillights seen from ten car lengths away.  The distance between them was the same as their diameter.  They didn't form any obvious geometric shape.  Each time they disappeared, they did so quickly but not instantly; they didn't quite blink out, in other words.  I didn't hear anything unusual.  I wasn't sure if they were moving roughly with me or not moving at all. When I first saw the lights, I was about five miles south of the point where highways 37 and 13 merge.  The second time, I was about a mile from the spot where 37 crosses SP Street in southeastern Elwood.  When I saw them the third and last time, I was past Elwood, about a mile north of the 37/28 intersection.  The first sighting lasted about three seconds and was the longest of the three.

While an infantryman in the United States Army, I was on a combat deployment to the Maysan province of southern Iraq.  I do not remember the precise date, however, the incident in question happened during a counter IDF mission along the Iraq/Iran border at a time after midnight local time.   As a Humvee gunner, I was a part of a 3 vehicle convoy, consisting of two other gunner-mounted Humvees.  After positioning out vehicles and going blackout, meaning we turned off our vehicles and any sources of light & mounted our infrared sights to our weapons and ACHs, we began our mission of being prepared to respond to any enemy IDF towards our forward operating base.  This type of mission was typical of our overall mission while stationed at this FOB, and usually lasted between 2-3 hours.  We were planning on holding position for 3 hours. 	Shortly after blackout, I’m not positive exactly how long, but don’t believe it to be more than 20 minutes, I received communication via the headset radio from the forward most gunner, who was in front of my Humvee by a distance of 50 feet.  The lead gunner asked me if I had a visual of an airborne vehicle at one o’clock of his position, at an angle of 45 degrees to the horizontal, and at an unknown distance but believed to located on the Iranian side of the border.   I lifted my helmet-mounted infrared and tried to acquire the target with the naked eye, figuring it would be easy to acquire with the naked eye.  I could not locate it, which I communicated to the lead gunner.  He then advised me to use my infrared.   After deploying my infrared, I acquired a single target that was clearly airborne and giving off a strong reading on the infrared, which to me meant it was either using some type of infrared light source, or was giving off heat.   After affirming target acquisition, I had a! short conversation with the lead gunner about what it could be.  Considering the object’s slow movement, which seemed for the time being to be nearly or completely stationary, we speculated it to be a foreign helicopter, mainly because of the object’s position and our lack of knowledge of any friendly aircraft in the area.  We continued to observe. 	I could see that the object was clearly moving, although slightly in multiple directions.  I would describe it as a very disturbed, very unstable, very erratic type movement that seemed almost magnetic in nature.  Even though it seemed to be making constant, albeit very slight directional changes, it always returned to what appeared to be it’s original position.   Several minutes into observation, the object did appear to be closer than it originally appeared; now being visible at an angle closer to 55 degrees to the horizontal.  The object appeared to move to this newly observed distance, which given the intense darkness and no visible landmarks with which to gauge a distance, it was hard to determine its distance from us.  The object then seemed to hold position and become less erratic in it’s multidirectional movements. 	After seeming to stabilize, the object then began to make a very distinct aerial movement that was an obvious, almost figure eight pattern, although not quite.  Shortly after beginning this new movement pattern, the object seemingly seemed to divide into two separate objects.  Once there were two objects the movement pattern changed from a figure eight to a slow, coordinated movement.  They would start close together in a side-by-side position before moving away from each other a short distance before the left side object gained altitude, while in the same movement the right side object reduced altitude.  They then followed the same movement in reverse until they were back to the side-by-side position.  After returning the their starting position, they began the movement pattern yet again, this time both objects divided at the beginning of their movements, seeming to create two more objects.  This is the only moment of the event that I recall anymore radio chatter.   The lead gunner radioed to me and said, “Are you seeing this?”.  I simply replied, “I’m seeing it”.  The now four aerial objects fell right into the pattern of movement, back and forth, each of which dividing again and again until, from my perspective, filled a quarter hemisphere of the night’s sky.  At this point, there was an absolutely unknown number of the objects.  It appeared to be in the hundreds.  Their continuous and methodical movements seemed, from my perspective, to create a grid-like pattern in the sky.  Each object following the grid lines forwards and backwards in their coordinated movements. 	Once a quarter hemisphere of the night’s sky was completely filled with these dancing objects, they began to slowly fade.  Very slowly and at the same time for each object, their light became less and less visible to us.  The fading didn’t seem to take more than 3 minutes once it began before all objects were no longer visible.  During the entire ordeal, not a single object broke formation nor had an irregular movement to the other objects.  Including during the disappearing act. 	After the objects completely disappeared, the NCO in charge of the mission was clearly spooked by the event as much as the rest of us, as he decided to return to base at that moment.  Everyone else eagerly agreed after voicing our collective disbelief.   The sighting didn’t seem to last more than 20 minutes to any of us, though we were 40 minutes from our scheduled 3 hour mission timeline.  Nobody voiced concern about it, but we were clearly missing well over and hour and a half of time.  Our watches read the correct time, we just don’t remember getting to that time.  Whether that time was indeed lost or we were all just so mesmerized by what was happening that we didn’t notice how much time was passing,  I can’t be certain.  All I can be certain of is that nobody that was a part of the mission was eager to speak of it, as it went unreported by the NCO and wasn’t spoken of again, even between those of us who were there.	 	  As of writing this recounting, eight years after the fact, I’ve still not spoken to any of my fellow soldiers about the event, nor do I plan on it.  At the time, everyone was clearly eager to forget it ever happened.  I plan to respect that.  However, I can speak for myself and I’ve been more and more eager over the years to speak about it.  Still, even I haven’t spoken about to anyone other than my parents and one close friend of mine that is eager about the subject of UFOs and UFO sightings.   I will say now that I’ve grown increasingly interested into what exactly happened that night and have gone over it time and again in my head trying to make sense of it.  Given the loss of time, I am worried that there’s more to the story than even I can recall.   The biggest reason for that worry comes from the emotional response I have to attempting to recount the event to someone.  When trying to retell the story to my family and my closest friend,  I became emotionally unstable.  It was hard! for me to tell them what exactly happened without bringing myself to tears, as if the experience was indeed more traumatic than I remember.

One night I woke up in his spare bedroom, looked down towards my feet and noticed a black metallic sphere hovering a foot or so above the ground, perfectly elevated and very slowly and silently hovering in the direction of the mirror to my right.  To my left was a wall with a window.   I'm a very skeptical person, so at first glance I smiled at the thought of a flying black metallic ball in the room, rubbed my eyes, sat up, looked again and it was still in the room continuing in the same manner it had been when I first saw it. It had in fact moved the distance I would have expected it to considering its movement before I looked away to rub my eyes. It was roughly the size of a beach ball and had a smooth metallic surface. As my mind slowly came to accept that it might be real, I started trying to look for signs that it was in fact real.  I noticed the window to my left which had light illuminating from it was reflecting off of the surface of the object,  I noticed the object was obstructing the view of the chair that it was in front of and lastly I looked in the mirror that it was floating in the direction of and noticed that it had a reflection in the mirror.  At that moment, when I saw it had a reflection, I began to panic.  Stricken with fear, I closed my eyes and after a few moments, I looked back and the object was gone. I do not know what the object was or how long the object had been in the room prior to me waking up, but I get the impression it was observing me as I slept.  It gave me the impression that was it purposefully trying to remain unnoticed and discreet due to it's color, size, complete and utter silence and very slow movement.  There was enough light in the room where I'm 100% certain what I saw was a legitimate, real and solid object.  I could see everything in the room clearly and it seemed to obey with the laws of physics in terms of light reflecting off of it, blocking objects it hovered past and having a reflection.  I was not under any sort of sleep paralysis.  As I mentioned earlier, I sat up in my bed, rubbed my eyes and was perfectly awake.  I have never had a history of hallucinations, and I consider myself a very skeptical and rational person.

In this video they mentioned your organization – one which until tonight I was unaware of. Currently, I reside in a small Canadian town in rural Saskatchewan, but back in 2014, I was living and working in Lake Forest/Mission Viejo, California.  At this time, I was living in Lake Forest and commuting roughly 2 miles to work (A night shift job for Ralphs Supermarket) into Mission Viejo to the South. The UFO I saw was interesting, to say the least.  I’m quite familiar with the stories and videos of glowing orbs, cigar shaped and disc shaped objects, but what I witnessed did not fall into any of these categories. I cannot remember the exact date, but it was the latter part of summer in 2014 (I returned to Canada in October of 2014, and this event occurred about two months prior to that time.) at roughly 10:00 p.m.  The sky was clear on this evening, with little if any wind, and out of habit I was driving with both of my side windows rolled completely down. The Orange County Sheriffs made it a habit of parking their cars in some of the parking lots in and along Trabuco Road (Orange County) as part of their regular patrol duties, so I was always a bit more cautious when I saw their cars, and on this evening there were several in their usual places. As I was approaching the intersection of Trabuco Road at Alicia Parkway, and slowing to stop at the red light, a grid (or matrix) of electrical light appeared and was moving (flying) from behind me and to my right.  It was roughly 40 feet above the ground, traveling at about 25 mph, and moving in a Southeast direction.  As it moved there was a distinct sound of electrical discharge – similar to that given off by a downed power line.  The forward movement of this object was caused by what appeared to be a continuous reshaping, reappearing, and forward rotation of the grid’s lines of electrical light.  While the entire object never completely disappeared, some of the lines would but they were quickly replaced by one or more lines of similar length.  The thickness of the lines seemed to vary a bit – especially while they were forming. My first thought was (Wow) I need to get a better look at this!  But I was in a moving car and slowing for a red light.  (And I did not need to be ticketed, much less arrested for telling the police a story they would never believe!)  I was almost at a stop, when the light turned green, so I proceeded into (and driving through) the intersection at Trabuco Road and Alicia Parkway.  The Ralphs (now closed) was on the southeast side of the intersection in a large strip mall.  As I proceeded through the intersection I noticed that there was a grid or matrix of light moving up, down, and around the street light post on the Southeast corner of the intersection.  It changed colors as it did this, alternating from red to green to amber, but not necessarily in that order. Anyway, when I got into the parking lot, I hurriedly drove over to and parked in the closest stall nearest this corner and got out of my car.  I approached the street light post with some trepidation, but I guess curiosity overcame my fear.  Unfortunately there was nothing to observe!  This entire even last about three minutes, but due to the circumstances involved, I was only able to view this object (as it flew) for about 5 to 6 seconds, and less than that as it affixed itself to the street light post. Yes, I read the part about Hoaxed and Joke reports.  And, no this is neither.  I am not now, nor have I ever been associated with the military (in the US or Canada).  I am just a common man who has worked any job I can get in order to support myself.  I am a dual citizen, and I was in California for two years after completing a bankruptcy here in Canada.  I hold a Class 1 license now, for which I had to pass a comprehensive physical exam.  I have also passed at least one Criminal Background Check here in Canada for a former job with Pepsico.  Those who know me would say I’m of rational mind and fairly logical.  So I would not take the time to write all of this in order for you to simply discard it, and I hope you don’t. I would have reported this sooner had I known where and who to report it to, but I still see it as worthwhile, and I hope you agree. Thank you for your time!

This event occurred at 0308 hrs, 20 November, 2016 in Victoria, Texas.  I saw an object in the moonless sky that was not a legacy saucer shape nor was it metallic, or have lights.  This object was organic, fleshy, and ‘seemed’ to be several miles long. The object described above was traveling from ESE to WNW.  My field of vision was 30% blocked by a tree to the east, I was facing south, and the object came into view over the tree. It took about 5 seconds to traverse my vision field to the westerly horizon.  But before doing so it changed direction by about 15 deg to the NW, and within 1 second my LOS was blocked by a neighbor’s rooftop. The object was estimated to be at or above earth’s atmosphere.  From my point of view, the object was approximately 4 inches long, if you able to measure it with a ruler.  Morning astronomical twilight was 0601 hrs, and sunrise was going to be near 0727 hrs on this date.  Moonrise was going to be near 2257 hrs, which places it underfoot.  The bottom of the object was reflecting light from the approaching sunrise.  The color range was from ‘pony tail badge’ to ‘pastel yellow’.  The estimated position (near edge of atmosphere) and length (several miles long) was calculated by the angle which light might hit an object at 300 miles ASL, estimated sunrise, trajectory (speeding away from sunrise), and it’s actual length perceived (4” long). The object can be described in this way:  Its dimension was 10 units long, 1 unit wide, and 0.1 unit thick.  Its horizontal axis was along its length. Shape was not unlike a colored crepe paper streamer when twisted like a double helix, DNA strand. It was almost certainly translucent. I could see through it. If it were not for the sun’s illumination I would not have seen it. It was ‘ribbed’ across it’s width. The ribs were narrow, rounded, and approximately 0.25 units thick. I would estimate that there were 25 ribs spaced evenly across a 10 unit length. The object rotated slowly on its horizon axis and looked like the above mentioned streamer if thrown into the air.",2018-08-10T00:00:00,28.853642285714283,-96.9943577142857

This happened way back in 1995 and is pretty much the same story as a previous sighting post, for the exception of a few things.   It was early evening I was sitting on the tailgate of my truck talking to my neighbor and I happened to glance up and see a very shiny aircraft not sure how high or how far away but seemed typical for conventional air craft.  I was facing northeast as the sun was going down behind me the metallic surface reflected the sunlight like a mirror which probably alerted me that something was different about this craft.  I continued to listen to her but was more interested in what I was seeing and started asking myself is this a conventional aircraft?  And then started asking her these questions:  Do hear any engine?  Do you see any strobe lights?  Do you see any wings or rudder?   I stood up and started walking down my driveway and her Answers were no to all three as we walked together.  Then I noticed an elderly man walking slowly looking at the same object and he stopped at the end of my driveway as if to wait for us.  So all three of us were watching as it slowly turned north to Waco and I thought I would surely see a wingtip as it banked, but did not.   Then something extraordinary happened it stopped dead still and a strange bubble of cloud surrounded it ,it reminded me of when a nuke is detonated and vaporizes the atmosphere out ahead of the explosion and then a flash of light blinded us, but I quickly shook it off to look back to see a green dot with a tracer heading north where it had been.  One of us said WOW that was weird,the old man said  Ya! I'm a retired Air force etc... and I've never seen anything like that and it is physically impossible for anyone to withstand that amount of gravitational force.I'm not sure what happened after that as we all went our separate ways, but minutes later as I was turning on the television when I heard the sound of copters getting louder and louder and louder!   I ripped open the back door to see Three flat black attack copters with clusters of white missiles attached to the bottom flying so low that I could see there helmets like a little closer than at an air show but not close enough to feel rotor wash.  They were hauling tail as they headed from south to north.  I was so excited I wanted to join the chase like Roy in ""Close Encounters"" but knew it was futile.  I never witnessed the fighter jets but that confirmed it for me.",2018-10-25T00:00:00,31.4507,-97.1909

I merged on TX 71 West from Interstate-10 in Columbus, Texas.  About 20 miles down TX 71 West, I noticed what I thought was an airplane about 30-50k feet up, with blue glowing beacon lights.  Even back then, when I was 18 years old, I knew that no airplane (to my knowledge) had glowing blue lights.  I pointed this out to my friend (also 18 then) and we were watching the light move across the sky like an airplane, as I explained to him for about two minutes how planes don't have blue lights and I wonder if it's military etc; it's hard to describe this how I saw it; so bare with me.  The light was  moving slowly across the sky like a plane - very normal, then in 1 second it shot off at light speed into the sky - - NOT across the sky into the horizon, I mean in to the clouds directly away from the ground, the way it zipped off, I have and never will see anything like it again. That object zipped away so fast, like a movie, I think about it all the time up to this day, and nobody believes us.  It was not a comet, I see those weekly when I am in Texas.  I investigated all the Texas July 2011 reports and nobody has reported this, even though somebody near Columbus, TX, HAD to have seen it. The only color I saw was blue, and the craft was not close to the ground.  This was at 1am with good visibility.  Whatever this light was, it left the Earth at light speed.

I looked out front and the back windows and there was nothing outside.  That's when I realized it was coming from inside my townhouse.  And the light was emanating white beams that began to  speed up violently...  Then it got faster and faster and faster and my chandelier was shaking and then it was gone.

I was working with another person on the roof of the Royale Towers Condominiums B building making sure that the AC units were secured to the roof racks because of bad weather.  While securing a AC unit I looked out over the retention wall towards the east and saw what I at first thought was a balloon.  I thought to myself who would be foolish enough to let their kid bring a balloon to the beach on such a windy day.  I walked over to the look over the wall and down on the beach.  There was no one on the beach.  I looked back at the ""balloon"" and realized it had gotten bigger and wasn't over the beach at all, but much further out over the ocean and was coming into shore. I called my coworker over and pointed the object out and we began bouncing ideas off each other as to what it could be as it slowly flew in to shore.  It was a very overcast day with a strong wind blowing from west to east out to sea and the object was going straight into the headwind with no apparent effort.  I estimate the speed to be roughly 15-20mph.  The object appeared to be on a definite trajectory and was unaffected by wind. As it drew closer to shore, its actual shape became more identifiable.  It was almond shaped but thicker than an almond, almost round in the center.  It was silver metalic, the color of an unpolished spoon.  It was flying in very low.  The condominium I worked for was 8 stories high. As the object came ashore it was just higher than our position on the roof, but did not appear to be higher than the Cape Royal office building located next to our condo which is a 10 story building. The object passed to our south less than a block away.  It appeared to pass directly over the Cocoa Beach Hilton.  As it passed we got our best look at it.  I estimate its size to be 25-30ft long.  It was totally silent.  There were no seams or rivets, ports or windows of any kind. There were no visible markings.  It almost looked like a drop of liquid metal.  The object was silent, but the air around it was disturbed.  The air about 1-2ft around the entire object was distorted much like the mirage effect created on a hot asphalt road. We watched the object move past us and continue towards the mainland never changing course or speed.  It continued on over Merrit Island and as it approached the mainland it suddenly decreased in size until it was gone like it blinked out of exhistance.  I believe that it zipped off at such an incredible speed that it caused that effect from the perspective that we were viewing it at the time.  Again, there was no sound, no sonic boom.

I work in southern Iraq.  I am assigned to a small camp there as support for various Exxon Management personnel.  First of all, let me tell you, I am a sceptic for any of this, but open minded.  I have a an extreme level of competency and common sense.  I am not easily fooled. I don't remember exact dates, but it was about this time last year.  I walked out of my modular building to got to dinner.  It was dark out.  When I turned to lock the door, I looked up to the west and noticed a bright object headed right towards us.  It was up about 25-30 degree above horizon.  There were no visible clouds in the sky.  There were NO planes I could hear and NO plane lights visible in the sky. The object immediately didn't feel right- I had a sense of dread in my gut because it was not anything recognizable.  It was like a rolling white cloud with a bright white headlight beaming directly ahead of it.  But it produced its own white cloud that was in front and around it rolling or billowing over as the object flew towards our camp. I did no see any tail or wings.  I did not see any tail or wing lights.  This is part of why it seemed unearthly.  It was actually frightening because it was headed down towards us about 1-2 miles away. It was very distinct- meaning not fuzzy or unclear.  It was clear and obvious, but not normal.  (Made no sound at) all  I was actually kind of afraid and began running to get help when another person walked by me outside and I said ""look at that thing up there in the Sky""  He is a engineer and he looked and said, ""What is that?""  Just then the light went out, but the cloud that was rolling in the sky kept moving and turned south.  So now I was witnessing a white cloud about the size of a large aircraft moving across the sky with nothing around it.  We could see the cloud do to to regional surface lighting.  This cloud was about 500-1000 ft above the ground, moving about 100 miles/hr southwards.  There was NO WIND and no other clouds in the vicinity.  It was not normal.  I was shaken.   I consider myself a smart guy, but this was unworldly.  I told someone at dinner- a retired military guy here.

UFO leaves Earth through black hole portal.,Seaside,OR,2018-07-05T21:00:00,circle,5 minutes,"Occurred : 7/5/2018 21:00  (Entered as : 07/05/2018 21:00) Reported: 11/18/2018 1:43:53 PM 13:43 Posted: 11/24/2018 Location: Seaside, OR Shape: Circle Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/143/S143822.html,"UFO leaves earth through black hole portal. Seaside Oregon July 5 2018, just before sunset I was at the Holiday Inn on the balcony taking pictures, it was a very photogenic day.   I noticed the sun was getting low in the sky and started getting my camera ready for a sunset.  As I looked through my camera, I saw a strange cloud low in the sky.   I had a mid-range zoom on the camera and zoomed in to look at the cloud.  I couldn’t believe my eyes!  In this cloud was a craft, clearly.   I took 2 photos of it and my settings were not getting the picture, see photo 1187.  Next to me on a table was my 300mm zoom.  I made the decision to go for the swap.  As I took the lens off, while keeping my eye on the cloud, the craft move out and away, up and right slightly.  Its movement was direct and smooth, it quietly and gracefully moved faster as it went, as it was getting smaller, due to moving away, suddenly it appeared to loop straight back on itself,  so for a moment I thought is was coming back and now had a very strange bright light on it.  Then I realized it had opened a portal- black hole and it was leaving.  The size of the portal was not much bigger than the craft.  This all took only seconds.   I reached for the 300mm lens, snapped it on and started shooting.  The first pics are of the UFO shaped cloud left by the craft and the black hole.  The black hole only shows up as a small strange cloud, although it was black in reality.  I was just amazed and disappointed in the photos and accidently deleted the second shot I took before changing lenses. Since then, I have poured over the photos and now realize, I really have something!  I may be the first and or only one to see this and photograph it.  Some of the photos are very high quality.  Nikon DX 5300 camera.  The UFO shaped cloud left by the craft dissipated in about 40 seconds and that is shown in the photo sequence.   I continued to shoot until it was gone.  On 11-14-18, I was looking at the time of the photos.  The time is not correct but it shows the rate I was shooting.  The photos numbered 1190, 1191 have a 4 minute 20 second gap.  I am positive I never stopped taking pictures for more than 20 seconds or so.     Then it occurred to me that the strange clouds that appeared next  (photo 1191) are part of the black hole and are measurable ( the distance stays the same from the gate to the clouds), consistent (there seems to be and energy making a twist) that stays  and then go away at the closing of the gate. 1.	  I have photos of a black hole, from a known fixed position with possible measurable data, which could locate the position of the gate.  The photos also show an effect from the gate starting with photo 1191, that affect seems to cause me too loose over 4 minutes.  The distance between the gate and weird cloud remains exactly the same distance until it closes.  It is my opinion that the ship was waiting for the gate.   Otherwise why would they risk this exposure?  2.	  What I witnessed in the gate is fairly interesting.  The light was like no other light I have seen, it is hard to describe.  But it was long and spikey, like a photo of star light but the spikes were bending and coming back to the gate.  Very bright and long spikes!  Photo 1188, when zoomed in shows the spikes.  The gate seemed straight at first and then after a while it curved left and the craft went left in the tube.  How I could see all of this is mysterious in itself.  How my camera didn’t get what I was seeing is disappointing. 3.	  The size of the craft was large, I am only guessing at 300 ft. in diameter.  Shiny and glistened in the sun.  But of a dark color, not bright and shiny like aluminum.   Deep enough for at least 2 decks.  Ironically no good photos of the craft.  Had I captured all of what I saw, this would have been one of the biggest UFO events in history. 4.	  I have forensically looked through all photos taken before the event.  All those being to the left of the place where I spotted the craft.  There are 2 possible UFO’s in photos 1138 and 1144 and I have a sequence of 5 photos showing 2 clouds dropping out of a larger cloud and moving right in the pictures, photos 1147 through 1154 on the right side above the tree and left.   Those might be clouds but they are going the right way and the craft was in a cloud so I included them. 5.	  There must have been a lot of people with cameras that day and many of those people may not know they have photos of this event. 6.	  Below is the basic shape, it was ugly enough to make me wonder if it was one of ours.

They were not in a symmetrical pattern, but they did stay in formation.   At first glance I thought it was a group of balloons that somebody released, because even though the UFO’s were traveling in a straight path, they had the appearance of floating through the sky like balloons or bubbles.  I say they were bubble-like because when I was looking at them, they were traveling in a straight-line trajectory, but they seemed to each individually be floating like bubbles with a small wobble.  The UFO’s were round and white and did appear to have a reflective surface but there were no visible lights or changing of colors.

I recorded the UFO’s with my G9 Samsung phone and was able to capture about 30 seconds of quality footage.

On January 4th, 2018, my husband and I were on a private jet flying from Seattle, Washington to Lakeland, Florida.  There were four people on the flight, the pilot, the co-pilot, my husband and myself.  There were multiple small screens in the cabin that showed a map of the U.S., the planes location, flight path, altitude and air speed.   About 1:00 pm we were flying over Wyoming.  Our altitude was 45,000 ft and air speed was around 520 mph.  The sky was a crystal clear blue and we were the only thing in the sky that was visible.  I was sitting in my seat on the left hand side of the plane looking out of the window when something to my upper left hand side field of vision caught my eye.   Sitting there, just as plain as day, was an absolutely enormous craft of some kind.  It was a dark dull grey in color, disc shaped with a dome on top and underneath.  The domes were almost as tall as the craft was wide.  I remember thinking that it looked rather “clumsy”.  It appeared to be motionless with no apparent lights, exhaust or gasses.  Again, I want to emphasize the size of the thing.  Allowing for a distance of 3 to 4 miles from us it must have been at least 2 football fields wide and almost the same in height.  Once again, I must emphasize how completely out of place it looked.  Beautiful light blue sky all the way to the horizon, and then this “thing” just hanging there in the sky.  Try to imagine if you tied two battleships together, squished them into the shape I described, and hung it up in the middle of the sky at 55,000 feet!  I called my husband to hurry over and have a look.  We both stared at it speechless for about a minute absolutely transfixed.   He then rushed up to the flight deck and told the pilot and co-pilot to come and look.  There we all were, dumbstruck looking out of the plane’s windows at something that looked totally foreign and out of place.  We asked if they knew what it might be or if they had ever seen anything remotely like it before.  Keep in mind, these were two seasoned experienced pilots who had flown for a very respectable company for many years.  They said they had absolutely no idea what it was and that they had never seen anything like it before.  We all continued to watch it as our plane passed underneath it and eventually left it behind.   The rest of the flight was uneventful.  Oh, we did ask the pilots if they were going to report seeing the craft and they said absolutely not.  More than their jobs were worth I guess.

More like a subtle glow emitted from a hundred little lights covering the surface.  It looked as though you could see the night sky in between the small lights.  Almost like a faint constellation floating across the sky.   There were airplanes in the sky going from West to East towards the airport.  The UFO looked like it was at a lower altitude than the planes.  I would guess that it was maybe 20 feet across, but hard to tell since I don't know how far away it was.  Even though it was moving in a steady straight line, it seemed almost organic (but I can't figure out why it 'felt' that way.

On Thursday 18th of October 2018 between 18:15 and 18:40 Hawai’ian Time. I had just collected mail from our box and was walking back to our cottage, in Makawao, when I saw a bright, neon green light in the sky toward the southern side of the West Maui Mountains.  The light was stationary above the line of broken banana palms at the rear of our house and above (what I estimate) the position of the wind farm on the flank of the mountains. I went inside and obtained my binoculars and observed the light, which was still in the same position.  Through the binoculars I observed the light to be two lights touching.  I returned indoors and acquired a telephone and tried to contact my friend who lived farther up Haleakela, in Kula.  Unable to reach him I contacted his wife.  She went outside to see if she could see the light from her higher elevation. As I spoke with her I observed the light move to a lower altitude, bringing it in line with the palms.  The light remained stationary in this lower position for a couple of minutes before moving southward over, roughly, the channel between Maui and Lana’i.  Within seconds, it changed course and moved in a curving upward arc northwards toward Wailuku and stopped approximately above the valley, maybe a little southward of, Waikapu. The light remained stationary against a deep purple-black cloud, which made the green even more intense, for a number of seconds before it began moving to a lower altitude northward toward Wailuku and disappeared behind the branches of an avocado tree. Just as I was informing my friend that it had disappeared, the light returned on a southerly course back toward the channel.  The light then reversed course, gained a little in altitude and headed toward Wailuku once more.  This time it did not return. I was on the telephone with my friend the entire time describing the maneuvers; unfortunately she did not see it. The light moved slowly most of the time, slower than the tour helicopters that fly over the valley between Haleakela and the West Maui Mountains. I do not think it was a helicopter due to the lateness of the day and because it was at different points so stationary in the sky. Just after the light moved off to the north towards Wailuku I observed the strobe red light of an aeroplane moving from north to south from Kahului airport.",2018-10-25T00:00:00,20.8451,-156.3087

The object was almost completely translucent, silent, and moved swiftly.  I first noticed the object from about 30 degrees north/north eastern the it moved in a slight curve almost straight south kind of to the west, the only reason i saw the object at all was because in the front of where it was moving there was a smokey kind of mist that outlined its front shape kind of resembling a half moon or crescent, the mist was able to be spotted because the bright moonlight illuminated the mist in front (maybe high altitude ice crystals or air cold air displacement was being reflected by the moonlight).  the strange thing was Im in a flight path between the orlando international airport and the sandford international airport, and planes are constantly coming to and fro. when it happened to pass by the sky was almost completely clear of air traffic.  As it moved it cleared the whole horizon in about 7 seconds and disappeared into the southern horizon.  As it flew over, the street lights got really bright for about a couple seconds as it was directly over then the street lights turned almost purple in color.  it was too dark to record video.  I feel as it might have been military because the cloaking was imperfect you could still make out the shape in the sky if you looked hard enough, like the cloaking was reflecting the light around it.  The object had to be at last 5 football fields in circumference if not a mile.  After it passed air traffic resumed about 10- 20 seconds later i started seeing planes again.  Friday 11:05 pm winter springs fl. the night before i saw something move from south to north i thought it was plane that might have turned its front lights out because it went dark, then started flickering lights, then disappeared in the night sky about midway above the horizon. around 11 pm",2018-10-25T00:00:00,28.6812,-81.2763

Triangle UFO Sighting Over Austin Area.  LIT UP TRIANGLE UFO OVER AUSTIN TEXAS 2018.  Triangle UFOs have been common in Texas and the US for several years now, but there does appear to be a big uptick in reports right now in Texas.  In Lubbock on June 3rd, a fast-moving triangle UFO was reported to NUFORC.  And now a large triangle craft with white, blue and green lights over Austin has been reported to MUFON (case 92594): Witnessed after dropping my husband off at the Austin Airport.  It was less than 5 minutes after leaving the airport & it was less than a mile away in a field or neighborhood right off the highway.  It was 5:08 a.m. and it was right at t! he tree tops. It moved very slowly forward for the first few seconds with either mist or some sort of clouds surrounding it.  At first I thought it was a plane, but then I noticed it had quit moving and was literally just hovering over the trees.  There were other cars driving in the same direction as me and I would assume they had to have seen it too.  It was HUGE & shaped like a triangular boomerang object with large circular spaced out white lights at the front of the craft and blue/green/white lights at the rear.  My husband called me at 5:09 while I was witnessing it and driving, so I was not able to film or capture an image.  I told my husband what I was witnessing and he didnt believe me at first, but he could hear in my voice that I was not making this up.  While I was describing it to him the left side of my face, the small of my back and the back of my thighs all started to feel hot.  I had my a/c on in the car and it was around 75 degrees outside.  I at first thought we must have! accidentally turned on the heater in the seats, but i checked and that was not the case.  It never flew off during that 1-2 minutes time period, but I drove out of it's view.  I am still in shock that I saw a UFO and even more shocked that I saw it so close up.  ""HUGE"" triangle craft ""quit moving and was literally just hovering"" - UFO Seen in Austin. recent triangle UFO sighting.  LOOKS LIKE A REAL UFO OVER TEXAS, AUSTIN 2018. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pkgZ8YU4iY   And another one...Looks like they have moved North and East...Whatever it is... ""Witness statement as follows: I was driving to go pick up somebody in downtown OKC and I spotted on object to my left floating over some buildings. I didn’t get a great video of the first one but I kept driving and saw a second one directly in front of me, which is the video that I have attached in here. It was a triangular object with lights all the way around, first hovering and then slowly taking a westward flight path. Very slow movement. Lights never wavered. Could definitely tell it was completely triangular from the lights. I have seen something before but not like this and so close. Thought it was crazy as hell. I lost sight because I was driving and recording but I didn’t stop as I was on the interstate.

Looked extremely wide/long from our view. The light's rate of blinking sort of looks like normal aircraft.  Only there were 3 lights, and all 3 lights moved together, and their blinking pattern was synced up as if highlighting a single shape.  Unclear if disc/chevron/whatever. If it was 3 helicopters, they did a really good job going at the same speed in the same direction, really really slow.  I've seen normal helicopters flying over my house before.  Lights look different, and I can hear the engines. Only other simplified guess I can make is some kids tied 3 drones together with a really really long fishing line.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was more than 1 to 3 miles long.  I'm no pilot or anything.

Our camp site is located on the Skagit River, about 400 feet from the river and in mostly old growth forest.  I have been camping at this location for 8+ years and at this campground for 25+ years and have never seen anything strange at night.  We turned off all light sources and no one else was camping nearby.  Our fire was out when we went to bed. I was awakened by my young daughter sleeping next to me inside our large tent, who was having a bad dream.  I noticed what appeared to be a bright moon beam hitting the top of out tent, but as it turned out, this was a night of a new moon (no visible moon).  I turned around and then noticed white lights projected onto the outside of our tent, dancing near the roof of the tent.  I could see leaf silhouettes from a nearby tree outside our tent.  The overall effect of the projected lights was that it appeared to be fire-like, moving quickly and morphing rapidly into various wispy shapes.  The color of the lights was white interspersed with light yellow. I had the impression that somehow my camp fire had reignited and was casting shadows on our tent, but the height of the shadows and angle of the leaf silhouettes was too high to be such a reflection.  After a minute the lights changed to two horizontal rows projected onto the outside of the tent, near the top of the tent wall where it meets the roof.  These rows were about 4 feet long and 8 inches high, and extended past the edge of the tent.  The rows were comprised of many rectangles (maybe 5 inches x 8 inches) with diffuse edges.  I also noticed that other lights were projected onto the roof of the tent but I could not see any details since the dark maroon-red rain fly was covering the roof. I had two ear plugs in that I then removed to check for noise, but the forest was extremely quiet and I could hear nothing.  I examined the light projections closely and noticed that the rectangles were moving and overlapping each other, and each rectangle was a slightly different hue.  The rectangle edges were rapidly moving and they appeared to be comprised of hundreds of frantically moving vertical lines, when I examined them for several seconds. The lights then grew dim and stopped two or three times before coming back brighter and with additional rectangles extending up to three feet below the two horizontal rows.  After another minute or two I climbed completely out of the sleeping bag and kneeled in the middle of the tent, waiting for some sort of escalation or attack.  I did not wake up my wife or two young kids since I did not want them to see the lights and be scared.  I thought about unzipping the front door of the tent and looking outside but this is where the lights were coming from and I feared that doing so might escalate things in a negative way. As my daughter continued in a sleep-walking state and began whining and climbing toward the bottom of the sleeping bag, as if to get away from the lights (which later she said she never saw), the lights suddenly stopped and went pitch black. Then they started up again for a few seconds and stopped, and did this once or twice more before suddenly ending. Within a few seconds my daughter then woke up and announced she needed to go to the bathroom outside. I was afraid to go outside so soon after this incident, but grabbed a flashlight and took her outside and behind the tent. I searched the sky, trees and area with the bright LED flashlight but noticed nothing unusual. The sky was amazingly clear and many stars were visible. I also noticed that our fire had somehow reignited and a small flame was leaping out of a log and creating a strobe effect, which was visible well above our camp site since the light from the fire could be seen across the bottom of the old growth canopy.  This fire-like strobe effect was one of the images projected on the tent wall when the lights first began. I had the strange feeling that we were visited by something that resembled an animal that was scouting up and down the river for something.  However, this ""animal"" somehow emitted lights with patterns.  The animal may have seen the strobe effect from our fire and came down for a better look.  This is just my impression. We did camp in the same location for the next 5 nights, without anyone noticing the lights again. I did examine this situation for the possibility of a drone prank, but the old growth canopy would have been very difficult to navigate and the incident happened in the middle of the night.  I checked with a few trusted local sources and no one had ever heard of drones in the area, or of similar incidents. Please note that there have been several big foot sightings in this same area, and that an old Native American Indian burial ground resides in the area of our camp site, though the exact location is still unknown.  We have installed a game camera to capture video or photos, in case the lights return.",2018-08-10T00:00:00,,

Notice a orange round disk lowering into the woods about five Kms ahead from where I was driving continue to drive to see if I could get a closer look.  When I got close to where the orange glow was in the woods it went out thinking it was gone I decided to walk into the woods.  About 230 feet in, I was shocked to see this round disk frozen in my tracks a door open still frozen in which I though I was fraiden of nothing in my life a voice came into my head and it said we are here to hurt you.  Again still frozen in my tracks I did not know where this voice was coming from, I was looking at this being not sure to make of it and it's mouth was not moving.  it said they had trouble with their ship and need my help.  They needed if few items in which I had to get.  No not gas or oil it was electric items my pretty sure it was the lithium battery's they were looking for.  I did get these items for them and was asked not to say anything to anyone.  Before picking up these items for them I thought I was day dreaming this I saw my self driving away not thinking I was going to do this.  Again the voice appear in my head even being a nice distance away.  We need your help I could not bring my self to tell my wife thinking she might think I lost my mine.  After dropping off the items they needed they spent sum time working on their craft.  They were there for five days not working on the craft but was waiting for lightening to charge their craft.  They ask me again not to say anything who was going to believe me anyway. I went there three times to see if they had left but was still there.  The voice in my head said no need to come where we are it would be more safer if I stayed away.  They said I would know when they were leaving and I did.  On July 29, I was outside having a smoke looking at the sky still not believing what had happen was real a wave like hum sound was over my head it was them.  They sayed they was really glad I was there to help and that if there anything they do for me.  The only thing that came into my head was to go for a ride in there ship why I don't know.  They said that they could do that but it would be for another time because there was very important things they had to do and would explain later.  For a guy who was frozen shitless is now at peace with these beings.  As they were there they was gone not knowing when they will return I will be waiting and I have a lot of questions I have to ask whether I go in outer space or just in their ship I will know what is out there something no one knows.  Until then I had to share this believe me or not this was real.  I will share my story went they return and what I learn.

UFO occurrence  Tonight, around 10:55 pm, I saw a strange dark object gliding in the sky.  It had no lights what so ever. I live in the suburbs of a large city several miles away.  There is some light distraction causing the inability to see all the stars, typical.  There were thin and high altitude clouds moving across about a 3 quarter moon.  I could still see the moon brightly through the thin layer of clouds creating a silhouette of sorts.  I often look up to Southern sky in an opening space of 70 feet or so, between some tall pines. As I looked up to see the moon, I also noticed how fast the clouds were moving, mostly from West to East.  I was only gazing up for about 15 to 20 seconds, when very quickly, small shadow type object, moved East to West just below the moon.  I only saw it for about 4 to 5 seconds.  It was the oddest thing.  It no lights on it at all.  And probably, I would’ve notice it at all if it did not fly across the lower and bright silhouette of the moon.  It actually took about 20 seconds for me register in my mind what I actually saw or didn’t see. There is a busy airport several miles away and often I see high airplane traffic.  I also use to practically live under a landing line of an airport for years.  I know the difference between an airplane at night or something else.  This was definitely something else. To summarize, I saw a small dark or shadow type object, moving east to west.  It appeared to be high in the sky as a solid object.  I could not differentiate whether the object was above or below the thin fast moving clouds.  Perhaps, the only reason I saw it, was by the light of the moon.  The object was probably only 1/32 the size of the moon.  Considering the short period of time, I viewed the object, I can recall it being the shape of a laid-down fat-in-middle cigar with a small fin on top and bottom of the back-end and not a long object.",2018-10-25T00:00:00,33.95629913473424,-84.01987614338691

My first thought was possibly a spotlight from a nearby airport hitting a cloud but the objects were still visible as they moved away from the cloud and against the clear starlit sky.  They then disappeared behind the next cloud.   I waited several minutes but the objects never reappeared and no spotlights were in use at that time which eliminates that theory.,2018-10-25T00:00:00,29.540924999999998,-81.20838511904762

The evening was cold  at  49 degrees and it was a waxing crescent moon large in the sky with no clouds to block the views, I could see the stars very well…and Mars also I believe.  I look to my right while driving on Kuebler Ave., heading south, and I saw a silver (dark silver) disk hovering to my right over some large trees in the distance, about a quarter of a mile from me. The saucer type craft  was spinning while hovering mid air.  There were I believe 8 lights around the outside of the disk; red, green and white.  Lights also on the bottom which were white.  I was approaching Battle Creek  Rd. and it started to go straight up then head off towards Fairview Ave. where a lot of businesses and manufacturing plants are located.  I decided to follow it, so I turned right on Battle Creek Rd. I lost sight of it for about 30 seconds then it reappeared.  I pulled to the side of the road and took a few pictures and a video.  The craft made no sound at all.  It would dip down low like it was landing, then I would look far away only to see it back up and further than I would think it could make it in just a few seconds. I felt as if I was playing a game of cat and mouse with it for 10 or so more minutes before  thinking about heading home, my two daughters are in the car with me and I needed to get them home.  It was strange there seemed to be no other cars around just us and this UFO.  I then noticed a second disk shaped hovering craft, identical to the one I saw at first, and it was hovering over a large business.  It was truly an awesome sight.

Huge round/oval object, many attached lights, no sound, very slow moving night time sighting. This possible sighting occurred many years ago (almost 60 years now).  But in all that time I have never forgotten it.  I have only spoken of it a few times since it took place in my home town of Fitchburg, Mass.  The specific area of the city known to locals as Cleghorn.  The actual spot was at the approximate corner of Chester street and St. Andrews street.  Two of us were walking toward a park/pond (the pond is gone now) known as Parkhill Park, which was several block away. The essentials are as follows:  In mid-fall of 1959, a friend and I were walking home from a boy scout meeting held at a local church hall.  It was dark, the weather was clear and stars were visible.  The time was between 1930 and 2030 hours.  Why we both suddenly looked up I cannot remember, but we both saw what at first appeared to be a grouping of small stars moving very slowly in unison toward our location from the direction of the park, above the tree line.  As this grouping of lights came closer it gave us the sense that these were not stars but lights attached to something very dark which we could not make out all.  Whatever it was, it was huge.  The sense I got was of either a round or oval shape to which all these lights were attached.  These were white lights like the stars, they did not blink or change color.  This 'object (s)' completely blocked out the stars/sky as it came over our heads.  This was a slow moving object, smoothly gliding/floating in a straight direct! ion, not bobbing or meandering, moving straight.  We had stopped walking by this time.  It was completely silent, no noise and eerily no other sounds either (this was and still is a pretty settled neighborhood).  As it passed over us it also passed over a 3 story building (what we referred to as a triple decker-a sort of tenement house if you will) we were standing next to.  We lost sight of it as it went over the building and so we quickly ran around the corner of the building to get another view of it, but in the several seconds it took us to run to the point where we could get a clear view, it was gone, completely gone.  We were so scared, we both ran home as fast as we could.  I never told my parents about it and never spoke to my friend about it either.  Unfortunately as so much time has passed,  I lost touch with this boyhood friend many, many years ago, but to this day, I have not forgotten about it.

I was doing the backyard thing, grilling, approximately 6 PM, evening, sunny, blue skies, 80 degrees, when, out of the corner of my eye, I notice three orange balls of light approaching over my shoulder.  These things weren’t little paper lanterns, you know, like the ones that you guys keep reporting on.  These lights weren’t that stuff drifting way up there in the sky. Nothing like that, these suckers were big, okay, easily 50 feet in diameter, and they’re making their way slowly past me.  I don’t know, maybe three or four hundred feet above me and off to my left. And I was thinking, shit, these things are for real.  No sound, perfectly quiet, and they had this majestic, almost stately, quality about them.  So I’m calling my wife, you know, because she’s gotta come out and see this, and I don’t know where the hell she is, the living room, the kitchen, whatever.  So I just did the next thing that came to my mind and stood there and took off my oven mitt and saluted these things. Seriously, does the government have any idea what’s going on in the airspace above this country?

On July 18, 2018, we had left a Montello, Wisconsin gas station where I had zeroed out the trip meter after filling up.  My two teenage sons and I were heading back to our vacation cabin. At about 3 miles out of Montello, going south on Marquette County Highway C, I spotted an apparently stationary, dark and round, very unusual object over the distant tree line a mile or two away.  It was perfectly round, dark and dull as smoke.  I remember so well that it was as round as a BB.  It was not swaying. It seemed to be hovering in place oblivious to wind and gravity. My son in the back seat asked for my cell phone so that he could take pictures of it.  He took four pictures from back there.  The pictures also recorded the digital instrument panel of our car.  The car was traveling 42 miles per hour.  The first picture was taken at 4.1 miles on the trip meter; the other three pictures occurred at 4.2 miles. My cell phone camera distorts distances.  The tree line and UFO appear much farther away. To find them they are always in the center of the pictures.  In the first picture they are between the lone tree and small group of trees in the foreground.  The image upon magnification is pixelated and displays a more saucer-shaped UFO.  Upon magnification the smaller companion looks more like a toy “top” shape with its narrow point aiming downward, but its behavior does not suggest a hot air balloon, due to the speed that it moved.  The tree line in the pictures changes in the photos relative to our speed.  The UFOs remain at the same angle to the car; in other words, stationary, compared to the trees. At 4.1 miles the smaller companion object is to the right of the larger stationary one.  The trip meter is at 4.2 miles in picture 2 when the companion object is above the stationary UFO.  Under magnification of the last two pictures, even though the mileage reading was still 4.2, faint dark patches suggest that the companion was left of the object.  No such darkened pixelated areas exist in the first two pictures; in fact, windshield residue of a couple of water droplets are identifiable on the glass.  To the naked eye the larger UFO stood out very odd and clear. My decision was to keep going, clear the tree line.  In a few miles there would be an eastbound change in the highway also and a clear view to the south.  But once we reached the tree line the road S-curved, and there were trees we could not see through.  It was only a few more minutes until we had cleared all the trees of roadside forest and had a full view of the sky in all directions, including back to the north.  The sky however was void of any unidentifiable objects in the sky.   We looked for it as we drove east too, but the sky was empty of machines.",2018-08-10T00:00:00,43.7829,-89.2983

Appeared to hold altitude as the sun was setting, and its diameter appeared to decrease significantly from initial sighting to last sight.  I was able to borrow some small low magnification binoculars and look at it after about the first hour of observing it. At any rate, the video certainly speaks for its motion shape and look.

They generally have a diagonal path as they are falling toward earth and they also fall very fast, usually within a split second I could see them burn up as they head toward the ground. But this night was different. I had just finished my truck driving route or schedule and now I was headed toward home in my Chevy Volt driving north on Baker St. in West Branch, Iowa, a drive I had taken for 13+ years.  Of course there was a black sky that night and I had just drove down that small hill that heads out of town.  The town was pretty much dead at this late hour around 11:35pm.   I was going about 30 miles an hour when right before my eyes I saw what looked like at first glance a falling meteor.  And then I could see the characteristics of it.  The path of this object was straight down and I also saw that it was not falling that fast like other meteors, as though it may have been space junk or an airplane.  I could also see a bluish and greenish glow coming from which I believe the bottom of this object.  There was no tail behind it like a comet.  It took about 3 seconds to see this fall looking through the front windshield of my car.  That is how slow it was falling.  But what took my breath away was how gigantic it was compared to other meteors.  It was not small by any means but about the width of the moon.  Something just fell out of the sky just maybe a few miles from where I was driving and it seemed like it was just maybe right off of the left side of the road ahead of me.  I decided to investigate and so I drove a few miles ahead of my exit toward home. I could not see anything.  And so I decided to head back home and while driving on the way back about a mile I passed a Iowa State patrol car speeding along as if he was maybe chasing someone.  Of course there was no other cars out that night and so why was he driving that fast, I will never know.  He did not have his lights on. When I arrived home I was somewhat in shock.  I did not know what to do about this sign from the heavens.  I decided to call the man that is in charge of the UFO sighting on coast to coast.  I explained to him the situation and he told me to call 911 just to be sure because it could have been a plane.  Or who knows what could have happened.  And so I did and also called the Iowa State Patrol and ABC and CBS news stations. No one seemed to hear anything on police scanners or have seen anything.  No reports were made and so time will only tell what truly happened this night.  Maybe a farmer will find something in his field, especially since its all farm land north of West Branch, Iowa. I, being a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ will not be caught dead with lying to anyone about what I saw.  I have a godly reputation in this neighborhood.  You could not get me to tell a lie if you burned me at a stake for the Bible says, “All liars shall have their part in the lake of fire” in the book of the Revelation.  I take this serious!!!  I do not even listen to all the UFO reports on coast to coast (90% of the time I don’t even listen to coast to coast) because it seems to always be the same stories told pretty much, and so I just turn off my radio at this time or try to shut it out of my mind.  I know there are many false reports but I also know that God Himself will never in a million years allow me to give a false report and live to tell about it.  Because it would haunt me within my conscience with fiery guilt and then I would have to make restitution on it. All I know is that God allowed me to see this sign for a reason.  I am 55 years old, never seen anything like this in all my life and I know without a doubt that something huge fell from the sky and it could not have been a meteor or could it?  It now could be classified as an Unidentified Flying object.  I could now say that I have seen one.",2018-10-25T00:00:00,41.6949,-91.3127

Approximately 8pm, clear dark night, October 24, 2018. Upon returning home from work, just as any typical evening, I took my dog out for a walk.  While doing so, I noticed a blue and red flashing light.  Seemed out of place but initially didn’t think it was anything more than maybe a satellite I just haven’t noticed before – I am a sky watcher, so slowly I realized that wasn’t likely.  Next thought was it was a helicopter – I know some have blue and red flashers on it.  After a few minutes of looking, I realized it wasn’t moving with any kind of trajectory at all – eventually realizing it wasn’t a normal aircraft or satellite once it stopped and stayed in location.  Over the course of 15-20 minutes it would make some slight movements in one direction or the other but mostly stayed in a general area.  To my eye its adjustments were fractions of a cm. I began to notice brighter lights – multiple.  2 or 3 at first.  Over the course of time I noticed roughly 8 or 9 different Jet style craft covering the area seemingly searching this object out.  They would make passes, turn and make return passes.  Some were much lower than I am used to seeing planes fly, others a bit higher in altitude but all doing the same search patterns.  I knew for sure the first object was different indeed at that point mostly due to its oddly blinking lights and pattern of the blinking along with the ability to move and stop without any typical trajectory.  Planes and odd lights I see all the time, but they all off PATHS they are flying – any change in direction is preceded by a curved trajectory.  This object did not follow this typical movement.  In fact, it seemed to vanish at times by eye and on video it looked to expand becoming opaque before contracting again.  Hard to even describe.  I had eyes on all of this for well over an hour from different vantag! e points  By eye showed as a small dot, on video looked like a disc on its side or a sphere.  Its color pattern ranging in colors from blue to red to green by eye, but on video you can see pinks, oranges, yellows.  This is clear on the video.  It also seemed to morph as its colors shifted.",2018-10-25T00:00:00,42.4853,-83.3772

Daylight sighting of Saucer shaped craft with design underneath. Inside glowing electric blue.,Cape Sable Island,NS,2015-09-18T15:01:00,disk,75 minutes,"Occurred : 9/18/2015 15:01  (Entered as : 15/09/18 15:01) Reported: 9/18/2018 7:19:25 PM 19:19 Posted: 9/27/2018 Location: Cape Sable Island (Canada), NS Shape: Disk Duration:75 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/143/S143176.html,"Daylight sighting of Saucer shaped craft with design underneath. Inside glowing electric blue. I witnessed a UFO hovering directly overhead.  I first noticed it around 3:01 pm on September 15, 2018, as I was flying my last drone footage flight.  The sighting lasting over an hour.  I was in the area shooting an independent short film on one of the local residents. As my drone was set to make an automatic landing, based on a GPS coordinate, I confirmed with its OS before takeoff. it hovered to its initially set height coordinates input beforehand (approx. 20 meters).  As I looked up to see it hovering prior to landing, I noticed what I initially thought was a bag floating high above the drone.  As I looked closer I realized it was perfectly round.  Then I thought maybe it was a balloon.  Then a weather balloon.  But it was locked in place.  Not moving.  White.  I wanted to take my drone up higher to see if I could match its altitude and get a better look but all 4 of the batteries were dead or dying and would not have the power necessary to take it to extreme altitudes and return safely to home without crashing or failing.  It had the capability of going as high as 500 Meters with a full charge, but was just not possible at this point.   The actual height of this UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) I could not say, as I'm not a commercial pilot and could not gauge how high it was.  I did see a plane fly by maybe 20-30 minutes later and could tell that the commercial plane was at a much higher altitude than whatever this was purely by the atmospheric distortion that softened all of the edges and the image of the plane according to my eyes.  The UFO was sharp in contrast and definition.  That gave me a little information in that it must've been closer to me than the plane. My initial reaction was to run and grab my HD DSLR camera (Canon T5i) from all the gear I had in my jeep for the shoot and start filming.  I was filming in 1080P earlier so all I had to do was point and click.  I landed my drone safely, threw it in my car and grabbed the camera.  I managed to get about 6 Photographs and as many if not more videos of the event, some of which I'll share here.  I had a telephoto lens I had purchased for another shoot (55-250mm) so I threw that on to get maximum magnification and started shooting. This thing literally hung right above me for about 30 minutes.  Silent, round, white.  I could see with the naked eye that there was a little blue spot in the middle so I thought maybe it was a donut in the sky.  Sounds weird I know.  As I zoomed in with the telephoto lens, I could clearly see definition in the bottom of this thing.  White lines, a design or something inside an inner round core of a light electric blue.  This design stayed consistent over all the photographs and films, as you will see.  As this traveled West I noticed that the shape was now slightly ellipsed which gave me the impression that this thing flat like a dish or classic saucer.   I was getting a little weirded out, so I called you, then Peter Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center in the United States, as under his guidance, called you, and witnesses to come to see this thing and verify my sighting.  Locals ((name of female #1 deleted)), and ((name of female #2 deleted)) arrived with author ((male's name deleted)), and all three confirmed my sighting, as it traveled over the beach at Daniel's Head Road, before heading out to sea.  In all, we had 4 witnesses.  ((2nd female)) met me at the Fire Hall at the head of Daniel's Head Rd.  I located the object for him which he then witnessed heading south to the beach.  I then left and headed to the beach. Laurie then met me there a few minutes later, and we picked it up again.   A few minutes after that (it must've been after 4 pm at this point) ((male)) and ((2nd female)) showed up.  By this point all of my cameras were dead, save one, but I had already gotten great shots and this thing was heading out to sea becoming difficult to track.  If you didn't try hard and focus in the direction it was you wouldn't see it.  This occurred at my original location once it had crossed the road and was making its way to the beach.  As soon as you picked it up it became so obvious that you wondered why you couldn't see it without searching for it.  Very strange.  I retrieved ((male's)) field glasses from his car, and he was able to see the craft, or whatever it was, w! ith 6x magnification, if I'm correct.  All four of us saw this thing on the beach.  I tried to show another guy on the beach but he couldn't see it.  He said he saw two drones flying around earlier, but I was flying one close to the beach earlier but I didn't see another drone or drone pilot.  I sort of think that maybe he saw this thing earlier but he also saw my drone, because I did fly past him.  Hard to know.  The impression it left upon me was, 'What was this thing?', 'How come I can't hear it?', 'How is it just hovering there barely moving' (even though you can see when the camera is mounted on the tripod that it is, in fact, moving all so very slowly).  I also felt like, 'I'm freaking out because I'm alone out here and this thing is just hovering above me'.  I also felt anxious, excited, nervous I wasn't going to get it recorded, and completely full of awe.  I was also completely confused at why nobody who passed by in cars (and there were several) didn't stop to asking me what I was filming in the sky.  There was actually a cyclist that bikes right past me as I'm trying to get his attention to look at the UFO!  You'll see all this in the clip I've provided via Google Drive link.  Please excuse all the expletives as I was rather flustered and flummoxed. Tonight as I'm looking at the photos and footage, I'm elated that what I saw was not my imagination, as the design on the bottom showed up in my videos and photos.  My reactions are sincere.  I want everyone to know that the strange things that have been reported in this area are still happening!!   The man I was filming that morning saw a sea monster there off the coast in 1976 with about 5 other people and other reports go back in time.  UFO's have been consistently captured there over the years, and stories still persist of strange incidences of weird visits by otherworldly beings.  Let's not forget that in 1967, just down the road in Shag Harbour, the world's only gov't documented UFO crash occurred.  The witness to my event, ((female #1)) is the very same ((female #1)) that witnessed that crash back in 67'.  It gets weirder. Heather, the other witness has been photographing these things for years and as it turns out, is the cousin of the man I had spent filming all day.  Lastly, ((male)), the 3rd witness to my event, just so happens to be the guy who has written 2 books on that crash of 1967.  He also just happens to be the subject of another film I'm making on his life.  While traveling out of Ontario filming this film, we both had another experience together involving a UFO.  It gets better.  The night before I saw yet another UFO over Citadel hill.  A month or so back, my wife saw two UFO's over North St, and my dad watched a small white orb trailing a commercial plane flying over the Joe Howe Superstore.  There is this saying, 'Once you stare into the Abyss, the Abyss starts to stare back'.  I feel like there's more truth to this, especially after yesterday's events. Attached are a couple files.  Zoom in on the photos and video. It's very compelling evidence of something still happening on Cape Sable Island. This was not a trick of photography as we all 4 saw this with our naked eye.

I saw a single object.  At the start of the occurrence the object at first appeared to be a distant jet liner.  But it produced no contrail and its motion seemed slower than that of a typical airliner cruising at altitude.  Furthermore the object ""flickered"".  Whether this was due to light emitting apparatuses or protrusions reflecting sunlight off of them is not clear. It's size and distance was impossible to determine.  It did appear to me to be high up in the sky and distant.  The object appeared to be solid as it was dark against the sky when it was not flickering.  The color of the flickering light was white in hue and the period between flashes was rapid in frequency.  There may have been two points of light as the object flickered but I could be mistaken in the recollection.  There was no sounds coming from the object all through out the entire time I witnessed it. The path object traveled was from southeast to northwest.  The object's path took it across Moon which was approximately 40 degrees above the horizon at the time.  In fact, as I recall, I first caught sight of the object as it as slightly below the Moon's position in the SE sky.  When the object moved over head and passed my vantage point, the object appeared to slow almost to a halt and remained in that position for about a minute before it seemed to vanish.  The estimated elapsed time from when I first spotted the object till when it vanished was under three minutes. I was riding a bicycle at when I first spotted the object, but I dismounted and walked along the street and pausing frequently to observe the object.  I was traveling south and traversed a distance of a block and a half through the entire duration of the occurrence.  I do wear glasses to correct distance vision.  I had them on through the entire time.  I was in a residential neighborhood however there was nothing obscuring the object all throughout the entire time it was observed. It was mostly clear skies at the time and sunny.  There were no clouds in the part of the sky the object traveled through.  The wind at the ground level was southeasterly a little over 10 mph I'd estimate.  It was warm at the surface; over 85 degrees F.

The moon is out and over my left shoulder.    I looked into the sky to the west of the moon and I saw a bright star that was white and seemed to turn reddish, too.  I thought it was a planet since there were no other stars.  Then suddenly it faded away, I saw something dark just as the light went away, and then just blue sky.   There were planes in the sky and I could see their bodies because of how the sun was shining in them still.  I could see exhaust trails from the planes, but this light had no trails, no illumination from the sun.  It was way to high in the sky to be a helicopter.

On September 4, 2018, at 7:20 p.m. in Deming, New Mexico, my wife and I saw a stationary ball of bright white light in the western sky at about 30 degrees.  There we no other stars or planets in the sky because the sky was still too bright.  I thought it was a supernova!   I ran to our shed and got my telescope, which is pre-assembled and is covered only by a garbage bag, making it always ready to go.  As I looked at the white ball with the telescope, it ejected two smaller orange balls of light.  They were flying in the area below the white ball.  All three objects could be seen with the naked eye. As I was scanning the area near the white ball with my telescope, I saw another object that looked somewhat similar to a Harrier jet.  It was stationary and was facing me nearly head-on with one bright white light in the middle of each wing.  It seemed to be fairly close to the white ball.  We could not see the jet-shaped object without the telescope.  I have no way to tell how large or how far away they were.  After about a minute or two, the jet-shaped object and the big white ball instantly disappeared leaving the two smaller orange balls.  They would alternate between being bright and dim.  The orange balls remained flying around in the same area of the western sky for about thirty seconds before fading from view. This whole event seems to me to have lasted only about 3 or 4 minutes.  If I would taken the time to get my camera and put it on a tripod so I could take some telephoto shots,  I would have missed the seeing the mysterious jet-shaped object.  I have since spoken with three other people who saw the big white object and one small object below the big one!

My boyfriend and I took the pontoon boat out on the lake to enjoy the sunset, as we often do. It was a fabulous sunset and we stayed to watch all the beautiful after glow.  The stars started coming out and the sky cleared.  We were picking out constellations when I saw a star shoot across the sky.  Then I saw another one.  My boyfriend started seeing stars shooting all over the sky.  He recalls seeing 30 to 40 of them at a time.  I remember seeing 10 or 12 at a time.  We were amazed and thrilled at the sight.  I was so happy because, even though I have spent hundreds of nights sleeping out under the open sky, I had never seen a UFO.  We could hear, but not see one lone jet flying round the area. Then, about 1000 feet of the stern of the boat, we saw looked like a huge (300' across?) plane shaped object bearing down on us about 100 feet off the water.  It had very bright yellow orange lights.  A big one in the center and decreasingly smaller lights going out the ends of the object.  It was speeding and descending directly at us.  Totally silent.   My boyfriend got a very short video but it is not very good.  I can't believe that I was laughing!  But it is on the video.  Then it just disappeared into thin air.  Poof!  It was gone.  It seems strange, but neither one of us seemed to be frightened at all.   It was all just so awesome and thrilling.  We decided to stay out and keep star gazing.  About 15 minutes passed then an object just like the first one, but about twice as large, started to bare down on us.  Same as the first but more lights.  It too just disappeared.  We stayed out another half hour, then decided to go home.  I hesitate to tell the following, because it makes my account seem unbelievable, but I want to report it all.  As we were stepping of the pontoon boat, from my boyfriends phone in his pocket we heard a computerized female voice saying random numbers and letters.  Something like: M R 5 V 8 M K 3 Y R B 2.  The phone had not rung.  And there is no record of it on his phone.  We went home and went to sleep like nothing had happened.  The next morning I couldn't stop thinking about it, and I thought it was very odd that I wasn't freaking out.  It was like I had seen a fabulous movie or gone on really wild carnival ride.  I didn't take my shower till noon because I had yard work to do in the morning.  When I went to blow dry my hair, I looked at my eyes in the mirror and I saw terror looking back at me.  And that freaked me out.  I am thinking that my conscious mind is protecting me from going crazy.  But my subconscious knows.  Days passed and the thought occurred to me that those huge objects created no waves on our shallow lake.  Normally even a small fishing boat will far away will create waves.  I'm thinking that those objects were holograms.  My boyfriend thinks that they were real because hovercrafts don't make a wake.  I just don't know. I'll try to figure out how to send you the video from my boyfriends phone.",2018-09-27T00:00:00,27.2419,-81.3564

My husband and I first noticed that what we were looking at was not a star or a planet when we took the time to stand still and we realized that what we were seeing was moving around.  The object was hovering over the Lake George area of Pierson, Florida.   We got out the binoculars and filmed videos of the object moving in directions that all normal aircraft we know of do not move like.  This looked like a star at first, but the object got brighter and  dimmer as though it was blinking or pulsating.  It also would move up slowly and down slowly and home still and it would dark to the left and the right in directions that you would not see a plane or a star move.  We did take photos and pay attention to the height of the object which was just above the tree lines and about a thousand yards away.  We continue to observe any object for about 3 hours.  Maybe between 2 and 3 hours.   And the next night, we saw the object again in the same vicinity and doing the same exact things.  The next week and a half went by and we would see the object and just not even pay attention to it because we still haven’t been able to figure out what it is.  We do know that it is still here, and our first sighting was 07/20/18, and as of last night, we still saw it, and videotaped and looked at it through binoculars.   Last night’s date was 08/04/2018.  Last night, the object was in the same vicinity but southeast of where it was the first times that we saw it.  We know it is similar if not the same object, and this time we got a closer look.  This time there was a red light beam protruding from the bottom of the object and the beam wood appear and disappear just as the brightness of the object would increase and decrease.  We got better photos of it last night, and will continue to observe the object because it is definitely here on a regular basis.   We discussed our location because where we live there is nothing really as far as much civilization, the majority of what is here is cow fields and Farms, and a very lowly populated Township.  The object would be in the same exact vicinity where some small aircraft would fly directly past it also.  The object would stop hovering and hold very still and make the lights very dim making the object appear as though it was a star during the periods of time that airplanes got near it.  At one point the object divided into two objects while the one on the right State still in the one on the left moved around and then the two objects joined back together as one object.  Sometimes it seemed like a white dot, and sometimes it would be closer and look more red, and sometimes you could distinctly see the white on top and the red light being on the bottom.  We discussed that maybe it was a satellite and it just appeared to be closer than it really was but that could not be because satellites do not move around in quick motions in 360 degree directions, and the satellite are actually out in orbit and this was much closer.  After doing some research online I also considered that maybe this was a drone that we were looking at, but drones also would make some sort of noise if it was that large that it was visible to the eye at that distance.  Also I don’t know if drugs that can move that quickly and have a red light beam underneath them.   This is definitely something that I would like a professional to look into to find out exactly what this object is.  If it is from mankind then that time, but I don’t know if anything that mankind has made that moves like that or acts like that, so if someone would like we can submit video or even to prove that this is not a hoax, I’d be glad to pull up video live on Google hangouts to prove that this is not something that’s computer generated.  I am NOT trying to submit personal information including address or name or telephone number whatsoever, and I want to ensure that I’m reporting this to the right agency.",2018-08-10T00:00:00,29.2158,-81.4445

I saw a bright white flash again, just a few seconds later, located in front of me and just West from the first sighting, after it initially appeared, which could have possibly been the same object, but I was uncertain as I assumed it was traveling from an East to Westward horizontal trajectory.   The object flashed again one last time (3 times total) just West again from where it was previously located in front and to the right of me, but assumed this was a single object still continuing its Westward direction of travel.   It was hard to estimate the distance I was away from this object (flash) since it was fully dark a! t this time and a significant distance away from me, yet somewhat close as night time lights are difficult to judge their distances in these particular circumstances (lights/flashes in nighttime skies).   I reported my sighting approximately 30 minutes later to a ranking airfield authority and asked if any aircraft were flying nighttime operations during this time as I have seen aircraft flying these type of maneuvers before at this location at approximately 10,000 feet dropping aerial flares (could previously distinguish the aircraft and the flares dropping at the same time, both in visual view together).  My observation of this sighting was definitely not the case in this situation, as this object was traveling horizontally with no streaks behind it (no sound either or streaks from its top side, which would demonstrate/exhibit a downward aircraft flare being dropped) and was not within the constraints and characteristics of a meteor sighting either (most meteor sightings I’ve seen lasted no longer than a few seconds).  The airfield official informed me he was unaware of any aircraft flying nighttime training/operations at the time and would look into the incident for me.  I haven’t heard back yet from him on any explanation regarding my sighting, however, I assume this sighting is still on active status/an unexplained event.   During the time of the sighting, the sky was totally clear/dark, with the half-moon practically located overhead with Mars nearby its presence (Just West of the Moon).  The planet Saturn was setting close in the far South-Western horizon.  There was no wind active or noticeable as the sky was totally clear and peaceful at the time of the event.  The temperature was approximately 77 degrees.  The entire event occurred over approximately 10-15 seconds.   No further information to report, yet to advise that I have considerable experience around all well-known civilian and military aircraft and can substantiate this event was neither a star, planet, satellite, meteor, flare or any known type of familiar aircraft that I’ve ever seen before flying in the nighttime skies, especially at this location.  I checked the NASA ISS fly-over schedule as it didn’t list any fly-overs in this area (or region) for the entire 24 hour period on 16 November 2018 (night of the sighting).",2018-11-24T00:00:00,,

After watching Venus for a moment he saw, a few degrees off, what looked like a huge band of lights - white surrounded by red - began flashing and moving in his direction.  As soon as the flashing began the dog seemed frightened.  Whining, repeatedly bumping his legs and jumping up to push on his chest.  When the object was almost directly overhead the lights changed to all white and flashing sequentially from rear to front.  At that point a soft gold color glow defined the edges, giving him the shape he tried to illustrate.  The object silently continued east until lost behind a stand of trees.

On Thursday, September 13, 2018, my friend and I were sitting out front of  my apartment building, probably around 1 a.m. or so and I noticed what at first glance looked like a star maybe burning out.  It had reds, greens, and blue tints to it and was flashing pretty steadily. I then realized what ever this is was definitely hovering somehow.  You could see it slowly moving from left to right.   When that caught our attention we finally decided to take a look at the sky and there were MULTIPLE objects in the sky that fit the same description.  Just looking at them you could see the flashing and hovering.  Some would just appear.  We have these little toy binoculars, that still work pretty good, that we started looking at the objects better and through that they looked as if things were coming out of them sort of like flares, they seemed long, like a trail of something entering into the atmosphere.  We noticed some made up a circle formation and then some were making u! p a triangle formation.  Then there would be groups of maybe six objects swarming around each other.  They were smaller and farther off so the way I can really explain it is when you see the gnats flying around a street light,  This was going on for a few hours.  I happened to walk outside about 6 a.m when the sun was barely out and there was one left in the sky and it was so bright as if the sun was bouncing of a metallic surface.  I was able to get a video of that one, I couldn’t figure out the shape but you could easily tell it wasn’t a plane or a satellite.  It almost looked like it was breaking off into smaller pieces and coming back to its original form but it was gone by the time the sun came all the way up.",2018-09-27T00:00:00,33.4584832733813,-82.04117769784173

It was very hard to take my eyes off this thing and pay attention to the road traffic because I never seen anything like this before.

I see these flights a lot, and most of those flights are at around 30,000’, and the red, blue and white flashing lights that I saw were at about that height.  Then, I noticed that these lights weren’t moving nearly as fast as expected, so I ran inside and grabbed the 10X binoculars.  With the binoculars I saw either many small lights on an immense object, or many objects flying in a choreographed manner.  There were many lights very close together, and those lights were pretty irregular in their flashing frequency, color and brightness.  These compacted lights were arranged in a rough semi-circle, which gave me the impression of an extremely large solid object.  But then I observed several small but bright lights moving independently of the rest.  One of these lights was a considerable distance away from the compacted lights, at least two to three miles away by my estimate.  That light was flashing a white color, and it only flashed twice that I saw. After watching these lights for about a minute, they seemed to be dimming.  But I then realized that the whole “swarm” of lights was moving West and away from my location.  Looking up I saw one of the regular commercial flights heading West, and in the general direction where the lights were.  It appeared that the lights started moving in response to the commercial jet. I say “swarm” because at that point the compacted lights appeared to be separating from each other as they moved away, with the independent lights trailing. Much like a swarm of insects might do. It seemed weird, but I really didn’t think much of it until yesterday when I watched this YouTube video apparently showing a “swarm” of objects over St. Petersburg, Russia, on September 13, 2018!:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPkbhQqaAsU   What is depicted in the video is similar to what I saw, but the object(s) that I saw were flashing different colors.",2018-09-27T00:00:00,,

This is taken from Sir Alec Kirkbride’s book, “An Awakening - the Arab campaign 1917-1918”, Chapter 5, ‘The Regulars’. It is therefore dated to June 12, 1918 (not 2018). I am posting it here because I don’t believe it has been reported before. The text reads as follows:  “On the night of 12th June” [1918] “we climbed up the Wadi Dhahal for the last time. [....] At about three o’clock in the morning I was aroused from a walking doze by seeing a large incandescent globe which passed quite slowly across the sky.  It moved without noise, coming from behind one range of hills and going behind another; but it illuminated the valley in which we stood for about half a minute.  In reply to my ‘Good God, what was that?’ one of the camel minders answered, ‘That was an aeroplane of course.  What did you think it was?’  He was wrong; it was not an aeroplane.   Most British people to whom I afterwards described the experience either produced silly explanations or assured me that no such thing existed.   Many years later, in Jordan, Glubb told me that he had seen the same phenomenon in the desert on the Iraq-Kuwait frontier.  He had also been told that there was no such thing.”  I live in France. Your witness contact information doesn’t appear to allow for details from non-US residents. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) Dear Peter, Thank you for your rapid response to my post - I wasn't expecting it to attract your personal attention, but I'm very pleased it did. I'm delighted that Kirkbride's sighting will be given the recognition it certainly deserves. It seems to me to be an interesting demonstration that ""UFOs"" or ""UAPs"" are not a product of the vivid imagination of post-WWII citizens fed on a diet of science fiction and alternative cultures, but a genuine phenomenon, observed throughout history. When Alec Kirkbride saw his luminous sphere he had obviously never heard of ""UFOs"" or aliens, and neither had General Glubb. You may like some background details: at the time of the sighting, Alec Kirkbride (1897-1978) was a 20 year-old junior officer in the British Army in the Middle East theatre, where he worked alongside charismatic figures like TE Lawrence and the Emir Feisal. His book of reminiscences of that period is long out of print, but having a special interest in the period, and in TE Lawrence in particular, I acquired a copy recently and was delighted when I came across the unexpected passage describing what was clearly a UFO. I was amused to learn that reactions to his tale were much the same then as they tend to be to similar experience today. Kirkbride went on to become a career diplomat, and spent most of his working life in the Middle East, including a long period as ""British Resident"" (something between an Ambassador and a Political officer) to the Kingdom of Jordan. My comment about your witness contact details wasn't a complaint:  I posted my report from my tablet, and although that shouldn't have made any difference, I didn't see the box for ""foreign country"", which a quick visit to your site from my laptop confirms is there ... perhaps I misread it in my haste.

Female friend and I were standing on her porch in a very rural area near Austin, IN, (between Austin, IN and Crothersville, IN) around 11:00pm in the fall of 1994 in the fall.  We were talking and saying goodbye, and all of a sudden we saw 4-5 white lights come up to the south east.  I originally thought these were helicopters since I saw round white lights shining down and I attempted to make it fit my reference frame, as we have had helicopters looking for pot, etc in that time – the problem was it was night time and there was no way they were really doing that at night.  Also, there were no sounds – I’d never seen a helicopter that made no sound – I thought in my head this must be special military aircraft.   I then was trying to look closely and finally the lights went out.  Then all of a sudden, lights came on the southeast area and the straight east,  shown above the tree line across the road from the house, 5 or more round white lights were shown.  I looked closely, again, trying to understand the context of the lights, they began to change color – purple, green, yellow, white, etc.   She and I never spoke.  Then, the lights shifted, turned white, and shone up and I was able to see that this was a huge craft.  Triangle shape and very large – length and height.  As the lights shined up on the craft, it looked like landscape lighting shining up on a very large building and was above trees at a height over 70 feet I assumed 500 feet long.  As I looked closer, I saw this craft was huge as the lights shown up the sides and showed the huge shape – my frame of reference was the tree line.  After a short minute, the craft moved forward (south) and I could see the triangle shape of the monstrous building size craft more clearly.  Then the lights went out and I could not see the craft any more.   Then small white lights came on and they moved on (about 5-10 of these) and move on south – the triangle craft was gone and only the ligh! ts left – like they quickly shot out of the craft then the cra! ft was g one leaving the lights.  Like the craft disappeared or turned into the small lights.  The lights then blinked out and then disappeared to the south.  I then regained my senses and looked at my friend.  She was still “fixed” on the scene and didn’t respond to me.  I looked at my watch and looked for any missing time, but didn’t at that time detect any.  But, I did notice that it seemed like I had a “bad edit” ( I heard that in a later discussion) because I really was lost for a minute.  My friend and I then went back to talking like nothing happened.  We did not mention it.  I then drove back to my house a few miles away, and checked my watch again looking for any lost time.  I didn’t notice any.  When I got home, I called her and said “Did you see that?”  She then said to me, “Did you see that, too?”  It was so odd that we both ignored it at the time although was very profound, but then noticed the importance later.  As I heard the description of sightings or abductions as “ba! d edits”, this fit that description exactly.  Although I have had other memories, this is the detail I remember in general.  Sorry it took so long to report.  Again, I can’t explain why I haven’t.  I did tell my sister about it the day after it happened and she remembered our conversation.",2018-11-09T00:00:00,38.7697,-85.8029

I am 58 years old.  I have 19 years of education and a post graduate degree.  I am married and gainfully employed. On November 7, 2018, I was traveling from Winston-Salem, NC, to Wilmington, NC.  I took Interstate 40 around Raleigh, NC.  Approximately 45 miles east of Raleigh, I exited near Newton Grove, NC, and stopped at a convenience store and purchased water and a snack.   Not long after I got back on Interstate 40, I observed a steady white light above the trees on the left (north) side of the highway.  This was around 7:35 pm.  The sun set at least 1.5 hours before I saw this light.  The sky was partly cloudy.  In this general location Interstate 40 was 4 lanes, two lanes in each direction, with a center median.  The speed limit was 70 mph.  This is a rural area.  I was traveling at around the posted speed limit, driving a 4-door sedan. I was intrigued by the white light.  It was far too large to be a star or planet but seemed to be stationary, so did not think it could be from an airplane.  I knew that there were no tall buildings in the area to account for such a light.  I considered the possibility that the light was on top of a large industrial facility that I had not noticed before, as well as the possibility that it was affixed to a very tall communications tower.  As I got closer, I saw that the light was affixed to an aircraft that was shaped like a stealth bomber (a triangle).    Because traffic was very light, I was able to slow my vehicle to around 45 mph and watch the aircraft through by looking up through my windshield.  The aircraft appeared to be hovering or nearly hovering.  It appeared to be close enough to the ground that if it had been proceeding at the speed of a jet, or even a small prop plane, its forward progress would have been dramatically greater than appeared to be the case.  I was headed east.  The aircraft was pointed west.  As I was watching the aircraft, I observed two similarly shaped aircraft to the south and east of the aircraft with the light.  I could see the silhouettes of the other two aircraft.  These aircraft were pointed in the same direction as the first aircraft.  I did not observe lights on them.  I watched the three aircraft for at least 5 seconds.  They appeared to be hovering or moving forward at a very slow speed. I considered stopping to get a better view but did not, as the three aircraft appeared to be close enough to observe me.  The three aircraft were close enough and strange enough that I concluded that my best course would be to keep moving and get out of the area. I was not far from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base.  It occurs to me that the three aircraft could have been stealth bombers.

At 7:56PM on July 21, 2018, I was having a cigarette outside of St. Rose Dominican hospital in the southwest part of Las Vegas, NV, when I saw what I belive is some new aircraft being tested near town.  I was looking to the southwest the right way at the right time to see a plane I think.  I do know however it was the fastest thing I've ever seen move through the air.  It was the same color as the night sky yet had a greyness to it due to the city lights bouncing off the bottem or ""belly.""  I've flown my whole life, so I tried looking for all the usual suspects, vertical stabilizer(s)?  No.  Has some kind of fighter front end.  Intakes exhausts?  No.  Maybe a hint of a delta shape with a flat ""stealthy"" single point kinda like an F-117.  No sound none!  I was watching airliners depart the valley at the class B boundry.  A new plane type looked to me like it  was transitioning from class c (or uncotrolled airspace) to class bravo and close to commercial traffic.  He made whatever airliner that was look like he was standing still.  He was also higer in altitude than the traffic off his left... may I say wing?  I watched him fly over the horizon.  Not a sound at a speed I never seen before.  He flew right over my head I caught him when my head was about 80 degrees to already be watching airplanes so I saw him really good and for a time.  No lights of anykind this aircraft I dont think anyone would know it, if it was flying treetop level over there head's right now that quiet and that dark.

We had not seen it for several months. It generally moves east though it may be moving slightly northeast or southeast. The intensity of the white light does not change even after it passes over and goes out of sight so it is not a landing light or spot light.  The light does not light up anything below it or around it.  It does not pulse at all.  The light is perfectly round.  There are no other lights visible such as the red and green directional lights on the side an aircraft or a beacon light 1that would be on the tail of an aircraft.  There are no strobe lights.  It leaves no trail. It is completely silent.  We have never heard the sound of an engine, rotor, prop, or buzz like from commercially available drones. We have no size reference for it other than it is much larger and brighter than a star such as Sirius.  We have watched satellites and the International Space Station go over and this makes them look like tiny little pale pinpricks in the sky.

(lights usually reflect on the atmosphere making it more difficult to see stars.)   When I stopped to see the “stars,” I noticed there were about 10-15 that were actually moving at different speeds and sometimes slowing and speeding up.  There was a random group, no formation like you would expect for planes or other aircraft.  I felt spooked after watching for about 5 minutes, so I ran in to get my fiancé to take a look so I didn’t think I was seeing things.  She witnessed the same strange siting, and also got spooked and ran in the house.   The lights seemed at a very high altitude and appeared to look like stars.  As the view became blocked, I moved between trees to notice the lights moving at a much faster speed toward the western horizon.  Still maintaining a random formation.  There’s no way they could be aircraft of any type to be that many and to move at that rate of slow speed to high speed and cover that much distance in about a minute or less.  There were no light trails of any sort.  Just a formation of random “star” looking lights moving very strangely. There was no ability to determine a shape of objects due to the distance and altitude they seemed to be at.   I’ve watch a lot of aircraft in the past, in the night skies, and this was definitely much different.  I even noticed actual aircraft in the skies during and after the siting and nothing moved like these 10-15 lights I witnessed.  It would have been difficult for anyone to notice unless you were looking up at stars and noticed the moving lights, they easily blended in with the night sky.

There were no sounds heard during the event or right after it occurred. When the ball of light first appeared, it seemed to ascend, arcing toward the east/southeast.  When it leveled off briefly, it seemed to travel toward the east.  When the light descended, it appeared to arc toward the northeast.  The brightness of the light seemed to get slightly brighter as it traveled, which makes me think it was moving closer to my position.  The ball of light looked like a roman candle type of light.

He estimated it was at least 10 to 15 miles away, but the height was hard to judge.  ""If you stuck your arm straight out, it would have been less than a fingers width away from a tree line that was over a mile away.  Probably hundreds of feet from the ground.""  The light was definitely lower and brighter than any star in the sky that he had ever seen.  It was also brighter than a passenger plane flying not quite overhead of where he was, and larger.  His first thought was that it was a helicopter with a search light, since it seemed to be stationary, and he figured a bright search light may explain why it looked so big.  He watched it for around 3 minutes before he had to walk away for about 10 seconds, and when he returned to see what it was doing it had vanished.  He watched for maybe another! minute and it still hadn't returned.  That's when he thought maybe it was a UFO.  He went to tell a co-worker about it and took care of a few things which took about 10 minutes and went to look again and there was another orange light.  This time it was off to the left a bit and a little higher. ""I would say at least a mile north of the first light.  My co-worker was close by so I called him over to see it.""  They talked for a couple of minutes about it while they watched it and then it just disappeared.  It was like someone just flipped a switch and it was gone.  After another 15 minutes or so he went back to look and another light appeared while he was watching in the same place the first one was, except this time it was a deep red.  Then this one started ascending higher into the sky very slowly, and after it moved about an inch or so from his perspective, it kind of changed colors back to orange.  It stopped after another inch or so and stayed there for several minutes before disappearing.  He had forgot to mention that between the first and second light he had seen an object fly from the direction of the lights toward and straight over him to the west.  ""It didn't appear to have any lights.  It looked like it was reflecting the lights from the city.  It looked grayish and maybe triangular.  It was moving almost as fast as a meteor and over twice as fast as a plane.""  It was probably several hundred feet from the ground.  After the third light he witnessed, he and his co-worker were standing at the garage door when he saw a light that appeared even further in the distance than the original lights.  Then a second light appeared to the south and another appeared to the north.  All three were slowly moving up and down and changing the intensity of their light.  Eventually they disappeared one at a time.  Then about 15 or 20 minutes later he was looking again and saw a bright red light blinking very rapidly in the distance for about 10 seconds.  All of these lights were definitely hundreds of feet in the air, bri! ghter and larger than any aircraft he had ever seen, moved in ways that he had never seen a regular airplane move, and were not stars or radio towers.  He wasn't able to take pictures because it was night and the distances, and there were street lights in the foreground screwing with the focus.  Also, the sighting didn't really make me feel any certain way but it did give me good bumps.  (MUFON CMS)",2018-09-27T00:00:00,37.98475253093363,-87.51397041619798

Always consistent with speed, it stopped when I stopped in my car, I believed it was following me.  The object waited for me at one point at a friend's home, and as I came out of the house an hour after I saw the object it then passed right above me again near the south of Highlands Ranch open space field.  It flew away, and then went back up north past I-470 and then back over to where I lived in Lone Tree.",2018-09-27T00:00:00,39.5539,-104.9694

I might watch a UFO documentary once in a while, but I want nothing to do with aliens, both fictional or non-fictional.  I happen to know a few of the constellations from school and my father.  I saw Neptune through a telescope once, out of state.  I know a little bit about weather but this is the extent of my experience with such things. I was crossing a parking lot to go home tonight and I saw a strange man cross my path.  I looked up and he turned to look at me.  When I realized he wasn’t interested in me, I just watched him for a couple seconds and then something caught my eye overhead of him. When I realized what I was seeing, I turned to see if the man was still around because I wanted to draw his attention to the lights but he was already gone. I looked up to see two reddish-orange orbs flying upward in the north sky.  I just stopped to watch them.  Usually, there are planes that cross this path going south to the nearby Peoria Airport.  The lights were big like the lights of a big plane nearby.  They were spaced far enough I thought they were the lights you see on either wing of a plane.  Only one problem, there was no plane in-between or attached to these lights. I watched them ascend, in a slight curve and then turn right (my left) and as they went over this one spot in the sky, they dimmed, almost turning white and completely fizzled out.  There was a single light coming up from the tree line, same kind of light but single.  I watched it ascend, also take a right turn and disappear in the exact location as the first two.  But again, before it completely disappeared there was another light ascending.  Also, these were doing this as in formation and pace and such. All together, there were the first pair of lights and then 5 single lights after -  7 lights total.  Every one of them disappeared in the exact same spot and in the same manner.  I was searching my brain for an explanation of what these were: planes, weather balloons, hot air balloons, falling stars, fireworks, comets, Chinese lanterns, helicopters, flares, you name it, I was thinking about it, and ruling each one out. I am colorblind with reds/greens/browns and can see these colors if the brightness and hue and lighting is just right. When Mars was visible people would say, “Look how red it is!”  And I could not see this for the longest time.  At one point, when it was at a different location, I was finally able to see a faint redness to it.  These orbs were very distinct, bright, true color-there was no question what color they were. Because I was coming home from a bunch of errands, I did not have my digital camera with me and I was not wearing a watch.  But it was somewhere between 9:00 PM and 9:30 PM and lasted close to 5-10 minutes. I was also questioning how the orbs just disappeared when I saw the first two and thought it was just a plane turning and making it skinnier from the angle.  I also thought about the fact that maybe this set of lights went into/behind a cloud.  But it didn’t take me long to realize, there’s no clouds! I could see the big dipper to my front left, another constellation (forget the name) to my front right and I could see a cluster of stars and individual stars where these lights kept disappearing. I scanned the sky to see when I would see the lights again and it was evident that when they looked like they fizzled out, that was the last I was going to see of them.  It almost gave the impression they went into a door, portal or whatever it was, to make them disappear.  I waited after the 7th one for almost 5 minutes to realize that the show was over. The thing too, is that had they turned to make it harder to see them, they would have eventually straightened out and I would have seen them again.  This did not happen.  I rushed home, set all the stuff down, grabbed my digital camera and went back out there.  I waited around another 10-15 minutes; I was hoping to see something again but nothing else happened. I called NBC WEEK 25 to inquire about this sighting and was transferred, but no one answered and it did not go to voicemail to leave a message.  I then decided to E-mail them but no one has responded as of yet.  I have also been scouring the internet for the past two days, to see if anyone posted this sighting, to no avail.  I really want to know if anyone else saw these and possibly know if these orbs are indeed UFO’s or drones or something else.  I only know they are nothing I have ever seen before. One last thing I would like to point out is that when I was back out there with my camera, a plane went overhead that was very high-the height of a cross-country flight.  And I could see it fairly well, the blinking lights, the movement and such and the orbs I had seen earlier made this plane pale in comparison.",2018-09-27T00:00:00,40.73239708939709,-89.61464490644491

As I pulled out of my driveway there was the short drive to a stop sign.  I live  in  a rural  area adjacent to the Outer Banks of North Carolina.  There  was no traffic to be seen…also not  unusual for my area and sparsely populated.  I looked across the highway to an uncultivated, empty field and as I glanced up I could see one cloud that was not moving.  It seemed to be cirrus type of cloud only very low in the sky.  I believe the cloud was  not more than 3000 to 4000 feet in elevation.  The bottom portion was thick and the top portion was wispier.  There was a section at the top that was empty of any cloud material and blue sky  could be seen clearly through it. I was immediately drawn  to this cloud.  I exited my car and leaned back on the front never taking my eyes off of the cloud.  I have no idea how I knew, but I was fully aware that there was an occupied object  of some type  seemingly “hiding” in that cloud.  I occurred to me that the object, which I could not see, must be giving off some type of electrical energy or radiation.  Why else would a person stand in the middle of the street in 30 degree weather  with no coat on. I watched this cloud, I think without blinking, for a good 7-10 minutes.  I knew something was going to happen…again, I am not sure how.  As if following my wishes, as I was cold and grew impatient  for the event I knew was going to come,  a silver/grey disk rose up in clear view.  Simultaneously, the object took  off  at a speed I can’t begin to explain.  Speed  like  that would kill a human.. the  G-force must have been off the chart.  I tracked it with my eyes, but at the speed it was traveling my eyes were not quick enough and for a moment, I lost track.  I kept my eyes steady and picked it up again and followed the object down range until it appeared  the size of a pinhead.  It headed up, punched through the blue sky and seemingly out of the atmosphere.  I was so close to this event  that I could see the craft was 25-35 feet in diameter.  Also, as it rose up and blasted away, it also took the cloud with it.  I looked back, stunned out of my mind, and there was nothing w! here the cloud had been. I never did go to the store.  I went straight  back to my apartment and felt that I had been jerked from the reality that  we all live in to another completely different place.  Little did I know that there was more to come.

It was flying real low like the height a small airplane is when it is spraying a field but much slower.  I watched it fly over and it got lower and lower.

My friend enlisted in the Air Force and several years ago we met in person after he retired from the Air Force as a career Air Traffic Controller.   Of course, the elephant in the room was our ""encounter"" when we were kids. Our recollection was exactly the same of the event which occurred in the Summer around 1960.  What the three of us witnessed in Northern Ohio that night was 3 white “lights” hovering among the tree branches about 10-15 feet above us.  Their glow could be seen through the tree leaves beneath these ""white lights"".  They were about the size of large, round dinner plates and appeared to be almost flat.  There were no other light sources in the backyard of my friend’s house. Now here is where it gets unbelievable........ I threw a couple small rocks at these ""lights"" and they moved to avoid being hit. Any explanation would be appreciated.",,41.4969,-82.0176

On this evening, I had stepped out onto the back porch to enjoy a cool snap that had lowered the humidity.  As I looked above me at the stars, we live out tin the country and i do this often, I could see many stars visible in the night sky.  As I turned around to look behind me to see the stars, I noticed that a lot of the sky was blocked out.  At first glance it seems to be cloud cover moving in.  But then I noticed this assumed cloud cover had shape. I watched as it moved toward my position and for a strange feeling in my stomach as if I began to get nervous over something about to happen.  I could see the stars reappearing behind the dark shape starting just above the horizon.  As the shape continued to move I opened the back door and yelled for my wife to come out and to get her thoughts on what I was seeing.  She came out and I pointed out this large triangular shape in the shy that continued to grow in size.  I cannot say for sure how big this thing was but it ! made no noise and had several white beacon lights at the tips of the shape and at the top point of the triangular shape.  It was moving pretty slow as it passed silently overhead and the entire sky was blacked out yet there was no noise.  It was no doubt that it was directly overhead and the flashing light made out the shape of the wings but did not reflect off of the aircraft. I could not see the light on top anymore and the lights on either side looked to be miles from where we were standing bot left and right.  I tried to get it on my phone but nothing showed up.  As far as I looked in all directions, this craft blocked out the night sky.  We were both taken aback and felt an incredible erie feeling as it seemed like it took forever to pass by.  About ten minutes had passed as I kept pressing my smart watch to see.   We continuedto watch the night sky reappear as the craft or whatever it was, continue on its path until suddenly it just vanished.  The sky just popped up in the pla! ce where the craft was blocking it out.  There was no flash or anything that would have gave an indication of some engine firing up or exhaust being let out.  We stood and looked at each other in silence, no words.  But there was a fear in each others eyes as we had no words or explanations for what we just saw.  As we entered the house, my wife said over and over up until the point of falling asleep....""there was no sound, there was no sound.  It was too big and too close for no sound.""  The next morning we stepped out at 3:30 am (normal work time for us) with our coffee and stood silent gazing in all directions until she said again to me """"Honey, there was no sound"" I had no response as I too was hung over from the fear and questions I had running through my own thoughts.  All I could think of was if this was what I thought it was, ""They"" could come in the night and we would never know they had arrived. If they wanted to do us harm there would be no noise to wake us or give us a moment to react. This incident will stick with the both of us for the rest of our lives.  I have had my sceptical thoughts on many things including UFO's.  But after this night I think my mind has changed dramatically!  I analyze things to death and look for obvious answers and usually sedunk everything.  I find myself not being able to concentrate today as my mind is fixed on the answer to this.   FYI I and my wife are drug and alcohol free.  I somehow wish I could explain it away from intoxication.  But now both of us are drunk from the lack of answers and understanding of this incident.  We both said this morning before leaving for work to not discuss this to any friends or family.  But I found your website and had to get it off my chest.  I am not ex military....but I can say with almost !00% certainty that what we saw did not come from our government, or even the planet we know!",2018-08-10T00:00:00,33.3145,-87.2605

You could see in the sky forever as the sky was very clear and it was rather bright that night with the long days of July.  We saw what we thought was a tornado in the sky approaching our homes.  It was enormous.  It was wide at the top and then trailed off to a skinny tail.  We ran home and I announced to my brother and father that there was a tornado coming and we have to take shelter.  Neither one of them moved an inch.  They said the sky was clear and no warning on TV for tornados.  They just did nothing.  I ran to my friends house and he was out back on the porch with his sister as I recall starting at this weird cloud moving through the sky.  It was not a tornado.  It was a cloud I can best describe as a snake or caterpillar.  It has a beginning and an end and was the same thickness throughout.  We we first saw it I guess it was like looking at train tracks with them wide up close then barrow in the distance and that is why we thought it was a tornado.  I watched close and saw a craft moving inside the cloud as it made it's way across the sky.  It was higher up then before I would say and was directly in front of us now.  I wanted to get a closer look.  I ran home and grabbed my brother's telescope. I set it up on my friends porch and tried to look at the craft.  I could not get a fix on it with the high power scope.  I looked through the smaller spotting scope attached to it and got a clear view of the cloud and the craft.  It looked like the cloud was leading and concealing the craft.  The craft flew very strangely.  I can best describe it as a how a moth flies.  All different directions, but making forward progress.  It never left the cloud area and was about in the middle of the snake body of the cloud.  It bounced around rapidly like a pin ball.  It had lights of three colors that were blinking.  All of the sudden, it was a! s if it knew I had an clear view of everything, and this is the most fascinating part to me, the cloud made a very sharp ninerg degree turn away from me.  It was like the cloud was in a tube.  The snake like cloud followed right along the path of the head and the ship did the same.  It was pretty high in the sky now.

My 15 year old also took notice and he grabbed my phone and took a short video. The video captures a bright object but it was too high to tell what it was.  It wasn’t an airplane because we saw airplanes flying around and we see them all the time.  They always fly at a low level because they follow the same pattern into LaGuardia.  We also see the pattern of airplanes flying into Newark Airport.   It wasn’t a helicopter because it was way too high.  It wasn’t a balloon because the movement wasn’t scattered the way a balloon moves with the wind and the wind at that time “I checked” was blowing SE at 8.1mph.

However the birds I was hearing I was familiar with what they were (sandhill cranes).  I decided to whip out my smart phone and take a picture of the area where I could hear them.  I took the picture to see approximately how many where flying around.  I ended up taking two pictures. When I got back in the house to look at my pictures to find the birds, I noticed a triangular object in one of the two pictures I took.  I found the object before finding the birds in the picture.  The birds are a large bird with a wingspan of 6'8"".  In the opposite direction of the birds is the triangular object.  The object seems to be in only one of the two pictures.  The pictures are taken five seconds apart according to the time stamp.  One other item in the picture is an airplane with it's contrails.

The next thing I remember the area I was in had suddenly changed which I could not recognize, I was so confused, my watch now said 1pm and the further I drove I realized I was in south London. Then I noticed an older man walking his dog which I mention because it was the former prime minister Harold Wilson much also to my surprise. That just seemed to confuse me more but I don't know why. I think I found a public phone next and called someone because of this and was worried about being late for the audition. The moment I got home to my parents I was frantic to get a map to trace my journey and tried explaining to my Mom that I lost an hour of time, still disturbed by it all. Again in the 80's I was driving late winter afternoon close to an air force base in Oxfordshire and just inside the perimeter fence behind some trees I saw rotating lights exactly as you see on ufo reports, and it could definitely see a round craft they were on even though it was dark because of the lights. It must have been about at least 30 feet wide. I remember thinking was I the only one seeing this?  There was a lot of traffic around. Since those days this has never left my mind and it's hard to tell people so I try not to for obvious reasons. In the last few years I still have had strange experiences, again driving home one night my car sped up and crashed into a hedge on the opposite side of a country road near my home totally out of my control but nothing wrong with the car. Night dreams of  flying in front of people are fairly common, and one night I was thrown out of bed into the furniture splitting my head open badly which scared me a lot. Other times I woke feeling suffocating and being held down then it went as I woke up. At times I wake up with marks on my body that look like injections or something else, one recently was a bruise on my arm with a small puncture which although the bruise has gone the mark has not even now over a month ago. Another strange thing is how I can think of something out of the blue and then the same day it comes up on tv or something as if I knew it was coming. I'm 62 now and not in the best of health physically but I have no history of mental illness nor in my family in fact, we are all quite intelligent. There are other incidents I'm struggling to remember but suffice to say these are the main ones. I now research this a lot, hoping to get some peace from it all one day.

They seemed like they were about 30-50 yards in front of me and maybe 30-40 feet above the ground.  There were 5 lights that lit up in a pattern going left to right.  The first 3 lights were in a straight line and then the fourth light was higher and the fifth was back in line with the first three.  So it gave a triangular pattern with the fourth light.   I was traveling approximately 65 mph and I never got closer to the lights or drove under them.  I watched them blink in this pattern for probably 3 minutes and then suddenly when the fifth light went out, I could see it shoot straight up in the sky as the light dissipated.   At that very moment, my car engine seemed to stop for 1-2 seconds and the check engine light came on.  I was so scared and instantly wondered if anyone else had seen this.  I noticed maybe 3-4 cars on the highway traveling in the opposite direction. I pulled off at the next exit that had a gas station.  I turned my car off and started it back up.  The check engine light was off and everything seemed back to normal. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2018-09-13T00:00:00,,

The Floating Spinning Tetrahedron September, 2013   The incident happened about 3 weeks ago.  The whole family was asleep and my son and his cousins had fallen asleep in the bedroom while playing the game cube.  I fell asleep in the living room on the floor.  I remember waking up and being fully awake I could not see the clock, so I did not know the time but it was late at night and past 1:00am because I had fallen asleep at about that time after checking on the children.  I was fully awake and noticed that a light was coming in from the kitchen window.  I didn’t think anything was amiss at first until I realized the light was becoming brighter and was an intense shade of blue.  It was then a spinning tetrahedron (pyramid shaped) entered in through the window.  It passed right through the window.  It was spinning very fast and was about the size of a Rubik’s cube, that I am sure we all have played with at one time.  I know it was blue and was also emitting a blue light but I remember I could not see the light emanating from the pyramid but it seemed to be the source, sort of like looking at the light from a flashlight but the light is coming from outside the flashlight it was really strange.   I started to feel afraid, especially for the children, when in my head I heard, “Do not be afraid, we will not harm you or your house.”  I was no longer afraid but I could not move, I don’t know if from shock or if something was stopping me, but I did not move.  The pyramid then went slowly past the doorway and into the bedroom, where the boys were and I could not see it but I could see the blue light.  Then after what seemed to be only a few seconds it came back into the doorway and into my field of view and went out the window again.  I could see the light fading from the window it was moving away and up. I seemed to gather my senses back and leapt up from the floor and bolted into the bedroom.  I made sure they were all breathing and sleeping.  Everything was fine so I ran back to the window hoping to get a glimpse ! of this thing again but it was gone.  I then went back to my bed on the floor and lie down and fell asleep so fast I am sure I broke some kind of record.  I did not even dream any more that night.  I guess I just soaked the experience into my brain.  I do remember, vividly, that now, as I looked at the pyramid as it was spinning and bobbing it looked exactly like a ""Star of David"", if you can believe that. A few weeks after the flying, spinning pyramid incident.  Something caught my eye in the window where it came in.  I noticed that the window was....deformed, for lack of a better term at the moment.  The first 3 photos show the window and you can barely make out the pyramid shaped indentations where it left its mark.  The last 3 photos are from an idea I had of giving it a background, roughly the same color, using a shirt of mine, LOL.  The effect was rather weird, take a look. As with anything of this nature, take it with a grain of salt, but It still occupies my thoughts a lot, as the window pane is still there and I look at it daily, LOL.  This is, by far, the strangest series of events that happened to me, but I don't think it will be the last, LOL, lucky me.

This is a country road about 12 or so miles with many curves and heavily forested.  There are no sidewalks or safe places to walk.  There are many houses off the road and usually the owners are the only people you'll ever see standing on the road waiting for cars to clear so they can cross and check their mailbox.   Today, about a few hundred yards before the Ladd Hill Rd. stop sigh and intersection I saw two strange looking ""people"" walking east along the road towards Wilsonville, i.e. in the same direction I was going.  Both were tall and thin enough to notice, in other words maybe 6'2"" or 6'3"".  Both wearing black calf-length boots and brown close-fitting clothing with what appeared to be dark colored jackets.   As I came up on them they seemed to be walking with a strange sort of gait.  (I'm pretty sure this is not just my imagination) I was not driving fast but I seemed unable to get a good look at their heads (almost like they were blurred) and as I drove past them and looked in my rear view mirror they actually seemed to turn their heads so I could not get a look at their faces!  This all seemed unusual to me.  You just don't see people walking on that road, and if you ever do it's usually a ""hippy kid"" who is trying to get your attention, thumbing a ride, not avoiding you looking at them.  Strange.

My daughters excitedly called for me to come see something else in the sky.  A circular, red object appeared, seemingly out of nowhere, and held its position for approximately 20-30 seconds then faded out of sight completely.  One of my daughters actually had binoculars in hand and viewed it through that.  It was an opaque red, with an orange-ish halo effect.  We kept vigil on the deck and about ten minutes later two separate ones appeared with one about 15 to 20 degrees off the horizon, a little to the left of Mars, and then way off to the right there was another one simultaneous, and higher in the sky.   Astonished, we waited and for the last sighting of the night, one red light appeared, while the other two appeared in apprimately the same area and degree of the first sighting.  But what made this even more fascinating was that this last one actually started with one red light, then added another red light, and then another.  For a total of three red lights seeming to be on one object, slightly angled.  It reminded me of the lights coming on in the Phoenix lights case.  Except this was much smaller, at least from our vantage point.  And then all five lights in the sky vanished and that was the last we saw of the red lights.

IT WAS AMAZING.  But, that does not take away from the fact that what we saw last night was totally unidentifiable.   I would also like to state that I AM a believer in the UFO community.

One by one, four additional lights appeared in close proximity to one another.  The lights illuminated one by one towards the horizon.  When all six were illuminated, they formed a perfectly straight line at extremely high altitude. From my position, the objects were located approximately 14 inches above the horizon line, and the line they formed was approximately 1 1/2 inches long.  There was no structure visible, only the light the objects emitted.  The light did not twinkle, strobe, or otherwise alter in luminosity.

I love star gazing, so I was initially just looking right above me at the stars.  Just north of Oldsmar, I noticed an intense flash of light in the corner of my eye.  It should be noted that this intense light was not as intense as lightening which envelopes the space around you.  It was like a flash of a camera.  I turned my floaty to lock my eyes on that area to see if I'd notice a flash again and then 3 minutes later.  I saw it again.  I did not see any sort of dim light in sky in between flashes.  This flash happened every 3 minutes like clock work.  Everytime it flashed, I noticed that it was decending slowly.  Over a 30 minute time frame it went from very high in the sky to just below the tree line of the horizon.  Although it descended below the tree line, I could still see the flash as a result of Aura light emission.  At this point, I'm thinking to myself ""is this thing landing in the forest!?""  This is when things got weird and scary as hell.   All the sudden the flashing object I had been watching that descended and went below tree line and kept flashing started making its way towards me and I knew this because the actual flash  became visible again but at the same time I knew it was getting closer because it was getting bigger.  As it closer and closer to me I was scared shitless and jumped off my floaty because I was having these nightmarish thoughts that the next time I would see it flash that it would be right over me.   See that's the weird part.  I remember having these thoughts and then jumping off floaty and getting out of pool,  But apparently what I thought my reaction was never happened!  Why?  Because my wife woke me up at 6am in the floaty and my phone was in the bottom of the pool which means I never jumped off my floaty and got out of pool like I thought I did.   Here is my rational thought and theory as to what really happened and what I'm choosing to believe.  I'm thinking, after the flashing light went below the tree line that I simply fell asleep shortly after that and me having thoughts of it approaching and being right over me and me jumping off floaty and out of pool was simply a nightmarish dream after I fell asleep... Please note:  at no time did I ever see an object between flashes",2018-09-27T00:00:00,28.0444,-82.6795

Same behavior one lit up then another then they all disappeared again.  The videos that I recorded are saved to my phone and when I try to watch them they are blank.  I have no clue why these videos will not playback.  Both were about 1 minute in length and it’s showing saved videos but they say 0:00 and won’t playback.  Definitely never seen anything like what we just saw ever before.. we heard no noise associated with these lights and the sky is pretty clear.  I could see the stars out in the sky but whatever made these lights couldn’t be seen.  Wild!",2018-09-27T00:00:00,29.87903129973475,-81.36659177718833

We were within a few miles of the New Mexico border.  It was very heavily snowing and we were driving in the mountains, so it was very dangerous.   Well, off to the right, just barely above the tree tops was what I now realize to be a boomerang shape, except with points on the front of the aircraft and and points on the wingtips so not rounded like a boomerang.  It was so so so huge. Its had the round like or dome shaped lights that were all on the bottom of the aircraft.  There were 5 lights on the bottom.  There was one light at the center or front and then a light on each wing in the middle and then a light on each wing at the end near the two wing tips.   This plane was basically gliding just barely over the tree tops and it appeared to be looking for somebody. In Texas, we constantly have police helicopters shining lights down and looking for somebody, and I thought thi! s was some military plane doing the same thing.  It was gliding so so slow though.  Maybe 20 mph tops.  I could see the color of the plane due to tue snow on the ground and the moonlight helping light everything up.  It was either grey or silver in color.   I pointed it out to my wife in a shock sort of panic mostly because it was ao huge and so close. My wife kept saying where and I kept pointing it out between the trees.  I have no idea why but I am the only person of the two of us who was able to see it.  Once we passed being directly across from it, I could no longer see it.  I kept trying to see it in my rearview mirror and mirrors on my doors but I couldnt see it.  It was too dangerous due to the snow and ice on the mountains for me to use my cell phone or even pull over at all due to the semis behind me that were honestly scaring me pretty bad.  I relied on my wife and her cell phone and for whatever reason, she just couldn't see it.  I kept asking her how she could not see it because it was probably the biggest aircraft id ever seen flying that low in my life, and we were in the middle of nowhere with the only lights beyond the ones from the plane in the woods being the lights traveling along this road in front of and behind me.  I couldn't believe she couldn't see this too.  I'm not sure if anybody is familiar with this road, but its the main interstate coming out of Trinidad and close to the New Mexico border and in the area that is in the mountains and has no street lights.  I was paying attention to the surroundings on my way to Trinidad in this same area except in the day time unlike when I was driving home to Texas.  It was the middle of the night, probably around 2:00 AM or so and very very dark.  This area is the area that has a lot of very very old looking powerline poles that really make you wonder how the people who put them there, got them there because these poles were on the steepest of mountain sides but someone still got them there.  Hopefully, sonebody knows or is familiar with where I am talking about.   I spent the entire rest of my drive home googling military planes and the stealth bomber and tried to even figure out if there were new military planes that basically hover.  I came up with no answers.  It wasn't until a friend joked saying it was a probably a UFO, that I googled into triangle shaped UFOs which lead me to boomerang shaped UFOs and then once I googled boomerang UFOs, I found the exact shape and light location as the what id call UFO that I saw.  The ones that I found online were all black colored and the one I saw was not so that was the only difference in the one that I saw because the one I saw was either grey or silver or just really light in color.  They showed some boomerang UFOs online with 7 lights on the bottom.  That was not the one I saw.  The one I saw had only 5 lights on the bottom.",2018-09-13T00:00:00,37.2242,-104.3727

I have experienced one of the most beautiful sightings ever!  This is the details:  On July 24, 2018 @ our home in Roswell, Georgia, at approximately 9:50PM, we were on our driveway saying goodnight to our daughter, ((name deleted)) and Grandson, ((name deleted)).  In the car behind the wheel was ((name deleted))/grandson who is 2 yrs old and in the passenger seat was ((name deleted))/grandson who is 15 yrs old.  Myself and my other daughter, ((name deleted)) was video taping them in the car when suddenly a loud humming noise occurred and you can see ((name deleted)) reacting to it trying to get to the window to get a peek.  Since the car was parked pretty close to the garage and I was standing closest to the front of the car and the wall of our home goes out from the garage door about 12 ft. straight out.  Once the humming started I looked at the edge of the house and saw flashing colored lights that were about to come in view.  What happened next was amazing!   Moving out in front of our driveway was a small UFO and what followed was the most beautiful V-shaped UFO.  As they floated passed the V-shaped UFO slowly rotated.  My heart stopped.  Everything seemed to go in slow motion.  The V was totally covered in colored lights and in the middle of the V-shaped area was a solid surface which was dark gray and had very tiny lights spaced evenly apart.  Both UFO's were so lighted and beautiful! We are the first house when you come into our subdivision and the power lines are at the beginning of the street.  So as they passed our house they immediately started going up.  So you would think that I have pictures/videos since my camera and my daughter's camera were running.  I wanted to and tried, but cold not move the camera up.   Which I have been kicking myself since.  However, I do have the video I took that night and you can hear the humming that they made and ((name deleted--grandson)) reaction trying to see it.   Also, the video my daughter took we were able to get a screenshot from hers that show a reflection of a v-shaped object in his sunglasses.  From start to finish this experience lasted approximately 14 seconds  You can hear me in the video trying to get ((girl's name deleted)) to look, but she was focu sed on ((grandson's name deleted)).  I think I was the only one who actually saw it.  ((grandson's name deleted)) did say when he got out of the car ""so you guys have UFO's?""  The things that I learned from this was the following:  --If you are close enough, UFO's do make sound/humming. --The v-shaped are only that because of the lights on the edges.  To me they are still triangle shaped. --Don't ever assume because you have your camera rolling you are going to get the shot. Thank you for your time!  I have been pretty much obsessed with this and am hoping that writing to you helps me let go. Thank you for your attention!!",2018-09-13T00:00:00,34.04023923444976,-84.34734832535885

The other witness said that they appeared too high in the sky to be drones.  They shifted the rectangular formation and moved but there was no pattern to their movement.  They were quite bright.  At first, the thought occurred that these were some aerial part of the Fair.  But the lights could fade and disappear within seconds, leaving only 3, and then finally 1 and that one disappeared.   The lights also seemed to go far higher very quickly.  Witness 1 wondered why no one at the Fair seemed to be looking up.  Witness 2 asked someone at the Fair about these lights and that person reported to Witness 2 that he saw them, and didn’t know what they were.    They were completely gone for about 10 minutes and all of them came back in a similar linear/rectagonal form and then moved and then each one disappeared, except one of them.  Witness 1 had to urinate and was searching for a portapotty, but first saw a row of about 4 truck cabs that were parked at the Fair and was thinking of urinating there, but looked up and sure enough there was 1 amber light moving slowly towards the trucks high up.  Witness 1 decided it was not the best idea to urinate there and before he/she found a portapotty, the light completely disappeared.  The motion was not like any type motion that Witness 1 ever saw before. Witness 2 was not very impressed at the sighting.  “Even if this were aliens, so what,” she/he said.  Witness 1 was very impressed at the sighting but both witnesses are rather concerned that there was no one they felt they could make this report to.   That is the entirety of the report.

It's still clear in my mind, even though it happened over 50 years ago.  It was the evening of May the 24h, 1966, in Hayward, Wisconsin.  I was outside the house near the lake, scanning with my telescope and standing in the little open area in the grove of trees where I docked my little fishing boat.  It was about a quarter of 10.  Then, I had that feeling we all get sometimes, that something is watching you. I looked up, and there it was, a flying saucer.  It was just above the treetops, maybe a hundred feet across and twenty-five feet or so high.  It was silvery white in color with a reddish circle of lights around the center.  It made no sound.  It was not swamp gas, I've seen that before.  It moved out over the lawn and hovered in the open near the house.  The reddish lights began blinking and shining on the ground, my telescope, my boat, and the house; it reminded me of a camera taking flashbulb photos. I also remember feeling I was in no immediate danger.  In any event, I was transfixed on the spaceship.  At that moment, the object began to slowly rise up and gain speed.  It then accelerated  and raced into the stars, it was out of sight and was what would have been thousands of miles beyond the moon and the farthest stars I could make out in a manner of seconds. I rushed into the house to tell my mother what I had seen, and the news was on.  There were reports of sightings by others in the area, and in several areas in Minnesota and the Midwest.  So, I wasn't alone in seeing something that was quite obviously out of the ordinary.  Other than my mother, I never told anyone about it until years later, family and a few friends. Something that happened a few months later, on November 18, 1966, made me believe that something might be going on we don't have all the details to explain.  A military plane mysteriously crashed nearby.  Some friends of mine and I went to the site even though it was off limits and saw hunks of metal skewered into trees, an obvious area where the plane had sheared off trees as it plummeted to earth and the like.  I had the feeling that it was looking for something that day, maybe another UFO.",,46.0143,-91.2901

Evidence suggest it was waiting and watching me. UFO Sighting 9/18/18  Approx. time of sighting 9:52 P.M. 9:55 P.M  I’m out hunting elk by myself on the Washington State coast.  I’m hunting on Weyerhauser property located along Hwy 101 between the towns of Aberdeen and Raymond.  At the mile marker 69 on highway 101 there is a locked Weyerhauser gate.  The gate is located on the East side of the hwy.  I was driving the gravel roads hunting elk in the vast forest east of highway 101 behind the locked gate at mile marker 69. After an uneventful evening hunt, I decided to go to sleep early.  Once the evening hunt was over and it got dark I decided to look for a place to park my pickup truck with canopy, so I could get to sleep and get up early for the morning hunt.  I’m driving east on Sprucedale Road and I take a left onto a lesser traveled road at mile marker 10.  I drive on the side road for about 2 to 4 miles.  I come to a crest of a small hill and find a small semi flat grassy spot surrounded by taller trees.  Because of the taller trees, most of the view of the night sky was obstructed.  I didn’t check a compass but I believe my truck was facing west, and the rear of the truck was facing east.  It took me a few minutes to view the area and turn my truck around so I could park on a semi flat spot, with my head slightly elevated.  Once I parked, I gathered some stuff to get ready for bed like my cell phone flashlight and pistol.  Once I felt I had everything I needed, I shut off the truck engine and headlights. I exited the truck and walked behind the truck.  I had my back to the back tailgate of my truck and I was facing what I think was East.  I had to pee.  My view as I was standing there peeing was the gravel road as it went down the hill in the opposite direction of the way I traveled in.  Since there were no trees on the road itself.  The road provided a small opening in the sky.  I didn’t see anything unusual at all. I could hear some wrestling in the brush about 30 yards in front of me.  Probably a small animal. I finished my business and I opened the truck canopy and, crawled over the tailgate into the truck bed.  I spent the next maybe 2 minutes or less situating my sleeping bag and getting my shoes off.  I get into my sleeping bag then I notice it.  I left the damn dome light on.  Crap, it's not going off.  I must have left it on when I was gathering stuff for bed.  I get out of bed slip on my shoes open the canopy door and crawl out.  I walk over to the driver door open it and turn off the dome light.  Finally, I can go to bed and get some sleep.  I shut the truck door and turn to go to the rear of the truck. That’s when I see it.  In the small opening in the sky I was just looking at a moment earlier when I was peeing now has a fairly bright slightly reddish color light in the sky.  It seemed the light was perfectly situated in the center of the opening from my perspective.  It seemed kind of shapeless, just light, then at times it looked as if it had a subtle square shape.  Mostly it looked like light and the shape was difficult to see.  No noise. My first though was wow what the heck, that must be Venus, but it seems just a bit too large.  It was much smaller than a full moon for perspective.  I’m looking at this light and it seems to be moving wildly but slowly in a fairly large space in the sky it was maintaining.  Although it looked like it was moving, its general location in the sky was fixed.  I’m thinking is it really moving or is it that twinkle phenomenon that a star or planet gives off to give the illusion that its moving.  I am now trying to figure out if it is moving as well as the distance from me.  As far as the distance from my naked eye it seems like it might be closer than a planet would be.  At some point it looked as if the light was only 100 feet in the air.  I held myself and my head very still and looked at the tree tops and the distance from the tree tops to the light.  When I did this the light appeared to be motionless in the sky.  After I did this I didn’t see any more movement as if it stopped when I really focused on its movement.  This was confusing because it looked like it was really moving.  I walked back to the truck and grabbed my binoculars from the dash.  I looked at the light in my binoculars and I thought wow it seems further away than with the naked eye and a bit crisper, so maybe it is Venus after all I told myself.  I was going back and forth viewing this with binoculars and naked eye, trying to analyze what I was seeing.   Just when I had convinced myself this was Venus, poof it vanished.  It was instantaneous, I was staring at it intently and all of a sudden nothing was there.  Ok that freaked me out a bit, I almost dropped the binoculars.  That is defiantly not Venus or any other planet or star.  It didn’t dawn on me until after it was over, when I was analyzing the light to try and determine if it was a planet.  I forgot that I was just looking at that spot in the sky while I was peeing moments prior and there was nothing there so had I realized that I could have ruled out a planet right away. When it vanished, it didn’t fly off or streak away.  There was no left right up down movement at all.  It was there then it was gone it just disappeared from sight instantly.  There was a weird detail at the very instant it disappeared the night sky in that area seemed to go a shade lighter.  I thought holy crap, that didn’t even look real.  The light change was very subtle but I seen it.  It reminded me of older movies where the eye could pick up the subtle change in the scenery when they cut and splice scenes.  I thought the light change was like a reset or something.  It almost looked fake like a movie but not.  Omg maybe I was abducted and they just dropped me back off. Moments after it vanished, I jumped in the back of the truck bed and grabbed my cell phone and pistol.  I was a little freaked and excited.  I got into the cab started up the truck and drove away. I checked the time to see if unknowingly hours had gone by.  There was no unexplained time loss.  I felt like I was only on the site for about 10 minutes.  I called my wife to tell her what had just happened as soon as I got a block or so from the site.  The call was made at 8:56 pm. I drove back to the gate on highway 101.  I drove down the road to the park and ride about 10 miles north of the gate.  I slept the rest of the night in the back of my truck at the park and ride. The strange light was there in view for 2 or 3 minutes total. Its creepy to think about but If I hadn’t left the dome light on I would never have seen it. I would have just gone to sleep. It seems as if it waited for me to get into bed before it appeared, because it didn’t appear until I got in the truck bed and shut the canopy door, as if it was waiting for me to get in so I wouldn’t see it show up to watch me. The next morning I went back to the exact spot to investigate in the daylight. I seen nothing but forest. I don’t know what it was. I never seen it appear, but I did see it disappear.",2018-09-27T00:00:00,46.8841,-123.99499999999999

Occurred while driving southeast on Hwy 54.  Stopped and photographed the craft at this location using an iPhone 7. This craft was in close proximity to RDU International airport flying perpendicular to the main runways at a distance of approximately three nautical miles. My friend, who was in my car with me, immediately called Air Traffic Control at RDU to report the incident.  The tower should have had a visual on the craft as well as on radar.  The info was taken, but we have no information as to any observations made at the airport. UFO/UAV craft configuration:  A flying wing with two white and one red light.  The red light was in the center, with the two white lights at equal-distance at each end. The craft was moving away from us.  We were tracking it from the rear.  It was flying directly before us, above the road and on the same track.   We could not see additional shape details.  It basically looked like a straight line with three lights.  It appeared to be flying very slowly.  There was no discernible noise you would expect from an aircraft flying away from you.  I want to stress, at the first sighting, it was not some distant blip far off in the sky.  It appeared to be a very large, low flying plane at a close distance. Now, seeing aircraft constantly at RDU, everything from small commuter planes to Jumbo jets, I report the following  — The craft was of immense size, frightfully immense, dwarfing anything I have ever seen.  It is hard to evaluate the size accurately without a firm reference to distance.  It did not have standard navigation red/white/green lights, nor landing lights.  No strobes lights.  No pulsing of its lights, just the three steady lights as previously mentioned.  This is a high traffic take-off and landing pattern area.  No conventional aircraft would be flying in this area without strobes, nav-lights and landing lights full on.  It would be an FAA violation and a severe hazard unless it was in communication ATC and had clearance. The sighting was as follows:  We were headed south on Airport Blvd and turned left onto Chapel Hill Rd/Hwy 54 in a southeast direction.  I noticed what I momentarily thought were aircraft lights forward and above us at a close distance.  I immediately realized it was not a conventional airplane and said to my friend, “That’s a UFO.”  She scoffed, looking at the three lights and assumed it was three airplanes.  She then realized, as I had, that this was a single craft and there was structure between the lights.  She yelled to me to, “Pull over, pull over and take a picture!” I had to drive, watch this thing, and find a safe place to pull over.  As you will see in the photo that I did manage to get, there were other cars on the road.  This is not some deserted country lane in the middle of nowhere.  She, in the excitement, was unable to find her phone buried in her backpack fast enough.  And is now giving me grief that I didn’t put the phone in video mode.   After I got the photo, we followed down the road trying to get to a more open view.  This is an Eastern US road with trees on both sides and the leaves are still on.  While she kept it in view for a short while, less than a minute, it was then lost in the trees and horizon.  She immediately called RDU Air Traffic Control to report the sighting.

I live 20 miles west of Chicago O'Hare airport so there's always planes in the sky.  At the time I seen the triangle ""craft"" I thought ""that's kind of an odd lighting pattern"".  For the size I'd say about the same as a mid-sized jetliner.  For altitude  maybe 1,000'. What is odd is I heard engines powering the craft but it wasn't going as fast as a typical jetliner. The reason that I took so long to report this is that I've been thinking about it and been watching the night skies for the same lighting pattern...with no luck.  At the time I seen it I was thinking that a Ufoligist would call it a UFO...that made me chuckle a bit as all reports I've ever read or heard said they were a silent craft.. .But I heard the soft roar of engines??!!",2018-09-13T00:00:00,,

It was about 1/4 the size of the full moon when it rose, much larger than any starts or aircrafts we could see in the sky.   When it rose to the height of an airplane, it moved across the sky to the Southern side of the lake.  It stopped moving or slowed down significantly for at least 7 seconds.  It then suddenly and very rapidly moved East towards Mars (which was visible to us and looked like a very bright star).  It moved as if it was shooting off. It then disappeared as if the light had just gone out.",2018-08-10T00:00:00,45.4677,-92.376

About 10 minutes later I looked up to see that the lights were closer than before when I left the house as well as higher in the sky.  When I started to look at the lights I noticed that there were 3 lights in a triangular shape at the bottom of base I guess you could call it, with another single light at the top..   I then noticed that there was a weird shape sort of like a pyramid and that the lights were part of an object and not separate lights.  I can't really determine the size but it was flying lower than an airplane and was still about the size of my thumb if I held it out in front of me.   There weren't any distinguishable colors of the shape other than a sort of hazy looking transparency.  The lights were orangish yellow.  But I looked at the object for maybe 10 minutes until it got too far me to see.  The direction it was going was straight up when it got out of sight.  That is all I can recall and it's pretty exact on what happened.",2018-08-10T00:00:00,34.2988,-89.9478

The object reminded me of a glider with a very high aspect wing ratio (I would estimate about 25:1), and was a dull gray metallic color.  What I could not discern was any sign of engines, propellers, fuselage, or tail.  It was almost like a thick line, but slightly swept.  It was moving slowly from south to north.   I observed the object for approximately 10 seconds before it went out of view behind some trees.  It was only faintly visible due to its color, but my polarized sunglasses helped me see it better.  I could not tell its altitude, but it was below the high cirrus clouds, which I estimated to be 20,000 ft based on local air traffic, but above the lower, puffy cumulus clouds.  I tried and tried to see any other features, but there were none.  If it was a glider (I have seen plenty of those) or even a predator drone (we live near the Redstone Arsenal), its fuselage would have been visible, but was not.   Based on my observation, I would place the wing span somewhere around 300 ft, tip to tip. I have attached a rendering of the object I saw to a separate email.
