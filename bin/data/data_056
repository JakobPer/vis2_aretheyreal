At approximately 2125 Pacific Daylight Time, September 8, 2009, I was leaving a friends home walking to my truck.  I noticed two bright, -2 to -4 star-like objects in the western sky.  At first I thought they were stars but their obvious motion eliminated that possibility.  The second thought was that they were aircraft, possibly jetliners at high altitude.  But their apparent path, traveling from west to east eliminated that possibility as well.  (Commercial aircraft at altitude DO NOT normally travel from east to west over this area.  The normal path for commercial air traffic is north-south, generally traveling between the major west coast airports of Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and Los Angeles.  Aircraft heading east from this area do so at lower altitudes taking off from the local airport the turning east.) 	Viewing conditions were clear, with no clouds.  The two lights were the brightest objects in the sky while they were visible. I called my friend over to view these objects and she was startled at their apparent motion across the night sky.  We thought they might be satellites but that was dispelled when the lead light changed course from a west-east direction to a north by northeast course. Having had years of observing satellites, (I’m old enough to have seen Sputnik’s first crossing of the Pacific Northwest sky) the speed of these two lights was much faster than a normal satellite.  Their apparent altitude was within the atmosphere but very high up.  I say this because there was no “twinkle” as with the other star objects visible at the time of this sighting. These two lights were traveling at identical speeds.  The lead light was ahead and north of the second as viewed from the ground.  The first light passed in front of the Big Dipper.  The second light, from our viewing location passed below the Big Dipper and farther south than the first.  I would guess the observed separation to be between 40 to 60 degrees north to south and about the same west to east. Shortly after the first light changed course it went vertical.  In less than ten seconds it disappeared from sight.  From our viewing point (I’ll send the actual Latitude and Longitude if you like) the first light disappeared just a little west of the constellation Cassiopeia. Right after the first one disappeared the second light changed course the same as the first.  Then it too went vertical and in less than ten seconds disappeared.  The second light followed the same vertical course as the first. There was no sound accompanying these two lights.  We listened long and hard to try to hear the faintest of sounds but heard none. These lights might have been military aircraft but the vertical acceleration argues against that idea.  Also, for two military jets to go vertical at such velocity would have required a considerable burn from their engines.  No engine noise or glow was seen. Once the two lights went vertical they faded from sight. Thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD))",2009-12-12T00:00:00,44.073170796460175,-122.93638849557522

As i moved to the house, I noticed that the lights started moving towards me.  My guess is that it was about an 40 yard walk.  The object drew nearer to my house at a very steady rate.  I ran about 10 yards to the door just being freaked out. Out of panic i rushed in and yelled for my father who was sitting in his chair.  He immediatley got up and both of us proceeded to go out on front porch.  At my surprise the object was directly above us.  This is where my opinions differ from other reports. As the object flew from the mountains it looked flat, like the oters reported, all 3 lights were horizantal.  When we got out on the porch, the object was above us and the lights were then vertical, as if it completely turned on it's side.  There was no noise.   The object seemed to be about the length of a football field. I ran into house to get a video recorder which is where this got scary. When I returned to the porch, lights still there, it was like an ery feeling in the air.  We had a barn with horses in it. These horses (apprx. 4) were screaming-not normally.  They were kicking the walls.  There screams were terrorizing and as this continued there were also dogs up the road that were carring on too! As i went to record this the object just vanished. within minutes everything seemed back to normal. This is something that my father as well I, have never discussed with anyone! One out of fear of what we saw and heard, two--the normal, we're nuts column. We lived in Centreville, PA along rt 220 (I-99). Between 2 mountains-- one is called Wills Mountain, not sure of the other.  There are also 2 dams thereas well. (Koont'z Lake). Centreville lies between Bedford, Pa (about 15 miles) and Cumberland, Md (about 15 miles).  It's a very small town, mostly farm and woodlands. I do not live here no more but do live in Bedford, Pa.  My father resides in Cumberland, Md. These statements ARE true. The lights were big red circlular lights.  I have never seen an aircrat of that size-speed-or quiteness. Nor one that would turn sideways and just hover there with no noise. Again, thanks for your time to read, i am not looking for publicity.

In about 1991, I witnessed two apparently flat, square, gray objects in the sky. The objects were identical, and moved as one. As an engineer, I would estimate the objects were approximately a half-mile away from me, and were 50 feet to 100 feet wide, each. They were closer to each other than their widths. That is, they were not very far from each other. They were both vertically oriented squares, that is, they were not ""diamond"" shaped. They appeared to be without much depth, or so it seemed as I was unable to determine if they had a depth due to my viewing them straight on. The two squares appeared to me by descending from the clouds. The clouds were not very high; maybe a few thousand feet. The squares descended from the clouds, to the point they were just below the clouds, then they moved to the west. I was facing south so they shifted across the sky to the right. They only moved 1000 feet or so when they stopped, remained still for a few seconds, and then receded into the clouds again. I estimate the entire sighting lasted only 30 seconds. 2.  In 1993, I was swimming alone in the pool one summer night. The weather was nice and warm and the sky was clear. I was floating on my back in the water just looking up at the stars. My body was oriented from east to west, with my feet being to the east. I noticed a red light high in the sky that appeared from my right, from the south. I began following the light with my eyes although I remained in a laying position floating in the water. The red light appeared to be a common aircraft flying high in the sky. I watched the light move toward me and thought nothing of the fact that it was an ordinary airplane or an airliner, but at this point, I gave it no thought at all – I was just watching it fly over me. When the light reached my 11 o’clock position in the sky, it stopped dead. This was very strange to me, as I know planes don’t just stop in the sky. I rose up out of the water to see if I could hear the craft, as it may have been a helicopter, but it was not making a sound. The light was not flashing. I stood in the water looking up at the still, red light with amazement, trying to figure out what I was looking at. After a few seconds of being still, the red light moved again, but not how it was moving before. Previously, the red light was moving across the night sky in a slow, steady fashion, which gave me the impression it was an ordinary aircraft flying by in the night. However, after being still for a few seconds, the red light began moving to the north again. It went from my 11 o’clock position to out of sight as if it had been fired from a gun. It zipped across the sky at what must have been thousands of miles per hour and it was out of my sight in a second, or maybe less than a second.

I saw this UFO sometime in November 1991. I don't remember the exact day. I decided to go get a hair cut. So I borrowed my Mom's car and headed out. It was between 7-8 in the evening. It was dark too. The first thing I noticed as I was driving along was the unusual amount of lights in the sky. There were a number of planes or helicopters all over, but not close enough for me to hear or identify them. As I traveled west on Sycamore in Pasadena, TX, I came to T interesection and stop sign at Beltway 8. I believe its called E Sam Houston Parkway now. Back then it was not a toll road. I looked to my left and saw the traffic was stopped down at the Spencer Hwy intersection. I turned right and headed north. Almost immediately I looked over to my left and saw something that grabbed my attention. About a hundred yards across Beltway 8 from my location (I measured it on Google Earth) there is a field with 2 bill boards on the north and south side. Hovering above the field was a large black shape. It was between the bill boards (at least appeared to be so). It had no lights on it. I slowed down to almost a complete stop, turned off the radio, and rolled down the window. There was no sound coming from the object. I should have stopped the car and gotten out so I could get a really good look, but I was so surprised I didn't really think about it. Within a minute from me sighting the ""craft"" it began to slowly ascend into the sky. It was quite large, but I could not see any detail because it was blacked out. I am not sure if it was a ""saucer"" shape or not since I was looking at it from the side. But it was not very thick. I circled around at the U-Turn on Pine as it slowly moved upward. When I was under it on the opposite side from where I started I could tell it was quite wide. I circled around back at Spencer and watched it float high and higher, and I ended up at a light down by Pasadena Blvd/Red Bluff intersections. At some point the dark shape lit up into a ball of light. I'm not sure how else to describe it. Then suddenly it flashed northward toward me. When I say it flashed I actually mean it flashed. It moved so fast that it left a trail of light behind it. As it came toward my location it did a 180 degree change in flight and flashed southward toward the Gulf of Mexico and did a zig zag. Again, it moved so fast that it left a light trail behind it. It looked to have slightly ascended in its trajectory as it took off.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,29.676929430379747,-95.1784835443038

Our room was on the 5th floor. Since our room was in the middle of the hotel it became the meeting place for everyone. The first morning we were there, which was November 26 at about 9 am the room began to shake ever so slightly. We turned on the TV to find that there was a 5.4 earthquake.  We were delighted to have a great story to tell when we got home back to Texas. What happened next, paled in comparison to the earthquake. The last night we were there, Saturday November 28, 1992, we ate out and those of us staying at the hotel came back to pack for Sunday’s departure back to our respective homes across the country.  My husband and children went to sleep around 9:30. My two nephews who had other rooms at the same hotel, came to our room to visit.  The room was sort of a one bedroom suite with a separate living area that had a balcony. We went to the balcony at 10:30, I remember because I checked the time and checked on my family who were all asleep. I was on the balcony with my two nephews ( aged 24 and 26) we could see the layout of the area below which was like a courtyard where people were sitting at tables and walking around. We chatted and enjoyed people watching as well. All of a sudden, as if someone on the roof had thrown it, I saw what appeared to be a football shaped object bright white light come down in an arc (it did not fall straight down, it arched from the roof to in front of us) to eye level where it seemed to hover in front of us. I happened to be looking up at the sky or roof when it first appeared so I saw it from the get go. I remember one nephew saying, ""What is that?""  The light or whatever it was hovered in front of us for what seemed to be a few seconds then took off like a bullet horizontally and as it did so, it changed color from bright white light to a neon green, with the green advancing from the front to the rear of the object as it changed color, it disappeared into the darkness. Suddenly, we realized it was 3:00 AM, we were sort of surprised that the time flew by, they left to their rooms and we all went right to sleep. The next morning, we gathered our things said our goodbyes and headed to the airport. While on the plane to Dallas, I suddenly remembered and told my husband, ""We saw a UFO or something.""  He was quite amazed and had me tell him the whole story.  He found it significant that neither of the nephews had mentioned it, and I had not remembered it when we were all together that morning. My eyes started bothering me beginning that day on the plane ride home. I was seeing spots in front of my eyes like you see after flash photography. I assumed it would go away. By Monday, I was trying to get in touch with my nephews to see what or if they were experiencing something. The younger of the two told his mother who told me that in the night of the sighting, he had a bad nightmare that something had him tied down to a table and was trying to hurt him  By Thursday of the same week, my eyes were somewhat better, but the spots were still there. So, I went to the eye Dr. He checked and said that I had damage similar to an arc welders burn at the back part of the inside of my eye. He asked if I had been near anyone while they were welding. I told him no, not at all. He said the spots would go away in a few more days and they eventually did. When I was finally able to speak to my nephews about our experience, neither really wanted to discuss it other than to say it was the strangest thing they’d ever seen.  Neither of them could understand why it was 10:30 then 3:00 and why time flew by, furthermore none of us could understand why we all seemed to forget about it completely until I remembered. The nephew that had the nighmare said he didn’t want to talk about it, so I dropped it. Page 2 UFO Experience cont’d. I became obsessed with this experience.  Since the Internet was not available at the time, I went to the Dallas Public Library. I asked the Librarian how to report a UFO. She turned to a reference book, and gave me two names.  The first of which was in Phoenix, AZ. To this day, I cannot remember the man’s name. I called him and he took down the incident.  He may have had me make a drawing and mail it or fax it to him. He had the oddest monotone voice, very deep but without emotion or inflection.  He assured me he would look into it.  A few weeks later, he called me and told me that he went to the Four Seasons, he actually stayed in our room (back then I knew the room number and gave it to him-now I can only remember 5th floor) he said that in daylight, the direction at which the bright white object that turned green went on the horizontal level would have taken it into a shopping mall on Robertson Blvd. He said that was not logical. Furthermore, he said that green lights are a phenomenon that occurs around earthquakes and have nothing to do with UFO’s.   His conclusion was that what we saw were those lights. Obviously, I forgot this man’s name because he did not tell me what I wanted to hear.  He did not validate what we knew we saw, a UFO.  We knew it was a UFO and have known all this time. He had no explanation as to why the object changed color from white to green as it went horizontal and shot off faster than I can type it. We know what we saw was a UFO.  We were not UFO buffs at the time.  This thing or even seeing it was the farthest thing from our minds.  What I do know is this thing to me was real. It was an experience I will never forget, and it opened my mind to the fact that we are not alone. As a sidebar to this experience, when I took the film from our California trip to be developed the girl that was working at the photo shop asked me who was my trip.  Well, I told her all about the UFO. She told me that on her way to work a week earlier she saw a diamond shaped UFO which seemed to follow her from Plano, Texas, (along FM 544) to Carrollton, Texas, which is where the photo processing store was. Not just her, but suddenly I found out I knew other people who had seen UFO’s right here in our area.

Right before we started to pack up to leave we heard this bone chilling cry behind us.  When I say “bone chilling” is was not a cry of anything I have ever heard of before on this planet.  It was loud and long.  I will never forget what it sounded like.  We both JUMPED UP!  It was just starting to get dark,  just a minute after the sun set.  We were around twenty feet off the side of my jeep.  There was a dirt bream about another 30 feet past the jeep.  It was slightly wooded with quite a bit of brush.  I shined my flashlight at where the sound came from.  What we saw in the reflection of the light I also will never forget.  These two large eyes were looking right at us.  They had a green/orange fluorescent look to them and were oval, pinched at the ends and slightly sloping down at the centers.  Then it howled again.  We could see the outline of its mouth in its eyes. It had a fairly large mouth.  We watched it for 20 seconds or so longer then all of a sudden it vanished.  Then as fast as the ambient light from my flashlight could move it would reappear.  And it howled again.  It moved a couple more times and howled a couple of more times.  It could move through the brush and the trees SSSOOO  Fast!  I could move around 40-60 feet as fast as my flashlight could move its beam of light.  It would move within a ½ second of one spot to another.  We were pretty freaked out by this time.  I turned all my fishing poles around so the reels were extended outward incase I had to start beating something over the head.  We scrambled to my jeep and got the hell out of there as fast as we could.  My girlfriend cried for hours after that because she was so freaked out. The next day my buddy and I went back there so I could do some investigating and see if I could find anything that would help explain what the creature was.  We eventually called it the (Waubonsee Monster) because we saw it out by the waubonsee college.  Any way I didn't find anything.  No footprints, broken branches- Nothing!  I couldn't figure how anything could move through the brush and scrub that fast.  How anything could move that fast anywhere.   Well going forward. My buddy and I started fishing again for a little while.  We packed our stuff up again and started to walk towards my jeep up a slight hill.  When we got to the clearing by the jeep, where there was also a clearing that opened up to a corn field.  We both stopped in our tracks and coming at us from across the corn field just about 10-15 feet above treetop level was some craft that had quite a few lights on it.  It also had some sort of spot light that it shined right on us for about 2 seconds.  Then it made a 90 degree turn and zipped out of there Very! Very! Fast. The craft did not have any sound what so ever.  You can imagine how quiet a small stone quarry is at sunset.  Well this craft was one hundred percent soundless.  Even gliders have some kind of sound and we could have heard a pin drop 200 yards away it was that quiet out. One or other of the events would have been pretty exceptional.  But to have them happen in two consecutive nights is really pretty profound. I truly believe that what we saw the first night was some type of extraterrestrial.  I know it was not any creature of this earth.  And then the next night to see the craft in the same location.  Pretty neat!!!!!!!!!! I don't know too many people who can say that they have actually seen an extraterrestrial and a UFO like I have.   Well that my story.  Make of it what you like but I know what I saw and truly believe it was ""Out Of This World Thanks ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was walking to the bus stop an I saw a craft fly across the sky.  It was shaped like a blimp, but also had some characteristics that are not normally associated with a blimp.  It had a big, orange, oval shaped glow on the bottom of it. It also had lights all over the side of it.  The lights did not all light at the same time.  They each blinked, one at a time, randomly, really fast.  Each light only flashed for a second or two.  They were not in rows or in a pattern.  They scattered all over the side of the craft.  I could only see them when they blinked.  It was a pretty close view.  It was far up in the sky, but definetly closer than a air plane.  It DID make a sound.  I guess it was an engine or hover craft sound.  I'm not sure how to describe it.  I don't clearly remember the sound.  I wondered about it and immediatly thought ""UFO"", but I did not know how to report such an incident at the time and felt shy about it anyways.  This was before people had internet in their homes.

The first two photos appear normal, but in the third photo the object appears in the top left hand corner.  I am not making any claims about what it is; I just found the object to be unusual.

I saw a streak of light in the western sky and had thought at first it was a bolt of lightning.  However as I continued to view the growing darkness of night I realized that there were silent bright white globe's or sphere's with trailing lines of light that simultaneously came out of each direction--north, south, east and west; met in the northern sky spun in a clockwise direction three or four times and then each went back from where they came to start the dance in the twilight over again. These ""lights"" were not saucer or cylinder shape they were ""globes"" or ""sphere's"" of intensely bright white light they appeared to be as large if not slightly larger than the full moon.  As they traveled from each direction bright white light trailed behind them.  When they met and spun they appeared to look like four ""ying and yang"" shapes. I live about one to one and a half miles away from several car dealerships which are in the north and I thought to myself that perhaps it was a laser light show used as an advertising tool.  Waterbury, Connecticut is known for its steep hills and valleys so to me it seemed impossible as each globe went to the north south east and west as far as the eye could see; if it was a laser show a hill or valley would get in the way stopping me from seeing its straight continuous path.

The other photos I took didn’t contain the object. I think it looked like a flying saucer…there was no one outside that day and the house was empty at the time, and there is nothing but miles of woods behind the houses, so it wasn’t a Frisbee. I don’t think it was a spec or dust particle because I think I wiped my camera lense off before taking pictures. And if it was, the spec wouldn’t appear like that on the photo. The object is blurred, so obviously, it was moving fast. Although I don’t believe it is a bird, it very well could be. I really want some second opinions on my photo.

My husband and I were on vacation in Italy in July.  We rented a house in the country, in the Chianti region of Tuscany, and went out late to watch the sky — which was incredibly clear — and look for shooting stars and satellites.   We had gone out two consecutive nights before that to do the same thing. That night, we had already seen several shooting stars and two satellites when we spotted a third.  It was a very faint, distant white light, traveling south to west (I think) very high up in the sky — like a dim moving star.  At first, the light traveled at a steady straight pace, acting like a normal satellite.  Then suddenly, after about ten seconds, it veered north, traveling VERY fast (It just took off).  It traveled north for about five seconds, then veered west again and proceeded at its normal steady pace for about another ten seconds.  Afterwards, once again, it suddenly veered north, moving very fast, repeating the same pattern.  After about five seconds it veered west and then disappeared after a few seconds (or I lost track of it). While moving west, the light seemed to move like a typical satellite.  But twice it changed directions toward the north, extremely quickly, moving in a neat zigzag (though it was less of a Z formation and more like a step).  The first time it veered, I yelped and sat up (I was laying down flat on a lawn chair, looking straight up).  My husband, who has undergraduate and graduate degree in physics, agreed that it moved like a satellite at first, but then changed directions very quickly — too quickly in his opinion to be a satellite.  He’s a bit of a skeptic but he agreed that it was a rather weird sight. We’re both certain it wasn’t a plane.  We’re not experts but love to watch the night sky, and often have contests to see who can spot the most satellites.  I also often check my sightings against the NOAA page to see if they match.  I didn’t in this case, because we were in Italy, in the middle of nowhere, with no Internet.  At any rate, it definitely looked like a satellite despite the fact that it changed trajectories fast. I’m not an expert but it certainly was an eye-popping site.  Looked like a satellite but moved like nothing I’ve seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The last one was about four years ago, and I never reported it. I will report it here soon. I have to recall the details.  This one is the most recent. I have been camping and hiking for decades. I know what a falling star looks like; this was not one.  My Girlfriend and I were camping at Dogwood, a popular camp site, three miles south of Lake Arrowhead. We were sitting in the forest, facing east, next to the fire ring (with fire in it), just chatting. As usual, I was looking up at the stars. It was a clear, black night and there were many bright stars in the sky.  I saw what appeared to be a star moving slowly, seemingly between the stars.  When it caught my eye, I watched it for a few seconds, and then told my girlfriend to look at it. After some difficulty in pointing it out to her, she saw it too.  By that time it “curled” slightly to the “right”, and then disappeared.  During the time I knew she was watching it, I asked her “Can you see it? Are you watching it? She said “yes”. Then I said “look, it disappeared!”  I was surprised that it caught my eye because it was very subtle, and my eyesight is bad. I looked like a star—i.e., a white dot. Instead of being in, what I would call the atmosphere of Earth, this object was in the heavens; it was among the stars. I kept looking for its continuation, but nothing more was observed.  Incidentally, what also surprises me is that my Girlfriend was very unimpressed by this sighting, telling no one else.  Had she not seen it too, I would have doubted that I’d seen it.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,34.2726,-117.19679999999998

Traffic was snarled so it was about 11pm by the time we got back. About a quarter mile away from our subdivision we noticed a collection of 5 (maybe 7) orange flickering objects that some people might describe as a fireball. Curious, we pulled over to watch these objects. We were facing south and these objects were traveling from east to west. Their motion and appearance were uniform although one object appeared to weave left and right slightly relative to the formation and subsequently sped up slightly as if to return to the correct spot in the formation. There was no sound. I would not describe the formation as uniform or tight, just motion in the same general direction. As these objects passed overhead and slightly to our south their flickering began to fade and then disappear entirely well before they would have been out of our line of sight. It is as if the front of the object gives off the flickering orange light but not the rear. We could not see anything much more significant that a faint star once the flickering stopped. At this stage it was difficult to reacquire visual contact with one object if one focused on another in the group. We agreed these were not aircraft. There were enough aircraft flying overhead at the fireworks so we had a good frame of reference for that conclusion. Since neither of us could explain what it was that we saw, we decided that we saw unidentified flying objects. We drove home; I carried our sleeping 4-year-old up to bed and began to unload the car. I noticed a group of 3 more objects traveling in the same manner and direction as before. This was about 5 to 10 minutes later. This time I was easily able to retrieve the camera from the back of the car and subsequently filmed this group of objects in a 30 second .avi clip (the camera’s limit). The video is thoroughly boring and by itself seems to do nothing to further identify the phenomena that we witnessed.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,42.47510648648649,-83.47834486486487

I was walking with my best friend from my house to his house in a subdivision outside of town.  We stopped in the middle of the street to look for shooting stars.  We found a few lights in the far distance that looked like airplanes without the flashing lights, but their behavior was strange.  The first one we found while looking to the north.  It moved a few degrees through the sky then stopped. A smaller light came from inside of it and went the same distance from its parent.  After a minute it returned to its parent and it continued to fly away. We continued to look around and we saw a bright white light over the eastern tree line.  At first we just assumed it was a light on a tower, but after walking a bit more then turning around again it was noticeably brighter.  We stared at it as it got bigger and bigger until we realized it wasn’t growing, it was approaching.  We ran westward down the street to my friend’s driveway, just a few hundred feet away. By the time we got there the object was above the street coming toward us. I told my friend to run inside and find a camera.  He ran inside screaming and his 5 year old brother came running outside to see what was going on.  A few seconds behind him was their mother who was in her late thirties.  My friend came back out without a camera to see what the object was doing.  By this time it was hovering directly above us at the height of a two story house. The object was hovering above us long enough for us to discuss it’s attributes.  It was a black triangle shape with four lights, 3 white and one red.  The white lights were at the corners and the red light was centered on it’s underside.  There was a low humming sound, but nothing more.  No wind, no engine noise, and no movement.  We knew it couldn’t be an airplane because it was hovering and we knew it wasn’t a helicopter because it was almost completely silent.   After about 2 minutes of hovering it simply tilted up slightly, probably about 25 degrees, and flew away at a very fast speed heading straight west above the tree line.

I had just left the restaurant that my girlfriend worked at in South Bloomfield and headed south on U.S. 23.  As I approached the State Highway Patrol office I noticed what looked two strobe on either side of a third, central flashing light in the distance, beyond the tree line of Cook's Creek Golf Course.  The two strobes would flash 3 times, then the central light would flash once.  Of course I thought it was a plane, as up and to the right of it were more lights that seem to be headed towards it's location. The highway curves to the right just past the golf course, losing sight of it because of the trees.  As I emerged, directly ahead was the lights, sitting completely motionless.  As I got closer to it the lights never changed or moved.  I decided to turned off 23 and onto North Court St. at 84 Lumber and go through town and take ST RTE 56 home.   At this point I was now east of town and as I looked to the west I saw the lights, in the same formation as before. That had me even more suspicious, so I decided to head toward it. I turned onto Tarlton Rd. and headed west. The closer I got the more I could see that it was near DuPont off 23 and was further away than I was willing to drive that night, so I turned south and went the back way home, all the while looking at the lights and they still looked the same from a S/SE view point. But that is not craziest part. My best friend worked 2nd shift and did not come to work till 3:30pm. He had no time at all to talk to those that I worked with, as he worked in a different department. As I was about to tell him about it he turned and said ""dude, you will not believe what we saw last night"". He began to tell me that he and another of our friends who worked with us were headed north (from the south of Circleville), coming from Chillicothe, at almost the exact same time as me. According to him as they approached DuPont they saw something over the factory. They pulled over to watch it and said that it began to come toward them. They described lights flas! hing 3 t imes in a circle under it with a ventral strobe light. This is one of about a dozen different encounters I have heard of in the same location.

It was the brightest and most white light I’d ever seen (and still have ever seen to this day, some 12 years later).   After a few minutes I realized it was still there, directly in front of me, maybe 20 miles ahead.  It was very low on the horizon and now I started to wonder what it might be.  I discarded aircraft because there are no headlights this bright, and even if they were, they’d have to be flying directly southbound over I-35, which I doubt they’d do.  I thought it might be a commercial spotlight that somehow had been pushed downward, aiming straight at me, but I couldn’t see any beam projecting from the source.   I was traveling around 70mph and getting closer to it by the minute.  After about 10 minutes I realized that the light was not stationary.  It was slowly moving westward, to my left.  I was really mesmerized by this thing now, and couldn’t for the life of me figure out what it could be. When it got much closer, I pulled the car over, turned off the engine and got out.  The craft was triangular in shape, and maybe the width of two to three 737 planes wing-to-wing.  What first struck me was that it was completely silent.  If the light hadn’t attracted my attention, you never would have known it was there.  It was slowly moving, almost drifting, south-westerly, maybe 500 feet off the ground.   The other thing that struck me is that now, from underneath, I could no longer see the white light, but instead saw 3 different colored lights, one on each top of the triangle.  One was red, one was green and the other yellow, all solid. As I stood in awe, a patrol car pulled off the road onto the shoulder coming southbound.  The officer got out and stood looking up at the craft, just as I was doing.  I jumped back into the car and drove right thru the grass, crossing the median and onto the southbound side.  While this was completely against the law, the officer and I didn’t even discuss it.  We just stood there staring at the craft. Now, as it was moving away from us, we could no longer see the 3 colored lights on the tips of the triangle.  All you could see from the back was a much larger, round red light in the center of the craft that was slowly pulsating.  I couldn’t make out how tall the craft was, just the approximate width.  The slowly pulsating red light was almost hypnotic, but our attention was broken by the arrival of a 2nd patrol car, this one the State Police.  He too got out and watched the craft moving away.  I asked them if they’d already checked with Austin-Bergstrom airport, and they had, reporting now commercial traffic anywhere near here or anything like what we were seeing. After a few more minutes of the two officers discussing their confusion and fascination, I jumped in my car and headed back down I-35 from where I’d just come.  I chased the craft for a few more minutes, driving about 70mph again, as it was now getting further and further off to my right (westerly).  I finally pulled off the highway and tried going down a side road to head more westerly, but by then it had disappeared from sight. I didn’t see anything about it in the papers, despite looking thru the Austin American Statesman for days afterwards.  I wish I’d gotten the names of the officers who witnessed this with me, but I didn’t.  I was too taken by what I was seeing in the sky.

I have never told anyone of this sighting other than my wife. The exact date is unknown to my memory, but it took place in late 97 or early 98.  In those days I drank and abused soft drugs.  As I and my friend were under the age of 21 and our parents did not condone this type of activity, we participated in a classic American teenage ritual known as ""road tripping"" where you drive around all evening drinking and listening to music. One place in particular where we liked to stop was at a small tree nursery off the Iola black top between Farina and Iola IL. I was parked facing east.  We liked to stop there because it was out of the way and it was very unlikely, if not impossible for any John Q law types to be patrolling, or concerned with.  It was here that our route, which started west of St. Peter IL, reached its’ intermission.  This means, it is where we finished half of the case of beer and always felt the need to peak the buzz w/ soft drugs in the form of a, marijuana joint.  The custom with my friends was if you couldn’t roll a J then you had to break it up. It was a winter month in 1997 at 22:00 to 23:00 hrs, when my friend completed his task of preparing enough marijuana for a joint.  He then presented it to me to roll.  I took the plate and all my concentration was on the rolling process.   Just as I am finishing my task I hear him belt out “what ((deleted)) was that” I look up off of the plate but see nothing.  My friend was a nice guy, but always had a reputation for pulling our legs or being reckless with the truth. What was what I asked?  He said “you didn’t see that?” see what I asked? He was some what hysterical and clearly not acting for a gag or joke. A big f/;’ing flaming eyeball just floated by. I laugh and give him some pretty heavy static.  He said “no way man not this time a big f’;.ing flaming eye ball just floated by it zipped this way and then slowly floated across the horizon.  I still look at him like he is crazy ((deleted) I said.  He continued with his rants of the flaming ball or “eyeball” flooded with the heavy use of superlatives. I by this time have finished the joint giving him more shit saying the weed wasn’t that good and so on.  I never saw the first sighting that he did but soon learned he was clearly telling the truth. I left the tree nursery and turned left on the Iola blacktop back towards Farina IL.  Just after the turn onto the blacktop as if whatever it was could hear the shit I was laying on my friend, we both see a glow way out in the stars above us. It happened in slow motion, like a car wreck but was instantaneous, because I only had started pointing at it. There was no time to say do you see that, but we both could not take our eyes off of the glowing reddish, purplish, aura, that was way out there, like a star itself, kind of spinning or flickering.  In the same instant it was glowing and we were looking at it. It streaked from that fixed point right over us off to the right in an acute angle it seemed to remain in the sky but didn’t, like the shutter speed of the mind was slower than what happened. It made an acute angle and nothing made by man could do what we saw.  I never saw a craft per-say but the effect of one. The streak it made was elongated in blue red and finally yellow it made an acute angle roughly 60* and again, it was instantaneous.  We both were speechless “now do you f*(%ing believe me”  he yelled.  I stated that two people could not experience the same graphic hallucination. The government might have experimental craft but nothing could defy physical natural law like what we saw.  “No f*#ing shit” he said definitely an unidentified object.  We both clearly agreed it was not of the material realm we are apart of, because it did not observe physical laws. He wanted to tell the other friends when we got back to town.  I made him rationalize that people already had an opinion of him as a bullshitter, and I didn’t want to be perceived as crazy, or a liar seeking attention, so I told him if he told any one I would kick his ass. He and I had a falling out but I have never told anyone what we saw that clear winter night.   I was instantly transformed from curious skeptic to believer on that night.  Since, doing pot and drinking and driving are illegal, I knew this story would never be taken seriously anyway. However, the sighting was very real. It made me think about the possibility of inter-dimensions rather than linear travel of them they it or whatever. Due to the way it was there for him, and then way out there like beyond the distance of the moon and instantly over us and so forth. Thank you for your time this is no joke or hoax.

I was just arriving home from the store about 10:15PM on 9-8-2009 when I noticed my two neighbors sitting outside on the stoop of our apartment complex staring up at the sky.  As I walked up to them I asked, ""What are you looking at, a UFO?""   To my surprise, the gentleman said, ""I don't know, maybe!""    I then proceeded to look up in the western sky and noticed what looked to be a bright star.  The ""star"" then started ""blinking/flashing"" different colors like red, blue and silver/white.  The thing that was weird was it was flashing these colors all at once like red on top, blue on bottom but flashing very fast sometimes in a steady pattern.  It would flash and strobe red, blue, red, blue, then blue on top, then red on bottom and all of a sudden it would be a solid silver/white light for like 3 seconds, then go back to the red, blue flashing!  At first I thought it maybe could be a satellite but I thought they could reflect the sunlight in such a pattern.  I have NEVER seen anything like this in my life!   I ran inside and grabbed my digital camera to snap a few pictures and by the time I got back outside, two more of my neighbors were also out looking at the ""star"".  What I thought was weird was that every picture I took the ""star"" showed up in the LCD screen on the camera but not in the actual photos! (Just my luck!) We continued to watch the weird object for another 25 minutes or so and I noticed that it had been moving away ever so slightly WNW in the sky until it finally was out of our view from the apartment complex stoop.  I started to tell my friends about it over the next few days and I think they thought I was crazy or something.  A few days later, on of those friends came over to visit and told me that they had seen the exact same ""star"" that I had described to them earlier that week!!!",2009-12-12T00:00:00,40.80091454183267,-96.67416752988048

On August 4th, 1994  around 10:30PM my husband and I were star gazing from the open upper deck of our home in Sedona, AZ.  It was close to a new moon so the sky was dark and we had a clear view of the evening sky. We were facing in the direction of  Cathedral Rock which would have been northwest of our home.  I first noticed what seemed to be a very bright star just to the west of Cathedral Rock and pointed it out to my husband.  Within minutes after we noticed  a white laser type beam came in from the east and hit this object which I thought was a star.  We could see the object flare at first and then about 20 seconds later it exploded causing a firework type of effect - sparks floating down.  There was no sound and we just sat there shocked at what we had just seen.  About an hour later we received a phone call from friends in West Sedona telling us that there was a fire going in Secret Canyon (west of 89-A), but they didn’t know much about it. We told them of what we had seen just a hour before and we all wondered if it might be connected. By morning the fire in Secret Canyon was quite bad, but because it is a very remote canyon the Forest Service decided to just watch the fire rather then try to fight it with water planes.  We went into town to a local coffee house and meet a few other people talking about the fire and the night before. One couple stated that about an hour before the fire was reported they saw a small flaming object fall into Secret Canyon and they thought that was the cause of the fire. That would have been right about the time that we witnessed the explosion in the sky. The people of Sedona watched this fire burn for ten days, many sitting for hours at night on Air Port Mesa looking out over Secret Canyon.  When the fire finally began to reach the area of resorts in Oak Creek Canyon the Forest Service decided to fight the fire. In itself this story doesn’t sound like much in the way of a UFO report, but at that time in Sedona many locals were aware of something strange in Secret Canyon, and another area, because many hikers into that area had been turned away by military type men in black uniforms with M-16s to back them up. There had even been two off duty police officers hiking there  that had been turned back and told to not return. After the fire was put out the whole canyon area was closed off for about 3 months and many trucks were seen going into that area. Many of the locals at that time felt that there might have been some type of aerial fight between two “UFOs” and the one shot down fell into Secret Canyon.  Many of the locals were talking about it and many tourist over heard and asked questions - and then a few days later some of the locals working in the shops had visits by men dressed as tourist in dark sunglasses. I was one of those locals, a man entering the shop and came “nose to nose’ with me and said, “I hear that you know a lot about UFOs, tell me about them”.  I knew exactly what that was all about and said nothing and the man left. There were enough locals afraid after that to just remain quiet.  One local rancher had already had much trouble from different government agencies because of UFO reports he had made and so it put the locals on pins and needles. There is a LOT that has, and still does, go on in this area revolving around UFOs and alien life forms - people just don’t talk openly about it anymore ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

On a late summer night, my sister, her friend, and I were heading from Toledo OH to my aunt's house in the country.  We became lost for two to three hours down a rural country roads in or around Swanton OH.  As we were driving I noticed lights within the trees which were brighter than normal house lights but I paid no mind thinking it was a house or cabin.    Approx two hundred yards from the trees we came across a corn field at which time my sister's friend slammed on the brakes and said ,"" What is THAT?""   As I looked I noticed aprrox 25 yards away from the road was two story house with a large barn and a combine and approx ten to twenty feet above the house was an object shaped like a football beaming different color lights.  We immediately stopped and starred in disbelief as we tried to figure out what we were looking at.  In my mind, I ruled out all known hovering vehicles such as blimps or helicopters.  This football shaped object made no noise, created no wind, and was approx half the size of the house.  We all became terrorified as my sister's friend drove slowly passed the house.  I looked to my right and noticed a State Trooper parked with no lights also watching the object.  At that time, my sister's friend did the quarter mile in what seemed like ten seconds.  I told her to slow down because of the Trooper.  As we slowed I looked out the back window of the car and saw three identical object approx five hundred yards behind us which was ten to twenty feet over electrical wires in formation moving slowly across the road. I have told few people of this story and the people I have told do not believe the me or poke fun.  My sister who is now a devote Christian denies these events.  I was sixteen years old at the time.   Since then I have served four years in the Marine Corps in a line unit, flown and seen many helicopters, and witnessed many things in the military.  However, with all that I have experienced I know what I saw that night.  I know this was not a helicopter because helicopters while stationary cause enormous down drafts, in fact hurricane force winds.  I'm not saying it was little green men from Mars, it was by definition UFO's.   I was not amazed or awestruck by the objects, only frightened at something I could not identify or explain.

At the exit prior to the one I was going to take, some lights to my right attracted my attention.  Higher in the sky, one could see the usual collection of airplanes that were on approach towards the Nashville Airport that is several miles on the other side of Old Hickory Lake, but these particular lights were moving slowly, were very low, a dull red in color, and were losing altitude. I didn't think much about it as I continued on towards my exit, but noticed that the lights continued to drop even lower and moved slower over the top of the suburban homes that lay to the right of the bypass.  Becoming concerned, thinking that perhaps an airplane was in trouble, and at the time being a Certified Nurse Technician, I slowed down and kept checking on these lights as I finally reached my exit, thinking that I might have to grab my phone and dial 911 if there was a plane crash. As I exited on New Shackle Island Road, the lights were now coming right towards me, as I exited to the right, and at this point, I realized that this was not an airplane. I pulled off onto the shoulder of the road and got out of my car, my son still asleep in the back seat, and I was absolutely overwhelmed by what I saw. It was triangular in shape on the bottom, with a dull red light at each corner on the bottom, and one in the center.  I had the sensation of a huge mass, that it was very large, more of a pyramid in shape, and that there was a sort of grid that lined it, rather reminiscent of a rocket gantry, some sort of support structure. It was totally black, so black, in fact, that it seemed to absorb light, giving off no reflection of any kind. There was no sound from this craft, no engine sound, no whine of turbines, nothing.  But I could feel an extremely low level vibration and hum as it approached. It seemed to be just drifting at this point, right over my head, so close that I would swear it seemed I could have thrown a rock at it and hit it. I stood there for several minutes as this thing went right over my head, then it headed slowly down the bypass, and suddenly just completely disappeared.  I got in my car, did a Uturn across the street, trying to see it, but it was gone.  And during this whole time, no traffic passed, which was a fact that didn't register with me until I was headed towards Springfield on the back roads. It felt as though somehow time itself had stood still as this craft passed overhead. If anyone else saw this craft, I would be very interested in hearing about it. I did not report it at the time, because I frankly did not know who to turn to, without being laughed at or not taken seriously, but with the increasing number of reports that sound so much like what I saw, I decided to go ahead and report it. This did not have the appearance of being terrestrial in nature, and I would gladly submit to hypnosis if needed to verify this report and perhaps dig out other details that I may have forgotten. I am that positive of what I experienced.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,36.34762547770701,-86.60062420382165

Previous to it, I dismissed all claims of sightings of UFO’s as explainable.  However, I saw the object in such broad daylight, in such clear sight, for a period of time, that it was totally inexplicable to me.  I even had time to go inside and get another person as a witness. Unfortunately, I did not think to scramble for a camera or a video recorder.  Although, I do have another witness who saw it as well. I tried for some time to find out whether there were any reports of activity at the air traffic control tower, or any reports by any other civilians; however I was unsuccessful in doing so. Now, I will also say that I did not think of the sighting as a “UFO” at the time, but rather just something to think about. It was probably 1-2 years later, when watching TV and seeing recorded footage of the same object sighted and recorded by many in Mexico, which according to the program made Mexican News, that I was struck by the fact that I had seen exactly the same thing. I believe it was Easter or around Easter in probably mid 1990’s.  (I believe it was 1995.  Might be able to reconstruct better timeframe with effort).  I was in my early 20’s, and was visiting my family.  It was probably between 10am and Noon, it was sunny with a few clouds and was pretty still.  We lived just below the airport,  as it is situated on a prairie rim.  From there I could see the air control tower, as well as some buildings, and of course commercial and military jets taking of and landing.  I was very used to seeing weather balloons, which I could also see very plainly when they went up. What I saw was a shiny object, mostly metallic-chrome-like, not completely round, oblong-round, just hovering in the sky approximately in vicinity of the air traffic control tower.  I never saw it move.  It seemed small, much smaller than even the F-16 jets that would take off.  I do remember turning away and returning minutes later, and it was gone.  Then later it was there again.  There was no movement ever witnessed, and it just appeared to maintain its position perfectly. I witnessed it for minutes.  I went inside and got another person to come out and look at it.  I asked, “do you see that?”.  “Yes,” they confirmed.  “What would you say that it is?” I asked.  “I don’t know,” they said.  “How would you describe it?”, I asked.  “Like a metallic object, just floating there,” they said.  We then returned inside.  Soon we came out again, and it was never seen again. Given the years I had had at the same residence, looking at the same buildings, same air traffic tower, same sky, planes, weather balloons, etc., I am totally convinced of what I saw.  I do not profess to know anything of what it could be. However, I have really wanted to know how to investigate weather air traffic control (FAA) reported anything, whether the Air National Guard also at same site reported anything, and whether there have been any other civilian sightings fitting that timeframe, date, time, location, etc.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,47.46981803278688,-111.33172786885245

The reason I'm reporting it as a UFO is that it had no markings or lights on it as required and was hiding in the clouds. I was driving West from Florence Jct. on Rt. 60 towards Mesa at 18:00 just before sundown and was still about 20 miles from Mesa when I noticed it among the clouds North of Mesa. At first it looked like 4 small clouds floating South but then 3 of the clouds continued to float South while the 4th one turned and went back North over the mountains when it looked like it might end up out in the open over the city. At that time I could make out the football shape and was able to identify the craft as a Zeppelin or something similar. I continued to watch it for about 30 min. as I drove West until it disappeared in the shadows over the mountains to the North. I've seen the Goodyear blimp and the Fuji blimp and it wasn't either of them, it was much too big, all gray and had no lights or markings on it and looked a lot like the one moored to the Empire State Building at the beginning of the movie Sky Captain.  The odd thing is I searched for Zeppelins on Google and the last one seems to have been decommissioned around 1940. This sighting was before the Phoenix Lights so I figure something like that carrying a structure underneath with some lights on it at night could have been the cause of some of the reported sightings. Then, last year I saw a story about a new model Zeppelin that was flying across Texas and Arizona on it's way to California about the same time all the UFO reports were coming from Texas. It was on the local news in Phoenix because it stopped briefly in Tucson. Here are some photos and information about the craft that flew to Calif. but I believe this one is smaller then the one I saw: http://zeppelintransit.blogspot.com/",2009-03-19T00:00:00,33.42126454293629,-111.772797322253

Thinking it was probably just an aircraft of some sort i followed it (visibly) for about 10 or 15 seconds and it stopped. I kept my eye on it so not to mix it up with the stars as it was about the same size and brightness of most. After watching it where it stopped for another 10 or 15 seconds the ""star"" accelerated at what appeared to be 90 deg. direction from which it original came from.... leaving a streak and promptly disappeared. I continued to watch the sky thinking i would see something else and approximately 15 or 20 minutes later i did. I believe it was a meteor coming into the atmosphere from the south east towards the north west at the same place as i just saw the moving ""star"" (as if it were marking the location). All this taking place (generally) over Edwards AFB and also near China lake Naval station...... i always wrote it off as possibly a military ufo, but a couple years later i heard a story right hear on nuforc about and object that crashed (touched down)and burned on the coast near vandenburg for a week. One last thing.... my cousin i found out just recently saw that so called meteor that lit up the sky green so bright it could have been day time, so i'm thinking there were atleast more people that saw that to possibly comfirm the date.

We were almost home when we saw a little (I think red) car stopped right in front of our house.  We got very close to them and I saw they were looking up at something. I looked up.  The car sped away (so I know someone else saw the same thing).   Right in our huge roundabout was a hovering object flying above us.  It was feet or inches above the tall oaks.  There was no wind, no sound.  It was triangular with spot light in the middle.  It had a white light in one corner and one side had a row of white lights with one red light.  It was spot lighting the grass and trees in the roundabout then it flew a few yards and spotted the house and then the back field where we had a huge garden on the corner of a farmer’s field..  As it moved, you didn't see it move.  We all gazed in amazement and fear. My mother pulled in the drive way, put the car in park and ran into the house to get my father.  My brother and I started to scream and hold each other.  Then it was gone.  All the while, it never acknowledged us but of course it had to see us, right?   What is weird is that I don't remember telling my dad or the rest of the night, maybe because it was not important or because I was slightly traumatized.   The next morning I drew pictures but for some reason my memory had changed.  Now, I could only remember clearly how I felt and what I was thinking as I looked at the object and the things around the object but the exact memory of me staring straight at the object was gone.  My mother said she can't remember as clearly either.  What is strange is that I remember in pictures.  We didn't talk about it much.   My mother thinks it is a governmental experiment, not aliens and I like that answer.  This is what I tell myself and I find it reasonable.  There is an air force base very close by. The next day there were military helicopters flying all around.  What this means, I don't know. Were they looking for something?   Was this a foreign government spying on the U.S.  If the object didn’t want to be seen...then why fly into peoples yards and hover around.  Why did it care about us and what could it possibly learn or want from us.  I guess we will never know.   I don't expect you to believe this because I wouldn't.  It is hard for me to believe but it happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in late 1995.

I was born in Canton, OH.  Shortly after my family moved to Poland, OH.  We lived there until my father got a promotion in 1985.  We then moved to Warren, OH, where I lived until the beginning of 2000.  I was an above average student in High School (class of 1995), but never aspired to go to college.  I started work at a local pizza shop in the beginning of 1996. On December 31 1997,  I got off of work shortly after 8 pm.  I already had several guests waiting at my apartment on the other side of town to celebrate the New Year.  It was an over-cast night with no precipitation at that time.   I always took the outer-belt Route 82 East to get home, that night was no different.  I was just past the Elm Rd exit on the part of the highway that goes north-south when I looked up and saw it. It was approximately 8:30 pm.  I saw what at first I thought was a row of floodlights slowly heading west across the sky in front of me. I looked closer because the lights were a different color and quantity than the floodlights I usually saw in the sky on cloudy nights.  What I was looking at was a giant boomerang shaped aircraft with a dozen large blue lights across the rear.  More interesting was the fact that it was just above the bottom of the cloud ceiling, and I could see the clouds rolling under it and around the front out-lining the shape of this ""UFO"". The blue lights were round in shape and a hazed blue color.  The lights alone were the size of the Hercules C-130 airplanes that fly out of the Vienna Air Force base on daily flight patterns over the area (at least at that time).  One of my best friends at the time, his father was a mechanic in the Air Force at that base.  I went to many air shows with them and saw the largest military plane at that time and it was nowhere near as large as what I saw that night.  It covered the sky from the top of my windshield to just above the horizon.  It had to be at least 2000 feet across but probably larger. The experience lasted about 15 seconds, so it had to be moving slower than current physics would allow to keep something that massive aloft. The highway is hemmed on both sides by tall trees and hills making it difficult to see the sky beyond.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,41.23654444444444,-80.8044875

The exact date is unknown to my memory, but it took place in late 97 or early 98. In those days I drank and abused soft drugs.  As I and my friend were under the age of 21 and our parents did not condone this type of activity, we participated in a classic American teenage ritual known as “road tripping” where you drive around all evening drinking and listening to music. One place in particular where we liked to stop was at a small tree nursery off the Iola black top between Farina and Iola IL.  The truck was facing east.  We liked to stop there because it was out of the way and it was very unlikely, if not impossible for any John Q law types to be patrolling, or concerned with.  It was here that our route, which started west of St. Peter IL, reached its’ intermission.  This means, it is where we finished half of the case of beer and always felt the need to peak the buzz w/ soft drugs in the form of a, marijuana joint.  The custom with my friends was if you couldn’t roll a J then you had to break it up. It was a winter month in 1997 at 22:00 to 23:00 hrs, when my friend completed his task of preparing enough marijuana for a joint.  He then presented it to me to roll.  I took the plate and all my concentration was on the rolling process.   Just as I am finishing my task I hear him belt out “what the f/;’ was that” I look up off of the plate but see nothing.  My friend was a nice guy, but always had a reputation for pulling our legs or being reckless with the truth. What was what I asked?  He said “you didn’t see that?” see what I asked? He was some what hysterical and clearly not acting for a gag or joke. A big f/;’ing flaming eyeball just floated by. I laugh and give him some pretty heavy static.  He said “no way man not this time a big f’;.ing flaming eye ball just floated by it zipped this way and then slowly floated across the horizon.  I still look at him like he is crazy “bullshit,” I said.  He continued with his rants of the flaming ball or “eyeball” flooded with the heavy use of superlatives. I by this time have finished the joint giving him more shit saying the weed wasn’t that good and so on.  I never saw the first sighting that he did but soon learned he was clearly telling the truth. I left the tree nursery and turned left on the Iola blacktop back towards Farina IL.  Just after the turn onto the blacktop as if whatever it was could hear the shit I was laying on my friend, we both see a glow way out in the stars above us. It happened in slow motion, like a car wreck but was instantaneous, because I only had started pointing at it. There was no time to say do you see that, but we both could not take our eyes off of the glowing reddish, purplish, aura, that was way out there, like a star itself, kind of spinning or flickering.  In the same instant it was glowing and we were looking at it. It streaked from that fixed point right over us off to the right in an acute angle it seemed to remain in the sky but didn’t, like the shutter speed of the mind was slower than what happened. It made an acute angle and nothing made by man could do what we saw.  I never saw a craft per-say but the effect of one. The streak it made was elongated in blue red and finally yellow it made an acute angle roughly 60* and again, it was instantaneous.  We both were speechless “now do you f*(%ing believe me”  he yelled.  I stated that two people could not experience the same graphic hallucination. The government might have experimental craft but nothing could defy physical natural law like what we saw.  “No f*#ing shit” he said definitely an unidentified object.  We both clearly agreed it was not of the material realm we are apart of, because it did not observe physical laws. He wanted to tell the other friends when we got back to town.  I made him rationalize that people already had an opinion of him as a bullshitter, and I didn’t want to be perceived as crazy, or a liar seeking attention, so I told him if he told any one I would kick his ass. He and I had a falling out but I have never told anyone what we saw that clear winter night.   I was instantly transformed from curious skeptic to believer on that night.  Since, doing pot and drinking and driving are illegal, I knew this story would never be taken seriously anyway. However, the sighting was very real. It made me think about the possibility of inter-dimensions rather than linear travel of them they it or whatever. Due to the way it was there for him, and then way out there like beyond the distance of the moon and instantly over us and so forth. Thank you for your time this is no joke or hoax.

During a sighting which lasted in total no more than 5 to 10 minutes, I initially saw a very bright white light beginning at 9:40 PM on May 8, 1998, while I was driving northbound on I-95 about 2 miles south of the Palm Beach County line near the town of Deerfield Beach, Florida, which is a few miles north of the town of Pompano Beach, Florida.  There was good visibility with few clouds while the Moon was also visible and approximately 2/3 full in the night sky at an apparently equivalent elevation but well to the south of the bright light.  Having seen something unusual looking,  I pulled off on to the right shoulder of the interstate and got out of my car to better observe what was occurring.  This bright white light appeared to be a few miles north of me and was slowly moving in a southerly direction parallel to and somewhat to the east of I-95 coming towards my position.  At first, the unblinking white light appeared to have a short contrail which later disappeared when the bright white light changed into a less brilliant unblinking red light which then appeared to split into 2 such less brilliant, unblinking red lights that moved apart but remained side by side and separated by a some distance from each other.  Both continued to move slowly in a continued southerly direction.  At about this point, I noticed that there was a third, unblinking, dimmer red light which preceeded the other two by some significant distance, perhaps one hundred to a few hundred yards, which was also slowly moving in a southerly direction and to the east of I-95 towards my position.  Eventually the 2 following red lights dimmed to the level of the leading dim red light and shortly thereafter, the pair of following red lights continued to become dimmer until they quickly became too dim to be visible while the single nearer red light, though dim, continued to be visible for another couple of minutes until it also disappeared as it approached my position.  It should be noted that even though a short contrail was seen at first, at no time was there any sound associated with these lights as there should have been if what had been observed was merely a jet or an airplane, (the latter of which don't produce contrails).  Also, jets usually leave very lengthy contrails that remain visible long after they have passed which was not apparent in this case in the night sky that was well lit by the Moon.  I believe that what was seen could not have been a rocket or space shuttle launch from Cape Canaveral (which is a couple of hundred miles to the north) due to the close proximity of what was observed and the slowness with which the lights moved only a few miles over a period of 5 to 10 minutes.  Also, all planes, jets and helicopters have some blinking lights, but none of these lights blinked on and off. Finally, although these 3 lights appeared to move synchronously with each other, the background of the well lit night sky could be seen between them, so that they ultimately could be seen to be spacially separated.  As an addendum to this report, I would like to state that I had attempted to contact a few police departments local to the vicinity of the sighting at that time in 1998 but that I was then unable to obtain confirmation that anyone else had seen or reported a similar sighting until ten years later in 2008 when I first learned about this web site of the National UFO Reporting Center.  Whereupon, having checked my original written account of the sighting and searching this data base for the same date, time and location, I finally discovered that one other individual had reported a sighting that matched mine with exactly the same date, time and a very nearby location and although his description differs somewhat from mine there are overall quite a few elements in common between the 2 accounts.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,26.309936585365854,-80.12194181184668

During the Halftime Home coming events on the field I witnessed a 2 foot diameter orb traveling horizontally from north to south over the field.  The object was not like the 2 dimensional translucent orbs seen in most pictures after development.  This object was a solid 3d Sphere, not a light.  Its color was a bluish green.  It was traveling between 80 and 100 mph. The entire sighting lasted a little over 2 seconds. It traveled over the eastern hatch marks on the field and was slightly lower than the Field Lights. Nearly ever person was focused on the Homecoming court down on the field. Upon seeing the orb I immediately notified my friends. Two of the three were able to see the orb before it rapidly faded out of site. The object had very sharp defining edges no blurs or fuzziness, the inside seemed to be made of plasma, it was not extremely bright and flew in a perfectly strait and flat trajectory. The most interesting part of the story came later. The next day upon seeing my neighbor in his yard I related the events of the previous night. To my shock he had a story of his own. He told me on the night in question at app. 1:30am He and his wife was up late watching TV, when all of a sudden he had an urge to get up and walk outside. He claims he had not heard or seen anything to make him go out. As he proceeded outside his wife also followed suit. They were both drawn to look westward towards my house.  An oak tree stood just south of the southwest corner of my house. Upon first looking toward the southwest corner of my house they saw nothing, then a small solid orb about 1-1/2 to 2 feet in diameter came floating out from either my bedroom wall or behind the west wall of my house.  The orb floated up into the oak tree maneuvering around the large branches.  After a few seconds the orb floated clear of the tree then stopped perfectly still app. 35 feet off the ground as if to let them get a good look at it. Then all at once it flew upward and away in a southwest direction at a very high rate of speed until it could no longer be seen. I asked the wife if she had got up to follow the husband outside, and she said No, she had been drawn by a mysterious urge of go outside also. These are professional college educated people. The only discrepancy between their two stories was the color of the orb. He said it was bluish, she said it was greenish. I saw it as blue green. The orb made no sound and left no visible trail. There is nothing openly known in the industrial or military complex that can fly with no open ports or wings that we currently know of. The orb is particularly similar to the orb recorded on NASA TV  STS Mission 37. Only the color is different. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

This experience is one of the only clear as day memories I have as a child. I was only eight years old, and it wasn't that long after my father had passed away. Me and my family (m other & brother) used to do these gypsy fairs where we would travel around the country in a house bus, we had quit the fairs for some time but still lived in the bus. My bedroom was in a loft, the ceilings were quite low and there were windows on both sides. I remember lying in bed not being able to get to sleep (always found it difficult) I was the only person in the house bus who was awake. As I was lying there, fully concious, I could literally see hundreds of lights as if there was something hovering above the bus, they were flashing everywhere as if the object was moving in a circular motion, I could hear all these beeping noises (and as silly as this sounds) you know the ones you hear in old sci-fi movies when there are people pressing a bunch of buttons in a space ship or something, they were quite loud and very distinctive, but not over the top, it wouldn't be impossible to sleep through. I'm not entirely sure how long it lasted, I can only remember these two things very clearly, the lights and the noises.  Without a doubt they were there, and I experienced them. After that however is just an empty space, no memory of what happened afterwards. Now for the strange part. There was this woman who had recently moved into this house bus next to ours with her abusive boyfriend, we all sort of became friends and years later still are. It was a couple of years ago she lived with us for a while (me and my family had moved to the city into a house) and we got talking about ufo's and things like that as we were both interested in that sort of stuff, and she told me about a night in Waitati, in the house bus, where she was visited by an alien who she described as the usual big eyes, grey skin, so on so forth...   My initial thought was ""mhmm, doesn't sounds very realistic,"" but then I remembered that night with the lights and the sounds, and I told her about that and she said that is exactly what she saw and heard from inside her bus. And that is pretty much it, it sounds completely unrealistic, but I at least know for myself that that is what I saw (I didn't see aliens or anything), and now I'm just hoping for some kind of answer oneday.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,,

The object was a flatter oval shape from my perspective as far as I could tell, but it was quite far away.  The object had a light trail as you might expect from a falling star, but it was not moving as fast as a falling star and the light trail remained constant in brightness.  Falling stars, by contrast typically start out small as they enter the atmosphere, grow larger and then burn out.  Furthermore, you wouldn’t see any object in front of the light trail with a falling star, you would just see the glow.  The object I saw had a definite solid part followed by a stream of light equal to about three times the length of the object.   I watched it for a good 3 to 4 seconds before it went out of site below the horizon.  Given the distance it appeared to travel, the speed exceeded what even a fast military plane could go.

I have witnessed dozens of flying objects as a keen sky observer and budding amateur astrologist.. but can't verify any of them as i always seem to be isolated and alone when it happens and many are most likely space junk causing ""shooting star"" like objects to fly across the night sky. I've seen dozens of those now. I once reported to the Australian police a sighting of a perfectly round object hovering above my top floor apartment which appeared to be at least 5 miles wide.. this was ignored.. and I myself quickly wrote it off as just light refractions. My report here however is not of a UFO but of a being. I had walked out of my home late at night as i was studying.. it was approximately 1999.. so i cannot recall the exact date. The night was still and silent with no wind. I walked outside my back yard.. and spotted a white figure.. i estimate it to have been 4 feet tall.. and was all white with a subtle glow. I stood in frozen shock as we faced each other off for approximately 3 minutes. We stood only 5 meters apart so I could make out the shape but could not discern a face nor shoes.. it was completely white. In that time the object sat on top of my fence at the rear of my backyard which fell into parkland behind it, and made no effort to run away.. It did not move for the whole time, even as i approached- i got spooked when i was 5 meters away though and stopped purely because this figure did not seem worried by me approaching it.. we faced off for the next 3 long minutes.. and then eventually it slipped over the fence and disappeared. As it slipped away.. it did not make a single sound.. and nor did it make a sound as it left.. The object did not move and as i stood frozen i simply stared at it, thinking it was a burgular. strangely though.. the figure simply disappeared after a few minutes. it did not make a single sound as it did. A burgular hopping off a fence would have made some noise.. and in the dead of night i would have at least heard leaves crunching underfoot.. but in this case there was not a single sound. it simply vanished. the fact it was all white left me to this day with the eery feeling that what i experienced that day was not a burgular but a potential visitor from another world. I could not see any discernable features other than it was a human type shape.. i did not see arms or legs though.. roughly 4 feet tall.. it seemed to be shaped like a round blob sitting on my fence.. and then like a jelly blob.. it flopped over the fence and disappeared.. it did not make a single noise in doing so and i did not hear a single noise thereafter. This story is not provable and more for your information than for public publishing.. the area where this happened could even be tested as the fence upon which the figure appeared has not been changed since.. it could have been a potential burgular that night.. but if it was, then it was one highly skilled dude.. because not only was it terribly out of shape and unatheltic looking (it was shaped like Jabba the hut from Star Wars fame) but it managed to completely disappear without making a single sound in the dead of night.. and it seemed to just roll off the back fence..which is 8 feet tall..  also.. if it was a burgular why would it be wearing only white clothing.. they usually wear black.. to this day.. the thought of that night sends a chill up my spine.. so i thought i would report it for documentation on your database.. this happened in a suburb called Ashbury in Sydney's inner city area ( the park is called Wagner Oval) .. a highly populated area but my home backs onto a large park which is where the figure disappeared into. it was also approximately 3am and no one else was on the streets at the time and the park was silent. my study is at the rear of my house overlooking my yard.. and my lights were always left on throughout the night as i studied for many years.. perhaps that attracted this figure.. a burgular again would have been deterred given that i was active till late all night.. this figure seemed to be sitting there just watching me.. until i noticed it, stared it off from a distance of only 5 meters.. it did not flinch nor seem worried either. it sat there the entire time before disappearing.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,,

I had returned home from work a bit later then normal one evening with thoughts of changing my clothes and then going to visit a sick friend in the hospital which was only about a kilometre from where I lived. I didn’t have much time to get there before visiting hours would be over, it was app. 8:40pm when I left the house,  I lived on a road that only had a french school on it, at the end of the road was a privately owned mini-home community-where I lived.  As I was nearing the french school I noticed a car going extremally slow, it was a neighbor that I talked to from time to time, he lived several houses down my street,  he had his wife and kids with him and he was pointing toward the back of the french school which was close to the back of the hospital..........this is what I seen ! Hoovering, still as can be over a inlet of water about app. 200-300ft away and about 50-75ft up was a very bright white light shining down on the water that lit up everything beneath it like it was daytime, on each side of the white light was a blue blinking light and on each side of the blue blinking lights were red blinking lights, blinking about three times faster then the blue lights, my neighbor and I both pulled over to the side of the road and shut our cars off,  this thing was totally silent,  we watched it for several minutes and came to the conclusion that it wasn’t a plane, helicopter,balloon or anything else that we’ve ever seen before, my neighbor had to leave......I didn’t. I drove up the road a ways to get a little closer to it, I turned off my car and sat against the trunk for about another several minutes observing when the bright white light in the middle of the craft dimmed and then started moving toward me, I was a little scared but more in awe of what I was observing, just as it neared me it turned in a 45 degree angle and headed toward the east and I watched it till it went out of sight.............it moved very slow but precise,  no noise the whole time............I drove back home. I told my wife what just happened....I dont know what she thought of it,  but I had witnesses.  I called the police and they told me to report it to the airport, and they put me through to the controll tower who told me there were no aircraft in in about 2hrs and none coming in for about another 2hrs,  not a very big place.   About 15-20 minutes later there were about 4 small aircraft surrounding the area that I had seen the craft, I told them I watched it till it disappeared into the east so I dont know why they sent them up............curious I guess.   Anyways I’m not lying........dont need the attention !  ....just wanting to share...........since seeing this I have been trying to search for someone else who has seen this same formation of lights.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,46.282650887573965,-63.05320059171598

The sighting took place in the late evening when it was completely dark and the sky was clear and full of stars.  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed movement in the sky from the north moving to the south.  When I looked closer, however, it wasn’t an object that I was seeing move, rather it was the disappearance and reappearance of stars behind an object.  The object itself was black or invisible with no lights.  Given the area of stars that were blocked out, I would say the object was five times larger than a jet.  It was completely silent.  It was shaped like a boomerang only a little more rounded in front rather than triangle and a slightly sharper points on the “wing” tips.  Since the object was invisible, I can only suggest the shape based on the black area absent of stars like a silhouette as it moved across the sky.  If the object was indeed five times the size of a jet and flying at about the attitude of a jet, then it was moving much faster than a jet.  I blinked a couple times, looked away and looked back, and then followed the object across the remainder of the horizon until it was out of sight.  In all it took about 8-10 seconds to span the sky and flew at the same altitude the whole time. Given the triangular shape, I suppose it could have been a low-flying Stealth Bomber that just appeared much larger if flying low.  But is a Stealth completely silent?  Also, Stealth Bombers have three triangles pointing backwards from the mid section.  The object I saw did not seem to have any mid section as such.

I just watched the YouTube videos about the lights over Phoenix. I have to tell you that our military and government makes me so mad. Everything has to be a cover-up with them. Maybe they should be more honest with us; don’t we at least deserve that? I was 17 years old and I was teaching a Pop Warner cheer squad on a football field out in Goodyear. There were also other Pop Warner cheer and football teams there practicing. I don’t remember the exact time but it was between 8:30 P.M. and 9:30 P.M. from what I remember. There weren’t less than 500 people there easily, parents, coaches and kids. I noticed that in the field next to us there were several bright lights, almost like street lights. I didn’t pay much attention to them because they weren’t moving and it wasn’t interesting. It did get interesting though when they starting floating towards the field where all of us were practicing. Everyone just seemed to stop and look up. It couldn’t have been more than 200 to 300 feet above us. We couldn’t see anything; it was just dark like the night sky. We just saw that the lights moved together in perfect formation and floated right over us until it faded off, almost like it disappeared. I didn’t really pay attention to its shape because it was so large in circumference, and so close to us. The lights were not too close together, but close enough together that we could see that it was an object. It also made no sound at all. I am angry because the military says that the lights were caused by flares. That is crap. Do they think we’re stupid? Last time I checked, flares could not stay in perfect formation with each other, as if they were connected. And I also wasn’t aware that flares could float over a crowd of people without moving up or down, and then all go out at the same time. These lights all went out together, at the same time as if they disappeared.

When I first saw it, it was floating over the S.East end if the airport area, and it was in a semicircle pattern about 5 miles wide.  Each of the orbs that made up the outline could move individually (and a few did).  The light of each orange/red orb came from within and didn't radiate out (like molten metal).  The orbs started moving and formed into a V shape with one side lopsided by on or 2 orbs.  when it pivoted to start moving the orb in the middle became the nose of the now V craft and when it pointed as if it were going to come my way...

I turned back around and instantly my fear was gone and as I watched it for the next 15 minutes, I tried not to blink, as I didn't want to miss a second of it.

My shift would start at ten pm and I would get off at six am. I like to finish off my shift by having some morning coffee with some of the employees of the cannery. After having my cup of coffee with the employees on this April morning I got on my security golf cart to finish my round. As I was driving out of the main packing shed I saw what at first appeared to be a helicopter shining a bright light over a company truck shop which was located about half a mile away from the plant. Many people were walking towards the plant because the morning shift began at six am, but only a few stood there looking at the light. Out of the people that stood there looking at the light I singled out a supervisor. I got of my security golf cart and walked up to him and asked what he thought the “helicopter” was looking for (as for me, I knew this was no helicopter, even though the plant was located near highway 99 and we saw our share of high-speed chases, but this time, the light was not here in our sky as we know it, this light was coming from really high up in the sky)? The supervisor answered it was a space shuttle and it was going to land in the Mojave Desert. I answered by saying the light was very slightly moving towards the north east, and Mojave is to the south east. At this point he stayed quit and just watched the light. I then radioed my partner and asked him to take a look at the “helicopter” shining the light on the truck shop (when using the radio we needed to maintain serious due to management listening in on our radio conversations). My partner replied stating, “What the helicopter wanted?” I replied it was just the police. 	After a few minutes the light had moved from the truck shop and was now hovering over a peach orchard. The life span of this light was about fifteen minutes and then it just shut off. The source of the light went off but we could still see a beam coming down, and then it just began to fad away, kind of like fog. The best way I can describe this light is like a huge “Mag-Lit”. It was really bright and very intense white light that was more like a beam. We could see the source that is how we could determine that it wasn’t here, not even close to earth. There was no sound coming from the source, nor change in color, just very slight drifting movement. My parents worked at a wine making company in the town of Livingston. Both of my parents worked in the vineyards. They too started their shift at six a.m. And they too saw what I saw, except they saw the source of the light. They along with about ten crew members witnessed the incident. They told me the source changed colors. It changed from dark blue to purple, to orange, to red. They could see the light beaming down but couldn’t see the movement that we saw at the cannery. I have been a long time Art-Bell listener and never did I hear a caller call in on this incident. I checked the evening news casts and the local newspapers in the surrounding areas, and there was nothing covering the event.

Mall, 7-4-97 I've decided that I should finally share something that I and my then-girlfriend saw over 10 years ago.  This seems to be the best place to do it.  I do not expect it to be taken tremendously seriously, as there are some details I've frankly just forgotten, and it is far from what you hear most UFO reports sounding like, but perhaps it's something to add to your database which could be correlated to other incidents.  I've only recently become deeply interested in this event again, sparked by a discussion with a friend, but I know that it has, in a way, always been in the back of my mind, for over 10 years now. Brought to the fore every time there was some report or show on TV, or a tabloid headline having to do with UFO's.  I do not expect a response to this, though it would be interesting to know if anyone else has ever seen anything like what I describe. First of all, about me:  My name is, let's say ""Mike"".  (I have no trouble giving my true details privately.)  I'm 37 years old, educated, and most would say intelligent. I practiced law for 4 years, now write flight simulation software, and will next year begin teaching high-school mathematics.  My hobbies have included things such as aviation, reading classic literature and about physics, plus even a bit of dabbling in astronomy.  (Just enough to appreciate the TREMENDOUS distances to even the nearest stars... which in my mind would make interstellar travel nearly impossible, at least under physics as we know it.  This is one of the reasons I'm so skeptical and have had real internal conflict over what I saw.)  By the way, I do not have a pilot's license, but do know quite a bit about aviation, theory of flight and such.  With a background such as this, and a mind-set skewed towards logic and science and technology, it's probably no surprise that I'm generally a very skeptical, evidence-oriented person. I frankly view a large part of the UFO ""movement"" or whatever it's called as comprised of people who just WANT to believe something -- followers, in a sense, of their own religion, in that many seem as eager to bypass reason and rationality as do the fundamentalists of the traditional religions. I add this only to point out that there really isn't a large part of me that is *eager* to believe this... to believe what I probably must believe if I accept the reality of what she (my girlfriend ""Lori"") and I saw. I think I now am starting to... hence this e-mail, 12 years later. My ""sighting"":  First, I'm actually not certain that this happened in 1997.  Lori and I are no longer together but still talk about this, and we're only 80 percent sure it was '97.  It may have been '96.  Regardless, it was the night of July 4th, and we had been to the National Mall in Washington D.C. to view the fireworks.  We each lived in the northwest suburbs of D.C., so had taken the metro (rail) from Gaithersburg directly down to the mall. (Red line to Orange line.)  We were there all day, watched the fireworks, and in general had a great time. We did not consume any alcohol, as we rarely drank, nor did we take any drugs.  The fireworks had ended.  We were tired and ready to go home. It was around 11 o'clock, I believe.  The crowd there was huge, obviously, so she and I had waited a bit for it to thin out instead of trying to sardine ourselves onto one of the metro train cars. So we started walking (I remember it as we were walking west, on the north side of the mall), and were heading towards the Nat'l Mall entrance to the Smithsonian Metro station.  We were not far at all from this entrance, certainly within 100 feet.  Then, from nowhere, this... ""thing"".. appeared. Carmel and I have always referred to it as the ""dragonfly UFO."" It was on our left, slightly above eye-level -- no more than 10 feet high -- and I'm certain it was within 15 feet of us the whole time, at several moments probably less than half that. This thing was the size of a large dragonfly, I would say around 6 inches, and it flew and hovered the way a dragonfly might... just with MUCH more quick and abrupt movements. Like gravity and inertia didn't mater to it. It would be hovering, and then a handful of seconds later, in what seemed like an instant, it would zip over and be hovering several feet away in a new spot. We were walking while this was all happening, mouths agape I'm sure and staring, but afraid to stop I guess because of the main light's striking brightness. It did seem like it was paying attention to us (I can't believe I'm saying this, but like it was ""scanning"" us), so, during the probably 30 second period this all lasted, we saw this zipping around movement I described several times. It was so astounding. How that made us feel is complicated. In fact, I can only speak for myself. I just know that as this was happening, a few times I glanced quickly around to see if others were seeing this too. There were people around, so I suppose I felt a little bit of the whole ""safety in numbers"" thing. On the other hand, it did seem to stay near us, and we saw its light from the brightest aspect angles, I assume, so it did seem like we were being evaluated somehow. Combine that with the fact that this thing does NOT, truly, seem to be anything that would come from this Earth, and yes, there's a level of fear that mixes in. So all in all, I personally was a little scared, VERY amazed by what it could do, and frankly felt somewhat entertained by it (to the point that I was laughing... as if I knew then I'd never see such a spectacular show again.)  Sound.... This thing made no sound whatsoever. (Even considering the background noise, which is actually not as much as you'd might imagine that time of night on the Nat'l Mall, I feel confident that, given this thing's proximity to us at times, we should have heard something.) ""Lori"" agreed with this: if there were anything to hear, we would've. This ""dragonfly"" SEEMED to be slightly illuminated, but perhaps was just so shiny that it was reflecting the background light. I'm honestly not sure. It was hard to see past its ""main"" light. This was a very bright yellowish light, facing forward, from the ""head""... though it struck me that calling that direction ""forward"" was somewhat arbitrary... and I really only could call it the head because that's where the light was. But this main light didn't show up as a beam, despite its intensity.  Again, maybe because there was a fair amount of background light in the area. What I did make out past of the object past that bright light could be best described as a very elongated computer mouse -- a flatter bottom, more rounded top, and length that was probably 3 - 4 times its width. Height was maybe half its width. All edges were rounded... nothing sharp. By FAR the most interesting feature of this miracle dragonfly was that there seemed to be two small spherical ""wings"" to it. But it wasn't like the blurry whirlwind you'd see when a humming bird or dragonfly are moving their wings very rapidly. It was more like a slightly yellow luminescent haze. Kind of like when you can see the heat rising from the asphalt on a hot summer day, but this was more intense than that. Somehow more turbulent or ""wigglier."" These circles, where dragonfly wings would've been, were not large. Maybe a couple of inches, probably slightly less (because they were less than 1/3 its length). But certainly they were not large enough, had it actually been the blur of wings, to support even the lightest weight imaginable for a ""body"" of that size... i.e., even though we refer to it as the dragonfly UFO, its ""yellow haze ball"" wings were not nearly as large, proportionately, as a dragonfly's. One thing striking to both ""Lori"" and I is that only one other person seemed to see what we were seeing, though there were probably a dozen people within a 30 - 40 foot diameter. It was a girl between 5 to 10 feet behind us, and who herself was several feet away from who I assume was her boyfriend. She and I just quickly glanced at each other, puzzled, amazed, after this thing flew away. Those parts I remember clearly. I think I may have said something like ""what the HELL was that,"" but I can't be sure that I wasn't just thinking it. I know she said nothing to me, but looked shocked and far too white for July in D.C.. As I said, this thing seemed to come out of nowhere. When it left, about 30 seconds later, it receded to our left (which I believe was south at that point, towards the Potomac), very rapidly, in a flat trajectory. No more than +5 degrees flight path. It was as if this thing had instantly decided to go monitor someone else a mile away. The speed at which it left I'd say was 80 to 100 miles per hour. But I could not keep it in sight for long, and don't know if it sped up after that, or where it went. And it reached that 80 - 100 mph speed very, very quickly... as I look at the second hand of my computer clock and replay this in my mind, I'd say just a bit over a second. 1.25 +/- . But you have to understand that this thing was not so easy to see unless the main light was visible to you, and near the end it was not visible to us. You could track it if you HAD seen the main light, and then it turned and maneuvered, but with the way it blended with everything else, pulling in and reflecting, almost duplicating the visual surroundings, I doubt that someone who wasn't in the path of the main light would have noticed it at all. I remember this very clearly: this object did not have to yaw or turn so that it was facing the direction it wanted to fly, nor did it have to pitch its nose up as a typical helicopter would if it wanted to fly backwards. This stuck with me. Standard fixed or rotor wing flight principles are out of the question here. Jet and rocket engines make noise, of which this had none. Even the ion engine things I've seen are not equipped to power something in the way that we saw. Nuclear... sure, whatever. But these are power sources, not propulsion sources, and there is no physics text book in the land that could describe how something could move this way. You almost have to have seen it to believe it... those yellow luminescent ""wing"" spheres... the INSTANTANEOUS stopping and starting. No way. Skeptics may dismiss things like these as obvious hoaxes, but I'm telling you, neither I, nor my ex-girlfriend are idiots. I've tried for 12 years to find ways to convince myself it was some super secret CIA craft, but I just can't believe that. The principles behind this ""dragonfly"" just simply strike me as things which are thousands of years ahead of our technology. I have never heard of UFO sightings such as this, with a small craft doing dragonfly-like darting maneuvers. But I can tell you that ""Lori"" and I discussed this incident many times, and there was always an element of disbelief in those conversations. I'm not sure either of us ever said this explicitly (maybe because of fear of ridicule by the other... because we're intelligent, rational people, right?), but I'm pretty sure there was an unspoken understanding between us that this ""thing"" was not built by man. Yet it was definitely intelligently controlled. The conclusion is one I've avoided, but which is obvious.... I've attached a very rudimentary bitmap. I'm not much with any of those paint programs, but it gives you a pretty close idea. However, as I look at what I ""drew,"" it seems to me that the length should be still longer. Still 6 inches, but the other sides adjusted proportionally down, so that the whole thing would appear longer and thinner, a super fat cigar, almost. By the way, I should tell you, I admire the work your organization is doing, and believe, given what I've seen, and given what it seems others have seen, that your hard work will be validated and highly appreciated within the next 50 years.

I recently watched a documentary (UFOs Seeing is Believing) hosted by Peter Jennings on the National Geographic Channel, which prompted me to report after all this time, something I saw when living in Colorado Springs over 10 years ago. The particular discussion on the type of objects seen in and around Phoenix, AZ at roughly the same time made me think there was something more to what I saw. After returning home from a friend’s house on the evening of the 13th or 14th of March, 1997 at approximately 10:30pm (I remember it was around this time as I had returned from a vacation shortly before, but can’t remember if it was a Thursday or Friday), I went out on my back deck to look at the Hale-Bopp comet which was clearly visible with my small binoculars in the North-Western sky.  At that time I was and still am a Financial Analyst, but have always loved backyard astronomy since I was in Jr. High School and had an issue of Sky & Telescope which told me where to see it. While looking at the comet for several minutes with the binoculars, I saw a distinct flash of light, which caused me to lower them and look to see what had cause it.  For about 10 seconds or so, I saw 5 lights in what seemed to be a triangular formation move quickly from South to North from my perspective.  It moved very fast to the North until it was out of sight, but it was visible long enough to see that the triangular ""V"" formation was kept throughout.  There was no noise or contrail(s) visible (I expected to hear jet noises thinking it was a formation of fighter planes, but there was none). Unfortunately, it moved too fast for me to determine if it was a solid object. This obviously was quite exciting and unusual.  After spending a few more minutes trying in vain to see the object(s) again, I thought this was peculiar enough to report to someone. I looked in the phonebook for someone to call and eventually spoke briefly to a person (whose name I cannot remember) at the local MUFON contact number and gave him the description of what I had seen.  As it was quite late, I agreed to call back the next day to go over the sighting in more detail, but I did not call again.  After thinking it over and keeping in mind that the simplest explanation is most often the right one, I determined that it had to be a formation of fighter planes or maybe a stealth fighter which sort of has that shape. After seeing this documentary and subsequently researching the so-called Phoenix Lights on-line, what I saw and especially the time I saw it is a little too coincidental. I have never seen anything like that before or since, but due to the similarities with what was seen in Arizona, I thought it was time to report what I saw.

We were moving house and I had loads of things to do.  About half way through the morning - about 10.30am I decided to telephone the selling agent.  My phone was on the window ledge at the front of the house, as all the furniture had been moved out - I rang the agent and when I finished the call I put the phone down .. I don't know why (but why not) I stood looking out of the window for a while and noticed a plane in the sky about, I don't know, maybe half a mile away, as I watched it it changed direction and came towards me.  I stood there watching because the way it did the turn was weird it kind of hooked round, like you'd expect a helicopter to do, planes can't do that, but it didn't look anything like a helicopter. It came towards me (in England most of us live in roads where the houses are in rows, pretty much as in the US but the roads are nowhere near as wide - usually about 60') and glided across the row of houses directly opposite me about 4 feet above them.  Straight along the row - it was the weirdest thing that's ever happened to me, I knew when I was watching it that I'd never convince anyone I saw this. It wasn't a plane or a helicopter, I watched it with my mouth open and tried to memorise it so I could draw it later - it was roughly 20 feet long (about the size of a semi-detached house) when it got to the bottom of the road it went behind some trees and just seemed to disappear.  It wasn't until it had gone I realised that it didn't make any sound at all - if it was a plane, or a helicopter - anything that could fly really it would have made a sound (bar a hang glider, but I know what that looks like and it wasn't one). I think about that thing every day but the only thing I can remember about it is that it was like a really high tech plane with a round 'saucer' part hanging out of the bottom of it - I even got the impression that it was scanning the row of houses. When it glided past I looked to see if it had a cockpit .. it didn't. It was really shiny like silver aluminium. Has anybody else seen anything like this? I've tried to draw the thing I saw but I'm useless at drawing and it was so long ago now all I really remember is it being in two parts attached by a kind of arm at a right angle. From a distance it rather looked like a microlight airplane with something hanging underneath it.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

I commuted daily from college in Spokane to my home in the northern part of the state for several years in the mid and late 1990's. I was driving about 2 miles north of Addy, a quarter mile north of south McClain road. The highway in this area is straight with a slight grade north, to the west is approximately a mile of open farmland, to the east a hill that abuts the McClain farmhouse, and small hills to the east and north of the farm. The sun had gone behind the hill to the west a few minutes before, the sky was clear and headlights were unnecessary. As I drove north I noticed two parallel lights approximately a quarter mile ahead, at perhaps 300 feet elevation. The lights were extremely bright, the brightest white light I had ever seen, with a slight blue tint-they looked exactly like halogens, though I had never seen a halogen at that time. They appeared to be separated by a hundred feet or so, but traveled exactly level in elevation and distance from one another. If you put a light on each wingtip of a jumbo jet, then erased the jet, this is how they appeared. They were about 6 times larger than lights you see on plane wings, more the size of round headlights. What I saw happened quickly. I noticed them first about a quarter mile to the left of the highway, they were moving extremely quickly, faster than a jet, yet slower than a meteorite. They flew exactly eastward and then turned a 90 degree angle north without losing speed. Everyone on the highway slammed on their brakes when this happened, so there were other witnesses. This happened approximately 60 miles north of Fairchild Airforce Base. I assumed it was a military excursion with a new secret weapon or aircraft.

I understand about ""gases"" on survice of stars and how they give off color.   What I have been seeing are different colors together but they are in a straight line with usually a bright white light slightly below. I've pointed these lights out to my Son and Husband but their reaction is..it's a star.  Well, tonight I saw the biggest and brightest one of all since Christmas Eve, 2008.  The light was much, much lower then previous lights and therefore was bigger they most lights I have seen. I came out my back door around 8:30PM to go to town to grocery store.  I watched the light for several minutes before pulling our of driveway and it never changed position.  Went to townm did my shopping and when I came back out the light was still there. As I drove home (going West out of Denton, TX) I continued to observe the light.  When I arrived at home it appeared to have gone further West of where I had first observed it but still very bright and low.  I mentioned it to my Husband when he came outside and he confirmed that he had seen it earlier...about two hours ago. I have been seeing similar lights now over the past 10 months.

The place I was watching from is out in the country, totally dark, and one of the highest spots in Illinois, Wisconsin & Iowa. It is quite easy to tell the difference between satellites and aircraft from this vantage point. It is very dark, very little noise (birds and crickets), and quite secluded.  As I watched three satellites move through the sky, I was astounded to see them converge from distant points, and form a triangle, after which they flew off into a different direction.  I know satellites are on a specific trajectory, and seeing them leave that trajectory was very surprising.  I’m just a nurse, not an astronomer, and didn’t know about this website, so told a few friends about it, but didn‘t know where to go from there. Several weeks later, the person whose deck I was watching from (and who laughed at me when I told him about this) was out watching for satellites with me, and we saw the same thing happen, but in a slightly different location in the sky.

We were out camping with another couple in the Fallen Timber area of Alberta about 60 kilometers east of our home in Carstairs (the camp site is located in between Cochrane and Sundre Alberta in the foot hills of the Rocky Mountains, a very nice and secluded, quiet spot) and my wife forgot to pack our lawn chairs so we were sitting around the fire on what was available.. In my case it was the kids wake tube that was left in the camper so I was actually lying back and I happened to look up at the night ski and noticed a very bright that was traveling towards us in a southeast direction. At first I thought is was a plane on approach to Calgary. It was a clear night with many stars and It was a clear night with many stars and the moon visible the moon visible. What was funny about this light though was how it seemed to radiate out in all directions - different than say the lights on a plane because there like a cars headlights (projection style) you can see the beam and its intensity changes as it passes or changes direction. This light was intense and also shined into the blue spectrum and its intensity never changed as it approached, passed over and traveled off so I thought this is not a plane or chopper. I thought as well it may be a satellite, I’ve seen them before but they reflect light and this beamed light and at first seemed too low to be a satellite and traveling to fast to be aircraft. As I said the night was clear and just from its approach and over flight I think we were observing something quite large. When I first saw it I made a comment to the other 3 people that were with me and 2 of them were able to pick it up almost immediately in the night sky and follow its path with me; my friend Darren and his wife Laurie. The other person with us was my wife who had trouble finding it in the night sky.     I believe Laurie watched the object until it went overhead then began to talk with my wife so only Darren and myself followed the light I then leaned over to a tree to steady myse! lf as I just got up from the wake tube and wanted make sure the object was tracking straight because I have looked at stars and other fixed lights at night before and if you are not braced against some thing solid a fixed point can look like its moving. Any how as I leaned against the tree I closed one eye and was watching the light move away from us (still just as bright as it was when approaching or over head) the light zigged to the left approximately 30 to 45 degrees instantly then zagged back onto its original course a second latter. My friend shouted, “did you see that thing zigg zagg” I replied “yes” but was dumbfounded at what I just saw. After the zigg zagg we followed it for another 2 or three seconds and it disappeared behind a tree-covered hill behind us to the southeast that was probably at a 20-degree slope from our site      The thing that was seemed funny afterward was how the experience we were watching gave me the Willies and left me feel kind of unnerved afterward.

I have spent many nights working in remote areas all over North America and have never seen any thing like this before. As I said it traveled very fast going from as far as I could see on one horizon to over the hill top horizon in 10 to 12 seconds.        ",2008-10-31T00:00:00,,

I am in Berwick, Nova Scotia, which is about 15km from CFB Greenwood, N.S., Canada. Greenwood is in Central Nova Scotia in the center of the Annapolis Valley. I had just got home from work when I saw an orange object moving in a SE direction. The object was not very high up and not travelling particularly fast---about the speed of a small plane. I was so concerned that I called CFB Greenwood to report the object thinking it may be something on fire --first time I've ever done such a thing in my life of over 50 years. Shortly after talking with the base operator I witnessed the same object at exactly the same location making a second pass. Both times I watched the object as it disappeared into the night sky toward the ENE which took approximately 20 seconds.  Shortly thereafter my neighbor and her son, in his 20s, pulled into their driveway. I asked them if they'd seen anything as they had come in the direction that the objects were travelling toward. As I was trying to explain what I'd just seen, I looked upward and the same object went across the sky in the exact location a third time. (In retrospect--I think I saw three of the same object on the same path). CFB Greenwood called back and ask some questions and sent the RCMP to my house (for whatever reason??).  The three objects were seen in a span of about 12-15 minutes. The object was firey orange and seemed to shimmer a red/orange. There were no flashing lights and no sound despite the fact this was a 100% clear night with no wind. The objects seemed to be about the elevation of planes which pass over our town to land at CFB Greenwood which is about 10km away to the SW--not very high up--approx. 1000-1500feet. The objects were not lttle points of light but a significant size in the night sky. I am university educated and a former school teacher of 17 years. The object(s) I saw seemed to have a bit of a shimmering effect which at times gave the impression of a burning object yet by the third time I witnessed the object (or objects) I realized it was not flames. Just to add, I spoke with the young man (early 20's) who, with his mother, witnessed the craft on its third pass (or the third one), He has a very good friend who is a MP (member of military police) at the Greenwood air base. He informed my neighbor that the base received at least 15 calls over a forty mile path that evening. The base person I spoke with told me he had received only one call initially. In my last conversation with them that evening I was told me they had fifteen calls going on but they were not related to a UFO. What I saw was not any conventional aircraft or flying object I have ever seen.  About one week later a German tourist took this video about 100km SE of where I live.  It was quickly explained away as flares dropped by the military.

Our plane initially approached from the south, then turned east to land on a different runway.  After the plane had turned east, I was watching the ground, looking at the cars and houses and farm fields around DIA.  There were clouds beneath us.   I was watching the things on the ground when a white sphere of light coming from underneath a cloud caught my eye.  I dismissed it as the sun's reflection off of an airplane or a windshield, or possibly a light on top of a communications tower, this area being a loosely populated area with a high amount of air traffic.   I then questioned my initial dismissal when from beneath the cloud I observed two more, and noticed how the ground was moving beneath them, in a formation with the first observed.  This was in the course of a few seconds.   I watched this group, traveling west, but our plane and the formation of lights were traveling in opposite directions and I could no longer see them for the clouds and the window well obstructing my view.  I shrugged my shoulders, and continued to watch the ground.   I saw a white light, moving in a squiggly path, traveling south.  I saw it only momentarily, before it was obscured by another cloud.  We landed and I saw nothing further afterward. The flight was a Frontier flight.  The aircraft was a Bombardier turboprop.  I was seated forward of the propellers. I am a Cavalry Scout.

I could see no fuselage on any of the aircraft, but it's possible that I was at too high of an elevation (I was above some spotty clouds, these were below) to be able to see anything beyond the shining lights.

We got into our car and followed the object, which had to have been moving close to 100 miles per hour. I distinctly remember the object passing in front of an airplane descending onto the runway. Afterward, the object moved too quickly out of our range to keep up with it. The local television station, KPLC, reported that there had been multiple sightings. The next day, our newspaper, ""The American Press,"" reported that what people were seeing was a blimp with lights inside of the inflated part that was illuminating it.

It was sometime in August 2000.  I am a drummer and had just packed up my gear and was heading home.  We had played at a place called ‘Rosie’s’ in Harrington.  I lived in Wilbur Washington. I have not drank nor done drugs since May 28th, 1998.  I have a full time day job, music is my hobby. It was about 2:30am and I was traveling toward Hiway 20 ((sic.  Route 2)) on a back road from Harrington that comes out by the power transformer station (I guess that’s what it is) onto Hiway 20 west of the Davenport Refuse Transfer Station.  I think the back road is called Rocklyn Road. I was in my Ford van which had a big windshield.  I glanced out the driver side window and noticed a huge jet black triangle shaped object outlined against the clear night sky.  It had one small red light in the very center.  This red light did not blink.  This object was moving very slow towards Spokane, Washington.  I pulled over to get a better look.  Even though it was dark out, I could distinctly see this object.  It was huge.  About 300 feet long, maybe 200 feet across the back.  The sides went straight up about 40 feet.  I rolled down my window (I did not get out of the van because I was pretty freaked out by now) and it made absolutely no sound.  I sat and watched as it slowly passed in front of my van.  It was about 200-300 feet off the ground.  It took about 15 minutes to pass in front of me if that tells you how slow it was moving. As it passed my van I saw 5 very big square lights across the back of it.  They spanned the full width across the back as well as went almost from the top to bottom of the object.  I am absolutely sure there were five lights because there was a dark line between each of them.  These lights were intensely bright.  Even though they were bright, they didn’t seem to give off light outside the object itself.  They didn’t seem to light anything up.  I thought to myself, ""Llights that bright should throw some light onto the ground,""  but they didn’t.   I watched as it silently disappeared from my view.  My heart was pounding and I was scared to death.  The next day I told some friends.  They immediately told me I was seeing things.  I know what I saw.  I have no reason to make up story like this.  I don’t care if anybody believes me or not.  I know what I saw.  I will never forget it.  I was going to send this report in several years ago, but could never get myself to push the send button.  Seeing  that you are now located at Davenport, I thought if nothing else you should know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter.   It's hard to pinpoint where I actually was that night because of the darkness.  I was probably 5-6 miles out of Harrington heading toward hiway 20.  ((sic.  Route 2))   I know I had passed where there is a Y in the road.   For the life of me I can't remember how long it was untill I came upon one of the old farm houses after I watched it.  Like I said I was very freaked out by then.  We usually played every other weekend at Rosies.  We always played the first and third weekend of the month.  My best guess would be August 19, 2000.  Rosies has closed since then but I could talk to to the other band members and see if they remember the exact date.   I kept running it through my mind the rest of the way home and do not remember much of the surroundings after that.  I kept asking myself things like ""could it have been a helecopter?""  Then I would remind myself just how big this thing was and how it made no noise.  So then I thought maybe a balloon.  Again, it was so big and so quiet with absolutely no blinking warning lights, just the small red light on the bottom in the center.  I ruled out balloon.  Maybe a big plane from fairchild?  It would have fallen out of the sky it was moving so slow.    I have always had this missconception that UFO's were round, saucer shaped objects.  That UFO's darted about then hovered, then darted about some more.  This did not fit that category at all. In my wildest dreams I would never have thought of them as being triangle shaped.  I always thought of them as being lit up with multicolored lights.  Again, only the small red light and the 5 sqaure lights across the back.  This object was totally black.  No lights on the sides.  I thought they would make humming or whirring sounds.  There was complete silence.   I kept questioning myself about the 5 lights across the back.  They did not fit the norm for lights that bright.  If you were to look at 2 bright headlights that are 2-3 feet apart, you would see two distinct bright points of light.  The light from those two headlights would join at a distance and you would probably not be able to see a distinct gap between them unless you were standing right next to them. From a distance they would blend together.  The gaps between the 5 bright lights on this object were very distinct.  Even at a distance.  The light formed definite edges that were perfectly straight.  I mentioned in my letter to you that they were square.  Actually they were more rectangular.  Taller than they were wide.   I am 51 years old and have never in my life seen anything that even remotely resembled what I saw that night.  It defied all logic.  The only thing that could move that slow and stay in the air would be a balloon.  This was not a balloon.  I can not tell you exactly how big it was because I had no reference points.  In the darkness I could not see buildings or trees, just the outline of the hills.  I can tell you that my Ford Van was a 1989 E250 Custom van.  It had a big front windshield and that at one point this object completely filled it.  This object was probably 400-600 feet directly in front of me and 200-300 feet off the ground at that moment.  It was very, very big.   This expierience has changed the way I think. I don't take things for granted anymore.  I don't believe that just because the Theory of Relativity states we can not travel  faster than the speed of light, we can't travel faster the speed of light.  I am full of ""What If's and Why's""  What if we simply do not have a calculation that would prove that theory wrong?  What if a life form millions of years older than ourselves had the capability to travel through space at speeds we can't begin to imagine?  Only 500 years ago people would have said you were crazy to think it possible to talk to someone  5000 miles away instantly in real time.  Why do scientist's and engineers continue to develop ways to travel faster if it's not possible to travel faster than the speed of light?  Even at the speed of light things are simply so far away it would do us no good.  I believe they are hoping the Theory of Reletivity is also wrong. The universe is huge. Just because we can't do it, does not mean another  much older inteligent life form can't.    As humans I believe now that we are self centered and very, very small in the grand scheme of things. I believe that we have conditioned ourselves to think if we can't do it, it can't be done.  I believe if we can imagine it, eventually it will be done.  I also believe something, a life form or entity, whatever, just beat us to it.   As I stated, I don't care if anybody believes me.  I know what I saw and nobady will ever convince me otherwise.  I know in my heart that the object I saw that night, was NOT from this planet.  As for my credibility... take a drive to Wilbur, go into Sandy's family foods.  I worked there 10 years as a shift supervisor, ask them.  Everybody in Wilbur knows me.  I am not a publicity seeker and have nothing to gain by making up a story such as this.  I have palyed music proffesionally for over 30 years and have had all the publicity a person would ever want.  My wife and I are very private people, almost to point of being hermits.  I just wanted you to know what I had seen in your area.  I will draw you a picture of what I saw if you would like and attach it to an email.

Between 12/20/00-1/7/01.   I am from Hawaii, born and raised, my family and I moved from the big island in 2000.  I was visiting the big island on university  winter break from WWU during my freshman year of college.  I was staying at a friends house in the Agricultural lots above Keaau.   We were swimming in my friends backyard pool and playing around.  I pushed myself out of the water and lay on the edge of the pool on my back.  There were almost no clouds in the sky that day that I can remember.  It was 3 in the afternoon, super hot and sunny.  On my back, I was getting a little blinded by the sun shining in my eyes, so I put my hand up to block the sun from my eyes.  We were just chilling and after a short while I noticed there was something in the sky not far from the sun.   With outstretched arms in front of me blocking out the sun,  I could see something 2-3 inches from the sun(not literally, but 2-3 inches from where the edge of my hand was blocking out the sun).  The first thing I thought was ”this is unusual, the sun is really, really bright right now, how can I see this thing right next to the sun?”  I told my friend about it who was on the deck as well.  He looked up and saw it, and didn’t know what to think.  We both yelled to our friends and family in the house to come outside and see the UFO.  My friends parents came out, but didn’t spend long looking up and couldn’t see anything.  Me and my friend watched it for a while, it did not move at all.  As we were looking we could almost see the detail of the thing.  It looked super big, but really far away.  You could see that it was either made of light at times or was metallic and reflective.  It would kind of shine like a star, reflecting light, but you could see that it was metallic like as well, definitely round looking, could have been saucer shaped but was too far away to tell and we were seeing only the underside.  The really weird part is this:  after around 5 minutes of watching this thing, I asked my friend if he had ! binocula rs or a telescope.  He said he had binoculars in his car.  He ran to get them as I was still on my back keeping an eye on this thing.    The whole time he is looking for and bringing these binoculars I was watching it.   He returns 30 seconds later, and he hands them to me while I’m on my back, hand it the air blocking the sun, with my eyes on the object.  I put the binoculars to my eyes and try to focus to find the object but I could not find it. All the while my  friend is asking me what I see.  Nothing through the binoculars, so I put them down to try and find the object with my eyes.  I couldn’t find it after that.  It had disappeared right when my friend gave me the binoculars, not before or after.  We were unable to find the object after that.  Pretty weird, something was watching us that day!  I am Hawaiian Chinese and Caucasian, grew up on the big island, went to Keaau and waiakea public schools.  I graduated high school in 2000 and was attending WWU in Bellingham WA at the time.  I have graduated since then and am in Bellingham WA with my family at the moment.  We have known each other  since we were 7 years old.  My friend is a Caucasian, who grew up on the big island, went to Keaau, and waiakea public schools as well.  He is very book smart, AP student and is a doctor of pharmacy.

Triangular craft hovered with car for aprox 10min, then moved forward, up & dissapeared fast We were driving from Orlando to Daytona on I4 East-bound.  I would say it was approximately 00:30-01:00 hours.  I was in the backseat of the car, staring at the skyline as we drove home. My best friend was in the back with me, but she was sleeping soundly.  There are lots of tree's to the sides of I4, so I had my face kind of plastered against the window so that I could look at the stars.  The night was very clear. The driver had his eyes on the road, but his friend in the passenger seat was fiddling with a CD.  I remember he put it in and it was some music from The Phantom of the Opera, so I glanced at them for a few seconds and went back to looking out of the window. I noticed something different in the distance and started paying close attention.  There were three very bright lights hovering above us, they were not stars because they were moving in unison with us.  They started getting bigger and MUCH closer. I didn't want to look away, I was sort of in awe and wondering what the heck I was looking at.  I ran through all of the things it could be... a jet, a military plane... hmmm, but it hovered down even more so and now I could see it was a triangular object and since it was now so close the middle of it looked pitch black, you could only tell it was triangular because of the lights--they were close the the edges of this massive aircraft, and because it was so dark it looked like there was a triangular whole in the sky -- (for lack of a better description)  There was NO sound. As we drove the thing hovered along with us for a good ten minutes.  The guy in the passenger seat was watching it too but neither of us really said anything at first.  I think we were both kind of shocked and silently curious. I couldn't tell you how high up this thing was.  The gap between it and the tree's wasn't huge to the eyesight, but the angle was a little strange so I have no way to measure.  It was definitely high up, but it still looked SO LARGE. Finally, it moved away by going up, slightly forward and then in a flash it was gone. The friend and I both spoke then, wondering if the driver had seen it.  We were glad that the both of us had watched it so carefully and talked about it only for a few minutes afterward, but our reports were identical.  We knew then we had definitely seen something that was not normal.  We were silent the rest of the way. I told my brother when I got home.  I was only 20 at the time and thought everyone would think I was crazy, well, everyone except for my brother.  He thought I should report it and see if anyone else did, but I felt weird about doing so.  I found this website a while back and thought about report it several times, but because it was so long ago I didn't think it would matter now. I can't give you any background information on the guy in the passenger seat. He was a friend of the driver and I had only met him twice before and very briefly.  I know he was a serious kind of guy, but that is about it. At the time, I was a florist and wedding planner. Since then I have been very interested in UFO's and I keep my eyes open all of the time, but sadly I have not seen anything strange since.  I wish I would have had a camera. None of us had been drinking at all. The car was not affected at all.

It was a clear day and my husband and I were alone at Arroyo De La Cruz beach in Big Sur California.  We saw about six UFOs that looked like stars high in the sky coming from opposite directions meeting together above us.  They came together and made shapes then the shapes would spin and they would all take off back from were they came from.  They repeated this process over and over again for about an hour.  There were a few air planes that passed by way closer to the ground than the UFOs in that time.  You could tell the UFOs were going 100 times faster.  I thought it was weird that there was no thunder from the sound barrier being broken. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

My wife and I were walking near the intersection of Second and Bainbridge streets in Philadelphia on a clear, cloudless late afternoon when I noticed a very dense and unusual contrail appearing above buildings to the SE, moving on a heading more or less parallel to the Delaware River, which runs ~SSW to NNE at that point.   The contrail seemed much wider and denser than a normal contrail, and had no gap in the center as is typical of normal airliner trails.  It was moving at about the normal speed of a high-altitude jet or perhaps somewhat faster, and seemed to be at the height of a normal jet at cruising altitude, but possibly higher - very hard to tell with no reference points.   At the head of the trail was a small but very obvious fiery reddish ball.  It may have been the reflection of the late-afternoon sun on a plane, but I've seen many, many airliners under these conditions and this looked different.  It twinkled and at no time did it appear to change intensity.  Usually a strong sun glint on an airliner will vary as the reflection angle changed, but this didn't.  It looked exactly like a giant reddish road flare making a dense smoke trail heading more or less toward northern New Jersey.   I say giant because of the size of the trail.  It is impossible to estimate the size of the object but it appeared comparable to the size of Venus or Saturn when they're at their largest and most visible.  A twinkling, starlike reddish road flare with an immense and persistent white smoke trail.  It was unusual enough that we stopped to watch it until it disappeared behind buildings.  It didn't change speed, heading, altitude or intensity, and the motion was very steady.  The smoke trail remained for at least several minutes.  My thought at the time was that it was a reentry of some satellite, or an unusual meteor.   I recall that there were some unusual meteor incidents in the time frame, but this was not the same as this one, for example: http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/07/23/flash.boom/index.html http://www.meteorobs.org/maillist/msg22061.html  It was shortly before 9/11, if I recall correctly. There were no other contrails visible at the time, by the way. This was the most obvious thing in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was rising at a normal helium balloon speed and appartently coming from the neighbors, 3 houses down, backyard.  After noticing the lights all off at their home and no car in the driveway I was suspicious of how it had come from that backyard that was dark and silent.  Then, without my perceptive ability to actually see the transition, it was now instantly a dull grey cigar shaped craft about 50 feet up above the houses.  It was not a balloon anymore yet retained the same color and underneath the hull of this silent and now motionless craft was a rectangular shaped protrusion of sorts that was obviously a part of the craft's geometry. In the right corner of this short protruding box-like bottom was a brilliant, almost like DIGITAL/LED square light.  The light blinked on and off with no apparent pattern and the object was the size of 3 or 4 mini-vans worth of mass in the sky from the distance I saw it.  It slowly moved horizontally over to be closer to me standing there and remained still nearly over head for a near full minute.

I have no idea what year I saw this but I know it was sometime between 2000-2004 in the summer months.  I was standing on the front porch of my parents house in Upper Gwynedd, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.  I was catching a smoke and I looked out straight off my porch to the horizon where I saw 3 solid red lights in a triangular formation.  To give an idea of size, if I put my thumb up, I probably could’ve have covered all 3 from site.  I know this doesn't give a clear idea of size since there are too many variables.  There were no sounds from the objects. I am disheartened as I definitely dismissed this as nothing at the time and now I don‘t know when it happened.  I really always thought it had to be something that I just didn't know of.   But, I just finished watching an hour long show on the Chicago Tinley Park siting, which had supposedly been seen around the world in a matter of days.  Chills ran down my spine watching this as this is exactly what I saw.  And while the lack of date of occurrence, it is definitely possible that it happened in 2004, around the same time as the Tinley incident (which also happened in the summer.)  I will say, the minor differences, the lights in my case seemed to be closer together, and they unfortunately fell slowly below the horizon which has a high tree line.  However, this very well could’ve been the objects moving away from me, but I just don't know.  I can also say with certainty, that the objects moved in perfect unison and the lights were perfectly solid (no flickering/dimming).  There is NO way these were flares or aircraft lights.  There is a great deal of aircraft traffic in my area from Philadelphia International Airport.  Their landing pattern goes right over the Landsdale area.  There is also an innumerable amount of small plane airports in the area.  I'm used to seeing commercial aircraft, small planes, military aircraft from Willow Grove Air Base, helicopters from Merck, helicopters from Medivac Hospitals. To add to my credibility, I have never seen UFO’s before, and even after this incident, I was doubtful that I saw anything unexplainable (only I couldn‘t explain it).  I am an audio video technician so I know the intricacies of video and the differences of seeing something with the naked eye vs. an image or video from a camera’s CCD or film.  These objects very well may have been the same as the videos from Chicago.  And one thing the show did not touch on is this eye/camera differences.  I can say the lights were probably the same because they were perfectly solid, and there’s little doubt in my mind that the lights seen in Chicago were just as solid.  Most people don’t realize that a camera will never see a solid light as perfectly solid.  And judging by the videos I just saw, they seemed like they very well could’ve been perfectly solid, made seemingly flickering from camera abarition. Well, that’s it.  I’m sure I’m just one in thousands with this siting, but I wanted to add my two cents.  MUCH THANKS to the History Channel for bringing this in the public eye…I may never have acknowledged what I experienced as something important!!!",2009-01-10T00:00:00,40.2262,-75.2931

When I went back in the house after taking the photos, it was still hovering so I don't know exactly how long it was there. After about 10 minutes I grabbed my Fuij digital camera and took a series of 8 photos a few seconds apart.

It was a red blinking light with one white light at 9'clock and another white light at 3'clock. I started to realize it was strange when the white lights were not blinking (which would have been the wings of a plane). I called to my husband to come out and look at it. The lights around the object were actually illuminating the craft. 'If it were a plane that low, why aren't we hearing any sound?' is what was going through my mind. As it was moving towards the east, towards the hill in front of our house, the white lights moved clock-wise so the object was now vertical. We both are saying out loud ""what the heck is that!!"". At this time the white light that was now at 12'clock separated moving up- further away from the other lights. It continued to follow the lights (i say 'lights' now that the craft is not visible by illumination). We bot! h ran through the house to the front to watch it more. As it reached towards the horizon of the hill the white light that was at 12'clock was gone and a quick flash of white light (as if the flash of a camera) was seen in the north. After this flash the lights were now beyond the hill's horizon and out of our sight. About 4-5min after this we returned to the back porch. My husband soon noticed a bright whitish light coming from the west (near where the border patrol is located in VT) towards the east moving slower than a 'shooting star' but too fast to be a plane. I only noticed this light at about the half-way point of where my husband first noticed it. Just after that left our sight there was a plane moving towards the same direction. About 3m after this there was another plane heading in the same direction of the craft. There seems to be a lot of flight activity tonight and I'm hoping these pilots noticed what we did.  We're having a hard time naming the shape of the craft. It was almost like a really fat cigar shaped or oval-like. We could only see what was facing us. I'm not sure if there was another side of the craft that was not visible to us or not. It could have been saucer shaped but it's hard to say. I really hope there is someone else around that witnessed the same thing.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

The object was stationary and continued to be observed from the corner shopping center, surrounding streets, neighborhood and from any point on the family property adjacent to the eleventh tee of the Painted Mountain Golf Course in far northeastern Mesa, Arizona.  The duration of the sighting was between four to eight minutes with a desert monsoon thunderstorm cell moving in from the north at approximately twenty-five miles per hour ended the sighting by piling in to mask in part, then wholly obscure the apparantly stationary object.  The angle of observation f! rom the mean horizon (Horizon is mountainous and a badlands region) of approximately forty degrees of angle.  The Azimuth from the driveway of the witnesses' home was a north-northeast heading of approximately twelve degrees.  The size of the object was similar to that of a seseme seed when held at arm's length.  In binoculars, the object appeared to be flatter than an upside-down candy kiss, but disc-shaped, with a round top and a slightly cone-shaped extended belly. Cell phone photo images appeared as nothing more than a faded point of light.  No detsil was descernible. The sun had already set minutes before but the waning afternoon had not quite reached the twilight stage.  No stars were visible in the northern or eastern sky above or between thundercells.  The quality of the light on the object precluded any possibility of it being illuminated by reflected or refracted light from the sun due to it being the wrong color and spectrum. SPECIAL NOTE: OBSERVER'S OPINION:  If the object were in fact an intensely glowing helium weather balloon, the altitude would be above twenty thousand feet and the size of the expanded gas bag would be a quarter of the internal volume of a sports stadium.  The flourescent spectrum-appearing internal glow was of an intensity that battery power for such a structure would be the size of a Uhaul trailer and would be too heavy to lift. This thing appeared too brightly lit, and was possibly too big to be an air force of NASA balloon construction. The location in the sky was north of and to the left of the northeastern approach corridor for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and aircraft inbound and on approach to the runways were lined up to the east at an azimuth of approximately 80 degrees and were sporting intense, halogen landing lights in a spectrum completely different from the object.  That approach corridor takes the aircraft over the northern crags and spurs of Superstition Mountain and the Tonto National Forest. The entire flight pattern was at far lesser altitude than the object and was under the acumuated thunder cells inbound from both east and north. Lightning was flashing at a rate of severa discharges per minute both east and north from an azimuth of 120 degrees to zero degrees.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,33.42126454293629,-111.772797322253

It was clearly a light, not a star, and looked to be the size of a large spotlight with one primary beam coming down.  However, it was partially obscured behind a house, so I did not at first see that, while there was only one “light”, there were in fact two beams coming down.  Also, this light was extremely high in the sky; this was clear by the fact that the length of the light beams, despite coming from an intensely bright light, ended far, far above the ground, what looked like miles from our perspective.  Nothing on the ground was therefore illuminated.   As soon as I rounded the bend and saw these beams, they immediately began to disappear in a strange manner.  Rather than getting smaller and smaller as they ascended, the brightness diminished in a nanosecond; what was left was the “after light”.  It appeared that the light had perhaps disappeared behind a cloud; however, the night seemed to ! be cloudless, based on the fact that stars were visible (although, due to the density of ground light, there were not many of them).  The “after light” lasted several seconds as it got dimmer and dimmer; it was clear that the “lights” had not been turned off, rather, that whatever they were attached to was ascending rapidly in the sky.  The entire incident last approximately 20 seconds.  It was witnessed by myself and my friend, who saw essentially the same thing (though she did not have as good a view as I did, being more blocked by the house that had at first obscured my full view).",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

Triangle Shaped Object Over I-10 Near Casa Grande. The incident occurred in Arizona on August 7, 1999 (not 1998) on I-10 between Phoenix and Casa Grande around 12 midnight. The area is the Gila Bend Reservation and there is not a lot of development - no lights. It was a very clear night as was usual in Arizona. As I was traveling south, I notice ahead that several cars on the interstate appeared to be putting their brake lights on, slowing and it also seemed that several had stopped completely. I assumed I was approaching a wreck. As I got closer to an overpass, I saw that cars were also pulled off the road and at least one man was out of the car looking up. Suddenly on the right side of the car, an object raced by me (at or near car level). It was like a bright flash that ""zoomed"" past me like I was sitting still. The hair stood up on my arms and I realized that this was something out of the ordinary. At that point I told my son, who was asleep in the back seat to wake up. The object had the brightest lights I had ever seen and at that time I couldn't tell anything about the shape. Once I got on the other side of the overpass, the object was overhead. It was triangle shaped with three super bright white lights on the three corners. At this point, I could see the object race back and forth overhead crossing the interstate from right to left and back. sort of in a ""swooping"" flight path. At the same time, it was turning and rotating and the lights were shining down on the road, in the air, and all over. (The motion would be as if you were holding an object in your hand and turning your hand round and round.) There was absolutely no sound. This whole incident took 5 minutes. I didn't actually stop the car but continued driving at a very slow pace. I know that others were pulled off and looking as I drove away. Being alone with my son, I was worried stopping. I have seen a few ""odd"" things from time to time looking out at the sky. However this incident was beyond that. It was close and it was real.

This sighting occured between approximately 6-7 pm, in broad daylight, as I was stopped at the stoplight on Hwy 50 (in front of Wal Mart and across the Hwy from East Central College), several cars in front of me, several behind me. I was Eastbound headed toward I-44, and while stopped at the light, I noticed the cars stopped Westbound, looking at something to my left. I looked to my left, I remember having to turn my head quite far - practically over my left shoulder, and hovering approximately 20 ft over the trees was a massive object. The exact location at the time had a large barn and silo on it, but is now a strip mall of shops - directly west (to the left if you are facing the front of it) of wal mart. The object appeared to be 20+ feet high, 50 to 60 feet wide, and it was matte mettalic looking, grey/silver in color. Solid in appearance, with no distinguishable lights or windows. The object appeared to be motionless, and made no audible sound that we could hear. The best way to give a visual is this: Take a stainless steel dogs food/water bowl, and turn it upside down. This hovering object was wider at the top, slightly narrower at the bottom. As I recall, it took several seconds for my brain to process what I was seeing, as it wasn't necessarily scary looking, it was more of a ""what the ****?"" reaction, more alarmed than frightened. I turned to look at my daughter in the front passenger seat - she was leaning forward and towards me, looking out my driver side window at the object, with her mouth hanging open. I remember saying ""you see it too?"", to which she replied with a nod of her head indicating ""Yes"". I had the presence of mind to glance around at the other vehicles, the traffic light had turned green and no one moved, we were all looking at the object. I looked back at the object and stared at it for what seemed like maybe 1 minute more, and I promise as God is my witness, it ""disappeared"".  My daughter's interpretation of it is the same. One second it was there, and the next, gone. No dramatic flight at high speed was witnessed, just the analogy that it seemed to vanish in the blink of an eye. The craziest thing of all, looking back on it now, is that there had to be at least 6 cars that I noticed, whose occupants were looking at the same thing we were, and none of us acknowledged to each other what we had just seen. I checked the local newspapers for months after the incident, hoping for some validation, but could find none. My husband said that if I wouldn't report it out of fear of being labeled a psycho-nutcase, what made me think anyone else would report it? He had a point. Anyway, I plan on checking back here from time to time, to see if anyone else comes forward. I would like to point out that I see that there IS another report on here that sounds like a family saw the same type of object in almost the exact location, except their experience occured in 2004. I held my breath when I saw ""Union"" and ""Wal Mart""! I hope more people ""google"" their experience, as I just did, and find this site. After all of these years, reading about the other Union Wal Mart sighting report gives me the validation that I have been searching for, for many years. THANK YOU!! Is it possible to put us in touch with each other via our contact information we provide to NUFORC?

"First off, I apologize for the length of the ""report"" however, it took quite sometime for me to actually be interested enough to find o",Oceanside,CA,2001-01-01T18:00:00,light,Minutes,"Occurred : 1/1/2001 18:00  (Entered as : 01012001 18:00) Reported: 1/23/2009 10:48:18 AM 10:48 Posted: 3/19/2009 Location: Oceanside, CA Shape: Light Duration:Minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68201.html,"First off, I apologize for the length of the ""report"" however, it took quite sometime for me to actually be interested enough to find out where/how to make a report.  Mainly, I have heard many stories in my life of ghosts and UFO's.  I'm not one to believe everything I hear.  Until recently, that's been my view.  So, skeptic?, absolutely, believer?, still working on that one. Here is my past, I've been in the Marine Corps for nine years and 8 months.  I am an operator of a type of Amphibious Assault Vehicle. Google: AAV for more information.  Deployed to the Asias, Iraq and several Floats (stationed aboard Navy Ships).  During these times, I have literally flown in every single type of helicopter that can carry a human being, CH (Cargo Helicopter).  Due to my type of ""Job"", I have come into contact with most AH (Attack Helicopter)types.  Reason why I'm saying this is, I know how they sound.  It's kind of a show-off technique that I can name most Helo's by the sounds of their rotors.  Each one, each type, each speed approximately can be relatively determined by the the sound of the rotors and how many rotors they have.  I can also fairly judge the distance and estimate where and abouts their ""buddy"" is, since no single helo can fly alone, there is always a buddy located nearby.  Also, I know what loud vehicles sound like, sounds can identify many things without seeing them.  My times in Iraq fine-tuned my ability to identify sounds, especially while on patrol.  All this being said, here is my account of what I have seen and heard of through my military career. During MCT (Marine Combat Training), approximately 15101999 0200, we experienced an earthquake. My instructor was livid in the morning, his truck which he had parked off the side of the road was rattled off the cliff.  Yes, a cliff.  You can imagine the pain we experienced that morning, he was quite mad.  Later on that evening, the instructors were commenting on the report given by the firewatch during that time.  Apparently, a helo came hovering by at a rapid speed.  When asked how fast, ""it was fast"" was given the answer.  Now consider, the Marine was probably 18 and never exposed to such things until then.  So ""fast"" in Marine terms: It was flying at ridiculous speed.  I know, I was young once too and would have said the same thing.  Also, he said it made weird sounds and was close enough he could have thrown a rock at it before it dipped into the valley.  Camp pendleton has numerous valley and hills.   Later that day, when asked, no one felt the earthquake and still, no one has really been able to explain how the instructors truck was pushed off a cliff sideways, when nothing else moved nearby.  I would think that if a truck could be rattled and shaken enough to move it sideways, things around us, such as ourselves since we slept on isomats on the ground would have moved also.  I think I would have awoken when I felt another man pressed up against me!  At the time and still to this day, it's a funny as hell story. Looking back though, it's always intrigued me just how...odd it really sounds. Next account, jets don't fly over pendleton unless it's when the President or another very high staff member comes to pendleton.  Due to the runways limited size here, it's a helicopter Air Wing, few planes land on the runway.  Mainly small jet type passenger planes.  So, when something flies over your car, on Basilone road, at the speed of a jet, you take notice.  Especially when it's about a hundred feet over your car.  Basilone road is a road that cuts through base from I-5 to vandergrift rd.  A very long and lonely stretch of road at 2 am in the morning.  That's what time I was Designated Driver to 2 friends coming back from the bar.  This was around Christmas time the same year as the one account prior to this one, 1999. Next account, a close friend borrowed my car to go see his girlfriend in San Clemente.  The drive from Oceanside to San Clemente is about 20-25 minutes on the I-5.  When he came back that night to give me my keys, he said the strangest thing happened, a bright green ball of light flew along the coast, up and over the car, then headed back over to the coast, the entire time heading in a northerly direction.  He said it flew way faster than a helicopter and when it was about 1000 meters off to the side and in front of him, the thing just ""took off"".  Faster than he had ever seen anything go. His girlfriend, now wife, said exactly the same thing and she was ""totally freaked out"".  On a side note, the stretch of highway has few lights where this happened.  What lights there are, do not reflect green off your windows.  That was my first assumption until driving down the same highway several times over the years, at different times, and I have NEVER seen any type of green light reflection.  Only yellow or white. In Okinawa, Camp Schwab, I was snorkeling with several friends at Naha island, about 1000 meters from shore.  I'm sure Naha Island is not the actual name, just our name for it. Naha means south.  There is an area on this island where it's covered and is quite cozy and perfect to have a sort of camp fire party.  In other words, it's canopied and we could have a fire and get very, very drunk without anyone seeing us or caring to swim out there to investigate.   Around midnight, some of us went to the closest cliff to ""relieve ourselves"".  The cliff faced away from base. While, doing this, one of my buddies who was apparently gazing up at the stars in a slight stupor, pointed out, ""Holy shit man, you see that?""  Yes, that is exactly what he said, still funny to this day. We all looked up and about 2000-4000 meters above us,  It's sort of hard to judge distance slightly intoxicated, there were three lights spinning but not spinning...it was like they were rotating about 45 degrees and back again but 75 degrees that time.  Thinking about it now, I don't think it was rotating as in parallel to the ground but was an illusion.  I think now that it was more or less tilting in different directions. What ever it was, if the lights were separate craft, I have never seen helo's do that in such perfect unison.  Odd thing was, it didn't just ""shoot off"", it moved slowly away from base, over the ocean until it was gone. Next account, flying back from Okinawa a few years later, around 2003, I looked out the window of the plane and saw several objects off to our left moving the opposite direction of us.  Probably around a mile.  Could have been planes.  They had to have been larger than C-130's and were definitely not passenger planes, unless they fly escort for one another.  Reason why I know they weren't C-130's, they were large.  Huge would be a better adjective. While in Iraq, I did see a Hercules plane. That was about how big those craft were.  Could have been that but still, I'm pretty sure I would have been able to see the shape of the wings.  Those planes are massive. Either way, I thought I would include this one since it is a iffy situation. Next account, Al Anbar Province, Iraq. I was on a night raid in a village in Bubaydah. I'm sure that spelling is incorrect. I was in the turrent of a Humvee. My LtCol asked me what the hell are those Helo's doing here. This was a very important operation, Helo's do not fly close to a ""snatch and grab"" for obvious reasons. My captain got on the hook and radio'ed whoever it is they radio to find out who and why someone was compromising our mission. Radio reply was they didn't know but be advised, jets are inbound. Bebeydah is very very close to the Syrian border, cause for alarm was very just. I was watching the light for about 5-10 minutes. During that specific time, it just sort of moved around, like it was searching for something. It was about 5 miles distant, 1000 meters altitude. It was bobbing and weaving. Acting much the way a Helo would during a sweep mission. Then I noticed, where is his buddy? If it was a Cobra, a Huey would be flying at a higher altitude and a little distance. If it was a ""Huey, then the cobra should have been able to be seen around it. Cobras are difficult to see unless their light is facing you and at that distance, it would have to face us for us to see it. It could have been there. That's what I was thinking. When the jets arrived, thankfully not over the city, they closed in on the Helo. I swear to this day, I saw them shoot rockets at it. I saw four contrails following the glow of four rockets headed straight for it. I know what rockets look like at night, you can see the smoke through the burn of the rocket, it lights it up, hard to explain typing but, I know what a rocket looks like. When those rockets got close to the Helo, they just lost power and fell. Still moving forward, I'm sure of that, inertia and all but, it was the craziest thing I have ever seen, the burners just stopped, when that happens, usually an explosion can be seen, not this time. They just winked out. When this happened they were about 3 miles away. The Helo, and I'm calling it that because, it could! have be en at this point, started chasing one of the jets. Not really chasing it because it would fly in front of it, behind and then under it. I then realized, this wasn't a helo. Helo's don't fly as fast as a jet, especially maneuvering like that. Common sense does replace rationality eventually. After about 3 minutes of this ""taunting"" it flew off. Simple as that, no explosions, only sound was the jets. Eventually, they took off back to where they came from. This occured in 2006. So, that's my experiences. I have heard of many many more. Specifically the lights that follow you and pass you on the I-5 going to LA. I've heard probably 10-20 accounts of that. As I said, I'm a skeptic. Not really one to accept an explanation without hard facts but, I also know, if the facts don't add up, then how do you explain it? I've seen some odd things and usually at the time, I blow it off. The incident in Iraq pretty much made me reassess those situations that I kind of didn't really care about the first time. Thinking back, I should have looked a little closer and took notes a little better. So, I think you should possibly check into sightings over Camp Pendleton, especially along the coast. On another side note, my fiance was telling me about how she saw a craft rise out of the ocean from her house. She on the other hand, fully believes in greys, white's or blues, whatever color they are referred to as. She is a conspirasist to the utmost degree. Needless to say, I really don't take her seriously, but, she apparently has seen some things while living in Carlsbad that she explains as UFO's. She also said something about Illinois but I hate to say, I kind of tune her out after awhile. Thank you for reading this and I hope it somewhat helps you out.

On March 17, 2003 (St. Patrick’s Day), I was in my backyard in Henderson, NV., a suburb of Las Vegas.  I was doing some star gazing with my Celestron telescope.   Sometime after 8pm, I saw a horizontal row of lights hovering about the Las Vegas strip.  They were an amber color, almost iridescent.  I thought they were lights on one giant aircraft.  They were spread out like what appeared to be several city blocks.  Then they disappeared, all almost at the same time. I stood there for several minutes in awe, trying to comprehend what I just saw.  Eventually I went back to my telescope; however I kept looking around the sky with my eyes.  A few minutes later, I saw three lights again, this time in a triangle formation.  It was at this point that I figured each light must be its own craft.  I ran in the house and grabbed my video camera as fast as I could.  I proceeded to record what I saw. I had to keep turning my eyes away from the camera screen, as the camera did not do justice to what my eyes could see (although the video turned out pretty good).  The bottom light disappeared, and then two more lights flickered into view above the remaining two, and disappeared almost as fast as they appeared.  Then the one on the right, to my perspective, disappeared about 20 seconds later. Finally, after about 30 more seconds the last one disappeared.  A few minutes later, one appeared again, and remained stationary for a few minutes before disappearing.  Before it disappeared, a regular plane appeared to fly by the object. I don’t know if I should report the next incident as a second occurrence or not, but I saw another ""UFO"" 10 days later.  I happened to watch a show about UFOs where a man described seeing almost exactly what I saw, and said he saw them again 10 days later.  So, on a whim, I took my camera outside about the same time, 10 days later.  I was shocked to see another one, and I filmed it.  This second occurrence was strange. The light moved slowly higher and to the east.  Eventually, it turned from a large amber-like orb of light, to a small, strange, strobe-like light.  This was not like the strobe on an airplane though.  I have the whole incident on tape. After a few minutes, I saw two more strobe-like lights appear, near the same proximity.  It was almost as if the one was signaling the others, and they started to signal back. It was very strange to say the least. The strobes were very small, and eventually, I just couldn’t see them anymore.  The second incident lasted approximately 20 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to obtain more information.  The video does, indeed, show the lights, precisely as the witness describes above, although we do not know what they are.  Ordinarily, we would allow for the possibility that they might have been landing lights on several airliners on long final approach, but they would not be visible for 30 minutes.

The day was sunny, cool (about 60 degrees), and not a cloud in the bright blue sky.   When we arrived on scene, a local resident pointed to the sky approx 30 degrees up off the horizon, approx 5 miles away (estimations), there was a silver ball slowly moving across the skyline.   As we observed the object, the resident shouted ""No s(*%, a real UFO"".   We video taped the object for approx 15 to 20 minutes before disappearing over the horizon.   The most surprising observations were the inexplicable ability of this object to change shapes from circular to diamond, and back again.  It appeared to vibrate and blur its borders while conducting these shape changes.   The absolute strangest observation was my attempt to zoom in on the object where I observed symetrical smaller diamond shaped patterns in ""the hull"" (for lack of a better term) but the object immediately speed out of view in a looped, non-linear manner when I apparently was getting too much detail on the cam-corder.  Most unusual.  I still have the video tape.   This object is not anything conventional or seen before; not an airplane, no propeller, no ""nose"" or ""bill"" or ""tail"".   We did not shoot the object because we thought this was potentially some secret project with humans aboard.  The incident is documented and witnesses are available.   I have never been visited since; even though I wish I would be. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested additional reports from the Chief of Police, and from the other witnesses, as well.

The wings were shaped as an isosceles triangle, as are many military planes and some commercial, but the entire length of the wings had lights, don’t recall colors, rather than the relatively few lights of regular aircraft. It was flying relatively slow, and appeared large, but I took it to be a plane coming in for a landing, which would not be unusual for the location, which was about 15 miles from RDU airport. (We also have several military bases in NC, and National Guard base, but I’ve never seen any military aircraft other than helicopters and cargo planes.)  I saw this many times around rush hour over Raleigh/Cary area over a period of a couple to several months, usually when I was returning from walking my dog at a park, around rush hour.  Given the location and hour, thousands of other people had to have seen it.  Since I never saw any UFO reports just assumed it was a regular aircraft. Still, it struck me as unusual, and when my teenage daughter saw it, she too thought it extremely unusual. Since then, I’ve never seen anything like it around here or elsewhere, and also the unusualness of it has stuck with me. So today I started looking to see if I could find photos of aircraft with that kind of lighting configuration, but have found none.

I am submitting this now because I just came across this site.  The date is approximate as I remember the time of year because I had just finished building a deck on the rear of my home and that was in mid-September of 2004.  I am a high school debate teacher and had only started school a few weeks earlier, so that also reminds me of the approximate date.  But I cannot recall the exact date at this time. I woke up around 1:00 in the morning for no particular reason and could not fall back asleep.  After sitting in the living room for a bit, I decided to go out on my  deck to have a cigarette. It was a completely clear night.  I do not recall if there was a moon or not.  As I was smoking, I spent time just staring up at the stars.  I am not much for astronomy, but there was nothing else to really do and I was trying to get myself back into a mode for sleep. I first noticed something in the sky to the west of my home.  I was sitting in the back of the house which faces northeast.  I had been sitting outside for about 20 minutes at this point.  I did not identify what I saw as an ""object"" at first.  There was a triangular shape, but my first thought was that it was a flock of Canadian geese.  I continued to watch only because it was something to look at.  The shape continued to come slowly from the west heading roughly southwest at what seemed to be a rather slow pace. After what felt like less than 5 minutes of watching, the shape was pretty much directly over the back yard of my neighbor to the immediate west.  This is where I had my first impression that what I was looking at wasn't a flock of geese. First, as it was coming toward my yard, it seemed far too rigid lines to be geese.  The shape seemed fairly low to the ground too.  I estimate it was no higher than 1000 ft, but likely less.  As the shape moved over into my yard, I noticed that the stars didn't seem ""right"" between the two lines of the ""V"" shape.  By that I mean they seemed a bit fuzzier and dimmed. What really convinced me that I was not seeing geese was when I noticed a straight line connecting the two ends at the rear of the ""V"" shape, making it a triangle.  As I tried to ""come to grips"" with what my brain was saying I was seeing, I also noticed a strange distortion along the outer edges of the triangular object.  I would best describe it as being like the heat waves one sees coming off of hot pavement.  This distortion was visible on all three sides, but I am not sure I would have noticed it if the sky hadn't been so clear otherwise. There were no noticable lights coming from the object and absolutely no sound.  Any other time I have seen geese flying in a ""V"" formation, I recall usually eventually hearing a goose call or two as they fly overhead.  Here, it was total silence. The object continued to move in a straight line to to the southwest.  As the object moved past my yard I could no longer see the outer edge distortion, however there were still three distinct sides to the object.  After about a total of 10 minutes or so of viewing the object was out of sight again. (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Suddenly the balloon shifted into a horizontal shape and I could see what appeared to be heat waves like you see when you look down a road on a hot day. This balloon morphed back and forth from vertical balloon shape to horizontal oblong shape a few times as it moved lower in the sky and began to pass over my apartment.  I ran through my apartment to the front door.  When I emerged from the apartment the balloon was just above my apartment. It passed over me at that height and then a slit opened and a red light flashed and the slit closed.  It continued along over the next hill and morphed a few more times.

I believe there was some form of Christmas Celebration being held and I attend.   Well I remember that I was walking home on a particular street where I could straight down into the town, as that was direction in which I was heading.  I remember seeing the very huge thing (well this is only word I can use to describe it) with a lot of what seem to be Christmas lights covering it, I was stunned at sighting this object.   First I thought it was a ship.......... but then I realized that it couldn't be because it was in the sky and the Sea was way too far away for to it be reflecting clearly.  It moved real slow and I was beginning to get even scared, as I could not figured out what it is,  I looked behind me to see if anyone else was on the street and witnessing what I'm seeing but there was no one.  I then kept looking at it....... I know this may sound silly but at one point I though it was Santa Clause as it was the Christmas season and the object was covered with colourful lights.  One thing I can tell you for sure is that whatever it was it was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my entire life.  As I walked closer to the town area I notice that it was disappearing and it was then time I realized that It really could not be any normal transportation.  I even started walking very fast amazed at what I've seen, with a bit of smile and fear on my face.   When I reached home I told my family, but we just ignored it cause it is not sometime we believe in, especially in Jamaica.  However deep inside I always knew I witness something abnormal.   The reason I decided to share this is because I was just idling online and I found myself after four (4) years of this event reading up on Aliens and UFO's.  Then I came across this case where the man who saw the UFO and even touch it was badly burned.  Well what stroked me was when he described the colourful lights in the space ship, just like or similar to what I saw.  I'm just here ! wondering how can they be so high tech as UFO sightings go way back to the 1940’s or 1960’s I believe, and if they are really visiting what do they want.......... do they live in those big ships and stuff like that.........

I went out to the back yard to have a smoke. The sky was clear and it was fairly cool at ~60deg. F. I was looking in the sky for the usual planes landing at FLO Airport. I noticed that where a church had been pointing search lights up in the sky the week before, there was a totally black triangle shape with its base toward me. It was so black the ambient light in the sky made its shape out very crisply. It was SWW of Florence (to my reckoning it was about on a line from Florence to Shaw AFB that some military craft use occasionally). I figured it to be at least 2-3miles away and about 2000ft up. It did not move, nor did I see any light emitting from it. I would estimate its size to be in the 100ft wide range and twice as long, as well as about 20ft thick. This estimate is based on the lack of atmospheric scintillation. It could have been farther or even closer. It did not reflect any light that I could discern and that made it so black it stood out in the sky like a black nothing. As I put my thumb up to measure it, which was about 1/4 the width of my thumb at arms length, it seemed to just wipe itself away, from tip toward the base in about 1/2 a second. That was the first time I could say I saw a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2009-01-10T00:00:00,34.17419081632653,-79.73023826530613

The light was roughly 8 miles away, maybe closer. It drew my attention due to its intensity which remained constant for the time I observed it. The weather was clear, unlimited visibility, a blue sky, no clouds, about 50 Degrees F, a light wind at about 2 mph. I was at about 6,700ft elevation. At least 10 other people in that area saw it. The trail was busy that day and everybody I passed talked about the light. I would estimate the light was probably 100ft in diameter and appeared round in shape. To the eye it was blindingly bright, like an arc welder with a white color that appeared to have a blue tinge at the edges. When I reached the trail head a forest service worker asked if I saw the light. A ranger passed by in a truck. T! he forest service worker asked the ranger who summers at Harts Pass if he knew what it was and he did not. It was nothing they had seen before. I did not see the light in the air or see the light switch on or off. I took some images of the light with a Nikon D90 DSLR using a Nikon 18-200mm VR DX lens set at f/8.0 and 200mm. I was on a steep hillside with a heavy pack, very tired, shaky and did not stop to use a tripod or optimize the camera settings so the images are not as sharp as they could be. To the eye the light was blindingly bright; it appeared to overload the camera sensor when it was imaged. The effect was similar to taking a picture of the sun without a filter, but confined to a small well defined area without lens flare or burst pattern. At least 10 people talked to me about the light and it is likely that more than 10 people saw it because there were many people hiking in that area that day and at that time. The Pacific Crest Trail stays on top of ridges in tha! t area at 6500ft or higher. I would estimate I observed the li! ght over the period of about 30 minutes. I took the images and stopped observing the light, and then it was gone when I looked up again.  The peak the light was on is above Ross Lake and there are no roads or anything else in that area.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

It was a black orb that  was tumbling through the air at a high rate of speed. I was standing in my street playing football with my two sons, 13 and 10.  My 13 year old and I were standing next to each other talking and it was abnormally quiet outside.  As a matter of fact, it was so quiet, I could hear the high school band playing at the Friday night game which is over a mile away.  I need to preface this email and state that I am a professional at trade and without giving up my occupation, let's just say my credibility is very high.  Anyway, I was standing next to my older son and I happen to look up and coming from the east was an object.  What I couldn't understand is why this object was moving so fast.  As it drew closer, the process of elimination in my mind quickly narrowed it down to a UFO.  By no means am I a believer in the whole alien conspiracy thing but I have NEVER seen anything like this before.  I quickly yelled at my son and told him to look.  My son quickly looked up and said, ""dad, what its that.""  At this point, I w! ent into defense mode because I could not explain away what I was seeing.  This object was sort of like an orb.  Based on the altitude, I was say it was about 8-10 thousand feet up.  It was black however it TUMBLED through the air.  I could see this thing rolling and the sun was going down and at one point, the object reflected light and it illuminated the object better.  I have NEVER seen anythings like this before.  What was even more strange was the object was not emitting ANY sound.  It was dead silent and at that point, you could hear anything.  We live within 15 miles of PDX airport in Portland, Oregon and I know the flight paths of airplanes that come and go.  This thing was moving at a VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED and in a flat east to west direction.  I have never believed in UFO's in the past but I will now argue with any skeptic till I'm blue in the face.  We were able to watch the object as it maintained the same altitude and speed until it many miles away.  My son a! nd I are changed people.  We have not stopped talking about it! .  The o bject is scared in my mind and again the strangest thing besides its speed, and shape, was the fact it did not emit any sound whatsoever.

I know it was a craft only because of the way it left.  At first it was still - straight above me - and VERY clear the entire time. The size had to have been longer than a football field (I know this because I could judge its length as it was really very close.  Now let me say -  it was beautiful - the colors did not seem of this earth - it was long rectangular with a very bright diamond white light in the very center - I'm only going to say ""cigar shaped"" because it was proportionate to a cigar in width and length, but its end corners were most unique - They were more perfect than a computer could draw out (how is that possible).  The material seemed to be like a silicon - it was not a metal - it was blue but darker than the sky and I say silicon material because of what the edges looked like, especially the corners - how the blue color defined itself.  It was not only too perfect of a shape for this world but the white shining light was like a diamond in its radiance, but not in its color - it was a solid white light, but not a light or sun white -like we see in any of our earth lights - not even our stars are this color white.  Also, it was not blinding, but had a magnificent radiance. I was sitting alone, but knew there was a couple about 10 yards to my side.  After about a full minute or more of me staring straight up - amazed and testing my eyes and sanity (am I awake?, here?, etc)- the craft started to move perfectly forward very slowly - as if it was a submarine (one of its ends leading).  It moved in a straight line in north-east direction.  At this time, I knew it was possibly leaving and so I moved slowly to the couple sitting close to me.  I continued to keep my eyes on the craft while I moved - nearly stumbled on the couple close by and pointed up - just saying ""Look"".  One of the people (female) looked up and said ""Oh wow!""  At just that moment the craft started moving faster (and I mean faster) it shot north, but (bing, bing) with two angles.  Our crafts can't do that right?  long shape disappeared very soon after it shot north - The light remained very very very bright for a longh time (at least a thirty seconds or more) - until it finally got smaller and smaller and disappeared. Only one person who I went to - to look up -actually saw the long body of the craft, the other person looked up too late and only saw the white light as it bing binged away into the northern sky.  The person who saw the craft with me acted very calm - thought it was amazing, but said she had many amazing experience of the sort. She started saying,  ""Have you seen...I've seen...."".  I had never seen anything that was so clear, and so not of this world. I went inside and drew it immediately.  Even if I had not drawn exactly what I saw - my memory is crystal clear.  And the other witness, I am only happy for her that never in my mind will I ever question if it was an illusion of some sort.  It was very material, and very visible.  It never made one sound and it did not leave a trail. I am writing you to ask you if you have any photographs or video of what I saw.  I can not find anything on internet - except distant videos and photos of long rod shaped craft things - but with no light in the middle and they don't look as large as what I saw.

As he came to a near complete stop, I stopped as well and it caught me eye. It was a craft flying quite low. (Around 1,000 ft) It had two orange lights, one near the top and one near the bottom. It was not quite a teardrop shape. The best I can describe it, (without drawing a picture) is the top of the craft was rounded and it got wider towards the bottom where it appeared to have a more boxed form. One light was at the top and the other was at the bottom. I realized thats what the motorist before me was looking at. The object moved side to side slowely and then began to pick up great speed as it flew to the West. It then streaked off into the distance moving up and Westward.

I saw this low above the intersection of Jefferson and Essington Street from my part of town a block south , and thought at the time it was a new water tower. Due to the park I only saw the top third of the metal sphere and since they were building one to the south west of my home in Joliet I just thought they were buiding another one. Sphere from my distance away was about 50 feet in diameter. I had to pick up a friend who was blind and take him to his doctor on Essington Road and thought I would see the new water tower. I of course did not see it, and had filed it away, until the program that summer. May 17th is Norwegian Independence day and my brothers birthday, and being third generation Norwegian I could not forget the day. Listening to your show tonight on the Jeff Rense show I decided I would look up the report from Bolingbrook which is 10 miles north of Joliet as the ufo flys, and it was that report in the summer of 2001 that woke me up to my missing water tower that day. When I was four I saw my first Alien, he was a skinny ET the one in the movie that had to phone home, standing in my play room. A few months latter I saw my second, which in 1952 was not the same. The cover of Whitley Shriver's Communion was the first time I saw that grey big eye's who was looking in the window when I was looking out at a storm. The third one was in 1996 in the winter when I woke up looking at this little dwarf like being, and before I blacked out I thought to myself, ""I know you!""  I had many experiences as a child, waking up with nose bleeds and screaming, that my mother remembers more of. I just thought I would mention this and add it to your collection. I finally decided in the summer of 2001 that UFO's were real, and I have come to grips with growing up on a farm in the cornlands of Illinois. You do a good job, and I thought at the time it was a few hours latter the Bolingbrook fellow had seen what I saw, either that morning or a few hours after I saw it. Where it was you could only see the top as it was only about 50 feet over a busy intersection in broad daylight but in the trees of the park just off the road. Thats all I can say about that one, however I have a friend who had an experience in my home in late 1996 early 1997, and that is another story. Keep up the good work.

I woke up at about 2:30 am and It was like being between sleepy and awake.  I saw just next to my bed a long figure looking at me.  I’ll describe it for you:  Very thin, as skinny as a skeleton.  More than 7 feet height.  His body was like transparent gelatin.  His two eyes black and very big.  His head was as big as our heads but small from his neck and wide on top.  He had four long fingers, 4.5 inches each one.  His hands looked like two spiders.  He had like a purple fluorescent radiance. I didn’t feel fear. I was very interesting on him.  I raised my arm to touch him and he did the same. I could touch his hand with my finger, and I don’t remember anything else. At 2007, living in California I had a dream.  I was walking and I felt something in my vagina.  Something was leaving from there without pain.  Then, I saw something falling down between my legs; it was two long jelly eggs.   After that, I didn’t remember anything else but next day I could remember the eggs material were the same like the figure I saw seven years before.

In fact, it appeared so mundane that I simply thought, “It’s odd that they would use helicopters to repair the telephone lines or whatever they’re doing up there.”  Then, realizing how unlikely that was, I stopped the car, and my wife, my daughter and I all saw the same thing: a craft that resembled a helicopter against the night sky.  We were close to this thing!  It was literally right over our heads.  And it made no wind and no sound!  It just bobbed up there.

This is an addendum to the report already filed for the same date, time, and location.  I rewrote paragraph 2 only, so you can replace the second paragraph with this one.  The rest is the same.  Thanks.  The date is approximate but definitely during the week of November 6. I remember the time exactly because I was sitting in my car drinking coffee, parked just outside the flightline at Davis-Monthan AFB waiting for my shift to start. I was participating in an exercise and normally wasn't there that early. It was still fairly dark outside but daylight was just starting to break.  As I was looking forward through the windshield, I first saw the lights out of the corner of my eye out the driver side window.  Even before I turned to look at them, I could instantly tell these were odd lights in the sky.  As I watched the lights go by, I froze, didn't want to blink or even breath, and I had this real ominous feeling like I was in the presence of something otherworldly. The lights flew either right above the runway or were slightly outside the perimeter of the base, but they were going in the same direction as the runway. These lights were so bright, they lit up the clouds.  I had been in the Air Force for over 11 years at that point, worked the flightline day and night, seen all kinds of aircraft come and go and I NEVER saw lights on a conventional aircraft that were big enough or bright enough to do this, especially since the lights were just as bright coming from the south as they were when they flew out of range to the northwest.  It really frustrated me that there was a straight narrow path of clouds going from the south to the northwest while most of the rest of the sky was clear.  These clouds were slightly puffy and relatively low in the sky.  I would best describe them as stratocumulus, and guess their altitude between 6,000 to 10,000 feet.  I was hoping the lights would make a turn so I could get a better look at them but they stayed behind this narrow path of clouds the entire way and I was never able to see an object.  Also, I should mention that as bright and fast as these lights were, surprisingly I saw no contrails at all.  After the lights went by, I looked around the parking lot to see if anyon! e else s aw it, but no one was around. That in itself was odd. There should have been several people in the parking lot by that time. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was around 9PM (not sure of the exact time), the weather was cool and clear. It hovered about 40 feet in the air, as I walked closer to it, it moved away in a slightly arched line and disappeared behind the trees . I stared directly at it for at least 20 seconds; I could not make out any solid shapes or apparent structure. It appeared, to me, to be a hovering ball of light. The silence was strange, even as it moved up and away, it made no noise whatsoever. It also traveled very quickly, covering 200+ yards and gaining enough altitude to easily clear the tree line in a matter of 2 or 3 seconds.

To begin with, I am a skeptic to ufos being extraterestrials, but still am interested in understanding this phenomenom, whatever it is. I have read about the ""hollow earth"" hypothesis, which I took as being as ridiculous as the flat earth belief, eventhough it was believed by Columbus and Halley . I have read about both South and North Poles expeditions, some claiming such areas being entrances within the earth's inner world; about Admiral Byrd's secret diary. I enjoyed reading such stories as science fiction and nothing else. One day I while I was searching for world maps on the internet, I stumbled upon Google Earth. I downloaded the free version and was extremely impressed with the satelite shots. After zooming on Paris,France, I actually could see cars on the streets. One boring night,I started using Google earth to zoom focus some sites associated with fictional, mythical settings such as the Pyramids, and the sea bed floor within the area some claim Antlantis might be located...looking for some abnormalities or maybe signs of human hands.I believe I saw some interesting landmaks however, the imagination was maybe leading me to see things that aren't dimentionally correct...just in order to, well believe in the mythical side of Life. I was starting to feel like a child again, one who still believes in such things as Santa Claus. The Alan Parson's song popped into my head....""I am the eye in the sky, .........I am the maker of rules....... This made me think of the conspiracy theories....Freemasonry and the likes of the Illuminaties. The eye in the sky....satellites? within a triangle... meaning perhaps the process of triangulation?? Har har, however the symbol was much too old to even support the thought.One thing struck me though. The pyramid's view seemed to come directly from above, as if the satelite was directly above it,unlike the buildings I saw in other places such Paris. Google earth, I then thought, could actually mean ""go ogle earth""...ogle being the term I heard used many times for the eye within the triangle....I was starting to enjoy myself in all of this. I said, let's take a look at the supposed hole in North Pole. And there it was....very impressive indeed. Although, true, this phenomenom certainly must be associated with the earth's magnetic field,however, the thought was proposed very long ago. Columbus thought the ocean water entered into the North Pole in order to exit the south...it does matches somewhat the Oceans currents. The image certainly seemed as if the ocean was indeed whirling in the earth itself. Next, the South Pole. The sight was even more impressive. Inside the continent Antartica, there is an image of what seems to be a sphere, having colour close to something like another smaller earth. Again, this phenomenom is associated with the magnetic field since the same blurry image exist like that of the North Pole. Now, what about the night sky? Nasa sent some signals (beatle's song Accross the Universe) to Polaris. I switched to the night sky setting and looked in the region of Polaris. Here is something I don't quite understand...the same phenomenom seen in the North Pole and South Pole exists....but why? The earth's magnetic field should not affect view of Polaris. I then turn to Octantis, the South Pole Star....same phenomenom again. Turning back to Polaris, I zoomed all the much I can, and that particular blurry spherical region came into view as something quite different than that from a constellation of stars.... The stars seemed more like lights; the edge of the sphere when highly magnefied, looked very much like a metallic perimeter. This is the reason why I sent this e-mail.... to have another perspective, and maybe some answers. I would like it if someone else would take a look and get back to me.

Normally I have about an hour to catch a nap before actually working, I usually pull off to the side of the road a couple of miles from the work site as its in a secured area and the gates are close and locked.  This particular morning I just arrived at my normal dozing spot and saw what resembled a satellite, though somewhat lower appearing. It was moving slow like a satellite does so I watched it for about a minute when a much brighter light appeared over the tree line (easiest way to describe it was imagine the North star the brightest you’ve seen it) it and the ‘satellite’ moved towards one another and they both stopped, right next to each other for about 30 seconds. Then the satellite went back from the way it came!  I was already thinking to myself wow this is interesting. At this point for the sheer hell of it I flashed my lights 3 times. The UFO started directly towards me! It got to what I guess to be about 2 hundred yards (maybe closer) and stopped. I had my windows down and there was absolutely no noise whatsoever. It sat there for about 15 seconds so I flashed it again. Then it was like it leaped up very fast but only a short distance and continued away from me over the wood line in the direction the ‘satellite’ had gone, at a slow speed compared to what I saw when it leaped straight up..  I could not make out any shape of any type of craft that might have been there, but the light honestly resembled a bright star.  I got the impression that what I was looking at couldn’t be any bigger than my Ford Ranger pick-up.  The color of the light was a bright white. It was really bright but seemed to be almost contained somehow. I don’t know, hard to describe.  Anyway, that is what I saw. I went back the next morning hoping to see something else.

They were as bright as Venus, and equal to each other in magnitude.  I knew the stars were out of place, and thought I was witnessing some strange double supernova.  The sky was crystal clear without a hint of clouds. I was thinking about looking them up and finding out what was going on when, as I was looking at them, they both faded simultaneously to the point of invisibility in about 4 seconds.

I could not make sense of what I was seeing, and still can't. The stars were stationary the whole time. At first I thought I might be looking at a couple of geosynchronous satellites that were rotating through a position of reflecting to non-reflecting, but the position was too far north of the Celestial Equator. I don't think we can place geosynchronous satellites in orbits that far off of the Celestial Equator. I don't know what I saw, but I definitely saw it.

The after image itself resembled a prismatic tear in open space, stretching about 45 feet in length, and about 30 feet off the ground. The image got smaller every second it lasted until it vanished all together. There were no sparks, smoke, thunder, flames, heat, sound, electric equipment around, no power lines, no way to explain it away and it left no traces that I could see. It was not particularly scary, but it was definitely intense. As soon as we could gather our wits we left. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

Eventually, a majority of my family had made it to the top of the boat and were conversing while a still gazed at the sky.  Although many individuals in my family had been drinking that night, I had not been.  A fireworks show had just ended and as I continued looking at the stars, I saw what I assume was a satellite moving across the night sky.  At the instant I let a breath out to tell my family to look at the satellite a grey object slowly flew over my field of vision which was much closer.  It was directly over the boat and was moving south.  The object was triangular in shape (more like an elongated crescent) and was completely silent.  At this time, all the members who were on the boat were looking at the object, as my Aunt stated she thinks it's a bird.  When the back of the object became visible, a single, centered, small, orange light could be seen and observed for only ten more seconds before the object swiftly ascended out of vision.

It seemed to be generally over Seattle, directly to the east of the Bangor submarine base on the Kitsap Peninsula.  It hovered in roughly the same location for over an hour, however it drifted slightly to the east over the timeframe we observed it. From our viewing location, the object was small and difficult to observe with the naked eye so we used a pair of 10X25 Binoculars for improved detail.  The colors alternated fairly quickly between red, green, purple, aqua blue, violet, dark blue, orange, yellow, and white and appeared like electrical arcs surrounding a sphere.

I had to look after my Uncles house in a village just outside of the town I live in. Me and my brothers were in my Uncles paddock when we had our first sighting. One evening we saw 2 white round objects moving across the sky. The sky was clear with no clouds and there was no wind. One object was bigger than the other. The objects were white like a bolt of lightning, that kind of light. These objects were silent and we watched them move across the sky until we couldn't see them anymore. When we first saw them the small object was behind the bigger object but it was moving a bit faster so it over took the big object. The objects moved at a steady speed, not fast or slow but fast enough to travel across the sky in a few minutes. The big object was about the size of a full moon and the smaller one about 1/5th of that size. The objects were quite far away, at least thousands of feet and didn't appear very high in the sky. We didn't know what these objects were. After this sighting we borrowed my dads camera just incase we saw anything else while we were looking after my uncles house. On the last night at my uncles we were outside, it was a clear night with no wind and my brothers were messing about taking pictures and getting the typical Orbs in them which are mostly caused by moisture and dust, later that night there was an intense fog and we think the moisture in the air caused the Orbs in the photos we got. After being outside for a while we saw something coming towards us flashing a bright white light. The object was round, silent and moving slowly and we didn't know what it was so we got a picture of it as it was overhead. As we got the picture of it we noticed another one coming which was identical to the first. As this second object was overhead we noticed a smaller white object travelling with it that wasn't flashing and we took a picture. The way the bigger objects would flash was that the entire object would flash a white light, the light would decrease and go out, then the light would increase and flash and keep doing this in a regular period of time. It was only after we saw these objects that we realized how strange they were. We had never seen anything like them, couldn't think of anything they could be either. They were low in the sky and moved in a straight line. Its likely that these objects were the same we saw the previous night but this time the bigger objects were flashing and there was 1 more of them. Then on the last day I was at my uncles house my brothers had gone home and I was waiting for my uncle to come back. I was outside smoking a cigarette, I had the camera with me because of the sighting the night before. I happened to look up and saw something moving towards the house. The object was silent, moving quite fast, wasn't flashing and looked quite dim. I didn't know what this object was so I took a picture which came out bad as I was holding the cigarette. I took another picture and the object was in focus. The object moved over my uncles house out of sight. I have no idea what this object was, it was different to the other objects we had seen and I wouldn't have noticed it if I didn't look up by chance as the object was silent and wasn't very bright. I have been in touch with Timothy Good and he didn't know what the objects are and recommended I get in touch with Nick Pope. I got in touch with Nick who also didn't know what the objects were and said that he wasn't in a position where he could find this out but that I should send the pictures and my UFO sighting report to the Ministry of Defence. I got a letter from the MOD saying they don't investigate all UFO reports, they only see if there was any evidence of a threat, they remain open minded about UFOs and that they would file away my report and pictures. I have sent the pictures to Ball lightning experts from this list  http://ae.nsstc.uah.edu/AE/addresses.html  The people who responded to me said the objects aren't Ball lightning because there were no storms that night and the sighting lasted too long. I have put the pictures onto a few UFO forums hoping someone has seen the same objects and would be able to identify them but so far no one has been able to.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

As we drove down the winding hills to our home, our eyes were glued to the sky.  I don't know how I drove.  When we arrived at our long driveway, the object separated into two glowing objects which were changing their shapes slightly, but were definitely separating.  They then rejoined and shot down in a straight line toward the earth, resembling an elevator; a glowing elevator. We were stopped in our driveway at this point.  As we drove closer to the garage, the object seemed to shoot off a small saucer-shaped, also orange neon and glowing in the same fashion, object which moved very rapidly toward Doylestown Airport which was behind our backyard, lined with trees.  At the same time, the large ship shot off into the distance and was absolutely gone in a second, it seemed. At this point, my daughter and I were in shock; I told her to get my husband because I knew he would never believe it.  I remained outside alone for several seconds, and the small glowing ship was now hovering behind the trees, practically close enough to the ground to say it could have even landed.  I felt that it was watching me. When my daughter and husband came outside, my husband saw it and didn't know what to make of it, but told us to get in the house immediately. We had a movie camera with my daughter's school project on it, and we began filming this orange light from our kitchen window.  The orange light and its movement was captured on film, also as it darted away into the distance very rapidly.  Although my husband did not see what we like to refer to as the ""mother ship,"" he did, at least, see the smaller ""saucer,"" which, however, was nothing compared to the large object.  My daugh! ter and I knew from that day forward that this was of another world.  I tried calling the police department, the airports, news stations, etc., the following morning, but there were no reports.  We were left feeling that this was a very personal experience.  From other reports that I read, it doesn't seem as if anyone has ever seen this type of UFO. The most similar report that I can associate it with is that which the airforce men saw way back while flying; I believe that was a huge orange neon long ship as well.  There is even more to tell, but I need to know if you would like to hear the rest? Even more intriguing.  If I were alone that night, I would have admitted myself to Bellevue.  Thank goodness my daughter and I shared this magicial moment, an experience and bond we will share forever.  By the way, it was not a frightening experience.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,40.32416086956521,-75.12223043478261

The motion was relative to the other stars, not the vessel. It then moved to the left, eventually obscured by a cloud. Now I’m not a pilot, engineer, or doctor, but it’s my best guess that ""star"" had to be rather far away to be behind a cloud and only a gleam with no form. If it were that far away, and moving at the rate my eyes saw, I have doubts as to whether life support systems for pilots of which I am aware could sustain a body in those maneuvers.

On August 12, 2008 approximately 8PM in Chandler, AZ  I walked out front to smoke a cigarette when I noticed 2 bright lights on the West horizon in a vertical line just hovering. I chalked it up at first just to be 2 planes coming this way in some sort of flight pattern creating an optical illusion. However, my husband walked out to smoke a cigarette and said ""Come here and look at this"". Just over the tree lines where I had seen the 2, were now 4 bright lights all in a vertical formation. I tried to logically evaluate what I was seeing but logic soon flew out the window.  As we watched these very bright lights, which were much larger than what you see on jets, the top one in formation dimmed the bright light and red and blue lights began flashing on it as it began to pull away from the vertical line moving in a Northeast direction. The craft that was moving was very low to the ground, lower than I see any jets in this area fly and the sound was different than jets. It made a noise but there was no ""rumble"" if that makes sense like a jet makes, it was rather quiet no more noisy than perhaps a car makes. The lights undernderneath and behind it were unfamiliar to us as well. As we kept watching, we then realized that this was a pattern that kept taking place. As the top one would begin to pull away from formation, another would ""appear"" to come up from beneath and get in this vertical line. We watched this trying to reason what was going on but it just wasn't making sense to us. If it had been planes in a flight pattern, logic would reason that the lights would be of different size and radiance if they were lined up behind each other. These lights looked like huge bright balls of light. My husband and I when we first saw them giggled and said ""Oh no, someone else is playing a hoax with flares and balloons"", however, as the top one moved away, we clearly saw the craft and it's flight pattern. Whatever they were, whoever they were, they were definitely craft. I lost count after watching 6 of these follow this pattern. ""That's 6"" I said to my husband, and then just quit counting at that point.  I began getting very nervous as we kept watching this take place as it appeared they began lining up in a perimeter around an area. I could see them on the horizon from the back yard, clearly to the north, clearly to the east and cleary to the west, the trees were blocking my southern view. However, as they followed this flight pattern, they appeared to be randomly stopping out on the horizon, not moving at all. Just hovering. Some we could follow moving following a rather large circle pattern on the perimeter. The red and blue lights flashing on them looked different than jets and some seemed to only have a steady red glow.This has to be one of the most bizarre things I've seen.  Within a few minutes of watching this, 3 helicopters appeared in the area and there was 1 helicopter that actually kept a distance from the line of lights, but was flying what appeared to be from an ""observing distance"".  This went on for approximately an hour with these things all over the sky. I kept thinking, someone else surely has to see this. We came in to turn on the news around 9Pm thinking that what might be happening would definitely make the news, we watched all the way through the 10PM news, but no mention. I began checking here last night to see if anyone else had reported anything, but soon realized this isn't kept in real time, so thought I'd check back this morning and there'd be a plethora of reports, so far nothing. This truly rattled me last night, I had knots in my stomach because what we were seeing was so bizarre. This went on for over an hour. There was not a single jet in the sky during this, just the balls of light and crafts and a few helicopters.  If anyone else has seen this, or has an explanation as to what was going on, please post it here.My husband and I walk out front and sit on our porch nearly every evening and have never witnessed anything like this in the past. We'll definitely be watching again this evening.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,33.29885793871866,-111.86506392757661

I am a hospice RN and at the time of my sighting I was an on-call home visit RN, coming home from making a home visit on the east side of Cleveland, OH.  It was in February, 2007 at approximately 2-2:30 a.m. There was snow on the ground and I remember bright conditions, like moonlight reflecting off the snow making the night seem lighter than normal for that time of night.  I was driving south on I-77, just north of the Pleasant Valley Road exit.  My car window was cracked open because I am a smoker and I was flicking ashes out the window.  I had the car radio on, but it was not turned up loud and there was no music on---my habit at that time of night was to listen to talk radio. There were not many cars on the highway with me and I do not remember any cars near me traveling in my direction close to me.  I was focused up ahead as I was nearing the exit.  There were fairly dense trees to my right off the road.  I sensed movement overhead and looked up through my front windshield and just slightly to my right. I saw a huge dark triangular shape with red non-blinking lights gliding silently over the treetops, traveling north but almost as if it were following I-77 northbound (but next to the southbound lanes).  It was not directly overhead, but no more than maybe 20-30 feet to my right.  I could clearly see the outline of the craft and remember thinking it was not an airplane.  I also made note of the fact that the lights were solid and not blinking.  I put my window all the way down and could not hear anything---it was completely silent.  I estimate the craft to be about 100 yards across at the widest part.  It was clearly outlined against the moonlit sky.  It did not look metallic from my angle; I had the sense that it was black. I turned my attention to the road ahead and drove as quickly as I could to the curving exit ramp.  As I came around the curve of the ramp, I was going to end up facing north.  I looked in the direction I had seen the craft and (as large as it was) I expected to see the back end of it.  I could not locate the craft again and assumed the tree tops were in my way. I looked in the paper and online after my sighting, hoping to see reports of other sightings, but I found nothing.  For a long time I just felt satisfied that I knew what I saw and it was nothing I had ever seen.  After almost 2 years, I’ve decided I want to report my sighting to SOMEONE just so my sighting is documented somewhere.  I’m not saying it was extraterrestrial, but it definitely was a UFO because I could not identify it, it was definitely flying, and it was an object.  Could it have been a stealth bomber?  My instincts tell me that a stealth bomber is not 100 yards wide, but I have no idea. (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Manilva-Gaucin, km 13.5 229690 Casares, Málaga Spanien  The accompanying photo has all the camera meta information intact.  I have looked closely to see if it was somehow attached to a pole or wire from the restaurant below but it seems unlikely.  I did not notice this when taking the picture. It is quite by accident.

Witness 1 saw the craft reappear in the eastern sky, about 45 degrees or close to the horizon,  while stargazing and two two of the witnesses saw what it looked like. The third witness was on his cell phone and missed this. The craft was then golden metallic and triangular in shape. Kept moving normally, moving in a straight line, then disappeared again ! during pass two. The craft disappeared in the center of the sky during its second pass by the witnesses. Shortly after this they observed something twinkle over the El Paso Mountains. Then the object disappeared again. Shortly after this the witness heard a high pitched whistling type hum after the craft left the area in a south to southeast direction. The craft was seen flying over the local mountains when leaving the area.  Witness 1 reports a strong need to get out of there. Felt scared by the sighting. All the witnesses got in their car and left the area around 9:15 p.m. local time, because of Witness 1's strong desire to leave.  Witness 2  Time:  8:30 p.m. approximate Duration:  Approximately 30 minutes. Date:  Sept. 12, 2009 Location:  South of xxxx, near the El Paso Mountains, behind community college Weather:  Clear sky, no wind Witness:  Does not wear glasses Size:  About the size of a small airplane (prop job) before breaking into three vertical pieces.  Observation:  Craft:  Triangular. Flashing lights in a pattern. All white lights. The pattern observed was:  Center light was off while the side lights were on. Right side back light on. The center light was off. Left side back light on. The center light was off. Cycled through in a regular pattern while crossing the sky. The craft flew close to the horizon during most of the sighting(s).  Lights:  Cycling lights were seen through the whole observation. Craft color:  Craft structure looked metallic but color was not discernible. The craft was dark in color (couldn't describe color) with white lights that  were solid. The actual lights did not strobe but they exhibited a pattern of cycling light formations. The craft color did become ""orangish"" with white lights when it broke into three vertical 90 degree triangles. Windows: None Aliens/Humanoids sighted: None Sound:  Mixed howl or a ""like wind blowing through a mine"" and the sound kept moving with the craft.  Experience details:  Arrived at the trail head of the college, past the BLM sign giving the trail name, and parked in a dirt area. College was directly to the north of the witnesses.  Got out of the car and Witness 2 looked to the east and saw three lights. The two lights disappeared which caught the witnesse's interest. The lights were observed on the horizon. The lights stuck close to the horizon throughout the flight. Two of the witnesses were talking while Witness 2 observed the object fly east when the object was seen again. The craft turned south and moved in a southeasterly direction skirting the horizon. It was low to the mountain tops.  When the object was directly south of the three witnesses, Witness 2 saw the object lights ""jump back"" before continuing in a southeasterly direction towards Trona.  The object flew east before disappearing behind an easterly mountain range. Before disappearing over the eastern mountain range the object broke vertically into three triangular shaped objects which flew separately in formation. When the object broke apart the witness reported the craft became the color orange of a street light while the lights became white.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,35.5542828125,-117.6764125

I couldn't tell for sure how far away it was from me but it seemed just farther than my house and above the small town nearest to where i live about a mile south from me.  I saw it and thought, ""Wow!  That is a huge shooting star!"" but I realized within a second that it was stationary and many different bright colored lights all together in a ball. It was getting close to around 7 p.m. and in August it is still fairly light that time of day in the summer, but it was growing dusky.  So, this bright ball of light was very pronounced in the sky as it was incredibly bright compared to the rest of the sky.  I would say it was like a bunch of colored lights all melded together and rapidly changing because there is no other way to describe it.  I immediately grew very nervous becuase it was so large.  It was about the size of a baseball to me from around 2 miles away.  I had a friend in the car with me and she saw it as well.  We both stared at the object until all of a sudden it rapidly fell or flew or by some means moved very quickly downward to the right and then vanished.

At around 9:45 p.m. on a clear starry night me and a friend were waiting outside my house for his older brother to pick him up.  He was messing around on his skateboard while I was sitting on the curb.  After he messed up a trick he was working on he looks up to the sky and says, ""Is that what I think it is?!""  I look up to see three white lights in the shape of a right triangle flying directly over my head moving from west to east, rotating slowly clockwise.  It was travelling at a speed faster than a helicopter but slower than an airplane.  It made absoutely no noise and blocked the stars behind it.  It is hard to judge size and altitude of the craft but I would guess around 15-25 feet from point to point. After it got to a point in the sky it stopped moving, but kept rotating in place slowly drifting around.  We watched it for a good 15 minutes when my friend's brother showed up in his car.  I ran to him and told him to turn off the car and look at this.  After a minute of trying to point it out (it was rather hard to see at this point on account of how bright the stars were and how far away it was) we realized that me and my friend were actually watching two different crafts that everyone could see, both hovering and rotating. 10 minutes after the 3 of us watched the crafts, one just randomly vanishes, while the other's lights turned to a red/brown color (maroon?) and took off extremely fast heading north. But that wasn't the end of it! 	Freaked out, we kept staring at the sky for another 30 minutes or so before we spotted 4 white lights in the shape of a trapezoid once again going from east to west, the lights slowly moving in and out of the shape of the craft.  This one didn't stop to hover at all it just kept moving until it was out of sight. Shortly after my next door neighbor pulls up seeing us staring at the sky and starts asking questions.  It didn't take long for him to start talking about his various UFO experiences and then again we saw more lights like the trapezoid, except this time it was two groups of two lights acting the same way the first one did, moving closer then further together. Well we stuck around for awhile long staring at the sky talking about the occurance trying to rule out any explanations.  It was spring time and geese will  fly in formations similar to what we saw the last three crafts.  Shortly after that came up we actually saw geese flying not east to west, but south to north.  They were slower, loud, and not pulsing in and out like we saw before. Three years later, around the same time in the year, I was working at a restaurant in the same town.  It was about 11 or so at night and I out back taking a smoke break when I actually saw two more pairs of two lights pulsing in and out, heading east to west just as I saw on the night that I had just described. I would also like to note that about 100 miles west of where this all happened is a military base.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,46.90163103448276,-98.73783448275861

I was seated over the wing on the starboard side of a Boeing 767.  The captain had just come on the radio to say that we were flying over Nevada and knowing that we were getting close to our destination, I looked out the window over the wing staring at the millions of stars in the sky when I noticed one particular object that seemed to be moving with the aircraft at least 50+ miles (approximation) as it was visible just off the far edge of the wing.  I thought possibly this was simply an optical illusion, so I focused on another object only to watch it move to the rear of the wing and out of sight.  I then refocused on the moving object keeping pace with the aircraft when it suddenly had a burst of acceleration. Mind you we were flying at 380mph (I asked the pilot when we landed) and this object sped forward at least 4 to 5 times that speed because it was out of sight in less than a tenth of a second. I thought the event was over when the object came back on its same trajectory in reverse then moved forward at the same rate as the aircraft. It performed the same maneuver several times then shot straight up in a vertical motion at the same speed it used when it moved forward and backward. Only a few seconds later it returned in a downward trajectory at the same rate and stopped at the same altitude just off the wing. That's when I noticed two other objects performing the same maneuvers. It almost seemed like they were playing a game of ""catch me if you can"" moving upward, downward, forward and reverse in Nano seconds. It was an amazing sight to behold. I looked around to see if anyone else had noticed this event but most of the people on the flight were sleeping, or had their window shades closed. At one point all three crafts met stood at the same location for a minute or two, then without warning one moved forward, one moved rearward, and the third flew vertically. All t! hree cra fts were flying at well over 600 mph during the maneuvers. I was absolutely amazed by what I was seeing, three UFO's performing a series of maneuvers impossible to be normal, jet aircraft -- and of course being in very close proximity to Area 51. After approximately 40 - 50 minutes of maneuvers, all three craft took three different trajectories; up, forward and rearward and then they were all gone. It was an amazing event, and one I will not soon forget. This was only the second sighting I have had, the first in 1976 when I experienced a glowing, golden orb that followed my car at low altitude (approximately 50 feet) parked itself in the sky in front of my home, then landed in a field around the corner from my home (see August 15, 1976, Hatboro, PA). Just for the record, I do not drink alcohol when I am on an aircraft because it dehydrates your body. I drink 8 ounces of water every hour that I am on the flight.

When we got outside, there was one glowing red-orange-white orb of flashing light in the distance.  There seemed to be a large hill in the distance and the orb was maybe a few hundred feet above the hill, but it was hard to tell.  It was perfectly stationary for the minute or so it stayed there. The surprising thing was that the people outside said they saw it speed across the sky very quickly to it's current position and just stop there.  This is where and when we saw the light, which was glowing like a disco ball, but flashing a thousand times faster and much brighter.  We did not see it fly across the sky, but if I had I would have been even more astounded.  I had never seen anything like this before in my life until the summer 2008 when I saw something very similar in Croatia over the Adriatic Sea, amazingly about 30 seconds after I told this story about the Mexico sighting to my sister and cousins in Croatia.

In July of 2005 I was living at my parent’s house in Mora, MN. I was in their sunroom that has two windows to the south and five windows to the west. Their backyard backs up to some thick woods. To the south the tree line continues for at least a mile or so. I was in the sunroom watching TV, facing the west wall. Suddenly for no reason at all I turned my head to the south. Just above the tree line, no more than 100 yards from the house there was a large cigar shaped disk hovering above the tree line. I looked as though it had just come out of the woods but that was ridiculous because there was no clearing that it would have fit into that I knew of. And I know those woods pretty well. This object was about two to three minivans in length. It was a silver color with red lights revolving around the middle. It had a disk shape with a dome top. It stopped and teetered for a moment. Then it just zoomed (for lack of a better word) off into the sky. I mean it was just gone in an instant. It was July and the windows were open because my parents are too cheap to run the AC at night. There was a low hum coming from the machine and that could have been why I turned my head to the south. Although there was a hum, the trees sat perfectly still.  I was so scared I ran to all the windows and shut them. I then went upstairs and ran around to all the windows upstairs and closed and locked them. It was hot and humid but I didn’t care. I have never been so scared in my whole life. I moved in with my fiancé two weeks later, but up until then every night I locked my window and my door at night. I haven’t seen anything since then, however recently my brother and his friend watched a bright, non-blinking light move in the sky following the Snake River. At one point it stopped several times and made a 90 degree turn. My dad who is a non-believer also witnessed this from the front of his house two miles away. As an experienced pilot he knows that no planes, helicopters, or satellite moves the way this object did.! I don’t know why we have seen all of these things, but I am sure there are others in Mora that have witnessed strange activity in the sky as well.  I am reporting this now as I saw a “stock” photo of a UFO online today and I instantly burst into tears. I feel like a crime victim that is finally ready to confront the experience after years of holding it in. The only people I have told about this has been a few family members and my now-husband.

There were no streaks in the sky, no trail left behind.  It all seemed to occur in one small spot, miles up in the sky. Family members immediately attributed the flash to the work of our deceased relative.  Though a meteor might explain the bright flash, the fact that flash occurred in only one small spot in the sky casts some doubt, as does the enormous intensity of the flash of light.  And, that doubt is what makes this flash of light ""unidentified"".  I did not see the sky myself, but I did see the flash of light reflected on the ground and buildings, similar to a lightning strike, brighter than the sunlight which was bright that day.  It should be noted that the elderly relative whose funeral was in progress, was a witness to at least 2 UFO sightings, one in the 1970's and one mass sighting in the mid 80's, both of which she forever refused to talk about, taking the accounts of those sightings to her grave.

It was shaped like a triangle with one open end. More like a boomerang, but more narrow like a triangle. It was moving along sort of like a jelly fish swims.

Looking north from my second story bedroom window I pulled down the top sash of the double hung window to watch through the screen and smell the night air. The room light was off.  As the helicopter moved off to the east and the blade noise faded I noticed a burnt orange-colored ball of light appear in the west and moving silently to the east seemingly tracking the helicopter but on a parallel path I estimated an additional mile north of the helicopter's flight path. The ball of light was moving about 150 mph, about half again as fast as the helicopter.  It appeared to be about 600 ft above the ground.  I tried to resolve its shape but I could not until it had moved off to the east.  The window screen pixelated the view and I finally convinced myself that the the orange ball of light actually had a vertical diamond shape, although that was not readily obvious.  Most of the time it seemed to have an amorphous, ill-defined shape.  The light was seen for about 30 seconds. It was completely silent.

He was killed 2 miles from my house in a one vehicle crash.  On 10/19 his wife (friend #1) asked that we (3 friends) go to her house to get his burial clothes because she did not want to go alone.  We took my car.  The time there was somber to say the least, we reminisced a bit and left for my house.  Upon backing out of the driveway friend #4, sitting in the back passenger side said ""What in the heck is that?""  Nobody looked because she has a drug problem and we never take her seriously.  Her sister (friend #3), sitting in back, driver side looked and said ""Oh My God look over the house!""  I looked and stopped the car (in that order) and all I can say is the first thing that came to mind was ""Is that an old car?"" I immediately dismissed that idea because it was ridiculous and I continued driving.  I figured it would 'disappear' but it didn't.  I came to a stop sign within a mile, rolled through it and the object was moving closer to us from the direction of Friend #1 house.  The object was not as high as a cell tower (I don't feel comfortable stating measurements in feet).  It was pewter in color.  It depended on the angle it was looked at, as to what it looked like.  After a while I didn't see the old car resemblance, I saw a futuristic car.  The car comparison is due to what appeared to be big fenders, like a 56 chevy.  The closest thing my mind could compare it to was the car in Back to the Future.  Its movements were as quick as a thought, there was no stall when it stopped.  At one point it backed up, stopped, waited and continued when we did. It was more of a rectangle shape than a disk at one angle.  Every edge was rounded and where there could have been doors there were no seams.  It appeared to have a windshield because the front of the object had a darker color in the area of the windshield. My friend that had died in the wreck had seen them many times out there as orbs and lights and triangles, always at night.  We have video that he filmed.  I watched some of it, I saw an orb but I'm not sure what to think but he was definitely convinced it was abnormal. The area we were traveling is in a very rural area and the road from their house to town is narrow and winding with trees hanging over the road.  Most of it follows a bayou for the first 5 miles or so.  Then it is open pastures and farm land for 5 or 6 miles to a city of 20,000. I live on the opposite side of town so we drove through town on a four lane highway until we stopped at a gas station 3 miles from my home.  Then we proceeded to my house through farm land.  Through the entire route the object stayed to our left as we headed north and then west.  It was hard to see it clear when we first left Friend #1's house due to the trees but we could see it.  It followed us along the winding road.  It stopped when we stopped and we all commented about it stopping.  All of us are fairly cool-headed so no one panicked.  It was the first time any of us saw a spark of the normal Friend #1 in the past few days.  We didn't know whether to laugh or cry so we all started laughing, everybody found a cigarette to puff on and we watched it follow us for the next 10 miles until we stopped at the gas station.  No one outside of my car seemed to see it.  We were all looking up and while on the 4-lane I watched other cars and it was as if they didn't see us either but that's not unusual these days.  When we stopped the lights from the gas station were so bright that we couldn't see the sky.  I never noticed that it would cause a blind spot when you try to see past the fluorescent lights at dusk.    While we were in the store I remembered I had a dang camera in the car!.  After 5 minutes we started back out and it was waiting on us over a field still to the left, passed a bridge.   Now it was dark.  I pulled my car to the right and jumped on my hood with my camera and started taking pictures and when I did the dang thing started flipping literally.  It now had red, white and blue lights (we triple checked that that night).  I got one shot of it in video (I attached it P1010006.MOV), if you have problems opening it I can co! nvert it Everyone was moving around in the car so all the still shots look like slivers of light.  I hollered for them to stop and they did and that is when I got the video.  They were all freaking out about me being on the hood.  I guess they thought I may get beamed up.  After listening to coast to coast, I have realized that may not have been the smartest move.  The object shot up so far in the sky it was just a blink of a light so I got down and drove us to my house. When we arrived at my house we told my husband what had happened and he looked at us like we had been doing drugs.  We pointed it out to my husband who quickly saw we weren't making it up.  He saw the 3 lights and estimated it was 1/2 mile up. He manages road construction so I trust his judgment on the measurement.  It was higher now than it was when we first saw it.  Friends #3 & #4 left and I offered to take Angie to her Dad's in Monroe so we could talk about what had just happened.  When we left, the object didn't immediately follow us.  My husband said the lights started getting closer to our house, so close that he went inside in fear of what may happen if he didn't.  After 15 minutes we saw it again while heading south on Hwy 165.  It was high in the sky (1/2 mile I guess) hovering.  Once I got her home I headed back to my house and I did not see it again until 10/19/2008.  I saw the same type craft in the sky roll out of the path of a jet.

There was no noise, and it circled above the house, turning over the roof and declined when it was at the corner of the dogs’ house. As the light came closer, its form became clearer, the turning movement stronger and it got a very strong, pulsing ‘eye’ in the middle. (Estimation of its size: about 10 meter). It took about half a minute to do the complete circle over the house.  After 5 minutes, my friends got in their car and went home, I kept on looking to this beautiful light and went inside after 15 min. One hour later, I went outside to look, it still was there, but less bright.  I can guarantee you that it wasn’t a laser from one or another disco- the house is situated in the middle of creeks and agriculture. And we were standing right under the light, and saw not one vertical projected line.   It felt like a very peaceful and special experience, without any feeling of fear.  I wrote a letter to a specialist, and got the answer and confirmation that is was an UFO from Mars.  Afterwards, there were a lot of other signs on and around the house, which confirmed again the presence of UFOs.

Me and my buddy were hanging out in the mountains in Nipomo, there is only 1 or 2 homes around us but other than that the area is pretty isolated from civilization making it one of our favorite spots to relax. It was around 1 o'clock in the morning, we were cooking hot dogs over a fire pit and enjoying ourselves. I noticed a bright, yellow, disk shaped light flying through the night sky, it was about 10 or 20 miles away and about 10,000 to 25,000 feet high. As soon as i saw it i told my friend ""Look"" and i pointed towards the night sky. We observed this thing fly through the air, it didn't turn or make any erratic maneuvers, it maintained a straight trajectory. When we first saw it it didn't make any noise, it went straight and seemingly changed to a blue color or emitted a bright blue light and soon after that happened it dropped an object. So there is this bright yellow light flying across the dark horizon and there is a blinking smaller yellow light under it thats falling towards the earth. By this time the object was emitting a sound similar to maybe a sonic boom or a passenger jet flying overhead. The object continued to fly across the horizon while the smaller blinking object continued to lose altitude, the objects grew farther and farther apart. The loud, jet engine like sound we heard faded away and the smaller blinking object kind of faded away in some fog that was very far from our location. The original, larger light kept flying until it became to faint to see. It was pretty foggy that night, we saw everything happen after the fog cleared up around us but the objects seemed to disappear into the foggy night that surrounded the city of Nipomo, it left a smoke trail behind it. Please keep in mind that it was extremely hard to determine how high and how far this object was. It seemed like it was almost flying above Nipomo but I'm not positive about that. I'm pretty skeptical that this object is a UFO. I think this object is man made, perhaps a rocket of some kind going in to space, or maybe a satellite reentering earths atmosphere. I don't know what it is but it scared the hell out of us. An explanation would be great.   -If you are investigating this and you have any questions/comments/explanations please contact me via email.

The object became evident when I was observing a private aircraft moving in a northwesterly direction; at the same time an airliner was above it moving in the same general direction towards San Francisco or Oakland airports. As the two aircraft moved and separated I noticed a third 'aircraft' behind and higher then either of the two I had been observing. Under clear blue skies what I thought was another jetliner was in full view and it was not moving and made no noise. It seemed odd that the craft could be so still and yet with the sun in the western skies it was clearly reflecting light as you would see in an aluminum like jet or airplane. I focused on the craft, with the naked eye, and I continued to observe it and clearly saw it was not moving. I deduced it could not possibly be a star because it was too early in the afternoon. I called to my wife to witness this but she declined, but I was able to hail my daughter. Unfortunately, she has a serious eye condition and could not see the object so I told her to bring down my binoculars which she did. With the binoculars I could see the object with more clarity and it appeared oval in shape and the bright aluminum-like reflection seemed to also show a red band? Without the aid of a tripod to steady the binoculars I was pressed to get a clear image. The object remained steady and did not move and I used a reference point to make this observation. I kept watching the object and then told my daughter to get my video cam-corder but she could not find it. After about 5 minutes I had to rest my eyes and had a hard time re-acquiring the object but I did and watched for a few minutes more with the binoculars now resting on the top of a camera tripod - my binoculars have no tripod attach point. Frustrated that no one else was there to witness this I hollered to my wife; as I was waiting for her - having taken my eyes off the object - I turned back to the are! a where the object was and could not locate it. After a few moments I was able to see it for one last time. Now it seemed to have moved away since it seemed much smaller than when I first saw it. By the time my wife came down I lost sight of the object and did not see it again.  I will add that in the general direction of the sighting you will find Travis AF base. From my backyard I will often see military aircraft on occasion; however, my military background and understanding of aircraft lead me to believe this was not a typical aircraft. It was too high and was absolutely still - no movement - and no noise.

It appeared to be cylindrical in shape and dark, gray maybe or a dull metallic color; it was relatively well offset by the colors of the evening sky so it was plainly visible to the naked eye.  It seemed to be fairly large and distant; it stayed completely stationary for some time.  After I first noticed it I didn’t point it out until I realized that it had not moved at all for close to 30 sec.  I pointed it out to my 4 friends who all saw I but we could not decided what it was, the general consensus seemed to be that it might be a kite of some sort but to me it seemed too high in the sky and large, also the area of the sky it was in did not see like a place where anyone would fly a kite of any sort.  I pulled out my cell phone to take a picture the clouds behind the object could be seen on the screen the but object did not appear despite that fact that as I mentioned before it was plainly visible to the naked eye, a fact that I pointed out to my friends, and all of my group saw it.  If I recall I also heard someone in another group we passed mention noticing it.  The object remained stationary for several minutes thereafter until it moved slightly down and to the right and from view. 	The object was perhaps 30 to 40 degrees in the sky to the WNW, generally in the area of the sky between the Washington monument and the White House but probably more distant.  It particularly struck me as odd because this is not a residential area, and as far as I know restricted air space, also this is the area of the sky were aircraft approach Regan National airport.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,38.907575087012276,-77.02499886426087

I happened to look up and was amazed to see an object in the sky with a short comet like tail. I was surprised as it seemed unusual. So I ran inside to get my monocular. I came back and observed it with the monocular. It seemed to be disc shaped, but was still too far away to make it out clearly. But since it looked more disc shaped than jet shaped, I ran back in and got my camera. It is a Sony Cybershot 7.2 megapixal. I keep it set on fine to get the highest resolution I can. I took about five still shots of which two show it pretty clearly. The object definitely appears disc shaped when you zoom in on the image. I then switched to video mode and filmed it for several minutes. The sun was starting to set and my settings must not have been so good. I am not able to see the object on the video because the sky appears too bright. I don’t know how to adjust the brightness on a video unless you go in frame by frame. I know I can try to go in and freeze a frame and adjust it, but have not tried that yet. The object was traveling from the NE to the SW so it was traveling somewhat in the direction of the setting sun. As I was filming it a helicopter flew by, much closer in range. I don’t know if they noticed this other object in the sky. I also heard the helicopter very well and yet I heard no sound from the object, although it seemed to be flying around the same height that most jets seem to fly. I can always here them in my location  The object and its short comet like tail were very bright; almost hot white, with a tinge of yellow. I watched and filmed it until it disappeared behind the tree line in the west. ((NUFORC Note:  One of four reports witness submits in five days from Cross Roads, TX.

I moved back and forth west to east and back a 100ft or so,  to try and get a feeling of how close it was. It did not appear to change its position relative to the nearby stars. It must have been very high up, possibly not even in the atmosphere. Just as I was about to say ""Hmm"" and go inside, it changed from its bright white twinkly color to yellow and through to red and made a clockwise spiral that decreased in radius as it moved toward the SSW (toward the star Mizar in the middle of the ""handle""). The movement was so rapid it appeared to leave a trail to my eyes. The yellow to red color got dimmer as it spiraled off to the southwest.

A bright yellowish light over the I-5 freeway in Western Washington.,Everett,WA,2007-10-02T02:00:00,light,20min - 30min,"Occurred : 10/2/2007 02:00  (Entered as : 10/02/07 2:00) Reported: 11/6/2008 3:45:18 PM 15:45 Posted: 1/10/2009 Location: Everett, WA Shape: Light Duration:20min - 30min",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66749.html,"A bright yellowish light over the I-5 freeway in Western Washington. This sighting occurred at about 2:00am during the first week of October 2007 while I was visiting my parents in Washington State.  I had just gotten off the phone with my fiancé and was settling down to read myself to sleep on the fold-out bed in the living room.  I was lying on my stomach, absorbed in my book, when a strange feeling of something being amiss suddenly washed over me.  I can't really explain the feeling better than that; it simply seemed as though something was not quite right. I looked out of the open window, which was directly in front of me at the head of the bed.  This window faces east and overlooks a high school football field at the bottom of the hill that my parents' house sits on.  Beyond the field lies Broadway Ave. and a section of I-5, and beyond that one has a view of the countryside, the small town of Snohomish, and the Cascade Mountains way off in the distance. Peering out the window, I didn't see or hear anything unusual, just some cars zipping along the freeway and a few lights dotting the foothills of the Cascades.  I shook my head and silently scolded myself for being silly and went back to my book.  After a few moments I glanced out the window again and saw a light in the sky off in the distance.  This light was quite bright and seemed to shift colors; it went back and forth very slowly between muddy yellow and pale orange.  I assumed it was just a helicopter checking out the traffic on the freeway, but I kept watching it anyway.  It stayed in one spot, not moving at all, and I suddenly realised that it couldn't be a helicopter, at least not any kind of helicopter I'm familiar with.  The light it was giving off was all wrong.  What's more, I couldn't hear a thing other than the windchimes on the porch and the traffic on the roads.  Sounds carry very well in that part of the state, and had it been any kind of conventional aircraft I'm certain that I would have been able to hear and identify it. I turned off the lamp next to my bed and lay in the dark watching the light.  It hovered over I-5 for about 10 minutes, then drifted slowly to the south, along the line of the freeway, and was concealed by a stand of pine trees about 500 feet from the house.  I figured it had gone away, but I stayed in the dark and continued to look out the window.  Another 5 minutes passed, and the light suddenly reappeared from behind the trees.  It moved north and took up its former position over the road and just hovered there, not doing much of anything that I could see.  It stayed in that spot for about 5 to 10 minutes. I started to feel uneasy; I squeezed my eyes shut, lowered my head, and counted to ten.  When I glanced out of the window again the light was gone.  I looked all over the sky but there wasn't a trace of it anywhere. I waited for a bit to see if it would come back, but it never did.  Finally I turned the lamp on and picked up my book, eventually falling asleep sometime around 3:00am.  Nothing else of note happened the rest of the time I was visiting. I would like to note that I did not feel at all threatened by this light, and if it was a UFO I very much doubt that the intentions of the pilots were hostile in any way.  I have the feeling that whoever, if anyone, was inside this craft was simply interested in seeing what the freeway was all about.  I did feel uneasy, as I said, but this mostly because I was faced with something strange, something I could not explain. I have been sitting on this story for a year, too embarrassed to tell it to anyone aside from my fiancé.  I am above all else a realist, and when I see something strange I like to exhaust all mundane explanations before I label the experience paranormal.  I have been very intrigued the UFO phenomenon for years, though, and I firmly believe that our vast universe is capable of supporting life on distant planets.  Why those lifeforms should be interested in visiting Earth is beyond me, but as long as they're not engaging in harmful activities, I say the more the merrier.

It was moving around the same general area and would disappear and reappear and was flying by really fast, I later found out that this was no star.  I thought this was really strange.  Then I was trying to follow it around with my eyes and I was really excited to be witnessing this.  Another light that looked like the same one appeared in another direction below that to the right and it looked like they would appear and reappear and fly away.  I was really excited to be seeing this and hoped that it would last as long as possible.  Later, I had seen a third object that had looked like the same of them appear in another direction (to the lower left), kind of like an off triangle formation.  By this time, my friend had come back and I was hoping that he saw the same thing that I was seeing just to reaffirm and because I just couldn’t believe it.  He saw the same thing that I was seeing.  For about 20-30 minutes, these 3 light objects were appearing and disappearing, getting brighter and lighter, and seemed to be like dancing in the sky between one another.  It was the coolest and most bizarre thing that I have ever witnessed. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The light was as bright as Jupiter during opposition but with a more sharper / crisp detail. It was perfectly round.  Just a note I am an armature astronomer with an 11' Schmidt cassigrain telescope. So I am families with the night sky.  I immediately thought the light was not a normal occurrence. It was motionless. As I looked at it for a minute or so the light literally began to shrink until it totally disappeared. I'm thinking that was weird. I told my wife about it and to be honest, she didn't think too much about it. Then about a week later at about 10:30 at night I and my wife were outside smoking a cigarette on our deck. Our deck faces due north. When all of a sudden there is another light of the same magnitude to the north. My wife asked me what star or planet it was and I informed her it was neither. It was motionless just like the one earlier in the week and as bright. We watched it for a minute or so when the same thing happened again. It shrank and then disappeared. I never saw it again. I moved to Ozark, MO in the summer of 2007. Thank goodness the only thing I’ve seen there was an occasional satellite orbiting over. Do you have any explanation to as what me and my wife witnesses?

We were in the left lane and there were other cars and trucks around us.  I noticed that this object with 3 beams of lights looked like it was coming towards the highway and I thought that it might be a plane in trouble, needed to land on the highway.  Instead it stopped coming closer to the highway and was about 50 yards away, hovering in the middle of nowhere.  After it hovered I thought it might be a truck stopped on an overpass but we couldn’t see any hill or anything because it was dark.  Then it started to swoop downwards and closer to the highway again, I realized that it was in fact NOT a truck on an overpass and that there wasn’t even a hill there, it had been stopped, hovering for about 10 seconds and it looked like it’s light was searching for something.  It appeared to be 20 feet across and had three round, white lights evenly spread about searching only on the ground.  We were traveling in the car around 80-90 mph and witnessed it go into an orchard where it appeared to hover between trees with its lights shining out towards the highway.  When we passed it, it was still in the grove and we didn’t see it fly away.  In total we saw it for about 2 minutes before we passed it on the highway.  I could not actually see a body of an aircraft or whatever it was, I could only make out three distinct lights.  Account 2:My daughter (age 19) and I (age 54) were driving north on Interstate 5 near the farming district in Ca. last Wednesday evening when we saw 3 bright highlights, ahead of us, but off to the side of the highway.  The lights were bright and blinding and we wondered if a plane was trying to make an emergency landing on the highway.  But that didn’t make sense since I’ve never seen 3 lights placed so closely together on a plane.  As we continued driving I thought it might be a tractor intending to cross an overpass since the lights were a bit higher than the horizon.  Suddenly the lights stopped moving and just hovered in one place, then it flew towards the highway and then counter clockwise away from the interstate.  It headed north in an open area as if it were going to land on a runway but it didn’t.  The lights illuminated a field which I thought had grass on it.  I think I saw a small red light on the right side of the wings, I’m not sure if I really saw a wing though, I’m assuming it’s a wing.  The lights were so bright I never could see what the lights were attached to but there did go across in a fairly straight line horizontal to the ground.  As we drove by the highlights were about 100yds or one football length away from our speeding car and hovered over an orchard of trees.  I couldn’t tell if it landed on the ground or just hovered about the tree line next to the highway.  Nor could I identify the shape of what supported the three bright highlights .",2008-10-31T00:00:00,36.6712,-120.4387

I looked up into the sky as I was driving and saw two objects about a half a mile in front of me land distance. I was just coming to the intersection of Vista Del Sol Rd. and Lomaland Rd. to a red light. It was dusk (almost dark) and their was a large thunderstorm coming in from the north. I watched the objects as I was stopped at the stop light. There were two dark (blackish/dark gray) objects floating (best description) across the sky. They stayed the same distance a part as they traveled. They were moving sort of towards the thunderstorm, perpendicular to Vista Del Sol. There movement reminded me of the gyrocopter from the movie the Road Warrior. But they were not gyrocopters I don’t think. Their size in relation to their altitude in the sky ruled that out as did their staying the same distance from each other. They sort of looked like they were being towed by something that wasn’t there and they were just floating behind. They had no lights and made no sound that I could hear. They didn’t appear to be moving that fast. I can not say how high in the sky they were but they didn’t appear to be to high.

They appeared to be sort of (aerodynamic motorcycle not German WW II) helmet shaped with some sort of “foundation” that protruded around the base. They had other protrusions but it was dark so you couldn’t make out any detail. It was weird.  I turned right on to Lomaland so I could continue observing them. They appeared to start moving at a faster pace as they were getting nearer to the thunderstorm. This is based on the speed they were going at the stop light and where they were in the sky as I proceeded up Lomaland. I wanted to see if other folks thought they were UFOs so I pulled into the first apartment complex on the right. A young man about 14years old was there in the parking lot and I pointed at them and said “Do you see those UFOs?” He looked up into the sky and his jaw immediately dropped. He turned and ran towards the apartments yelling at his companion that there were UFOs. I drove another 10 or 15 feet into the apartment complex because I saw another guy looking right up at them. I said to him, “You see those UFOs right?” and he said, “Yes I do. I wish I had a camera.” I explained quickly that I wish I had my cell phone with me. I pulled up another twenty feet and by this time the objects were moving directly towards the thunderstorm. The thunderstorm was at least 20 miles off to the north. On the other side of El Paso International Airport. Within seconds one disappeared into the storm and then the other. I came home directly after the incident and as I was driving I didn’t see anything unusual in the sky. I did see  two planes or copters over the airport as I could see their lights blinking.

"Silent, black, triangular object with no lights",Chisholm,MN,2007-10-22T18:45:00,triangle,5 Seconds,"Occurred : 10/22/2007 18:45  (Entered as : 10/22/07 18:45) Reported: 11/18/2008 9:52:27 AM 09:52 Posted: 1/10/2009 Location: Chisholm, MN Shape: Triangle Duration:5 Seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66972.html,"Silent, black, triangular object with no lights I remember it as being roughly a week or so before Halloween of 2007. My friend and I were grounds workers at a mining museum/park, and we had just finished closing up the park and locking the buildings around the site. We locked up our grounds garage last, where our cars were parked, at about 6:00 PM. We ended up getting into a conversation for about 45 minutes. The sun had set, and we were having a deep discussion about 80’s Hip-Hop artists, when my friend suddenly stopped talking, looked up, startled… and then SPRINTED up the road about 20 feet!  I wasn’t too concerned, just a little confused. I caught up with him and he explained to me that he had just seen a very large triangular “object” pass right over us, and just over the tops of the trees near us. He described it as being INCREDIBLY low, probably just 75-100 feet off the ground, triangular, and black. I couldn’t help but be skeptical of his account, being as I sensed absolutely nothing of this seemingly huge UFO right above our heads. We were all by ourselves, there was virtually no ambient noise down by our garage, except the sound of cars passing by on the highway near us, and still this “craft” made absolutely no noise whatsoever. So I stood there for a while and listened to my friend frantically repeat his description for about two minutes. I clearly remember him estimating the size of it and whatnot, when I looked up to the north, pointed at something, and yelled “Like THAT?!” I felt my stomach drop. He looked and said “Yes!”  I stared directly at it. It was a black triangle, floating slowly upwards. It wasn’t as close to the ground as what my friend described, and its really hard for me to guess how big it was, but I would estimate it as being roughly the same size as the one he witnessed first. All I can remember is how directly I was staring at this thing… it was a totally clear night, the thing was darker than the sky, and I had no doubt about the exact shape I was looking at. It was just a triangle… no lights, just a shape… slowly moving upwards. We watched it for what could not have been more than 5 seconds, and it just vanished right in front of our eyes… just disappeared. I proceeded to freak out and scream a string of profanity, all while we tried to reason and deduce what we realistically could have seen. “Things can’t just disappear!” We ended up jumping in our cars and driving across the street to the ‘Ironman’ statue/parking lot. We got out of our cars and stood there for quite a while, staring up at the sky, almost expecting to see another one. I imagine we looked pretty insane like that, but it didn’t really concern us as much as seeing disappearing triangle spaceships…  I’m not sure how long we stood there, but I swear it was almost 9:00 by the time we decided that we had no idea what it could have possibly been, and it was time to go home. My drive home was about 15 minutes, and I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t an immensely unsettling drive home. I found myself staring up out my window the whole ride, but genuinely not wanting to. I never really believed in paranormal activities and the like… I’d never seen a ghost or alien or UFO or anything like that, and I always remember seeing UFO accounts on TV and being very skeptical. I always thought “I’m doubt they could see anything clearly if it was that dark.“ But what I saw was so clear, and I have no doubt about exactly what we both saw, which I think was actually the part that made me the most uncomfortable. The following weeks I just felt sick, scared, paranoid and uncertain. I told very few people about it. Over the course of the next months, and the rest of the winter, there was more slight… anomalies. One strange night at around 10:00 PM (again at our workplace), we were in the museum parking lot, looking at the sky and we saw a strange, moving star-like light up in the sky. Naturally we assumed it was another plane, but it was moving it an erratic, arbitrary pattern that was just odd. We watched for minutes as it just moved across almost the whole sky, heading towards the horizon (which happened to be the general direction of the airport…), when two other lights appeared. We heard distant rotors and decided these ones were helicopters. The helicopters seemed to follow (or chase) the first light, until they all disappeared behind the horizon. Another time my friend called me at 5:45 AM, and I didn’t answer. He left me a message telling me to turn on the news. I did, and saw video from the airport cam of three strange, dim lights in a triangular pattern right on top of the horizon. They (or “it”) weren’t moving relative to the surroundings, though when we replayed the DVR in slow-motion, we could see the lights “fluctuating”. There has been several times where we or I have just looked up and seen a “star” moving in the same strange, erratic patterns, or just general strange stuff going on. And the weird thing is, its always only happened at work. I’ve thought about trying to get a picture or video sometime, but haven’t yet. I still work there, and it’s almost a normal thing now for strange things to happen. But I have to be honest, it still bothers me deeply not knowing for sure. I always expect to go outside for a cigarette one night and see something else. Airplanes can’t disappear. (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was traveling to Eastern California from Malibu Beach and I saw five distinct trails of exhaust or smoke of some sort. This was very strange to me, because there was nothing in front of the exhaust to explain their appearance. They were appearing in strait lines and horizontal from each other from behind the hill. As far as I could tell, they were just appearing without logical explanation. I had never seen anything like it before. The trails were, like the exhaust you would see from an old steam engine’s smoke stack. (puff, puff, puff) They were appearing all at the same time (five at a time) in a straight across pattern, appearing about every half a second or so, going upward at about a 45º angle, to the left. Not like a jet trail would leave behind it, in a (V) shape. The trails of exhaust didn’t appear quickly, rather slow in my opinion. When I saw the trails, my camera was in the car trunk. I pulled over as soon as I could to get the camera. Before I had a chance to pull over, a shiny cigar shaped object appeared in front and center, of these exhaust trails for a split second and it was gone in a bright flash of light and the exhaust trails just stopped. The trails were quite far away, if I had to guess how far I would say about 1 to 1-1/4 miles or so, and the cigar shaped UFO, compared to the trees at the top of the hill, looked to be about the size of a school bus maybe bigger. From the time that I first saw the trails till the time of the flash it was about 6 or 7 seconds. By the time I could pull over to get my camera the remains of the trails had started to dissipate and are not as sharp in the photo as when I first saw them. As close as I can tell from my research, the object was coming from the valley east of the small town of Monte Nido, California , near Piuma Rd. Note: The Valley is called Dark Canyon…  As a young child and as a young adult I have also seen other things in the sky but, to me, I have always been able to dismiss these other sightings with some kind of rational explanation, (weather balloons, shiny silver planes at sun rise or other things...) but not this one.  I have attached the photo and some Google Earth images to calibrate the location. My photo and the Google Earth photo image are as close to the same location as I could get Google earth to get me there. I have also included several Google Earth, ""top down shots"" of the valley, were I think that the UFO took off from. The first top down is from the opposite direction of the original shot and shows were the picture was taken from, the second one shows an area (to the best of my calculations) the place were the UFO took off from. In this area you will notice some buildings and some other objects that are of interest. First you will see a large area at the top of one of the hills near the buildings that has been whited out (by Google) or covered with a white covering of some sort. (Not sure) Also you see a circular shape that is very large and has some interesting shadows around it. I don’t think that this is a pool, maybe a horse corral. Maybe it is a large door or cover of some sort. Your guess is as good as mine. With all the UFO stuff that is surfacing I thought that I should send in this shot.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,,

While on the interstate if was raining pretty hard. As we were traveling I noticed a odd light in the sky just above a mountain. I stared at the light for a good 5 or 6 minutes before coming to the pre-mature conclusions that it was the top of a blink tower. Then as we drove closer and closer I realized that it was really bright. To bright for a light tower. I asked my boyfriend what he thought it was and he said it was a light tower. I agreed and then a couple of minutes later I looked again and saw that it was definitly not a light tower. I saw there wasn't a poll grounding the lights. I started to get confused and focused harder on the lights. In doing so I realized that it was hovering. By this time we where very close and when my eyes focused I saw that it was a man made jet airliner. However, what was so odd about this was that it was not on top of a mountain it was right next the interstate bridge inside of a deep valley. Hovering there it seems to teeter. All the lights where on, I could see the windows to the plane. There was absolutly no markings on the plane accept for a blue stripe and a red stripe. I had already rolled the window down and in total shock I stuck my head out the window in order to try and beleive my eyes better, completely ignoring the pooring rain. The airliner wasn't more than 3 or 4 hundred off the ground and slightly tilted forward towards the ground. There wasnt any sound whatsoever. That was what blew my mind was the absence of sound.

My wife called out, “What is that?”  The other three of us looked up in the southern direction she was pointing (about a 10 o’clock position from where we were sitting) and saw a very large object, which appeared to be a burning ball of orange fire traveling in a southern direction away from us.  We all stood up and began calling out our observations to each other as it continued in a southern direction.   We all commented about the unusual size and the orange flame.  I asked if it could be a military aircraft afterburner, but this was dismissed due to no sound produced by the object and it seemed larger than a known type aircraft and the burning appearance continued throughout our entire observation which, to my knowledge,  was inconsistent with an afterburner. We commented about the possibility of space debris! or a large meteor, but it did not appear to be descending. It continued in the direction of the suspected fireworks display which I suspect should produce more witnesses. It’s difficult to estimate how long in seconds we watched the object. I tracked it as long as possible and I would estimate we watched between twenty to thirty seconds which seemed too fast for a typical aircraft to cover that much area.  It was very strange to all of us. Its flight path would have taken it in the Trenton/ Philadelphia area.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

After that it was gone, the next year in school in my photo class me and my friend got to talking about aliens and such and he told me a pretty terrifying story. Well he used to live in Huntington Park and there are fields throughout the park where there are playgrounds and such. Him and one of his friends saw lights flashing in the sky and heard a siren sounds(similar to police). They were shooting fireworks towards the lights in the sky, all of a sudden they look up and saw this thing standing about 60 yards or so from where they were. He said it had long straggly hair, long fingers, and long arms. All of a sudden it started running towards them with it's arms going in a circular motion and ran the 60 yards in about 3 secs. As soon as they saw it start running they ran into my friends house locked the front door(doorknob and padlock)and their garage where the main door was connected to. They then ran into his bedroom but forgot to shut the door, they were scarred to death, they then argued to who was going to shut the bedroom door he lost and got up to shut it. He then heard all the locks coming undone extremely fast, then the door opened heard it walk into the house. Then heard something glass breaking, and heard the door slam. He shut the door and they stayed awake all night. In the morning his mom asked him why was there a broken bowl in the kitchen, he told her it wasn't them but didn't bother telling her the story because she wouldn't have believed them. After he told me this story i was like no way and told him my experience and we came to the conclusion it was the same type of being running at the extreme speeds that no human would be capable of. if you've had ne thing similar contact me Rbreeze001 @ student . monroecc . edu without the spaces between @ and .",2009-03-19T00:00:00,43.3233,-77.9272

I then decided to go outside for a closer look. I went out site and noticed the stars were slowly moving in the sky... sometime in the midst of all this I saw something drop about 25-50m away on the other side of some trees and I can recall a strange steady beeping noise... beep. beep. beep. beep. then I went inside and came back out for another look this time I decided to look around the corner of the house for some reason and there was this huge thing with lights on it hovering must have been 15ft above the power poles I quickly ran in and got my mom to come see it as soon as we opened the door three flying objects flew through our backyard about 20ft over the trees.

It was weird normally with jets the sound is behind them because light travels faster than sound but with these the sound was in front or ahead of them.

Not that I do not think there are other intelligent life forms out there, I just do not want anything messing with me! I was a skeptic and still am a skeptic, and want to forget all of this, but I cannot hold this in any longer. On May 31, 2007 I graduated from high school. My friend and I decided to go to my favorite spot in town, the point. It is a place in our harbor that kids go to at night to make out. My friend and I are both girls, and for one do not drink. We were just chatting about life down at the point as there is a really nice view of the Ashtabula river and the river leading into Lake Erie. There is also a very shitty view of the train yard and coal. As evening turned into night and we continued to be amazed at how we had just got out of 12 years of torture we sat on a brick ledge looking out on the river. I remember around 8 or 9 p.m. I was looking at my friend and she had her back to the south of the river. I remember seeing a light out over the river and marina behind her and thought that it could possibly just be a helicopter going to the local hospital. About 15 minutes later we were still sitting on the brick ledge looking directly at the river when suddenly there was a bright light passing in front of our vantage point. It was clearly following the river. It was probably a football field or less away from us and maybe 100 feet above the river. At that point I think I said what is that light, and at the very minute the light dimmed out. Now it could have been a helicopter or some kind of military aircraft, which I hope it is. The fact that the light went out as soon as we spotted it, makes me feel like it knew we could see it. The other strange things though that make me believe it was from out of this world are: 1.)	It was heading north out toward the lake and Canada 2.)	It was flying low to the ground 3.)	It made no sound 4.)	It had to fly under/ between sides of a coal bridge because it was so low to the ground The last fact really makes me believe it was from out of this world. If it were a plane or helicopter it would have to have maneuvered through that bridge or gone higher up in the sky to pass it and quickly. Ok I feel a lot better, but I still do not want to believe this crap, but it was amazing to see, I guess.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,41.852927083333334,-80.79049270833333

I was living near the intersection of Washington and Rancho in Las Vegas, NV. I only lived there for about 2.5 months. I was renting a room in a house. I did not have a car, but I bought a bus pass to get around.  On many nights, I would leave around the same time, and take a walk to a local 7-11 store to get a soda or candy bar. It was a good half mile to mile walk. I occasionally would glance to the sky and look at the stars on my walks. One evening, I did just that, but this time was different. I noticed a real bright star that stood out from the other stars.  I was walking South towards Washington Street, but my head was facing to the West while walking (Rancho street), toward this object in the sky. I was looking at it for about 5 or so seconds, and all of a sudden it zipped at a 75-80 degrees using an acute angle. When I say zipped, I mean it appeared to leave the Earth within a few seconds (blink of an eye). I am not good with angles: so I will say it zipped nearly straight up.  It was too far away to describe what kind of object it was. I did notice a light trail that was whitish/blue that it left behind. This trail dissapeared within a few seconds as well, but gave me a good idea of its path. It was clear that this object (physical or non-physical) had unreal speed.

It was a white color with a long tail that was following it then  smaller different colored balls shooting off of it.  So I initially thought it may have been a firework, then suddenly it began making vertical circles and followed into a zigzag motion.  Seeing this I decided to pullover and take a better look because I was on my motorcycle.  The portion of highway I was on is raised so I had a good view over looking the buildings below easily.  When I pulled over the tail stopped and know it was a pulsating red object that was also turning white and was still shooting off balls that were colored green, purple and red they were shooting off in three's and from those balls a couple other even smaller balls were shooting off.  Then a guy in my class pulled over wondering in front of me so I pulled up to him and asked him if he saw what was looking at?  He actually pulled over to see if I needed help.  So I pointed out the light to him which was only pulsating bye now which at first he had trouble identifying at first because of airplanes in the sky. Then we  watched the light move west in a zig zagging motion along with an up and down movement with figure eights and swoops.  After about five minutes we were going to leave and it pulsated real bright and I pointed it just in time to see it drop to the ground and the sky lit up like a bomb was dropped and where it lit up a smoke flume rose into the air.

Normally I would have thought that this was a plane but it seemed to come out of nowhere and was traveling extremely fast at high altitude.

At any rate this object appeared fairly brightly at first and then within seconds faded away while traveling at a high rate of speed even though it was very high up in the sky. The array of lights was such that it basically to on a sort of rectangle shape but that is solely based on the light configuration as I could not see the body since it was dark.  I often work outside my backyard at night and I'm always looking at the sky while lying on my back doing sit ups and resting often for at least 45 minutes a night. I'm very used to seeing satellites and shooting stars as well as all sorts of aircraft. This object was either an extremely large and fast top secret U.S. military aircraft with astonishing flight characteristics or an advanced vehicle from somewhere beyond our planet.

The object hovers silently over Caesar's mountain which is located close to our home.  Caesar Mountain is 3,323 feet above sea level, and the glowing object is suspended well above the summit the majority of the time it is visible.  At times the object will dip below the tree-line, then reappear minutes later high up over the mountain and in a completely different location from where it disappeared!  We've tried to use binoculars to get a closer look, but can't distinguish a shape. The binoculars do, however, sharply bring the intensity of the lights into focus. The lights on the object will glow a brilliant white, then dim.  It also has a brilliant blue haze within the white light.  We were alarmed this morning when the light ""winked out"" and suddenly disppeared after hovering high over the mountain for almost 30 minutes, then abruptly became visible miles away over a ridge.  It briefly shined intensely, and discharged what looked like a beam of light from underneath the object.  It actually (briefly)illuminated the trees beneath! It then shot off with a remarkable acceleration of speed and disappeared from our view.  We've tried to find a rational explanation for this object.  It's most definitely not a star, and we've also ruled out headlights from vehicles on Lobelia road as the binoculars proved that the object is far above the treeline most of the time.  The object is silent and there is no audible aircraft noise from rotor blades or engines, so we're positively sure that it's not a plane or helicopter.  There is a small airport in Lewisburg, WV which is located about 30 miles away in Greenbrier County.  The aircraft traffic that utilizes that particular field consists of small jets and prop aircraft.  The noise they make is audible when they fly over our area.  Caesars Mountain is quite close to our home, less than three miles away, so it stands to reason that we would be able to hear any noise the object emitted-if it were a conventional aircraft.  In addition, the conventional aircraft traffic flying over our area has visible flashing red and green running lights.  The object we witnessed does not.

It would hover over an area but then it would move instantly in another direction. It seemed that it could move in any direction and  be able to stop instantly. I am not an aviation expert but I do not believe that any human aircrafts could have been able to move like this one did. I was alone on a country road and I pulled my car over and stared at the object for several minutes. It moved throughout the valley in the way I described before it suddenly zipped far away out of site. At the time I did not know how to react to what I saw, but around 6 months later I was talking to  friend when he told me that he had seen an object while driving on the Pennsylvania turnpike that same night. By the way he described the object I could tell he saw the same object. Also he told me that the traffic on the turnpike nearly came to a complete stop as all of the drivers were looking at the object. I would not be surprised if other people reported seeing this object as well.  I do know that Letterkenny army base, which has been used as a testing zone for covert military activities was within 20 miles of where I was when I saw the object. The object appeared to be triangular in shape, but I did not get a very good look at the object since it was off in the distance. What stood out for me was the irregular way in which the object moved, I have never in my life seen an aircraft move in that way.

Slowly tipping side to side manuvers under power lines & around a pine tree & gone. I went to the bathroom at 3:00hrs. My shades were open.I only have a few steps to the bathroom. I saw nothing at either window at this time.My husband was sleeping soundly.Sky was clear with bright stars.I sat on the edge of the bed & saw lights in my field.It was very cold -0?? 2-4ft snow drifts with 6"" ice crust on top.Snow was shinny.I got off the bed found my glasses on the dresser. I am now frozen in place as I have my nose pressed against the window. I didn't want it to know I was watching it. I didn't awake my husband as he would of turned on the light.It is now moving tipping side to side. It moves about a ft. off the ground under the power lines which I didn't see just the pole against the snow. It started to turn to the left as if it had feelers to go around a pine tree. it aligned it self turned to the left & started to rise higher like 6ft. I could see the top of the tree. It was half the size of the pine tree high. I move to the right of my window to get a better look as it is moving now into a patch of woods with higher Maple & Beech trees. It was going very slow. I wanted to reach around the corner to get my camera but no it might flash? I see now it is black in the middle with s triangle shape &  amber lights all around the craft. Amber as in a car? I blink my eyes & poof it is gone. Next day I told my husband & 2 neighbors. Within 2 days I hear of a UFO sighting in Texas. The lights were red & big as a football field.  To get the exact date would be 2 days before the Texas 2008 sightings. Larry King had the people on his show who saw them in Texas. I tried to put this out of mind & sight. But no longer as something was seen only 4mi. from here a few wks. ago. 3 people saw it. I tried to email to fox news I doubt it worked is why I am typing this now. I feel something is going on up here in Gods Country  of Potter County,Pa. Thanks.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,,

The craft itself appeared to be of a gray color.  It quartered away to our left.  It's shape was odd in that it was triangular with what was visible with bowed sweept wings from its center.  Although it was less than a mile to the object at a guess from us.  Totally silent.  The flashing low level lights made the rear of the craft appear rounded. The flashing white lights were just around the uderedge of its wings.  You couldn't quite see anything but the light itself and the little of the craft that was visible in this light.  It looked like the light was a by product of its propulsion.  It didn't much look like it should be flying at all with the trailing edges of its wings being so rounded.  The flashing intensified when the claft started to move away from us. A light at the end of each wing just around the edge of it.  A center light that had this same peculiar appearance of being just around the edge of the craft.  There were probly three or four smaller flashings between the center and each wing tip.

I had observed some flashing lights, but dismissed it for airplane navigation lights.  As I looked closer, I noticed that the lights were not only blue and red, but yellow, green, and white as well.  Needless to say, I became quite intrigued.  It was around this time that I realized that in the 16+ minutes I had been observing the craft, it had not been moving away from me, but rather had stayed in the same spot moving in a circular motion.  After every two and a half or three rotations, the craft would then abruptly move diagonally to the opposite end of the previous circle.  This went on for another ten minuted until it quickly shot forward about fifty meters (rough guess), and repeated the circles.

A Confederate soldier's war journal was published as ""Blood & Sacrifice,"" by Blue Acorn Press, Huntington, WV in 1994. On Page 140, the author reports, ""Prior to our arrival at Cave Springs, quite early in the forenoon in fact, a white object was observed in the sky to the southeast, apparently about half a mile high and moving rapidly toward the south.  We decided that it was a balloon, and that the enemy was endeavoring by that means to ascertain the strength of the reinforcements that were coming to Gen. Johnston.""   The book editor notes that Union General Sherman's troops did not have balloons with them on the Atlanta Campaign.  It should also be noted that observation balloons were tied to the ground and only moved vertically up and down.  If a balloon were untethered by accident, it would only move as fast as any winds prevailing at the time, or certainly not ""rapidly.""   The observer (book author) was a Sergeant in Company B, 46th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, and later Sergeant Major, and finally Acting Adjutant of the Regiment.  He had been a school teacher prior to the War Between The States, and the book is a very factual chronology of his daily experiences during the War.

I then sat down beside her and after a few moments there appeared lights out side our window. Yvone ask, what are those. I answered they look like UFO’s to me, and I opened the window wide so we could get a clearer view of a spectacle taking place in the sky. We saw 5 orbs each one looked exactly the same as all the others the were glowing the color of a soft pink similar to the color of the rising moon at night. The were all in a straight line of 5 round orbs or discs straight up into the sky. The were approximately 1, 500 feet away right over the Spokane Community College and were approximately 500 feet above the ground. Each one was moving in rotation around each other. This was a sight of beauty that reminded me later of looking down upon a group of square dancers. You know the doe, see, doe, and spin your partner type thing. The size of each of the 5 orbs or balls was the same, each was approximatly the size of a hot air baloon. There was no sound as they continued to circle around each other in the sky in front of our ring side seats. The speed of each rotation was a complete rotation took less than one second. After viewing this for about 5 seconds I decided to get a picture of this strange scene and rose up to find a camera. At the same time I ask Yvone to keep her eyes on the orbiting orbs.

I was leaving a tradeshow in Chicago in a cab with maybe four other people and a driver. I was next to the driver taking the highway from downtown Chicago to the O’Hare Airport. It was around 5:00 PM, and everyone who was in the cab with me was, like myself, tired and relatively quiet. We had just finished taking our booths down and mostly wanted to just go home to our own cities. I sat in the front passenger seat (we crammed in and split the fare to the airport… very economical…..) and just watched local traffic when off to the north, which was to my right, I spotted something hovering in the sky.  The object may well have been moving slowly or even stationary, and was clearly rotating very slowly, and after a few minutes of mentally triangulating (admittedly not terribly accurate…) I gathered it was approx. one to two miles away, located probably a thousand or so feet in the air, and was solid and dark. The sky was blue and calm, with only occasional clouds. Periodically planes could be seen flying, and they were very easy to identify. There was no sign of a balloon supporting this object, nor of a plane pulling it, or for that matter a pole holding it up. The very curious aspect to me was that the three or four times that it completed a rotation it would be so thin as the edge appeared that it would actually disappear, and then the other side would become visible. It would be like holding up a rectangular piece of cardboard in landscape orientation, but vertical, and rotating it counter-clock-wise. The rectangle had to be at least a few hundred feet long and maybe a hundred feet high, with almost no thickness. After seven or eight minutes I remembered I had a digital camera with me and I fished it out of my briefcase. I took a few seconds of video (I accidentally clicked “off” too soon and didn’t realize it…) and the object appears there, but very distant and not clear enough to make any useful analysis of. All it does is confirm to myself that I actually saw something. At this point the driver asked me what I had been looking at and I told him and the other passengers, but no one else had seen it, and by this point it had faded below the line of site of the buildings and trees. For my own experience I can't believe I was so ill-prepared to think to grab the camera when there was a much better shot of it.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

Misery) - Life Changing UFO, Big Blue and White Lights, Silent as Slience Itself. PEMBERTON, NJ.  SUMMER 2007. It was the summer of 2007. Two friends and I drove to a Weird NJ location known as “Mt. Misery Rd.” I was driving my car that night, which was a green Ford Escort. So we drove around for a while, exploring this creepy, heavily wooded area in the Pine Barrens of Pemberton, New Jersey. We’ve been there plenty of time before, but this particular time we took a different road to switch it up a little bit. As I was driving and talking about nonsense with my two friends, I didn’t realize how deep I had driven, and I paid no attention to any of the turns I was making. Inevitably, as a result of my mere stupidity, we became lost, trying all different ways, but could not find anything that pointed us in the right direction. Of course, that’s when I noticed that all of a sudden, my ¾ full gas tank was now was empty to a point where the E-light was on. At this point, we were all starting to panic a little. Then we saw it, this HUGE, slow-moving object in the night sky. I’ve always been interested in UFO’s and all things similar, but up until that night I have never seen one, nor have I seen one since, but this sighting, that night, has changed my life and my perspective of everything. This giant thing in the sky was quieter than silence itself. My two friends kept telling me to “Go,’’ “Leave,” and “Get the hell out of here!” But I was not about to jet away from this amazing experience. So I stopped the car (but left it running, totally disregarding the E-light), and I stepped out of the driver’s door to get a better look. It was breathtaking. It was even bigger than I had originally thought and it was moving towards the car. Well I don’t know if it knew we were there or not, but it was flying overhead anyways. The underside was beautiful. Four bright blue lights and two or three white lights. The shape of the object was hard to make out, but it kind of looked circular, but not flying saucer. Whatever that thing was it moving too slowly and too silently to be anything man-made. Then it was time to leave. Gas supply was running really low at this point. Eventually, somehow, we made it back to the main road, and started on our journey home. Over the tree tops we were still able to see whatever it was we saw out in “Mt. Misery Rd.” Not too long after it finally disappeared though, I look at my gas-gauge. It was once again ¾ full. I SWEAR ON MY LIFE THIS IS NOT A HOAX OR AN EXAGGERATED STORY. IT REALLY HAPPENED. I WOULDN’T MAKE UP A STORY JUST TO GET SOME INTERNET FAME. NO ONE BUT ME WOULD KNOW THAT “I” WROTE THIS, SO FAME WOULD GO TO NO ONE.

Towards the end of the intermission we noticed a strange strobing light, but concluded it was simply our eyes appearing to make a star “twinkle”.  Once the second movie began the bright star caught each of our eyes several times.  With my peripheral vision, I witnessed this “star” moving slowly to the right and found this very odd because it did not appear to be a plane.  I commented to my fiancé about this and he dismissed my claims.  Shortly later we both realized that this object had moved much closer to us and was approaching at a high altitude to the right of our view.  We kept our eyes fixed on the object as it moved closer to us and eventually, right over our heads.  By this time we had gained a new perspective on this object.  What we could now see was that it had a triangular shape.  With a light in each of its three corners and two red lights on it’s back.  At the point of the object was a blinking white light.  The lighting in the sky at dusk and the position of our car made it so I could lie across the back seat and watch this object glide overhead.  I never let my vision falter as I watched the object continue across the sky and out of view.  About 20 minutes later this object returned from the direction that it came and continued from a slight left of our vehicle, to its original rightward position.  It was much higher this time and for a good period later hovered above the hills in the distance.  No sound except for a dull humming could be heard when this object passed overhead.  We were both genuinely stunned to witness such a thing.  There was also at least one other triangular craft with a similar light pattern in the distance.  We could not see the details of this one as closely, but it appeared to be of a similar build.  At one point an object passed much lower than the others and more in front of our view from the car.  We coul! d not se e the lights on this craft as easily, as it appeared to have a fog light effect.  What made this sighting interesting was the shape of this particular craft, very similar to that of a stingray. 	When we returned home we each drew a picture of what we had personally seen.  Our pictures have very similar details and when I got on the internet and searched for a place to report this, I read a few articles from the past few months and saw something about a wave of reports this summer in Pennsylvania.  I am not surprised; Pennsylvania has been a hotbed of UFO sightings since the early 1960’s.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,41.0559,-78.4129

On 15 August 2008, from approximately 6:25pm to 6:30pm, I observed an unusual object in the sky while I was driving home from work.  I had just merged onto SR429 from the Florida Turnpike, heading north toward Apopka, Florida.  The weather was partly cloudy, but it was not raining, and visibility was good.  Looking out my driver’s side window (toward the west), something in the sky caught my attention. An incredibly bright, white object appeared to be hovering stationary in the sky at what I would estimate to be 700ft to 800ft in altitude.  My initial reaction was that the object was probably an airplane reflecting sunlight while banking, but after continuing to observe it, I quickly realized that was not the case. The object appeared to be perfectly square in shape, not a cube, but a flat, square shape.  It was smooth, with very clearly defined perimeter lines and corners, and was a very brilliant color of white;  incredibly bright, but in a different manner than the brightness of the sun (very comfortable to look at, no glare associated with it, and its brightness did not obscure its shape at all; there was no  ""halo"" or other glow surrounding it in spite of its brightness).  It seemed to be illuminated from inside of the object, even though the object was so flat that it appeared to be almost two dimensional.  The object was located well below the cloud cover, and stuck out like a sore thumb against the overcast, grey sky. I would estimate my distance from the object to be at least one mile.  I’m not sure I can accurately estimate the size of the object, but my impression was that it was fairly large given that I could clearly see the outline of its shape at that distance.  The best description I can give regarding its size is that if you held your thumb up at arm’s length, the object would appear to be slightly smaller than your thumbnail. The object was absolutely stationary in the sky; no movement whatsoever for the entire period that I observed it (at least 5 minutes).  While observing the object, I noticed a small, round flashing light that appeared to be further west of the object, but moving toward it.  When the flashing light had almost reached the bright, square object, they both disappeared.  I spent several minutes trying to spot them again, but they never reappeared.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,28.519246697974758,-81.35409597886704

It was a clear night outside, millions of stars in the sky. Not a cloud in sight. It was warm (about 800 outside) at 11:30pm. We had pulled over to look at all the stars and see if we could see a UFO or anything else in the sky. While there, we had seen approximately 3 objects that were very unusual. When someone would spot something in the sky (way up there) that was moving, I would shine my flashlight on it so everyone could see the object and follow it with there eyes. The 3 objects in question would be flying along (as one solid white light) then just disappear as we were tracking it with our eyes. There was no explanation for this. Where did it go? One minute it was there and the next it was gone. This went on for about 30-45 minutes. In that time frame we saw the flight path of the airplanes to our immediate north and to our immediate south. Very few planes (3) flew by us. The planes to our North were so far north that we could barely make them out. The planes to our South we could clearly tell that they were planes because they had lights on the crafts and we could hear the noise as they flew by us. No mistaking them for anything else. After about 45minutes we were talking about leaving when I spotted this solid bright white light (way up there) in the Southern sky. I told everyone to look (shining my flashlight up at the object) when all of a sudden the object turned toward us and shot a beam of light at us (as if acknowledging that it saw our light) then it simply turned and shot West into the night sky and simply disappeared right before our eyes just like the previous 3 objects we had seen earlier. The beam of light was as wide as the object itself. It was no search light from a helicopter or any other aircraft that I know of. Besides, it simply disappeared right in front of our eyes. When it turned and shot the beam of light at us, I screamed and stared to dart back into the vehicle because I was afraid that it would come down out of the sky and do something to us. The other 2 people with me simply froze. We didn’t know what to say to each other afterward or even believe what we just saw.

I race off road dirt bikes and was checking the weather report for the Madison, Florida area on March 7, 2008, at 4:40 pm ET. I was looking to see if the area was going to get some rain; since we as a whole hate it when a race is dusty. I found this radar image that one can find on www.weather .com.   I put the map ""in motion"" and there was a section of movement that had this “straight line”, in like two or three frames. It caught my eye and I was like what the heck was that, so I paused the motion and advanced it frame by frame till the image came up. I say a straight line cause it was ""more straight than a cloud clearing of sorts,"" and low and behold there is this line that looks as if something flew through the cloud and made a trail. The end of the trail is round and looks as if the clouds move away from the end in uniform distance.  I first thought that it must be a jet fighter or something coming out of the military base, that I think is up there, but then I start to think about the scale of which the radar image is covering. It is this thought that makes me wonder to myself what I have I have a picture of, I mean the radar image is in the middle of the slider scale which scans in and out from I guess ; city view all the out to multiple counties.  I have the scale in the middle when I printed the image. I have shown it to friends and no one has a clue as to what it might be. I know weather can take on any form and it can take shapes that make us as people go huh, but this image is, in my opinion not a clearing of natural origin, but more of a picture of a wake so to speak. I would be happy to email a picture of it if can get it to scan clearly. Well in conclusion, it could be said that it is an airplane, but some one would have to prove to me the scale of the radar image is that small and show me other weather radar pictures of airplanes that have been imaged and recorded.  I feel for know that this is an unidentifiable flying object that has been picked up on a weather radar loop swing. Other questions that cross my mind are 1) how fast does a radar loop move and how many frames does it take to make one loop swing. This entire image lasted for three frames at most, before it was not visible in the radar loop  ""in motion."" Thanks and get back to me via my email if you would like to see the printed out color copy of the image",2009-01-10T00:00:00,30.3979835443038,-86.4573

At 8:51 pm EST on April 2, 2008 I witnessed a UFO that flew directly over my house.  I was very skeptical about UFO's before that day, I am now firmly aware of extra-terrestrial beings.  I had just looked out my window when I saw a huge green light coming towards the house.  At first it reminded me of an airplane but it was so low it would have made a huge sound. I ran outside and saw a triangular object flying overhead.  It came from the South East and was traveling to the North West. This triangle was about 125 feet in the air maybe less and there was barely any noise. The noise that was there sounded like an airplane taking off in a scene in a movie, it was very quiet. It was cruising at about 25-30 mph, almost like it was floating. It was rounded triangle, the edges did not look sharp, and on the two sides there were small green lights, maybe six or more on each side. On the back were five white lights. The middle light was bigger than the others and was flashing a brilliant white light. It was blinding if you looked at it directly. It was not like the blinking lights on a plane. It blinked about once every two seconds. Something else I noticed about the encounter was that my dog was quiet. He barks at vultures above our house and chases them. This object was about 10 times bigger than a vulture and you could hear it more, but he just sat down on the grass, he didn't bark at all which was extremely unusual. This object was also witnessed by my sister and mother. My mother thinks it was a plane from the Dayton Air Base but I do not agree. It wasn't like anything I had ever seen, it was not a plane, and I will firmly stick to that conclusion. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  Probable hoax.  PD))",2009-01-10T00:00:00,40.8776,-83.7385

I would just like to report this possible sighting, and let you know beforehand that I have seen one before in exactly the same spot last february at sometime; although I chose not to report it. Anyway, onto the event I witnessed (just moments ago, I might add). I was stroking my cat at the window of my dining room, strange yes but I like animals. I decided to check the skies, literally in the hopes of spotting something like this. I spotted a star, and looked up at it for a while before realising something: it was rather bright considering no other stars were visible, and appeared to be flickering slightly. I looked closer, making out what I think to be the shape of a disc. I looked around to see if there were anymore, to my relief and dissapointment I saw none. However, when I looked back I glimpsed as another seemed to shoot straight out of it and dissapear in moments. Of course, at this I knew something was awry. It dissapeared for a while, at which I thought I was imagining things. But, it returned, along with another, brighter one flying lower to underneath the other with flashing lights. I disgarded it as a helicopter, thinking maybe all was well. But then they both just dissapeared, like that. I checked again after and they haven't returned. Please look into this, the other sighting I had mirrored this pretty well As soon as I spot them they go, almost as if they are watching me. Please, I do not wish to be abducted at all, and my discussions with other believers on the internet may have gotten them interested in me (I intend to uncover it all in a few years time). I would be greatly assured to know either result. Thank you. P.S.My email is genuine, although I do not wish to give you my adress; my whole family already mocks me.

I just happen to find this site while watching a  National Geographic channel on UFO sightings. It was being narrated by the late Peter Jennings. I live in a 15 story building in which I'm located on the 5th floor. We happen to have a great view of the New York City skyline. This was an overcast day but the view was clear for miles. One could see the skyline quite clearly from where we are; some 5-10 miles from the city. My daughter, who was playing with her dolls near by yelled out to me to look out the window. I in the mean time was on the computer finishing up some papers, when I turn to look out and we see this oblong shaped object some 3-4 miles away. It's difficult to discern exactly the distance because all this lasted some 15-20 seconds. But as we looked outside, this object floated some 600 feet/plus from the ground, just  hovering when it began to move upward slowly and then disappear. The shape was obelisk with some sort of protrusions sticking out from the side in a horizontal  form.  It was dark black.  I would guess the object was rather large. Roughly  some 70-100 feet long vertically. It made no sound. Wasn't a helicopter, or  blimp that just happened to stand on it's end. It was very weird. This is something I will never forget. The odd thing of course is that no one that I know or I don't know reported this except my daughter and myself. My daughter is 5 years old.  This is a big city and for this  to happen here is just damn crazy. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date.

By this time it had moved slightly farthur to the east and upward. It had to be about what I consider 6-700 feet high at this time. The white/silvery color stood out against the clear blue background of the sky. And was no longer heading east, but straight up. It got to a really high altitude and kind of came to a stand still for a period of about 4 minutes then increased in speed really fast and shot out of eye sight for a while.

My husband and I were returning home after dining out in Bay St. Louis, MS, on the evening of Tuesday, September 15, 2009. It was around 9:00 PM and as we headed east onto the Bay St. Louis Bridge, a bright orange light abruptly appeared in the sky to the southeast. As I tilted my head to look out the passenger-side window to get a better look at the light, it just slowly faded away. There was no movement. The object was stationary from the time it lit up until the light completely faded out after only a few seconds. I turned to my husband and he asked me if I had seen it. Since we had both seen this object, he started looking for a place to pull over on the beach. Before he could find a place to stop, I saw another orange light that did exactly the same thing as the first – light up and slowly fade with no movement. This object, however, was more to the southwest. We pulled over at a point where there were a couple of benches on the sea wall and decided to sit and watch the sky over the Gulf of Mexico for any more lights. Before we had time to get settled, another one appeared to the southeast. A short time later, there was another to the southwest. Then, three lights appeared almost simultaneously--one, two, and three. They faded out in the same order. We saw one or two more lights, and my husband remembered that we had our night vision monocular in the truck. He saw the last orange light with the night vision and saw that when the light went off, there was still something there that we could not see without the night vision. For about 15 minutes, we watched a number of small spheres travel back and forth in the areas where we had seen the orange lights. One of the spheres appeared to pulsate, but the others were just faint solid objects. We saw no more orange lights during this time. As we watched the spheres, they suddenly disappeared. There was no moon that night, but it was clear with lots of stars. The objects were very close to shore – between the shrimp boats on the horizon and the beach.  They were also not very high above the water. The entire event occurred over a period of 45 minutes to an hour. We plan to go back with our high-powered binoculars on my husband’s next nights off and see if we can find anything else.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,30.4672,-89.2763

During his childhood he grew up in a hamlet called Sarnesfield, Herefordshire before he moved to Saint John, Canada aged 22 in 1953. As a child during the war he and his friends used to work on the fields surrounding the hamlet, operating simple farmyard machinery. One summer afternoon during the latter half of the war he and a few friends were returning to the fields after having lunch when they all saw a small saucer over some nearby fields. When telling me about what he saw he always said it was drab green, had a domed glass canopy on the top of the saucer and had two large black circular vents on the beneath of the saucer. He said it was like no plane he had ever seen as it was much bigger than anything of that time. Immediately, my grandfather and his friends ran back to a barn and stayed in there until they were sure the saucer had gone. For many years he thought it must have been a new German bomber, as he had never seen a German plane in the war at all as he was in such a remote location. It was not until he moved to Canada in the early 1950s and UFO hysteria gripped North America that he believed what he had seen was a spaceship. I am entirely confident that my Grandfather saw what he claimed to have seen as he was a very honest man and was a policeman for 18 years.

This sighting included my parents, my older brother Bob and myself, I was only 2 ½ and I do not recall anything.   My dad and mom have different stories, so I will tell this like it was told to me. It was about 9 PM and we had just left my grandmother’s about 5 miles from our home. It is about a 20 minute drive.  Dad had the habit of driving up to S Commercial Street about 2 miles from grandmothers and he and mom  go by and would watch the Color TV in the TV shop before coming home, which they did occasionally and stayed about 15 minutes and then drive home.  This was a very sparsely populated, undeveloped area of town. Dad said, ""The UFO  showed up out of no where and it was cigar shaped, it was silver colored and had red lighted round windows and he could see figures moving around inside but did not see any people.""  Then, he said if he slowed down, it would slow down and if he sped up, it would also speed up.  It did not make a sound.  He said it paced him on his drive home. That’s where dad’s memory ends. Then mom said, ""No, it was on Market Street NE, this would be between 10-12 miles distance from dad’s sighting, we were heading down Market near Swegle Grade School and Birchwood Drive about 6 blocks from home and all the sudden the UFO appeared and it was near the ""goose house.""  This was a house where they raised geese and had a very distinctive odor.  I said, ""Did you get out of the car?""  And she said, ""Yes,"" and dad said, ""No,"" in an almost terrorized voice,  mom said “ yes we did and we watched it go over and it almost hit the roof on the goose house. Then mom said she did not recall anything more till they were turning in the driveway at home.  Dad went in and called the local airport and was told that “ we are closed “ but he talked to the man anyway telling him what happened, and  the agent said they had also seen it and it went over so fast and without a sound and there was nothing around that could track it or follow it. Note: the airport closed at 11 PM, 2 hours after they left grandma's house. It was shortly after that time that I begin to react to low sound and vibration.  My family tells me that I would hear a train go by or vacuum running or even water going down a drain and I would cover my ears and scream. My aunt recalls that I would be playing and then all the sudden become stock still and then slowly turn my head as if I were tracking a sound that only I could hear.  I am not sure what happened that night, but I do know that when I was old enough to recall things, between 6-11 years of age, we would pass a building on the way to my grandmothers and I would sit on the floor of the car,put my back firmly against the locked car door and bite my arm to keep from screaming from pure terror. In later years I went back and looked at the building, still there and it was/is a car parts store with radiator hoses etc… looking in the windows at night it was dimly lit with curved archways over long dark hallways with lots of dangling tubes hanging down  could this have triggered a memory from that night?  As I said, I do not have any conscious memories of the event Mom has two deep red marks about the size of a small pea about ½” above and below her naval and she has deep dimples from scoop marks on front of both upper thighs and  she has 6 small brown smooth on the skin dots about the size of match heads on her back, forming two separate triangles which one over the other form one diamond and they have been there since that night.  She said the craft almost hit one of the houses as it was so low, it was cigar shaped and had portals and no visible form of engine, fire, etc, but the portals had light behind them. It paced their car, speeding up when he did and slowing down when he did.  We pieced together there was about a 2 hour missing time for this event.  Dad said it was in one area of Salem, and mom saw it in another, about 10+ miles different in location.  Mom said they stopped the car and got out and looked at it, dad said, noticeably scared, NO WE DID NOT and he would not talk about it any more, he died shortly after that. Mom always wondered about this one and still brings it up from time to time. She is now 83  None of her body marks were there before that night. My brother has no recall of that evening at all, he was about 5 years old. He still lives in Oregon as well. Since he has no memory of the incident it did not make much of an impact in his life, as far as we can tell. Dad was about 24 years old. Worked in a cannery as well as sold real estate. dad was always open minded, but I have to say he did not like talking about this event.  Mom was 25 and was home during the day, with my brother and myself to take care of she has always wondered what happened that night and even at her current age of 83 she still has questions and wonders about the marks ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The stream is called Winters Run.  It is located between Route 7, and Route 1,and about a mile north of Mountain road. We had parked about an hour before sunset, and near as I can remember we had a clear view of the stream in front of us and the bank on the other side.  After some time of smoking, listing to music, and just passing time.  I noticed a fireball off to the right.  It was in no hurry, and not high in the sky.  I told my date to look.  It was traveling the same route as the stream east to west.  It was throwing out what looked to be sparkles like the kids play with on the 4th of July.  I would say it took more than a minute and a half to pass from my right to left.  It did not lose any altitude, and just kept traveling towards WVa. I then left the woods, and stream, and went to a fire station on Mountain Rd., and Route 7, where I reported this as a plane in trouble.  They said it was a meteor, and I left it at that. In the years after, I thought if it had been a meteor the speed would have been greater, and it would be descending.  This thing maintained hight and speed over what must have been 40 to 80 miles. This to me classifies as a U.F.O. Until someone gives me an explanation I can live with.  I am not saying it was being piloted by little green men, but it defies the senses.  I would like to unravel this if possible, I thought it might be the Kicks burg thing but the path is wrong. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Sighting in Bakersfield of Saucer with multiple colored beams of light ...,Bakersfield,CA,,disk,10 min,"Occurred : 2/13/1966 17:00  (Entered as : 02/13/66 17:00) Reported: 6/15/2009 8:52:08 PM 20:52 Posted: 8/5/2009 Location: Bakersfield, CA Shape: Disk Duration:10 min",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70523.html,"Sighting in Bakersfield of Saucer with multiple colored beams of light ... On the night of February 13th 1966, I went out back to ask my friend next door to come out and play. She was excited about the Rolling Stones being on the Ed Sullivan show.  When she opened the back door so I could see the Stones, the song they were playing was ""Satisfaction,"" and that is how I remember the day and year, I was eleven years old at the time.  My friend went in to have dinner and I went  over to a darker section of  her backyard to twirl on the abandoned clothes line. Sitting on top of the  T section of  clothes line pole, I heard a whirring sound, have read where another witness to a similar ufo used the term “ electrical “ which does describe the sound, and is what I would imagine to be an  exceptionally well built electrical engine, like nothing on this earth. A very low whirring electrical sound. I looked up an not far above me, the height was of two garages placed on top of one another, the width was not as wide as a double car garage. What I say was UNBELIEVABLE, I was directly under the bottom of a  saucer shaped ufo, with multiple colored  beams of light pulsating around it; red, blue green yellow and an occasional white beam of light. It had a  bright white light in the center which went off for a spilt second and caused me to strain to see any details  of the bottom of the ufo. Which looked  like a dark gray silver color with a mid section slightly protruding, the beams of light seemed to emanate from holes on the bottom of the ship. I watched the lights for four to five minutes though for some reason time had seemed to lose meaning, when the ufo verved to the left of me, paused then moved away and disappeared in a blink of an eye. It  returned as I was still watching the spot in the dark sky where it had left and was above me once again for a brief period and left again the same way as before in a blink of an eye, as if it had disappeared, all of this was noiseless. I got the impression it wanted to make sure I knew what it was capable of doing. When my friend came out, I said that there was a ufo above me and she looked at me, looked up above me and said, lets go in the garage. This is something I never told many people about and suppressed the memory for obvious reasons.  When I began to hear reports of ufo’s and shows on them, the memory came back very intensely and I began to speak about it to family member’s who do not seem to know what to make of it.  I have also had to have cataract surgery, which had ophthalmologist shaking their heads that someone my age, without any family history of cataracts, had them as severe as I did.  Since then have been doing my own research and have read one or two reports of sightings in Bakersfield as well as elsewhere which describe the ufo I witnessed.  At the time this was occurring I was not fearful!  Though now it unnerves me to think of the power they have over us if they chose to use it.  I would like to be hypnotized and regressed back to that night to uncover details I might have forgotten. It does amaze me that our government has not done any survey of people that have witnessed ufo’s.  Personally I know they are much more advanced than us, but my feeling is we may become just as advance if our civilization last long enough.  What makes me believe this is the whirring electrical engine/motor that I heard at the beginning of ufo sighting, was something, man here on earth could one day replicate.  One more thing, after viewing pictures and videos of ufo’s, many seem to be near of above power lines, like they are taking energy from them?   There is so much more I would like to discuss, about what else they have been doing near power/telephone lines, some of it might label me a kook.  I also  would like to learn more, hopefully doors will open up so that we will not feel so ostracized.  I do not feel so alone with all of the other eye witnesses coming forward.",,35.34399793103448,-119.04089261083743

As we walked into the perimiter of the craft?we thought is was a car and could not figure out how this could have got into the field. About a hundred feet from the car we were shocked 2 find two people wxit the vehicle. I can only remember they were around 5 ft tall. When we saw the faces, just like the pictures I see on TV.

An odd thing at the end of the line occurred:  the object that was second from last moved out of position, passed the one in front of it, and got back in line, thus becoming the third from the end. The next day I contacted MacArthur Field, and the Suffolk Air Force Base who claimed they had heard nothing.  The local Police Department, however, said their phones were ""ringing off the hook.""

We were use to grandpa getting up every night to get snacks, so never thought much of it if we heard doors, even being little we wouldn't.   I was laying on my back next to my mom that night Ill never forget as long as I am able to think and breath ill remember it as if it were last night.  I heard a door open, knowing my grandmas house well I knew in my little mind it was the breeze way door from the sound it use to make.  It would have been around dark mid morning . This twin bed my mom and I were cramped into was straight visioned to see down the hall.  I lifted my head slightly and seen these tall forms in a single line walking soundlessly straight at my mother and me, where we lay. I was so afraid to move.  If a 4 year old could have heart failure, I was having it.  Just as I got the nerve to try to bump my mom or scream, it was like them being all around us at the bed in a operational formation.  Somehow, they didn't let me do anything at all.  I could move or talk or nothing it was like they calmed me in my mind only not like a mom would more like very matter of fact with firm thoughts, they never made a sound at all. I remember my eyes being able to move watching them stand over us.  Seemed like they were studying me as I think back on it, they touched, or seem to touch, places of my joints.  But I didn't feel them touch me; it was like I just new they were. So hard to explain but then they all the sudden looked at one another and left in a single line just as they had walked in.  My mind goes blank at this point.  The next thing I remember is I wake up next to my mom, and am frantic to tell her what happened to me.  She, of course, being a mom, along with the whole family, said you probably just heard grandpa get up and had a dream.  I remember wondering why when something like this happened to me, they didn't want to know, or wouldn't listen. Thinking back, I wonder how can a little 4 year old dream in 1967 and see detailed humanoids that have a eerie glow of greenish mist about them with huge black eyes same form and color and glow as would be said now in 2009.  How can a little girl know this when the only Aliens she has seen at this age is my favorite martian.  Some man with a fish bowl on his head.  Well, I know I am not a liar or making up things now at 46 to impress anyone.  I really finally just want to tell someone in hopes that maybe when I am gone and other things happen who knows maybe one of us and what happened to us or things that we saw will help someone out there that needs that little puzzle piece and if not it is alright with me as well, because they left me I feel better than I was before they came.  I have because of them lived my life so much more open minded than I might have before it. They were now I am guessing about 7 foot tall at least that . They had a dull colored lime glow of misty look to them. They had no visual ears , they had black eyes They're head was shaped like a smooth cone huge top small chin They had a line where the mouth would be but very dim impression They communicated to me seemingly with thought and was able to control me as well. They not once made me feel threatened or took me out of that bed.

The Milky Way was overhead and extremely brilliant. It must have been a new moon and I lived in a small country town so there were no lights and lots of stars. My father was in the garage working on his car when my boyfriend and I came back early from a date. We parked in the yard away from the house and decided to lie on his hood and see who could find and name the most constellations. We were parked facing an easterly direction. I was looking toward the south and my boyfriend toward the north.  Suddenly he grabbed me and said, ""Look there.""  At first I didn’t see anything.  Then my eye caught a movement under the starry sky.  No lights, no sound.  It appeared to be 7 disc-shaped objects flying in a tight V formation.  There were 3 discs on one side and 4 on the other, so not even.  Or at least it appeared that way.  We weren’t sure if it was one object or seven.  The only reason we could see it was because the star light reflected from the bottom and the fact that it moved across the star scape.  Since we had no perspective we could not tell how far above it was.  But I saw it at about 11 O’Clock (my left) and it moved very quickly to the south.   After it left, we listened for a few seconds but heard nothing.  I yelled for my Dad but he didn’t come out in time.  Something that I feel is very significant is that the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville at that very time had the Apollo missile.  I remember a big to-do about transporting it to Florida.  Also, my father who worked for IBM had just been told he was being transferred with the contract to Cape Kennedy.  I have always felt there was some kind of connection.

While following a jet far away, I saw this rectangular shoe-box shape object come into view as I was moving the binoculars. I watched it for a few minutes in total amazement. What is unusual is it was completely motionless, and it was camouflaged the exact shade of color as the blue sky. I was about to yell at my neighbor to come look, but when I looked thru my binoculars again I could no longer see it. It vanished very quickly. I tried for several minutes to find it, but could not. It seemed very far away, which means it must have been pretty large. I looked at it without the binoculars and all I could see was a tiny blue dot. I wish I would have had a telescope with a camera on it to take its picture. What is my opinion? I believe it has an electrochromatic polymer surface to camouflage it the same color as its background. I believe it is a creation of the military-industrial complex, (and it could be foreign-made, as in Russia.) As for the ability of this non-aerodynamic craft to hover motionless, and then fly away at high speed, I suspect scalar wave technology is in effect.

I stare through my polarizing glasses, which allowed me to see the clouds and sky clearly, at 8 to 10 small round shaped white objects moving in formation similar to Canadian geese forming and reforming a triangular shape. My immediate reaction was that it was a flock flying as you always see them. As I watched, I realized they were up by the clouds some 5,000 to 8,000 feet or more, and were colored white, not the usual dark color of geese, and staying very close to the cloud at that high altitude. I watched for some 15 to 20 seconds until all of a sudden they disappeared into the cloud. I kept watching for another 2 minutes or so until the powerful winds quickly swept the cloud away. I kept searching the blue sky for the objects, but saw nothing.

In November of 2007 I had stayed late at work for an extra half shift in which I left work around 03:45, I do not remember the exact date.  I had two events on my way home but only told my family once, most of them said I am crazy. I was driving on a main road fairly close to the West Michigan lakeshore.  I was driving from Holland Michigan to Grand Haven Michigan, heading in a northward direction. Durring my drive, I noticed the area being illuminated with an orange light.  I automatically assumed this was from the sun at first.  I got to thinking about it and it was way too early for the sun to be out. This was around 04:10.  I noticed the orange light becoming brighter and there were some clouds over Grand Haven that were glowing bright orange, there were no other clouds in the sky except the giant ones that were glowing orange. As I was driving closer, I continued to keep my eyes on the clouds.  There were eventually three giant glowing orange what appeard to be thrusters, there was also a shape that appeared, could see the back where the thrusters were and the bottom.  This thing looked like a star destroyer from Starwars! It was huge! The backside where the thrusters were was possibly a mile across, maybe more. The craft was about as far off from the ground as low storm clouds, so not very far. I drove within a third of a mile from being under the craft and it just disappeared. The clouds it seemed to be hiding in went with it. The area also turned completely dark again, it had been brightly lit from the thrusters of the craft. It made no sound. After this sighting, I continued to drive home.  I was already worked up from the giant ship, which was very close to my home.  I continued down a back road so I could get home quicker.  As I neared my street, I saw a pair of red eyes glowing in my head lights.  The eyes were at the end of my street where I had to turn.  As I neared the creature, it stood up on its legs like a human!  It was thin, stood taller than my street sign and was black in color, it was standing in the middle of the road and I could see fairly well.  I planned on turning and hitting the gas to drive past it, however I was distracted by a flash that appeared to be like a camera flash that was in the back seat.  I looked in my rear view mirror to see what it was.  There was nothing! I had only looked in the mirror for a split second then looked back because I had to turn. In that split second, the creature had disappeared. Sorry folks, I know how to defend myself quite well and even have a weapon in the car for self defense, but I was not about to wait around to see what that thing was! I have seen bears, it was way too thin to be a bear. People don't have red eyes and I don't see many people that skinny or black in color. I ran to the door of my house! That was a freaky night!

So much so it startled me and I looked up I saw three lights which really didn't alarm me but it grew brighter in the distance and so I thought oh cool a shooting star then it shot straight up in the air all three of them and turned kind of a golden brown then went back to a bright light again I stood gazing up at it thinking what the heck is this, then it just stopped right in the air and then shot straight across to the left  I did not have a camera on me except my cell phone that I had in my pocket so I grabbed it out and turned the camera part on and snapped the pictures.  This thing shot across the sky stopped again then literally went straight up and at an angel and then it was gone.

While driving w/b on Highway 160 out of Las Vegas I saw 2 lights ahead which I thought may have been landing lights on an aircraft.  It was very windy and the sky was completely overcast with low clouds.  As I drove nearer it was apparent the lights, which looked like white globes, were either stationary or moving very slowly above the highway, and they appeared to move apart as I closed with them.  As I passed beneath them, 6 very dim white lights became visible; four in a diamond shape between the globes (closer to the right globe than the left) and then two placed equally distant trailing west.  Unlike the two bright lights, the light from the smaller six looked indirectly lit, like distant windows appear in the nighttime.  The lights were then blocked from view as we passed beneath them.  My wife was with me but was not in the least interested and paid no attention to either me or the lights. Also, on the drive back to Tecopa I was astonished to find my night vision was restored--the halos I'd become used to seeing around oncoming headlights were gone and I could actually see the road ahead as headlights passed. It only lasted a week or so, but man was that a great thing.  I don't know for sure that it was associated with whatever it was I saw in the sky, but I do know that my vision immediately after I saw the lights was a whole lot better than before.

We were coming back down Kellers Church Road which is the road that runs directly behind my house when we saw two-three distinct lights in the distance.  I know the time was at 5:59 pm eastern time because I had just called my friend Matt.  I thought that the lights must have been a plane whose lights were pointed directly at us because they were very bright.  It was also traveling in a downward motion and to the west.  From our position when we saw this I estimate that the object was close to a mile or two away.  I also thought it was a plane that must have been making an emergency landing or was facing an imminent crash because it was lower and brighter than any plane I had ever seen before.  So before we turned into my neighborhood we proceeded north on Kellers Church Rd. We went over a small bridge, continues, went around one bend to the left then a second to the right immediately after where Scott Road and Kellers Church Rd. meet. We continued trying to eye out the object/plane through the trees and went through a small set of woods and then there was a clearing between that small set of woods and another north. In that clearing we found ourselves to be near an unidentifiable object which I have never seen before. We were slightly to the South West of the object. It was above the treeline of the new set of woods, sitting there, hovering. It did not move in any direction at that point. It was just sitting there. I estimate it was only 150-300 ft above the treeline, which is seriously low. I have never seen any plane or object do such actions. We slowly came to a halt and we were all dumbfounded. This object appeared to be almost a diamond shape, and we were seeing it from the bottom, angled. There seemed to be a dominant light on the front (which appeared the brightest) and two light on the side of the object. Those two seemed dimmer and less dominant. The way all the lights were connected made ! the obje ct appear angular and almost diamond shaped. The car at this point was stopped. I tried to make a video using my sister's cell phone but it didn't come out. There was a distinct point, about 20-30 seconds after we were in awe looking at this object in which myself and Annie (sister to my gf) both felt as though this object/plane, whatever had noticed us and the front light that appeared to be dominant began shifting itself towards us. I freaked out and told April, my gf, to please just go. I had a sickly feeling in my stomach and I had never, ever seen anything like this. She hit the gas and we proceeded through the second set of wooded area and came out 15 seconds later. As we were traveling through the wooded area I kept watch on the object which had a bright light on what I would describe the back of it. At least as bright as the front dominant light. (these light may have appeared more dominant because there were facing us more directly than the other two had). My sister described the top of this object as having a spherical structure to it. We proceeded up the hill which lead to deep run road. We made a right and proceeded to try and follow the object, ended up being more round about of a road and by the time we came closer back to our original location, the object was gone. I could not find it in the night sky. The only object I could see in the sky were normal, blinking, red tinted planes. Planes I could identify normally. This obscure object vanished. I have no idea what happened to it, but myself and the three other people with me saw something we had never seen in our entire lives. This object furthermore had no engine sound. Annie described it as a buzzing, humming sound. After the incident I told many people and was informed of other sitings in the Bucks County Area. Please write back any inquiry or information you may have for us, or if others reported siting the same distinct object in the sky. This testimony is 100% truthful, I want to know if others saw it, if this object was on a radar, ! whatever you guys do to figure this stuff out, please let me know the details of your finding. You may contact me, ask me questions, etc. I will fully cooperate and I am intent on learning of what this was.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,40.3873,-75.1466

Was driving from Clifton Forge to Covington, Va. on I-64 W after getting off work and going to the grocery store.  Weather was overcast, just before a winter storm warning, with low, solid clouds, cold temperatures, and poor visibility. Sky was fully darkened.  Was driving due west on I-64 when I observed from the far left, an aircraft of some kind, which flew from left to right (very south to very north) over the interstate. The aircraft was approximately the same size as a typical fighter aircraft, but didn't have running lights. First off, there were no flashing lights at all (required by FAA), and also no solid wingtip lights, if there were any wings. Second, the aircraft had a distinctly large, bright, diffuse aft glow, orange to peach in color, oval in shape like a figure ""8"" laid on its side but not that precise. This gave the impression of what might be jet engines, but it didn't seem as bright or cherry-red as engines, and was more large and amorphous, less like two distinct circles, like you'd observe on a fighter aircraft at night. Also, there was a fore end glow, rather large but smaller than the aft end glow, also peach or orange in color but less bright, and either pointed-oval or cone-shaped, like a cockpit with the light on. It gave the impression of a structured craft with a general shape of a high aspect ratio cone, but the glowing features were not bright enough to illuminate wings or a fuselage of any kind.  The aircraft flew approximately over Alleghany Regional Hospital, perpendicular to the interstate, over the interstate, until it reached Valley Ridge Road in front of Alleghany High School, where it took a sharp turn westward, to follow Valey Ridge Road. It cut the turn rather abruptly, kind of ""skidding"" through the air and wobbling from left to right a couple of times to overcorrect its path to a straight line before proceeding due west to the right of I-64 along Valley Ridge Road toward Covington, where I lost it. When it cut the right-angle turn, the glow seemed to brighten, but that could have just been me getting a straight-on look at it's aft section.  What struck me was how low, large, fast and maneuverable it was. There is a mountain behind the high school, can't be more than 1,500 feet high. I saw this thing silhouetted against that mountain as it flew off, so it was definitely lower than the ridge. It looked like it had to hand a fast left to avoid smacking into the ridge. Approximately the size of a large jet fighter only larger, and very fast and maneuverable... I'd say the whole sighting lasted maybe 5-7 seconds. There had to be lots of people who saw this, it was over the interstate at a very busy time.  This could be related to some daylight sightings of Osprey aircraft operating in Lexington a few weeks ago. Could this have been an Osprey at night? I don't know. Somehow I don't think so, because if you saw this thing move, it moved more like a cruise missile or sophisticated UAV or something. Also, there was NO (and I mean absoluted ZERO) sound at all coming from this thing. That produced an eerie effect. After I lost it, I looked at my car radio and marked the time as 6:41 PM.  Anyone else who saw this, I'd appreciate your views. Thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

My wife and I were trying to really figure out what this was and were actually joking at first with our kids that it was a UFO.  The joking soon turned to puzzlement as we could not,and still cannot determine what it was. Just wondering if anyone else in the NJ area spotted this?

Clear as can be but very high in the sky above the highway I saw a formation of white dots.  There were eight dots with a line down the center, four on each side, exactly the way a domino with 8 dots would be set up.  Never losing form it slowly moved through the sky leaving a chemtrail looking trail of white dots behind it.  Round white dots evenly spaced making four perfect lines of dots behind it.  The older dots had dissapated leaving just a cloudy white ribbon for miles and the newer made ones stayed as dots for quite some time.  The formation didn't move in a straight line, it slowly turned and twisted a bit and went in and out from a cloud all the while the trail of dots were evenly spit from it. I don't know how long it lasted.  I watched it for a few minutes until I had finally driven past it.  I don't know how many other drivers saw it, it was very visable.

The sky was bright and clear with only light clouds overhead. We were facing south when I told my son to look at the large jet (its color scheme was gray with 4 red engines and red tail) that probably took-off from O’Hare airport and was just passing over us. That is when I saw much higher up more to the left a bright silver cigar shape traveling from S.West to N.East just below the clouds. I said out loud ""look at it, it has no wings!""  So I grabbed my binoculars (7x) from my fishing bucket/chair and stared at it almost straight overhead. It was a silver cigar without wings and was traveling as fast as or faster than a military jet but the next thing that struck me weird is this thing did not produce any vapor trail at all. None. It sped through 2 of the clouds before it was gone from sight in the n.east and it stayed very bright silver until out of my sight. Definitely was not a jet.

I was at a friend's house who has wide open fields out back (he lives on the edge of town) when i noticed an object in the sky.  i figured not to high up maybe 1,500-2000 feet in the air, so i tried to write it off as a stationary object light a light tower or something.  Then i noticed it moved. It was round and had one white,yellow,red,blue light on it which appeared to be rotating around it in the center. (the object itself may have been rotating or just the lights i'm not positive) but anyway i figured oh well and went to sleep. The next day went by normal i was at my friends again but there was no light this time. The next day went by and around 10pm you figure when all lights should be on that are stationary or you'd see a star already there was nothing in the sky at my friends field. I walked home around to notice that this object was now over his field again. (i live about two long blocks away and can see the airspace over his field from a big gap in the treeline) and there the object is. Floating and blinking. i wrote it off and slept again. The next night i was in newburg spending the night at a local hospital with my girlfriend who was ill. Again around 11 at night the same object appeared in the sky and about 500ft higher then i and about 800yards out the object floated (note that i was on a top floor and facing the complete opposite direction of walden. It was a very cloudy night which made me notice it. it was far to cloudy to see stars that night so it had to be below the clouds. An airplane showed in the horizon and the object disappeared only to reappear after the plane was gone. the object reappeared and disappeared in the corner of the horizon floating in and out of the clouds. i fell asleep. The next day i had left my friends house(mentioned before) and we checked the lot behind his house before i left (it was around 10:30pm) we all agreed there was no light no nothing there. But on my walk home just as i was walking d! own my r oad the object had appeared, and alot closer this time just over the line of trees across my road it moved or rather how i would put slicked it's way through the air virtually silent in all ways. Well i'm not going to lie here. i'll admidt it. I ran as fast as i could to try and get inside my home it creeped me out. Now i'm not exactly slow and the object was going somewhat slow when it flew over me i ran and by the time i got to my door i looked back to see it in the gapped treeline again. Hovering in my friends field. me and my brother had checked on it ever half hour and we saw it gonig in small circles and move up and down and left and right. again around the same time. I had forgot to mention until now that also during the week at one point all my friends were outside my friends house (the field owner) and we witnessed two of the same objects i had describes flying extremely close and not to low and not to high virtually soundless zipping across the sky. my girlfriend had researched what i saw and came to here so that's why i'm here she pointed out a case in kingston on the 8th of august that sounds very similar to the object i've seen so i made my report here. I plan to further investigate this. i plan to go out in the field at night on my own with a camera of some sort so i can get really close to this hovering object.

His statement that there is a blimp factory on the NC/VA border is patently false. There is a company with an office in Durham, NC, called Flairships that leases out aerial advertising blimps to various companies, but they did not have any blimps in the air over SE Virginia on the day in question. I contacted other companies that utilize airships (including Goodyear and MetLife), and none of them had a blimp within 200 miles of the James River on that day.  Having seen advertising blimps on various occasions over the years, I can assure you that this was not a blimp. I had a close-up view of it under ideal conditions. What I saw had no writing of any kind on its sides.  Nor did it have a crew cabin on its belly, a tail assembly, or motors or any other protuberances from its surface. The craft I saw was perfectly smooth and silent.  It was also in the range of 300-400 feet long. Even the largest advertising blimps in use today are only about 200 feet long. And they, like the Goodyear blimp, have the company logo prominently displayed on their hull.  Otherwise, what’s the use of having an advertising blimp?   The idea that a blimp might have been blown from north to south by a southwest wind is laughable.  If anything, it would have been blown towards Williamsburg, not away from it. As I said before, the craft I saw moved strongly INTO the wind and was not at its mercy.  And, with all of the empty real estate it could possibly encounter along the river, it chose to stop just opposite a nuclear power station?  That, in itself, is telling. I called the Jamestown airport (which is less than a mile from my house) two hours after my sighting, and the fellow in charge assured me that there was nothing even remotely like a blimp in the air that day. Unfortunately, the local airport does not use radar, so he couldn’t tell me just what may have been flying over the river at noon that day. The “very highly restricted military intelligence community/base” he refers to must be Camp Peary, aka “The Swamp.” This is the well-known CIA training base on the York River. It lies on the other side of Williamsburg about 5 miles from where I made my sighting. Having lived here for the past 15 years, I too have heard tales of remotely piloted vehicles like the Predator drone flying over the base and the nearby York River. But they are never seen over the historic areas or the James River. I know what a Predator looks like, and with its sleek body, long wings and bulbous nose, it was the complete opposite of what I saw. I suspect you could pack twenty Predators inside of what I saw. Having seen this alien craft up close (at first from less than half a mile away) and then at a distance of about three miles, I am absolutely certain that it was not a helicopter, “military item” (whatever that means), or small airplane. I spent 6 years in the Navy and believe my eyesight is still good enough to distinguish helicopters, Ospreys, and fixed winged aircraft from the absolutely unique craft I witnessed. And the idea that I’d mistake an ultralight for a 300 feet long craft leaves me speechless. I have seen ultralights fly over directly my house while out doing yard work, and I’d know their shape anywhere. Besides, they make as much noise as a flying lawnmower. What I saw was silent. In summation, I’d like to add that I’ve attempted to get in contact with Mr. ((name deleted)), as he so obligingly left his phone number, bur he has so far refused to return my calls. All I know of him is that he lives in Virginia Beach, about 60 miles from the sighting area, which, by the way, is home to Oceana NAS. Just up the peninsula a few miles is Langley AFB, a first response base which is tasked to defend US airspace in the event of hostile activity (such as 9/11). This part of Virginia is home to at least a half dozen very sensitive military bases. I am speculating here, but I suspect that the idea that an alien craft could literally ""stroll"" past these bases, at midday, right over the heads of millions of people, and not be detected, much less confronted, and then loiter next to a nuclear power station, is something that no one in the armed forces or the intelligence community is willing to admit to. There also appears to be a coordinated effort to discredit valid sightings. ((e-address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides little contact information.

I was in Loleta California a friend and I sitting in the car. I was looking out towards the ocean.  I noticed a white light in the sky and it was flickering with red and green.  I noticed it was moving. I had to ask my friend if he saw,  what I saw.  He said, ""yes, I see it too"".  We watched this light in the sky for about 20 minutes.  It was a distance away.  We feel it was quite a ways out in the ocean. This object was racing back and forth, up and down. It did a figure 8's.  I know that no airplane could do what I saw this light do.  Sometimes it would go straight down down down, then shoot straight back up.  It went on for so long.  I hoped I would see it shoot off in the sky.  The light just disappeared.

I was lounging on my couch in my apt when the volume on my tv went mute.  I grabbed my remote when I realized I was hearing what sounded like either a rolling thunder or and aircraft.  I live on the second floor and my window was open two away from me.  The volume on my tv returned but I was puzzled because I was unsure where the sound was coming from. I turned the volume on my tv down to mute to verify what I was hearing not from the tv. The sound continued. It had been a clear day so thunder I thought was unlikely. The sound still persist, by this time at least 2 minutes had passed since my tv volume had first been interrupted. Out of curiosity I walked over to the window and there it was. The craft was ascending into the air very very slowly. It was not very high in the air, I would say maybe the height of a police helicopter. But I know it wasn't a copter for at least two reasons; 1.  There was no helicopter sound which I am very familiar with having grew up in the inner city and currently living within a mile of a police station.   2.  The lights on the craft where not at all like the typical search light you see on police helicopters. I am pretty certain that it was circular shape/disk shape. Although it did not seem thin or flat disk, it was thick or tall but it was more wide than tall by far. It seemed black or dark and it's figure was more of a shadow or outline. It had three very dark lights on it. There were two red lights on each end and on the left side just near the red light there was a blinking yellow light. I must stress that the lights were very clear and very bright! I followed the craft rising in the sky with my eyes until it went out of my line of sight through my window pane. I wanted to run down stairs an continue watching but I was in my undergarments. The sound which was jet and thunder like continued to persist. I scrabbed to my bedroom to find something to pit on, but by the time I reached the stairs the sound had ended. What I thought was strange about the sound was that it was quite powerful and was clearly being generated from this vessel however the craft itself was moving very very slow. I immediately sought out this web site because I am convinced that what I saw was an UFO. I live in the city I am used to seeing airplanes and helicopters, and even those small planes that advertise signs and blimps. This was certaintly not a craft I am familar with. It was round and disk like, it's light was unusually, clear and bright, and it flew straight up! Very very slowly.

They then slowly dissapeared and we stopped watching.  About 15 minutes later, we decided to look East again and we saw the flashing lights again.  This time, there were 4 lights.  They all were flying different directions at first, but then then formed into two pairs in formation and flew from East to Southeast.  We heard brief sounds of engines.  Then, it looked liked 2 of them were about to crash, they then merged into one orb of white light.  Then, they all started blinking and some of them turned off completely while others stayed on, and others turned off completely.  Then, all four started blinking frequently but randomly, and all of a sudden, there were six lights blinking in the sky.  For the next few minutes, they all spread out then slowly disappeared at different times.

July 2009 My UFO Experience:  I was walking up the sidewalk/steps to our south facing home on Law St. in Pacific Beach (San Diego, Ca 92109) in 1970 or 1971, I think about 11 to 12pm when I glanced up at a cold clear night sky & saw a large craft the size of a blimp perhaps with many lights (in fact all I saw were the lights, no outline of the object) approaching to my right & slightly to the north moving silently from east to west.  It was being trailed by two fighter jets (I assume from Miramar Naval Airstation or North Island) that were shooting tracers towards it.  This obviously grabbed my attention.  I had never seen tracers other than in WWII documentaries. As the craft came to be directly in front of me (well above the roofline of the house to the north), it turned north on a dime and accelerated & vanished in an instant.  I realized that it was a UFO when I saw it streak towards LA like a bullet & disappear.  The two jets, which I could now hear, continued to follow by slowly arcing to the north.  The pilots had to be as totally mystified as I was. No man made craft then or now could have made that maneuver.  I thought about reporting this to some authority like the police or the newspaper, but it was late & I just went to bed.  I told my family & friends the next day & I combed the San Diego Union to see if anyone else had reported this but found nothing. This is by far the most incredible & unexplainable thing I have ever witnessed, and to this day I can still visualize it like it happened last night.  I have never witnessed a remotely similar event & to my knowledge, no one has ever reported seeing a UFO over San Diego. I have always wanted to notify an appropriate organization to see if an investigation could locate a Navy report which had to have been filed by the pilots, perhaps two per jet. From that point forward in my life I have always had a tremendous interest in UFO sightings, documentaries, stories, etc. I have had a lifelong interest in the manned space program (I  still have an old scrapbook of news & magazine articles about the Mercury, Gemini & Apollo programs) as well as astronomy & the knowledge constantly evolving about the Universe. I loved the movie Contact so much that I read Carl Sagan’s novel which was just as awesome. I have watched some UFO programs on the Discovery Channel & I believe there were several very well documented UFO sightings/encounters near Catalina Island or the Channel Islands around this time.  I have been wondering if there is a connection between those events & the one I witnessed.  I would love to discuss my experience with a relevant organization in the hopes that it sheds new light or somehow furthers our understanding of this type of phenomenon.

It was a beautiful night and the sky was clear, no moon, no wind.  the amount of sky i was looking at varied considerably because of trees, powerlines other houses to include my own.  as I started to walk a blink of light caught my eye out of the west.  I didn't think much of it at first because it was quite a distance in altitude.  But then I saw what appeared to be the same blinking light again only this time it was in a different place in sky.  When I say blinking the light would momentarily go out and it would reappear in another part of the sky. So if you can imagine I was piviting from right to left watching this light make a perfect square in the sky.  So at every corner point it would reappear at the next corner. Finally upon completing a perfect square it shot off to the north at incredible speed to the point it left a shimmering trail that did not last long. The amount of sky that this light covered was to say the least amazing. The speed in which it completed the square no past nor present aircraft could make those kind of manuevers.  I was 13 at the time.  I have since completed 20 years in the Air Force and I can tell I know as I did then as I do know now the dynamics of aircraft.  This was no terrestrial aircraft.  I believe while watching this light I was encountering an intelligence.  This part in unexplainable on my part, but I just felt as if the movements of this light had a purpose.

Like recalling it as if it were a real event. Anyway, I didn't really  give it much thought until a couple years ago. I was at a party with my brother and he brought it up. I don't ever recall discussing it with him other then during the encounter.  When he brought it up I was shocked. I really did think it was just an extremely realistic dream that i had as a kid.  We both shared many feelings about it. The shared feelings are more strange than the encounter in my opinion. We both remember not being freaked out, it was if it was no big deal. After the incident and mostly during it, we did to seem to care all that much. In recollection, that is stranger to us more then the encounter.  The encounter- We were out flying my black kite at about 8PM. We still don't know why we decided that was a good idea but kids do dumb things. As we were flying it (always looking upwards) my string felt strange. I knew it was up and that it was flying. I just didn't feel the kite on the end. It was very strange. We suddenly noticed a large object with multicolored pulsating or flashing lights off to the side where we thought the kite should have been. My guess it was more of a pulsing but its been a long time ago. We should have seen it coming in from further away but we didn't. One moment we were flying a kite, the nest we see an object about 300yards away heading right for us. It was about 50 -100 feet off the ground. It was fairly large.  At first I thought it was the blimp and it just turned on its lights and thats why we didn't see it coming at first. It was moving about 25mph, maybe a little less. As it got closer we looked back at it because we then realized it wasn't the blimp, or even a silent helicopter (as a kid I thought those existed). It was making absolutely no sound at all.  Lights still pulsing around it on the sides. As it got closer it was apparent that it was flattish and sort of rounded or oval. Its surface was extremely black. We strained to see ""its"" surface but we really couldn't. It was solid and not transparent. the lights on the edges sort of curved down the sides to almost the bottom edge.  It was now maybe 75yds away and my kite crashed. This is the weird part. Most people would be freaking out at this. What did we do? We were worried about my kite. I reeled it in as fast as I could but it wasn't  fast enough. We both looked back at the object and at this point it was going to pass overhead. It was definitely lower now. Maybe 50' feet.  It passed directly overhead just to our right. it was perhaps 60-80 feet wide. Still making no sound at all.  All we remember after that was making mention then we needed to get my kite back. So we walked to the crashed kite. It was like we didn't care about the huge craft above us. We walked over to my kite totally ignoring it. We examined the kite and noticed one of the sticker eyes was missing. It probably blew off but we joked that ""they"" took it. Then we decided to look again at the craft and it was a hundred yards or so away moving away quietly. We watched it for a few seconds at most because for an odd reason it didn't matter. We didn't care.  That was the last we saw of it. We never saw it continue its journey away. It was just over. it may have continued or blinked out. I will never now. It left the way it appeared.  This may not entertain some UFO or Alien enthusiasts but we both agreed that we must have created the story in our youth and it became a false memory. Its strange that we both share the  same exact memory, but I am sure its possible.  I decided to send this in as a UFO report because it seems like a UFO encounter. Maybe it really was. I will never know. I wanted to make it public in case anyone else experienced this. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I am not sure of the exact year but it was most likely in the mid 1970's.  I grew up as an Air Force brat and my father was chief executive officer (director) for the Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, OH for 5 years. Therefore, I am and was familiar with nearly every aircraft our military has flown. At the time of the sighting, I lived on a 98-acre farm just north of Denton,TX, and I was a high school teacher. The farm was located in a creek bottom area in a flood plain adjacent to Core of Engineers property. My mail box was located about 1/4 mile from the house on the blacktop road above (elev.) the creek bottom. As I got out to check my mail, the object flew directly over me and across the tree tops in a NW direction. My description of the object and event: Bright fire-engine red heart-shape like a thick, fat Valentine heart (the pointed end of the heart was the forward or leading edge); no visible windows: no noise; no vapor trail; air speed was about 50 to 60 mph; flew in a straight line only, no turns. I am guessing that it flew only about 100 to 200 feet above me and estimate it's size to be in length and width approx. about the same as an F-16 fighter jet, it was in a thick, heart-shape as I stated earlier. I knew immediately that this was not something I could explain or that it was anything I had seen before. I was excited, jumped back into my truck as I watched in cruising away, and raced to the house to ask my wife and a girlfriend of hers if they saw it or heard anything since the object had to fly almost directly over the farm house. They did not hear or see anything. I drove back to the mail box so I could see over the trees and of course it had disappeared. I don't know why I never reported this until now except that I have never seen or heard of a report of a UFO that describes something similiar or exactly what I saw. I know what I saw, it was a perfectly clear day, and it was too close to me for me to be mistaken or confused about its description.

I am a registered nurse holding a masters degree in health care administration. I had just gotten off work and was traveling East on Hwy 64 when I encountered a strange sighting. Around milepost 155 I passed numerous bill boards along both sides of the road, and then there were tall trees on both sides.  All of a sudden around milepost 144,  a single golf ball-sized bright light was centered on my rear view mirror.  It was so bright that it was blinding me, and  I had to put my hand up in front of the mirror.  At first I thought it had to have been a motorcycle, but it was way too close to my window.  Also, it just came out of nowhere very quickly;  one second it wasn’t there, and then the next second it was.  I turned off the radio and rolled down the electric window, but the only sounds were that of my 2001 Buick, and it was a quiet vehicle.  The object stayed right with me without moving for about four minutes. The road was getting ready to turn to the left, and the area opened up on both sides.  An 18-wheeler was coming around the bend, and would be passing me in about 30 seconds.  Right before the truck reached me, the object jetted quickly to the left-hand side of my back window, just out of view of my side view mirror.  As soon as the truck passed me, the object swept toward the truck and then disappeared.  I kept looking back toward the truck, but I never saw the light or a single headlight following the truck.   I then followed the road to the left in the turn, and lost sight of the 18-wheeler.   After this happened, about three minutes down the road, East 64 slowed down in preparation of entering the town of Plymouth, North Carolina.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

I will email the image to ""ufocntr@nwlink.com""  It was a typical spring day in early March 2008. The day started out very pleasant, then just after mid day we had a storm roll through. I remember this storm quite well, because we had a fair amount of Thunder and Lighting, which seemed scared my 2 yr old son. The loud cracking of the thunder prompted him to run over and ask that I hold him.  After the storm had passed my wife took our Dogs out for some potty time, but when she came back into the house she said ""You have to see this rainbow outside"". Much like anyone else this got me curious, so I walked out onto the deck to see this brilliant rainbow. It was the only rainbow I had ever seen that was entirely complete. At that time I decided I should snap some pictures of it, as I thought a complete rainbow was pretty cool to see. I walked around our house just taking random snapshots of the rainbow hoping that I could get an angle that showed the entire thing.  A few days had passed and I decided to dump the pictures off of my digital camera onto my computer. After the process was complete I starting trolling through the pictures that I had taken over the past couple of weeks, and then noticed the rainbow pictures in thumbnail view. I opened the first of about 10 or 15 photos I had taken of the rainbow and started looking at them. When I reached the 3rd photo in the sequence I noticed a bright light under the left side of the arch. My initial thought is that it was simply the sun peering through the clouds. So I zoomed in closer to the anomaly on the pic and immediately said WTF is that! I quickly called my wife over to take a look at this and her response was the same. I was a bit perplexed because I did not see this when I was taking the photos. After further review we noticed that there looked like there was another one of the same objects just right of the center under the rainbow, but it was clearly too far away to be sure. At this point we definitely thought what we were looking at was a UFO.  As you can see in the photo there are 3 or 4 individual round objects (lights) that appear to be emitting this bright white light from the UFO, or whatever it actually is. Also, by the length of the light trail, coupled with the fact that they are so large in the middle of a sunny day looks as though this object is moving up and to the left at a pretty impressive speed. Again, I did not see this at the time I was taking the picture, which leads me to think that this ""UFO"" was moving very fast, faster than the rate of capture by the human eye, and my camera just happened to catch one single frame during its travel. I really do not know... Take a look at the photo yourself and let me know what you think?  Also, for your reference I was facing north east and the sun was behind me, as it was late in the day.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,40.5489,-75.6658

It was the last night of a vacation me and some friends from my university took to an island just south of the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland.  Most of the group was tired from a full day of sight seeing and swimming, but four of us stayed up to watch the sunrise.  We were on a large sand island called Fraser island just of the eastern coast of Queensland.  It was about a half hour before the sun would rise over the water on the horizon, so we decided to wait under the stars.  There was about a half moon so the lighting was dim, not pitch dark.  It was however fairly cloudy, and when the clouds opened up we could see the countless amount of stars behind them.  We were laying back in the sand when my friend Adam pointed out an unusually bright star out over the horizon.  We were all running through ideas of what it could be.  We thought it may have been a star glowing through an opening in the clouds, but after looking at it it was clear this light was below the clouds.  It was unusually close to the horizon and we though it may have been a light house, but we were certain there was no land off the island.  We figured that it had to be a plane or a helicopter, but for a couple minutes the light didn’t move at all.  Shortly after, the light was gone.  We shrugged it off as strange but a couple minutes later we noticed it was back.  This time it seemed to be a little higher than it was before.  I was pointing out how weird this all was to everyone drawing our attention to it.  Then, all of sudden the light moved in a right-up-right motion, similar to Pac-Man.  At this point I started yelling and screaming that this couldn’t be a helicopter, there’s no way this thing is a plane.  I continued to yell “What the Hell is that!? And pointed at it when we all witnessed the light make two motions at an angle down to just above the surface of the water where the ocean met the horizon.  As we watched this white circular orb, it seemed to change shape, kind of elongating in a way and changing to a greenish color and then back to white.  We were watching it in shock when it, as I can best describe, projected itself at us.  It was similar to when a light is coming at you from inside a night club or from a distant laser pen.  We could see the light now coming towards us.  This thing was clearly coming straight towards us at an incredible rate.  I had my eyes fixed on it except when it looked like something whizzed past us left to right on the beach.  It then felt like the light that was being projected toward me was going up and down over my eyes as I was staring at it.  In a matter of seconds, this orb, which was now a dim gray came in quickly, floating just above the water.  It followed the contour of the terrain stay just feet over the water, then the sand, slowing as it approached.  As I saw it coming in, I was petrified in fear.  I was yelling and pointing “ITS COMING RIGHT UP HERE!”  As it came in the four us all backpedaled, completely shocked.  This thing made absolutely no sound, but we were all very aware of its presence.  The air seemed to be electrified, as if there was some kind of electrical charge in the air.  It was about ten feet high, and about 4 feet in diameter.  It looked similar to a disk only flipped up like a tire or a snail shell.  I could clearly see its outline as it approached, but very strangely, I was able to see through it.  The best way I could describe it was as if it were cloaked, similarly to the Predator in the film with Arnold Schwarzenegger.  All four of us backed up terrified, stunned, too scared to run.  As we moved back, the object gradually decelerated to a stop right above the sand where we had just been sitting.  I remember asking my friends in a yelling whisper ”What the FUCK is that??”  I reached for my camera and tried to take a photo of it.  We sat there silently for maybe not even ten seconds, when I could no longer make out its outline.  Then, suddenly a very bright pulse of light above us lit up the beach.  I say pulse because it was very quick, unlike a lighting bolt or camera flash, rather it was a quick ‘bing’ of light that could’ve been missed if you blinked.  The moment after the flash of light, the energy in the air dropped.  DISCLAIMER  **At this point, everything became VERY strange.  I will tell the rest of what happened that night exactly the way it happened from my perspective.  Two of my friends remain skeptical.  To this day I can’t forget what happened.**  As soon as the object was gone, we started asking each other what it was and where the light came from.  Before we could even start to come up with answers for each other, we noticed a group of people suddenly standing down the beach from us maybe 100 yards away.  We started asking each other how they could have got there.  They certainly didn’t walk past us from the left, the only trail down to the beach was behind us, and to the right down the beach the next campground was 9km away.  Either they walked through thorny bushes down from where the resort was or they were there the whole time unnoticed, two very unlikely scenarios.  I just had the most unexplainable event of my life just take place, so I told my buddies that we can’t rule out the possibility that those are aliens…  One of my friends was so scared all he could say was shut up, don’t say that shit.  As we’re trying to figure out how the hell these people got down there, my friend Matt started walking towards them.  I was hesitant to go with but when he got about half way I decided I had to check this out for myself.  As we got closer, I could see that there were 8 people facing the horizon.  They were all standing in two lines, shoulder to shoulder, in groups of two .  We stopped about a rocks throw away and yelled HEY!  As we did this, the two standing in the front and one directly behind him simultaneously did a 90 degree about face, much like a soldier or robot.  One of them was very tall, and was wearing a black suit, the person in front of him was shorter and very fat in the hips, opposite of an hour glass, and another was very short, maybe two feet tall, about the size of a small child.  “WHO ARE YOU? HOW DID YOU GET DOWN HERE”. I yelled.  No response.  They just stared at us with dark faces.  At this point we were pretty terrified.  We had already seen lights in the sky and invisible orbs, now a strange group of silent people moving like robots was staring at us.  We could not see there faces.  They seemed to be looking down slightly and had shadows over their faces.  Keep in mind this is in April in tropical Queensland.  We were all in shorts and T’s laying in the sand looking at stars.  These people were all fully clothed and standing, staring into a dark horizon with nothing to look at.  I yelled out again “WHERE ARE YOU FROM?”  As I did that another did a 90 degree about face and looked at us.  Me and Matt jumped and grabbed each other, not knowing who or what we were looking at.  This figure was holding a small blue light towards the ground.  I could best compare it to a digital camera LCD if a small camera display were on.  We stood there silently when one of the four that had turned towards us suddenly did an about face back to facing the horizon.  We had had enough.  We started walking back towards our other two friends.  We got back to them and started trying to explain how the people were dressed and that they moved robotically, when we noticed one of them was coming towards us.  Initially we were pretty alarmed but I remember thinking well there are four of us and one of him.  As he got closer we could see he was no longer coming straight at us but running a path that would cross about 30 feet in front, perpendicular to us.  He was running in very short strides, chopping his feet behind his body very quickly, leaning forward.  As he got exactly perpendicular to us, he slowly moved an open hand left-to-right  in front of his head at about a quarter of the speed he was chopping his feet, as if to waive.  We were all shocked.  He seemed to have big gloves on his hands and was wearing a scarf.  My friend Matt began chasing after him.  As soon as he got close to him, he did an abrupt 180 and began chopping his feet back to where he came from.  Nobody new what just happened.  My two friends that had stayed behind said that was it, that was just too weird.  They left the beach and went back to our hostel.  Me and Matt sat down in the sand trying to figure out what happened.  We waited for the light of the sun to come over the horizon, and when it was bright enough to look around, the people were gone.  To this day I can’t explain what I saw.  Whatever came down to us from over the ocean was nothing spiritual, it was not a hallucination, all four of us saw it.  What I will say with one hundred percent confidence is that what I witnessed was some kind of advanced technology.  As far as the figures that showed up, I really don’t know.  But if anyone who reads this testimony has had anything similar happen, or can provide any answers I am open to speaking with you…",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

But in climbing altitude was moderate. After about 5 minutes the object could not be seen in the eastern sky. Witness and his wife reported having difficulties seeing well after that object left. They both saw white spots in their vision. And about a minute their vision was restored. The spots can be due to focusing on a small shinny object on a light blue background. Now at about 18:30 they continue to look in the sky at an eastern direction and the first contact of the second object was his wife. His wife told him “what is that!” they both starred at the second object. The second object was moving in a straight line north and wobbling like a top making no sound what so ever. It passed through the neighborhood and that object was seen for about 2-4 seconds by Witness and his wife. They both looked at it when it went by. His wife moved up the pool stairs to see more of the object as it was moving out of sight. Witness stood there in shock and did not seen more of the second object as it moved out of his sight. The second object was seen by Witness for about 2-3 seconds. And his wife had seen the second object for 3-4 seconds. After it had passed by they did not move out of the pool. Then Witness yelled for his father-in-law but he was not home. His father in law is a UFO believer because he had a sighting in the 1950’s when he was a young boy. Of a flat black saucer shape with a top hat look, in the city of Norwalk as well. Witness yelled to his wife’s nephew in side the house for the time and it was about 18:34-35. Witness nephew is ^ years old. Witness and his wife were confused and startled. They both were confused and at first did not know what to make if it. Object 2, was flying at about 4-7 stories high. Speed is estimated at 5-25 miles per hour. The second object was about an estimate 200-700 feet away from their pool and house. Approximate size of object 2 was about 15-50 feet in diameter. The second object was traveling north from the south. The type of object was a Disc or Donut Disc Saucer shape. It looked to be round if not oval shape. The ends or corners of the Disc shape was rounded like a donut not thin like a common Saucer shape. The top was slightly rounded like a dome. The bottom was almost like a donut. With a dent or if not a hole in the middle bottom of the second object. The color was satin metallic dark silver. It had a type of shading to it lik! e if the color would get darker when it would turn or move direction. For example there is a cell phone by T-mobile that is called the Wing. It is blue metallic color but when you move the cell phone it makes its color darker. The second object was like that when it moved as it was wobbling, but a satin silver color not blue. There was no sound what so ever from object 2. The wife noticed a slight glow of red under the second object. Too ad there was no visible markings or windows on object. And I did not look like it was spinning but wobbling only. At about 5-10 minutes after the second object was seen, another object in the sky was seen almost like the first object. A shinny chrome object in the sky wobbling. Going east from west and gaining altitude or getting smaller. And it was gone after 2- 5 minutes. Just like the first object seen at around 18:20. After that no other object was seen. Afterwards Witness father in law came home and went swimming with Witness and his wife. Witness explained to his father in law of what happened. At around 19:30 Witness and his wife got out for the pool and went inside the house and went to the second floor of their room and looked outside. And then ran outside a few minutes later in front of the house where the second object was seen. Nothing else was found that night. All areas of measurements are estimates. Conclusions,   It was either a well advanced engineered aerospace/ U.S. spy aircraft or literally extraterrestrial ufo.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,33.90689037433155,-118.07691390374332

On Aug 18 of 2008, while visiting my friend whom lives just up the road from me I encountered a sighting in which I cannot fully understand. We were visiting in a loft of their garage and my friends boyfriend left to go use the restroom. When he came back he quietly and calmly said to come over and look out the window. Stating ""look who's crazy now"", being he had told me about seeing these things constantly since he was young. Nearly every day from how he made it out. When I came to the window I saw a light pattern that was strange moving in the sky. At this point I must admit I was a skeptic at best, but I do have an open mind and find his stories interesting. What I saw was a light pattern just above the tree line, moving a lot like a plane. But then it stopped, and started sinking behind the trees. Most strange thing was, when my friends significant other said something like ""see, just above the tree line"", it stopped and sank as if it were reacting to his voice. I walked around and kept watching for about 15 minutes to see if it were still there, which a little light was still visible, but it was just behind the trees. What I find most interesting about this is that on this day, Indiana had several earthquakes, which is very uncommon. On top of that, I've heard that Indianapolis airport shut down due to a ""unidentified flying object"" sighted by the tower. I just tonight tried to find an article related to this but didn't have much success. Granted it was a mediocre search in the grand view of real research. But that is getting me away from my story. We return to the loft to go about our conversation and he is telling me that its a totally common event for him. And goes into story after story about his encounters. Most disturbing was when he was telling me that a lot of times people missed these things because as he put it ""they tend to make false noises, like helicopter, planes or jets to throw you off"". That is when I felt like I was in a movie. Not 3 seconds after he got done with the word ""jet"" I hear just that. Like clockwork. He, not being phased by this at all mentioned that ""they"" very well might be out there again.We pop our heads out the window and we see just that. Two this time. I go running outside to see the show and there it is again. He the mentions that the one we saw earlier was right on top of the building we were in when he saw it, at this time comparing notes with each other, and finding out that it moved when I came up. And there they sat, above the tree line, maybe 125 feet high, and they just sink right below it, like a cat trying to catch a rodent. The last thing that I recall seeing was right before they left all together the second one that appeared made an amazingly bright flash, a lot like the one on a camera and off of it shot a little orb that went into a crazy free spin through the sky that didn't seem to have any real pattern to it. And then they were all gone. That was the last thing I sighted this night. I do have one new recent sighting which is to follow in my next report.

I am at work, so I had to do an xray.  When I came back it was gone and has not returned since.  I had one of my skeptical work mates look at it, and all she could say was that it had to be tethered to something.  It was raining here this morning with a slight breeze.

There was a car in front of me but I am certain it did not slow down or had any light changes that might have caused my seeing during the incident. I was driving about 60km/h in an inclined road but not significant enough for any object i saw on my right to descend from the sky about 1 metre relative to me on my driver's window side in about 1 second. My first guess was that it might have been just a plane landing close to me, but there was no airport around that area and there should have been sound if it was, none was heard and it was not windy tonight. On the second time i looked, it was actually a burning ""fireball-like"" object descending so quickly in the air and very far away from me that i figured it was travelling at a very swift speed, descending 90 degrees down from the horizontal. In within 2-3 seconds of watching the descend when i realised the incident was rather inhuman the object stopped in the air for about 1 second as if it knew i was watching, and the fire burned brighter as if it's engine fired up and propelled towards exactly were i was looking at. When the fire was dimmer( something like how a jet plane gets its propulsion force from the burning of fuel but seemed like rocket's engines used in mid-air) i saw an object that looked like the back of a jet plane, but without the top wing which i assumed to be a flat surfaced object with 2 wings and the hole that produced fire was relatively about 70% of that UFO's size. Right after the fire was put out, there was absolutely nothing in the sky. All these happened in within 5 seconds or less and i actually stopped accelerating(not brake) but not accelerating to look over that object. There was no illusion or reflection, because I am a smoker and i had my window down but i was not smoking. It seemed to me it just travelled in an unbelievable speed like breaking the speed of light as soon as i realised that object was not normal. That however, might have been coincidence, but the acceleration it had was definitely not and no sound was produced, not even change in wind, nothing around me changed or moved that was ideal before.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,,

Three lights in a triangluar shaped formation floating over horizon for a good two hours. I was driving to Prescot from Green Valley, on high way 8 with my family for familly dinner, when suddenly my 8 year old son said ""Daddy!, theres' a ship in the sky!""  Me and my wife then looked up to see three green lights in a HUGE triangle, or V formation.  The object moved about every 5 minutes, from side to side, or up and down. My wife, who was frightened said ""Call the police! Call the Police!"".  Sadly, we had left our cellphones in the baby bag at home.  So i stopped the car to look up at the strange object.  The lights were flashing green and they didn't seem to be connected to each other.  But they stayed in a straight line and continued to hover.   About 20 minutes into watching it it climbed a few 100 feet into the air and continued to hover.  It moved vigorously up and down from side to side.  As it climbed, thats lights became whiter and whiter, and soon became pure white.  For a moment, we couldn't see it because of the tree's.  But soon enough it hovered over our car.  It was at a high altitude, so i could not say if it was directly above or not.   But then it started slowly moving west, turning counter clock wise [ which was odd, because it was a triange shaped air craft ].  It then sped off at almost the speed of light maybe 50-60 miles west.  It was just above the horizon when it stopped.   Then another 5 or ten minutes later, it sped off into the horizon disappearing completely. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It is crystal clear however. One star looking object is stationary, and the other is heading directly at it. It happened so fast that it just looks like a streak live.

It cannot have been a meteor or something, as it started large and then must have 'flown' away to move away from Earth. I hope I have helped with something thanks",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

Once we stopped, there were a dozen. Splitting, moving at unrealistic speeds, warping.  It was at this point that we saw what looked like a triangle craft/stealth bomber cover 20 miles from behind us to the west towards nyc in the east in under a few seconds. We witnessed 2 or 3 more of the larger more terrestrial looking craft move to intercept the orb. We were forced to leave, there was an overwhelming amount of energy involved and my friend and i could both feel it. However, we both saw th! em still at it on our way home east along the highway.

Living in the immediate area of the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport, actually in the flight path of the alternate crosswinds runway, I enjoy laying outside on many evenings watching the stars and flight paths of jets/planes.  Also do this at property in Springville, New York which is approximately 35 miles south of Buffalo. On approximately this night, my daughter and I went outside at 20:50 hours to hopefully see a satellite that the local news stations had said was to pass over the Buffalo area around 21:00 hours and be visible with the naked eye. I have always read that a visible satellite was pretty much a constant moving white light that would move across the skies. If I remember correctly, I believe the news reported that this satellite was to move from the NE to the SW or vice versa. Not positive at this point, but I believe this is what they had indicated. It was to pass over at approximately 21:05 hours. As my daughter and I waited and watched, we apparently missed seeing this or just were not looking in the correct direction. We continued to stay outside and enjoy the night sky above. At approximately 21:15 hours my daughter first noticed the following and then I did. We are not crazy and we both know what we saw. What we saw came across the night sky, curving from the NNW to the SSE. In the shape of a triangle were 3 hazy, dull, orange-yellowish colored lights moving/gliding in a quiet, peaceful motion slightly rotating on its own axis. It appeared to be only, say, a few hundred yards above us and well below the night stars in the sky. It was no aircraft, no helicopter, no weather balloon, no satellite, no military crafts, etc., etc. And funny thing is, its path of going to the SSE was basically going just west of the airport, over the Cheektowaga area. My daughter and I looked at each other in excitement and somewhat disbelief with what we both saw. We know we saw something and we are convinced it was an UFO. I for one have always believed in UFO’s and been very much interested in them for years. We did not report this to the Town of Amherst Police or any other agency. There was nothing in the media outlets, papers or radio in the following days after that I am aware of. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

I had been traveling every weekend to the North country throughout the winter, always in the early hours of Saturday morning as I had a second shift engineering job and I would not leave my Massachusetts workplace until 12:30 am.  So, the times of my being northbound on US Route 93 was 2:00 am onward. On the early March Saturday morning in question,  there had been a terrible rain and snow storm.  This storm was typical of the type of late winter storm that occurs in New England.  Because of the weather conditions and the time of night, there were no vehicles traveling, or if they were, vehicles were few and far between.  As I proceeded North conditions remained treacherous.  I had just passed  the city of Concord NH on US Route 93 when the stormy weather suddenly stopped and driving conditions were back to normal.  No slush on the highway, no freezing rain or snow falling.  It was just me and the highway with a smattering of vehicles moving normally in both north and south directions. Suddenly, ahead of me, I saw a strange glow moving south heading towards and directly ahead of me.  This glow was below the very low cloud cover.  I remember I was watching the sky anyways as the storm had just stopped and the driving conditions had returned to normal. This glow was moving very quickly, like a blink of an eye.  Then, the low flying glow became this neon green light.  My view to the sky was keen as the car I owned then had a very large windshield that came up to almost my driving position and provided me with a panoramic view of the sky.  As the green glow quickly came to me, I suddenly saw a large number of what I would describe as objects in the shape of white corpuscles, only neon green.  There were, as best that I can remember, about a dozen of these objects all flying in formation, one after the other passing directly overhead of me.  The last three were abit a skewed to one side but still in formation, one after the other.  I saw these objects fly in total silence over my car moving just under the low cloud cover. My first reaction was to quickly stop my car.  I turned around and saw these objects continue on their southerly direction following the ribbon of highway and disappear into the low cloud cover.  The clouds reflected the green glow. Then they were gone as quickly as they had appeared. I remember thanking God for allowing me to see something that I could truly not explain. I also saw just a very small handful of cars stopped on the north and southbound side of the highway as I was.  I regret not jumping out to talk to these drivers about what we had just seen. I remember this experience as though it had happened yesterday, the vision still fresh in my mind.  I don’t tell people about it as they would not be able to comprehend it.  I have a BSc degree from Dalhousie University on Halifax N.S.  My career has been in Engineering and up until last year I was a Unix Analyst for ten years with a major American investment company.

Shasta and the city of Mt. Shasta California I grew up in Weed, California, Siskiyou County, and heard numerous stories of UFO sightings and in particular, stories from my mother regarding ""St. Elmo’s Fire.""  The sightings of St Elmo’s Fire were always located several miles south of Weed in an area that bordered the then Kellogg Ranch.  Located west of I-5.  My mother described St. Elmo’s fire to be as large as a car, hovering approximately 5 feet off the ground.  The color was always a brilliant emerald green mixed with red/yellow flames.  She stated that the only way you knew St. Elmo’s Fire was coming was because the air surrounding you would become charged with electricity causing the hair on your body and your head to stand up. My story begins early evening October 31, 1981.  Fall was settling in and when I was growing up, November 1st always brought snow; thus, there was a coolness to the air with the smell of wood smoke.  I was newly dating someone who lived in Mt. Shasta, California and I was headed to a dinner party that friends of his were having.  Just as I approached the Kellogg Ranch area headed south on Interstate 5, (which at this date of 1981 had a McDonald’s and a hotel located on the east side of the highway) I felt the crackle of electricity in the air with it being stronger to my right, which would be due west.  I was slightly confused due to this new sensation and as I scanned left to right I saw a huge ball of emerald green fire shooting from the west headed due east about 2/10’s of a mile in front of me.  The ball of fire was as large as a sedan and approximately 5 feet off the ground; just as my mother use to describe it in her stories.  As I visually followed St. Elmo’s Fire from right to left, the mountain, Mt. Shasta was in my line of vision to the east.  To my utter amazement, there was a saucer shaped UFO hovering on the side of Mt. Shasta closest to me.  It was huge, sliver in color and slightly dipped downward on the left side of the UFO.  The UFO was located toward the base in the area we call the ""timberline.""   As I traveled south toward Mt. Shasta, I was able to keep it in my line of vision for approximately 15 minutes and then it shot straight up in the air and disappeared.  The light during this entire sighting was bright enough for me to not misinterpret what I was seeing.  I had hoped that the UFO would remain where it was as the house I was headed for would have had a front and center view of a life time. The house where the dinner party was being given was located almost at the base of Mt. Shasta on the Everett Memorial Highway.  The house is located on the west side of the highway and Mt. Shasta High School is still located across the road from this house.  Upon entering the house everyone was excited and asked me if I had seen anything strange on my way to their home.  Because I didn’t want them to think that I was strange, I told them to tell me what they saw.  They stated that they felt a charge of electricity and when they looked out the picture window that faces Mt. Shasta, they saw a UFO and described it exactly the way I saw it.  None of us saw lights that were lit up on the UFO-could be due to the fact that it was still light outside that none were needed.  I then told them about seeing St. Elmo’s Fire and then the UFO.  My friends apprised me that, though they had never seen St. Elmo’s Fire, they had heard stories of sightings in the same area where I saw it. The four individuals that saw the UFO besides me were approximately 8 to 15 years older than me as I had just turned 21 that April.  Two of the individuals were school teachers and the other two were business owners. This was not the first time I had seen a UFO while living in Weed, California, and the other sightings were also witnessed by my siblings and friends and on one occasion, we even called law enforcement, who did respond, but found ways to discount what we were seeing and what they were seeing.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,41.5109,-122.3648

First of all I dont really believed in ufos, I know there are other life forms but I dont believe the things that are now mostly spreading through the Internet. I do athletics, am very sportive, I just finished a Informatics Communication Technologies study. So common sense and logics are the things I use for the most things of my life. I dont do drugs or any other thing that could cause hallucinations. It is very hot this time a year in Belgium. So like I do more, I open the windows ( 1 roof window, 3 normal windows ) the let cool air come in. This event happened at 4.30 ( was still kinda dark ). So that is from now 90 min ago. I was sleeping and I was dreaming. Nothing special... suddenly I hear a kind of hovering, god how can I describe it ehm Its like: mix the sound of bubbling water with a sort of hovering sound into it. I cant say it more clearly :s ( eng isnt my native language )  The thing is I woke up from this sound, it was not in my dream. I opened my eyes and before I realized that I was awake and looking I saw something near my bed ( floating , hovering but without reshaping the surroundings through air, like you see with a vehicle moved by air ). I get a bit scared while I am typing this ( bring back the memory rather lively ) but I need to tell, type it to let it out of my system. It was a bit bigger then a tennisball and it was making that hovering / floating / bubbling water sound just about a meter from my face. I coudnt see it very detailed. It gave a strong light green light on the surroundings. In a split second when the "" item "" noticed I was awake it moved in a ( like you see in spiral movements of comets etc ) such way past my door ( that was open ) to the right through the open roof window. ( what was open also ). I coudnt believe what I saw and was sure I was still asleep. But how longer I waited and tryed to explain this in reasoning how more aware I was of the fact I was awake ( I pinched myself in the arm, I felt pain, as far as I know you cant imitate that in a dream ) The next 20 min I was more or less paralyzed with fear and trying to explain what I just saw. Only "" logical "" thing I can analyze out of this experience is that I was dreaming when that "" item "" was near me. I will not make further conclusions cause those would only be based on stuff you see on tv smile.gif Like aliens of outer space only explore human life and how they their way of life is by scanning and analyzing the memories of peeps who are in REM state of sleep. ( would make sense cause this way its highly unlikely you could have been caught. I still got goosebumps when I think of my experience (less fear). I am not sure how to process this experience. But I feel a bit relieved that I could write this post. I even took my drink of last night out of the garbage to see if it could cause any hallucinations or any other reason for seeing wat I have seen... I know it can be medical explained when you feel paranoid or similar but this .... ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

My grandmother was also in the kitchen, standing at the sink washing dishes, and her daughter (my aunt) was just off the side using the phone and looking out the sliding glass back door. Suddenly my aunt let out a terrifying scream and was pointing upward at something just outside that door.  My grandmother leaned over and was looking out the window in front of her and terror struck her face as she ran to that door.  They were both just standing there, with their mouths and eyes wide open. Frantically I was asking, ""What’s wrong?  What’s going on?,"" but I couldn’t see ""up"" from behind them.   I knew something was terrible from the frightened looks of their faces.  Finally my aunt mumbled, ""It’s a UFO,"" and I wanted to see too, but I was too scared to look then.  They began talking about the bright white lights surrounding this ""UFO,"" and how close it was.  And just as quickly as it came, it was gone.   By the time I got to the door there was nothing to be seen. Many questions later revealed that they believed it was a UFO because of its circular shape and the lights all around the exterior.  It was unlike anything that was normally flying in the sky.  They said it came real close to the earth; that it was just above the roof of the house and hovered in that one spot for maybe 10 seconds and then shot off like a bullet into the unknown. While reminiscing years later, I brought up that night during a family gathering.  My grandmother and aunt both had no recollection of the event whatsoever.  It hadn’t been that long ago and they both had excellent memory.   I had thought maybe they were joking with me, but they really didn’t know what I was talking about and declared innocence when I asked them if they were just playing a joke on me when I was a kid. I still ask them occasionally if they remember and always get an unsuccessful response. My memory of that night is quite vivid; I could never forget the sound of her screaming, and the looks of shock in their eyes.

Who would I tell and what would they think?  That I’m weird or for the most part why? Why would I want to tell, After finally seeing the Peter Jennings report on  UFO’s I decided that maybe I should say something. I’ve read so many other stories on UFO’s and Alien sightings, but I have never read anything even similar to what I have seen. In the summer of 1988, my then husband and our children set out to a Law Enforcement track meet in Show Low, Az.  My husband was a deputy and was on the track team. After the meet, we rented a room at a local 2 story Motel our room was upstairs and sort of in the middle of the bldg.  The door to the room faced west, as you entered the room the 2 queen sized beds headboards were on the north side of the room and on the south side of the room facing north were the dresser and television. That evening we were all in bed and asleep by midnight, my three children slept on the bed that was closest to the door and my husband and I slept on the bed next to them with	 me being on the west side of the bed. Sometime in those early hours I awoke to see two large size Alien Men walk through the wall coming from the room just south of ours, they walked through the wall, through the dresser and the television and as they approached the feet of our bed, they stopped and looked at me, by this time I was totally paralyzed and terrified,  I could not scream move or alert my husband in anyway, I feared for our lives and especially my children. As these being’s stood there watching me and my family, I could see that both had to be at least 6’5 or taller, they were very muscular but yet very lean no body fat, both were wearing body armor, I noticed their color, one was a bluish gray and the other was a redish gray color.   But these two also had a face like a horse, there mouth and nose came out just like a horse or a dog. As I looked at the one that was redish gray, he looked at me and mentally told me “ its ok were just passing through, after which time I think I passed out. I don’t know if anything happened to us that evening, for what ever reason it took years for me to remember that night, or maybe I blocked it out, I don’t know, but I do know what I seen. I never told my husband or children of the incident, and as I type this I wonder am I doing the right thing. Navajo ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were playing football outside in the street when  when my oldest brother was staring up into the sky. My brothers face was confused perplexed I asked ""what are you doing throw me the ball"" he said ""what the hell is that"". When I turned around I immeadiately looking at an amazing craft hovering very low maybe 4 stories high. I never belived in disc but here was a disc hovering no sound and was glowing in neon blue plasma surrounding it. The disc was flawless as the shinest chrome I've ever seen like a platinum liquid mercury. Standing amazed my brothers told me to get away but I said no way ill remember this day forever and I'm not leaving till that thing leaves LOOK. So I stared into this thing an could plainly see a revolving off white light around the craft it moved in different patterns. Also the craft was messin with my eyes it seemed so close I could touch it. Finally it began to move UP it moved so slow it was like it shrank but was now a small blue dot in the atmosphere then gone.

The dreams had a lot to do with God & Satan but more now than ever I'm attracting people who have had encounters an have never spoke about it. I don't understand truly what all this means I've had a vision that they are gonna reveal themselves to the masses. Hundreds an fleets of crafts an ships are gonna appear and people are gonna panic.

Initially spotted craft on Old Station Rd, and kept observing it as I drove down Oregon Pass.  I saw a black (or at least dark colored) wing initially heading roughly south-southeast.  Wing executed roughly 120 degree turn within an estimated few hundred feet without banking or slowing down, and proceeded over horizon line.  Light arrays looked like running lights I've seen on conventional wings (eg. B-2, Boeing's U.A.V.), but I've never seen a wing turn that fast before.  I've not even seen vectored thrust aircraft turn that fast before.  Speed was roughly similar to twin-engine private jets I've seen operating in the airspace.  No noise that I could hear, but it also appeared to be high and the engine on my truck is loud and windows were up.  As a note, there is an ultralight pilot who flies regularly in the area.  He usually operates in the morning and early afternoon, but I've seen him flying around just before dusk once.  Ultralight is small, low, slow, and brightly colored (mostly white) and makes a buzzing/humming noise when it's close.  It often looks like it's hovering if viewed from a distance.  What I saw was higher, faster, darker and bigger than the ultralight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

Eratic motion and behavior suggest none-human aircraft... First off, I’m going to say that I have always believed in life on other planets. It’s really egotistical to believe that the earth is the only planet in the whole universe that supports intelligent life. But at the same time I have always been skeptical of UFO’s visiting earth. Honestly, I thought that earth wasn’t interesting enough. We’re destroying our planet; we are loosing all of our natural resources, and over all, were not a very friendly species. Why would an alien species be interested in us? Well, my skepticism was tested one night. The day was July 4th, 2008. It was after dark, and we were all sitting in our lawns on our lawn chairs watching the fireworks that people set off over the lake. (I live on a lake) We did this every year, gathered with our friends to party and watch the fireworks. Anyway… Someone had just set off one of those giant fireworks, you know, the ones that shoot up and explode into a flower of colorful embers. It was an orange/red one, if I can recall. As the embers faded and burnt out, I noticed that three embers remained. I wasn’t the only one who notices, considering all of our attention was too the sky from the fireworks, its not surprising that we all saw it. I thought it was really strange; these three lights were in a triangular formation. And just when I thought I was seeing things, the lights began to move across the sky. I thought, maybe military aircraft; considering the formation they were in. But they were far too high up. They were so far away that they looked more like stars than aircraft; beads of light moving across the sky. At some point in time, a fourth light, moving much faster than the triangular formation, raced to join the other lights. They stopped for a bit, then started moving again. They were also moving relatively slowly at the time, giving us plenty of time to gossip about the strange lights. Suddenly, however, one of the lights veered off in a different direction at angles far too dramatic for a human aircraft to maneuver; the light literally took off 90 degrees in the other direction. I watched this light speed off, going extremely fast, until it eventually disappeared; maybe going invisible, or maybe just leaving the earth’s atmosphere. I was stunned. After this, of course, I turned my attention to the other two stars. Eventually, the second of these strange lights did the same thing, but went forward rather than changed directions. It shot off very fast, and then vanished. The third light would just vanish without moving. It stopped, and then vanished. The fourth light, oddly enough, came to a halt, and stayed there most of the night; disguising itself as a orange star. I recall looking back on it sometime later that night; it was gone. I really was stunned. I had no explanation for this. Some would say weather balloons, but they were far too high up, and the erratic change in position and speed could not be explained by this. And unless the government has secretly developed some sort of spherical aircraft, noticed only by one light, that can move at 90 degree or less angles then vanish, I highly doubt it was anything man-made. It baffled me, it baffled everyone else. I really have no explanation for it. I wish I had a camera on me at the time; it would have validated this a bit more; or maybe even a video camera. But with the fireworks, and considering how high up they were, I wonder if I would have even been able to record them. All I have is my sight, and my memory. I’m sure others at the party dismissed it, but I can’t help but feel that there was more to those lights than they all think.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,42.47510648648649,-83.47834486486487

I had just looked up over a pine tree in the front of our house and nothing was there.  I looked back 5 seconds later and was astonished to see the same thing I saw in Mexico and just had told the sighting details to my cousins.  We were all astounded as to the timing of this event.  It just simply appeared and then slowly faded away over about a 30-second period of time.  It was silent, quite high up in the sky, but couldn't say exactly how high.  It was over the Adriatic Sea and did not have a reflection on the calm waters.

The craft was hovering and slowly moving south , toward the airport. From my point of view I could see the red lights of a water tower stand still as this object moved in the background, from one side of it to the other, like it was moving further and further away the whole time strobing the length of the craft sort of giving it a shape it happened this way until about 8:08p.m. when it moved out of sight. About 25 min. later I saw two planes flying in formation which is weird because I never see that sort of thing, except for at an air  show, or on T.V. and the thing about those planes that caught my eye was that they strobed at the same time and stayed at the same altitude, flying the same length apart for what looked like the whole city .

There are so many that I gave up trying to count them (the number provided above is an estimate). Their movements can go in any direction: left, right, up, down, or diagonally. They look like fireflies in flight, with no discernible pattern to their movements. From my vantage point they look like tiny stars, however their light is visible even through a passing cloud -- which would not be the case if they were, indeed, stars. I suspect they are also out there during the daytime but I cannot be 100% sure. More recently I have noticed that they seem to be ""migrating"" east, thus moving away from my field of vision, which is directly north, over the Atlantic Ocean. My sister, aunt, and two nieces have also seen these ""dancing lights"". When I first reported this phenomenon back in August I was hoping someone more knowledgeable and experienced would come see them, but no one did. Pity. They might be moving away.

At first I saw nothing but a high altitude plane, at about 35,000 ft. but then to my surprise I saw something else too. Beyond the plane, higher up, maybe at 60,000 ft. I saw something strange. I put down the lens and looked again with the naked eye, nothing. Again, I looked through the binocs and once again saw the ""thing"" in the bright day sky. It looked like a gold cylinder with reddish top and bottom. My brain could not quite place the object, I was searching for a connection to something else I may have seen before but could not quite understand what it was that I was looking at.The only connection I could fathom was that I looked kind of like a plane rising up into the sky at first, then, it also had characteristics of a kite, but it was tumbling, head over head, in one place. I was confused and amazed, I really could not place this thing...I could not understand in my mind what this was....strange. My friend then told of how he had been seeing these things all week and followed them with the binocs as they moved, often randomly, his girlfriend also witnessed them from time to time yet she never spoke of it and even joked around about her ""crazy"" boyfriend always looking up.

It seems strange that I wouldn't notice something that large in the sky but it was just a tad darker than the sky and honestly not very noticeable. At each point was a white ""star colored"" light. ! These lights were also about as bright as stars. They all flashed in unison. As we drove by it seemed as if we were almost under the object and its depth or height was impossible to determine as were features on the triangle. It just seemed like a large black mass that blocked out the stars. The white box also remained centered in the middle of the triangle so I am fairly confident it was all one object. Amazed and unable to look away I noticed more lights very similar to the ones at the points that seemed to crackle all of a sudden flashing on and off quickly at random points around the perimeter of the object. This lasted about 3 seconds and then stopped. The object just hovered motionless with no noise. We couldn't pull over because the shoulder was pretty short, and a vehicle was close to our bumper. My son was also a witness to this. We passed a bend in the road and lost sight of it after we passed. As we approached Preston we noticed 2 or 3 more of those fire streaks ! far in the distance.

After fighting the urge to do so, I gave up, and got up to go take a look.  Outside the window, there was a spherical ball of light--about 1.5 to 2 ft in diameter, acting in a way that can only be described as conscious.  It was about 20 yards away from me; it was rising and disappearing into the sky, and falling gracefully back down in an arc so that I can only see it through the tall grass.  It spiraled in circles and it bounced up and down, drawing a wave with its movement.  I felt that it was conscious of my audience and that it was acting this way, strangely enough, for me: that it was playing and dancing around to make me feel that the interaction was a friendly one.  I grew frightened of the notion that it knew I was watching, and returned to my room, resolved to shut my eyes and not to open them again until morning.  In telling my grandmother this story in the morning, she got a strange look in her eye: she told me that there had been reports about 50 years back of children aged 12-14 being approached by a spherical ball of light, similar in description to what I saw, as they were walking in the neighboring woods.

The date is an educated guess.  It occurred, to the best of my recollection, on either 10/03/92 or 10/05/92. While flying a Boeing 727 for a major airline, we were enroute to RDU airport, in North Carolina.  As we were approaching the airport from the northeast, I observed something I’ve never seen before, nor since.   We were within thirty five miles of the airport, below 10,000’ and going 250 KIAS or less.  The First Officer was flying the airplane.  While he was flying, I was looking out ahead of us.  We were below a broken layer of clouds, and the sun was still high and breaking thru the layer above us.  Ahead of us, I saw what I thought was a flight of two F-16’s.  The sun was glinting off of *them*, or I wouldn’t have even have been able to see them.  The Raleigh Approach controller didn’t call them as traffic, and I wasn’t worried, as they were a good bit ahead of us.   I looked down to review an approach plate or tune a radio or some minor task, I looked up about thirty seconds after first seeing the flight of two, and the next thing I see is a chevron shaped vehicle within a! n eighth of a mile of us.  It is now right outside of my window, just forward off the left wing, traveling opposite direction, at our altitude.   I think that this must have been what I had previously thought to be the F-16’s.  The chevron shaped thing must have been in a turn earlier, and that the sun glinting off what, for lack of a better term, might be considered end-plates of the *wings* made it appear like a couple of F-16’s (or any other small fighter). As unusual sightings go, this was not a very flamboyant looking vehicle; however, it was a very flashy flyer.  It wasn’t flying along as if it were a *flying wing* type vehicle.  It flew past us, standing on the tip of what you might consider to be its left wing.  So, rather than the wing being parallel to the surface of the earth, it was perpendicular.   I watched it for about five seconds before it passed behind our left wing.  I asked the Raleigh Approach controller: what just passed Airline/flt. # so and so?  I was specific when I asked him.  I stated that it was just to our south, and at our altitude, flying from a generally southwest direction to the northeast.  The controller took a little longer than normal to reply.  He said he didn’t have anything on radar.  Then he waited a little bit longer, and asked if I had seen anything.  I knew it was better, at the time, to keep my mouth shut, so my reply was along the lines of:  no, I guess not.  The controller didn’t press, and I didn’t offer anything else. This vehicle was unusual in a couple of ways.  It flew on the tip of a wing, level (as it were) and didn’t seem to have any problem maintaining altitude.  There was no, visible, means of propulsion.  It didn’t leave any type of trail.  It was approx. fifty feet (plus or minus ten feet) from tip to tip, and from its *nose* to the trailing edge of its *wing* was no more than maybe twenty to twenty five feet.  It was a dull grey, kind of like battleship grey, and there wasn’t anything on the side that was visible to me that looked light lights.  There were no markings at all, that were obvious. Unfortunately, I had been totally taken in by this thing when it flew past us.  After it passed behind the left wing, I asked to FO and FE if they had seen it.  They had not.

UFO Report  Dear Sir;  I was just made aware of your reporting center from a television show narrated by Peter Jennings.   I appreciate your work.  I’m sending you an ancient sighting report for one purpose:  You may be able to compare the description I give with similar ones, or it may stand out as a different one.  The event happened in approximately 1993 or 1994 in the summer.  My son, his girlfriend and myself were in the back yard of my house when the girlfriend said “Look at that” and pointed to a plastic shopping bag that had been kicked up by a gust of wind.  When I looked at the shopping bag my gaze was directed elsewhere and I saw 4 or 5 craft that I consider to be not only unidentified flying objects but non-Earthly flying craft.  The craft were gold in color and incandescent, glowing with their own light in the full sun, with no part of the craft shadowed.  The craft had no windows, flight controls or other appurtenances.  They were identical, about the size of a thumbnail on an outstretched hand, and were shaped very similar to a football with one exception:  The points of a football are centered between top and bottom, but in these craft the points were slightly lower than the center.  The craft maneuvered independently.  I’m not sure of their number because they maneuvered in diverse directions and moved so fast I couldn’t get a count of them.  I watched one in particular and observed it to move very fast, and to make sudden changes in direction, performance unlike any Earthly craft.  All of the craft were located to the south-southwest of my position.  The one I watched most intently moved to just about due west of me and then changed direction suddenly and went back to the south.  All manuevers observed occurred in clear sky with no other background.  The observation lasted only a minute or so.  Eventually all craft disappeared in one way or another.  The one I watched the most carefully went into or behind a cloud.   At that point I queried my other observers and they agreed, yes, they had seen them too.  The area of my observation is a few miles west of the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.  No Earthly craft would likely be in that area without the knowledge and permission of the Phoenix TRACON.  Seconds after my sighting terminated an airliner departed westbound out of Sky Harbor and climbed directly through the same place in the sky that I had seen these gold-colored craft maneuvering.  The airliner made it all the more apparent by it’s difference that the craft I had been observing were not Earthly craft.  The airliner was larger than the craft, moved very much more slowly, and displayed clear areas of sunlit and shadowed areas on the top and bottom of the fuselage.  I had a 20-year career as a Police Officer, was so employed at the time, and consider myself observant and objectively so.  If you’ve had other reports giving the same description, one that I find to be rare among my casual UFO reading, I’d be interested in knowing about them.

I am entering this event for information and comparisons to similar such events.  During the summer of 1993 I was attending night school so I could pass the 11th grade. I had just been at a friends house and was driving to night school. It was night and I was day dreaming as I was driving. I happened to look up and see a plane coming from my right hand side in the trees or low to the trees, or what I thought was a plane. You know the typical red and green lights on the wings. The area is rather woodsy but some what populated and is a well traveled road. As I approached the Y intersection which I was going to take a left on I continued to see the lights. At this moment I thought to myself ""wow this plane is flying very low"". In the exact moment I was in the Y intersection I looked up through my windshield to see why this plane was flying so low. But to my surprise which then turned into a horror it was no plane. Description: Diamond shaped craft. One red light and one green light, at opposites ends of the diamond. A visible line through the diamond (from the small part of the diamond). The size was small and probably as big as a semi truck without its trailer (50-75 feet) max and maybe even smaller. Height above the trees, probably no more than 20-40 feet. Approximate tree height was about 30-50 feet. The color was black and when I say black I mean blacker than the night sky which appeared bright compared to the diamond shaped object. The skin of texture of the object looked like the underside of bark when the little worms dig their little trails but more squared off. It had very sharp corners and the thickness of the aircraft was approximately 10 feet. The moment I acquired the object with my eyes I stepped on the gas. As I was taking a left and the aircraft was coming from my right as I had looked up seen the object and then continued to make the turn. At this moment I was very upset and scared, panicked. So I sped up as fast as I could safely drive and then realized that the object was pacing me but moving away at the same time. Because of the trees and such I could not see the object as I had in the intersection but I could see the lights dimming as I drove down the road. At the next moment I thought that there should be other cars as I was very close to the highway and a second later I saw a car approaching and then the object was to far away to see and it was gone. I was overall visibly shaken from the shock of seeing such an object and the fact that our paths crossed exactly the same time in an intersection. I continued on my way to night school.

We were on our way to Doncaster to drop one of our friends off and it was about 10pm. Looking up at the night sky i was pointing out constellations when accross the sky came a shooting star, however this shooting star stopped dead on the horizon.  We all thought this was strange that something traveling at that speed could stop dead as it did.  My friend from Doncaster was training to be a civil engineer at the time (since passed) and concluded that maybe this was a star that we didnt notice before!!!  I reported what i had observed to RAF Finingley, needless to say they did not take me seriously and cut my information short. We arrived at Doncaster and dropped of my friend and decided to take a different route back to Rotherham Via Wadworth, Tickhill, Maltby (the A60) mainly because it was getting late and my cousin could put his foot down. While traveling towards Wadworth Hill where it goes over the A1(m) we began to notice something to the left hovering over a field.  As we got closer we noticed it was Triangular in shape, Black (but it was night) with lights in each corner and more lights in the centre.  I cant really remember what colour the lights were but i do remember winding down the window to listen for engine noise.  I wanted to stop but my cousin did not. Arriving into Tickhil i managed to get my cousin to stop the car so that i could use the phone box.  I rang RAF Finningley again expecting the same reception, however this time they asked me questions which seemed to be set. I.E. where in the sky, location etc. After getting home i left the subject on the back burner.  A while later, possibly days or weeks i recieved a letter in a brown envelope.  With marking On Her Majesties Service.  I opened it and read a type set letter stating that what i had seen was one of many things: flock of geese, car lights, plane.......

I am reporting my sighting now rather than when it occurred because i am much older and really do not care anymore what people think of me as far as being crazy or weird. This sighting was also called in to 911 dispatch as it happened, so there is evidence of my reporting it. This sighting occurred in the Spring of 1994... It was a nice evening in Las Vegas and my girlfriend and i had been hanging out in our apartment. We both smoked cigarettes and i had decided to go outside to smoke this time. We were on the second floor and it had a railing right outside of our front door and i leaned on the railing with my forearms and lit up my cigarette. I had taken a drag or two when i just happened to look up at the sky at my 2 o'clock position and saw this enormous black triangled craft float overhead approximately 2000 feet up.  The craft moved at a slow and steady pace from right to left.  If it had been a plane it would have fallen out of the sky.The craft made no noise and was PERFECTLY triangular. I yelled for my girlfriend Dana to come outside.  When she came out i pointed to the craft and asked her, ""what does that look like to you?"".  She replied, ""Oh my god, look at that thing, it's huge!"".  I was so shocked by what i was seeing that all i could think to do was run in, grab the wireless phone, and call 911. When the dispatcher came on the line i told her this, ""I can't believe what we're seeing, my girlfriend and i are looking at a huge black triangle floating over my apartment right now!"". The dispatcher, not apparently upset that i called, said, ""really?  You're looking at a UFO?"".  Something to that effect.  I told her i was not kidding that my girlfriend was right there looking at it with me.  I also told her i wasn't on drugs or alcohol or anything like that.  I was just witnessing an unidentified flying object. She told me there were no other reports of the craft and that maybe i should try contacting Nellis Air Force Base.  She also was genuinely interested in what the craft looked like and what it was doing. She never dispatched any cops or anything. My girlfriend and i then proceeded to watch the craft climb slowly up and away. The craft never made any sudden moves or turns or attempted to speed up until the very end of the sighting, it looked as if it was moving faster as it gained more altitude up and away. That's my story.  It isn't the most exciting, but it was a real triangled craft ""plain as day"" and there is a 911 call out there with my voice reporting it. I just can't remember the exact date.  But i'm sure there has to be a way to find the recording. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date of event is approximate.

It has always stayed in my mind as I had never seen anything like it.  I never knew to whom or if I should report it to anyone as I thought that people might think that I’m crazy.  Anyway, I would like to share this story now. Me, my husband and two young children, ages 4 and 10 at the time were on our way to Disneyland in Anaheim, California.  To avoid the evening traffic, we had left our home in San Jose, California at about 7:30 pm in hopes of checking into our hotel at least by midnight.  My husband and I had decided that I would drive as I had been home resting during the day and he had worked.   We decided that he would sleep during the trip and I would awaken him if I would get tired of driving. It was about 10:45pm and we were at least sixty miles away from Bakersfield and my husband and younger child were asleep in the back seat.  My older child was asleep in the passenger seat.  I was listening to music.  I could see in the distant the dark gray of the sky with the shadows of the hills beyond.  I could also see what I thought were city lights in the distance.  All of a sudden a very bright light above the hills caught my attention as it seemed that it was descending in a very vertical manner and quite rapidly.  My first thought was, ""Oh my God, could that be a plane that is falling?""   No sooner had I thought that, when it seemed that it was coming right towards our car and very quickly.  I got scared and began to speed up.  I looked into my rear view mirror to see if other cars were close by, but it seemed that the car behind me was still a ways back.  “The object” seemed to have come right next to us to what seemed about 25 to 30 feet away in the open space next to us.  It zoomed by very low, almost parallel to my vehicle.  It went past us and I remember looking through my side mirror only to see it coming back at a slower rate.  It was hovering and spinning slowly.  It then came exactly parallel to my car as I drove at about 70 MPH.  It just hovered and spun next to me for what seemed like a minute or two.  My youngest son awoke at that moment and I asked him, “JJ, what is that thing?”  I wanted to make sure my mind was not playing tricks on me.  He replied in his four year old voice, “A spaceship!”  Just then it made a final quick and rapid spin and disappeared back into the distance in the direction it had come from.  I was speechless and still trying to wrap my head around what I had just experienced.  I quickly woke my husband to tell him what had just happened and he said that it was probably a helicopter or some military object test being conducted.  I then replied, “A triangular helicopter that spun with white lights around it and made absolutely no noise!”  Furthermore, it was not onl! y triang ular, but the triangle did not have straight lines, it seemed to have inwards curves with many lights all along the curves. I don’t know if it indeed an UFO, but to me it surely was unidentifiable.  I had never seen or have ever seen anything like it.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,35.34399793103448,-119.04089261083743

In October 1994, about the time of my twentieth birthday, I was in my room on Hillegasse street near the UC Berkeley campus.  I looked out of the window and saw a blip of light moving erratically in the sky.  In a moment, it went away.  I wished that it would reappear, and when I thought this it came back, this time moving in seemingly controlled, deliberate movements, as if it returned because I knew that I wanted it to return.  It seemed as if it had a message for me so I said, “Yes”, obeying it. The sighting seems to be related to an aberration that I heard on my radio, listening to BBC News as I fell asleep the night before I switched on the TV the morning of September 11, 2001 to see the horrors of the disasters in New York City and Washington DC. In November 2001, I was on the light rail in San Jose, when someone technologically assaulted me with a weapon in a pager case.  The weapon flashed rays in my eyes, and the person who assaulted me said, “I forgot”.  The rays reminded me of the acoustic aberration that I heard on the radio that night before the morning of September 11, 2001.   I now know that this person was being used by Fujisankei communications in New York City as a caricature to make money, and by the people of Fujisankei to pass for White people in what is left of South Africa’s apartheid. I have had some difficulty in expressions about seeing and hearing thunderstorms. I have witnessed a more constant point of light in the sky when I was in the Philippines in 2005 and upon my return to the United States in the years since that visit. After the change in the government of Iceland in February, I contacted the Consulates General of Great Britain and Chile in San Francisco, concerning Stonehenge and Easter Island in relation to the 1994 sighting.  Before reaching the consulates, I had only watched Fujisankei on Channel 26, but after my contact I found that Fujisankei was broadcasting on another channel, 60 digital 2, so I have the number two from the rongo-rongo tablets.

We leave our trailers in a state camp site a few miles from the Bay.   One evening around late October 1994 we saw what was by definition was a UFO. The campsite was deserted but for my dad and me and a friend who had gone to sleep in his trailer.  The moon was bright and we were standing outside listening to the geese and ducks being loud and obnoxious.   I noticed a white light about 30 degrees off the horizon.   I told my dad it might be a planet, but it stayed there, and as our eyes focused it flickered like a flame.   He went to get binoculars and I went to the observation stand which is about 20 feet higher.   Thru the binos it looked like a white flame flickering over open water, you could clearly make out the shoreline with the moon light.   We watched it for a few minutes; my dad speculated it was a gas well, then maybe a reflection of one.  I told him there were none there. He walked down and woke up his fiend in his trailer.  Thru the binos I could see a white mass that appeared to flicker like a camp fire from a distance.   Dad’s friend joined us on the observation tower and was clueless as to what it was, then out of nowhere a smaller light appeared next to it, they then started moving back and forth along the water line.  My dad said they might be helicopters looking for someone.  But helicopters don’t make pin point turns like that and have spot lights which look like flames.  After only a minute or two of that, they started heading out over the bay, we lost sight as they took a high speed route straight away from us. Sometimes now we mention it and pause and some says, what do you think that was, but no one knows more than the other.  It was an unidentified flying object, that’s all I know.

However, some days later I did discuss the ‘sightings’ with a coworker who resided in Akron and found that she too had seen a similar array, and was able to describe them as I had seen them. The sightings occurred after dark at approximately 9 p.m. The road I was driving on runs true north/south.  I live in a small city of 22,000, and the mercury vapor streetlights were on.  I was driving north toward my driveway when I noticed lights in the rear view mirror. The first thought was they were police lights – flashing red and blue, that they were at a distance since they were obscured, somewhat blurry, and their were several of them, perhaps seven in a group. By instinct I pulled to the side of the road to avoid the passing (what I thought must be) police cruisers, but there were none. I looked again and the lights were there having not moved. I parked in my driveway and exited the vehicle. Looking due north I observed a flickering group of seven lights in a formation that appeared to be hovering at the horizon what could have been several hundred feet in the air. They moved a bit in an easterly direction but generally were stationary. I heard no sounds of any kind from that direction, and probably the objects were too far away to have been heard. I observed the lights for fifteen minutes, excused it as swamp gas, and drove the car down the driveway and put in into the garage. I did not mention it to anyone, only several days later in conversation with an individual I worked with the topic of some strange lights came up, and she too had seen them. She described them as I had seen them, only she saw them to the north from her home in Akron, Ohio – some thirty miles northeast of Alliance. Multi-colored hovering in a group moving slowly. We ‘thought’ perhaps the lights might have been over Lake Erie, but Alliance is too far south from Lake Erie – sixty miles, the curvature of the Earth too great – yet she observed them north of her location. I thought at the time the lights were swamp gas above the now closed Superfund site at Willowcreek, at the intersection of rt. 224 and rt. 225 in Portage County, Ohio where several large landfills are located. The intersection is about eight miles north of Alliance. Nothing ever was reported in the local newspaper, The Alliance Review, but that is considered not surprising as it would have been considered bad for advertising and well beyond the scope of the newspaper. The lights shimmered, were round but the edges were obscured and fluctuated. They were brightly colored white, red, and blue. A resemblance would be when a very bright light is refracted through heavy crystal or diamond resulting in brief flecks of pure color. The objects did not wisp away and were not dissipated by winds, but did seem to move in a slow easterly direction. They were totally silent. I have never been able to explain what they were, except to say they were U.F.O.’s. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The three of us were by ourselves and our parents and other siblings were inside doing who knows what.   ((name deleted)) was irritating me by jumping right next to me and I started to wrestle with him meanwhile my sister is laughing at us sitting on the other side of the trampoline.  It was a pretty clear night with just a few clouds in the sky with a gentle breeze which I remember clearly because it’s so humid in Florida and it was one of the few evenings as a child that I was unsupervised and outside to enjoy the sea breeze.  The next few moments are hard to describe put I will do my best. Their was a bright flash of light so bright that I was blinded momentarily to tell the truth I’m not sure how long it seemed like a long time but I’m sure it was only seconds. It was almost like a strobe light you know how everything seems like it’s in slow mo.  After the flash, it looked as if a bright ball of light fell in the woods maybe 30 or 40 feet away from the trampoline.                                                                     My sister, ((name deleted)), and I were stunned.  We scrambled off the trampoline and raced to the backdoor. Enroute I saw 4 different colored lights blink in the woods. (Yellow, blue, green and red) After that I heard a strange noise that’s even harder to describe it was like a metallic computer sound with one beep after the other with each beep a different pitch. By this all happened in seconds I think. By the time we had heard and seen the different colored lights and the beeping noises we were at the back door pounding on it for someone to let us in. Meanwhile there was a rustling in the woods which could have been a dog or other animal but I’m just not sure given the other things that had just occurred. Matty’s older brother came and opened the door maybe a minute or two after we had started pounding on it and we all rushed into the! kitchen The three of us were hysterical and proceeded to report the events that had just happened to matt’s brother and then told our parents who of course could not say what had happened and made it seem we were making it all up which to this day bothers me that my own parents think it was a prank or that we were flat out lying. So I hope that this may help someone else who has seen something similar to me experience.  Thank you for your time. ((initials deleted))",2009-08-05T00:00:00,30.462935377358487,-87.26545408805032

The property I was on is situated on a peninsula on the westcoast of Zealand, Denmark. Overhead is an air corridor I think, because you often see passenger-jets crossing west-east og east-west.  At almost 2.am I spotted a jet on an eastern course at an altitude of maybe 24.000 feet. I followed it with my eyes having nothing better to do. After a couple of minutes I took my eyes off it and lighted a cigarette. When I looked for it again I saw the following: Maybe 20 km away and above the city of Kalundborg in the eastern sky close to 'my passenger-jet' was a light as bright as Venus, but it was moving and swelling. 'My jet' suddenly switched on its landing light, which couldn't match the light from the other craft at all. The passenger-jet seemed to make a rapid move to the right, whereas the bright light almost danced around it on its left side. And it was still swelling now with a milky halo, which again were surrounded by a white rim. In size it would still be like Venus in all its might, but the halo around would be ten times wider. The passenger-jet just looked like a jet with its light turned on. The strange craft seemed to almost lock on to the passenger-jet...as if the jet couldn't get away from it. I was quite alarmed by this and was thinking: so now it happens. Suddenly the lights of the strange craft went out and nothing was to be seen of it. After five seconds the passenger-jet turned off its landing light. For all I know it could have been an advanced military craft getting too close to a passenger-jet, whose pilot in panic would have turned on his lights to warn the other craft. But two things make me wonder. 1. My own immediate reaction. I've seen strange crafts before and have been puzzled. I've even reported my sightings to you twice. But I am still a sceptic and search for at rational explanation. But this time I felt a deep fear. 2. There was a blackout at the hospital of Kalundborg that night. It happened at the same time as the strange craft were immediately above the city. My sister works at night on that hospital and has been for 20 years. She told me about the blackout the next day. And said that they had never had a blackout before and for the first time they'd had to power up the generator. I reported this sighting to the danish SUFOI (Scandinavian UFO Information), but they managed to lose my report, which they have apologised for, but I don't really trust them. I wanted the report posted in Denmark in case the pilot on the aircraft were Danish. He might have checked to see, if anybody had observed something from the ground. I still wonder about the incident, so I decided that the right thing would be to mail it to you.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

Like most people I have been skeptical about this subject, but after observing what I saw on July 23, 2008 at 10:10 pm, I definitely have more than an open mind on this subject. My boyfriend and I had just left from an evening of dogsitting.  As we got to the edge of Lagro, (called ""old Lagro Road"") heading west to Wabash, I had dozed off only to be awaken with a nudge on the shoulder and him telling me ""Look at that, did you see that"".  I then looked out my passenger window and saw nothing. He slowed the vehicle down, but there was nothing I could see. As we got to the edge of Wabash (a very curvy area) straight out in front of us was a amber orangish light that was only visible for about 6 seconds and faded or burnt out.  Now, upon entering Wabash on E. Hill St., we entered town.  Sitting at a stop sign at Hill St. and Wabash St (where the courthouse sits) we proceeded across and noticed, just above the treeline, about a block away this light had reappeared. Let me explain that after observing the light previously, this light then split into five lights, estimating to be at least a quater mile wide. The lights then one after the other faded out.  We then proceeded to an open area on the edge of town for an unobstructed view. Upon getting out of our vehicle, we noticed numerous aircraft in the area of the sighting, only to be followed by military jets.  As a matter of fact, we are only 25 miles from Grissom Air Reserve Base, in Bunker Hill, IN.  These jets were low, and at a high rate of speed and seemed to me they were aware of the lights. I have never experienced anything of this kind and was in shock at first. We were silent, then went home and sat in the kitchen in silence for at least an hour.  The night's events were then attempted to be discussed, but I was not ready.  That is why I am here now, because I am ready to share what I saw.

I believe 100% his story and observation as he is a very credible and responsible person. My brother who works for my company overseeing my night operations of my business got off work at 3AM. He lives in Maricopa so he travels from Phoenix to his home driving I-10. At around 4AM while traveling eastbound on I-10 as he approached the queen creek exit in Chandler he observed a dark diamond shaped object to his left rise up from a field about 100 feet and it then headed in a easterly direction towards casa grande. My brother said he was driving about 75-80 MPH and there were a few other cars on the road. He said the object made a few moves that made him think this was not a known civilian or military aircraft. It had 3-4 lights similar to navigation lights and it moved faster then his vehicle. He guessed it speed to be around 100-125MPH. He turned off his exit to queen creek/Highway 347 and proceeded on to the Town of Maricopa where he lives. He did not see the aircraft anymore once he left the Interstate freeway. I have lived here since 1996 after getting out of the military. I was in aircrat maintenance for F-14's and have been exposed to many types of military aircraft. What he described and its movements and speed along with no typical aircraft sounds associated with a jet engine aircraft or any normal chopping sounds of a helicopter type aircraft I conclude what he saw was either extremely new military technology not yet known to the general public or it was a UFO. I know there have been many unexplained events and sightings in the Phoenix area since I have lived here. Bottom line, I believe my brother saw exactly what he described as described. In my opinion, there has been to many sightings by too many people of various types of aircraft doing maneuvers that are just not known to be capable of modern aircfraft both military and civilian. Our current aircraft designs and more specifically, their power plants do not a! llow for this. Even a Harrier jet can not stop on a dime and hover, and when it is hovering, it is very loud because of the nozzel thrust it produces in the downward position.

My first thought was a plane.  As a few moments passed my second thought was helicopter. There is a small airport as well as a hospital a few miles from here.

Still waiting to hear the sound of the engine  or the rotors  in a few more moments it will break the tree line into open sky. The instant it broke into open sky I knew. This is something  amazing. A extremely bright twinkling light traveling on a straight flight path making not a peep. Moving slow and steady like a satellite but super  low.  At that instant I turned  and opened my screen door reached  in onto the kitchen counter and grabbed my  video camera. Turning back through the door I turned the camera on and started shooting.

Me and a friend were walking through park and talking about a new business venture we were investing in, and it was at night we mostly conversed because at those times there were no interruptions or phone calls. It was calm, warm, and the sky was crystal clear, and I noticed some unusually bright star in the Northern Horizon, about two hands high if measured by my hand. This star was active with red, blue, and green flashes normally associated with some stars we see at night due to our limited vision and anomalies associated with planets such as Mars or Venus. I joking said to my friend ..``LOOK`` `THERE IS THE MOTHER SHIP`.. I stared at this anomalie because I never seen such a bright star in  that position in the Horizon before, and much to my amazement I saw a single star, moving from the West sky towards this bright object and it stayed in a motionless position for just a second, went out and than reappeared at a distance closer to the flashing star that was positioned in the North (the bright colored flashing star like object). The much to my amazement and surprise I seen another star from the east, one from overhead, and a one from beneath this Colored star doing the same thing as to appear, then dissipate (unlit), only to be positioned closer to what I will call the mother ship until the lights went and they became one. In the Western night sky I see the same type of colored star but t did not move so I did not know if it was a UFO or planet. To this day my friend will not talk about it, and I do not feel surprised or shocked at what I saw. I have has different experiences with unidentified objects in the past, and near my city, we have the CFB forces Moose jaw air base only 50 miles away. I will submit my experience with what I thought was Stealth technology in a different forum.

It was VERY big and was hanging like a thin black mirror in the sky, point down. This was the second UFO I've seen in my lifetime, and this one made me feel very afraid.  I think because it was so large and so black. Next, the triangle began to rotate, with the point of the triangle going up and the other points turning in a clockwise motion.

As I lay there, I was on my left side facing a large double window a few feet away. As I lay there a large triangular craft passed over the roof of my unit passing over the roof of the the units directly across the courtyard from where I was and then I lost sight of it. I would estimate the altitude of this craft to be no more than five-hundred feet and it was traveling in a north-easterly direction. It was moving slowly and I estimated the speed to be in the neighborhood of thirty-five miles per hour, give or take. I didn't make any sound that I could detect. I would estimate the size of the craft to be about three-hundred feet on a side; maybe a little larger. Although this happened in the middle of the night, the sky does not get really dark here because of all the lighting in the area so I saw the craft fairly well. It appeared to be flat-black against the lighter sky and there were low intensity lights at the points of the triangle. There were no visible windows that I could see but I only had a view of the bottom of the craft. The best way I can describe the movement is that it appeared to just slide effortlessly across the sky rather than fly as would a conventional aircraft. I told one other person who lives in the community about the incident but I could tell I wasn't believed so I kept it to myself. I would have reported the incident to a Government agency but I know how that would go so I didn't bother. I can state that this craft did not depend on air moving over the surface to keep it airborne because it was traveling far too slow for that to be a factor. I can also state that whatever technology this craft possessed was far advanced to anything that I am aware that this country or any other country currently employs.

Sunset was at 7:11 and I was situated at Latitude: 35°32'4.77""N and Longitude: 117°32'43.80""W I got the sunset time from the internet. I got my camera gear out and got it all set up so that I could be ready for anything. I sat down in my easy chair until it was time for the stars to start showing themselves to the world. One by one they appeared. If you are not fast while you are watching for the stars, they will sneak up on you. Looking at the First Quarter Moon that was to the south of my vantage point, there was a bright star/planet that showed up to the east of the moon and just a little higher in the night sky compared to the moon. It was very bright and steady. I turned around only to find a brighter star/planet on the horizon where the sun had just set. When I turned back around, there was a second star even farther east of the star that was near the moon! It too was bright. “sorry, I only know that a planet does not twinkle and stars do” I don’t know the names. Anyhow, I started my scan around the heavens to see what was appearing and by the time I got back to the bright star/planet east of the moon, I noticed something very odd. The star/planet to the left of the one that was near the moon was now GONE. One minute it was there and the next minute it was gone. I know it was not a plane as it just sat there in one place when I first noticed it. As the evening progressed, I noticed two objects passing on by. One of them looked like it was headed towards LA and about a half hour later I saw one that was headed north away from LA.  Ordinarily I would suspect that they were planes, but there were no strobes on these two objects that looked like stars passing in the night sky. Even though there was no strobe to them, I just noted them as planes. Same speed, no deviation whatsoever. It was about 8:30pm when I looked to the north and off of the big dipper to the right, I noticed this light. This light started to get very bright and all of a sudden, I had surmised that this thing was coming right at me. It just kept on getting bigger and bigger. I turned around and grabbed my camcorder and stand as a complete unit, and when I turned back around, I had to say to myself, what’s the use. It, by the time I turned around started to get smaller again. So I just stood there watching it as it eventually disappeared. This object did not go up, go down, go from side to side or anything. It was as if there was a very high candle power light that was being turned up and then back off slowly. This lasted for about 15 seconds. I have no idea what it was, but I can finally say: I have seen something in the nights sky that makes no sense to me. Twice… In one night… A disappearing planet and a light that made no sense. I would go back out again, but the bugs are so bad as the sun goes down that I did not have fun due to these bothersome critters. I was so busy swatting them that I lost sight of the fact that Rattlesnakes were out and about.  A video that is called ""Contact has begun"" with James Gilliland. I had never seen it before and I did not know it was James in this video when I downloaded it. I only downloaded it because of the title.

The light did not blink, so my first thought was that the object was the space station flying overhead.  It had been a few years since I've seen the space station overhead, so I was excited to see it again.  But then I realized that the trajectory was not they typical pattern the space station orbits over the earth.  As I began to realize that this object was possibly not the space station, another object with a flashing light akin to an aircraft or fighter jet began to follow the first object.  It sped up as if it were trying to catch up to it and then when it got to a certain distance from the first object, it locked in the same speed and maintained its course and distance with the first object.

This could have occurred either over Fort Bragg or Pope AFB or just to the north of these military installations.  I am located about 2 miles south of the Reilly gate of Fort Bragg.

Location: On the water north of Foul Weather Bluff which is the northern-most tip of the Kitsap Peninsula in Puget Sound. It was approximately 100 feet north of this Bluff. Shape: The shape of a bowl facing downwards on a small plate. Size: Approximately the size of 1/2 of the moon when seen very high in the sky. Another reference point is that it was approximately 1/2 to 2/3 the height of the bluff (Foul Weather Bluff) just south of it from sea level. Its width was approximately 3 times greater than its height. The fact that it was lit up was taken into consideration in estimating its size.  It appeared to be huge because of being lit up and with it's reflection on the water. Lighting: Lit up with diffuse light, not dissimilar from the moonlight. Another way of describing its lit-up appearance is that it was similar to the light coming from an off-white or light-beige light fixture. Both observers are professionals with advanced degrees (M.A and PhD), both have taught at the universities and have never seen anything like it.

I sat there for about fifteen minutes, I was already sick and I felt ...as crazy as this sounds... an external 'annoyed/go inside/getting sick' that wasn't my mind or emotions. As if something was annoyed at me for being so reckless, sitting in the cold while sick. It suddenly got urgent. 'Go home' I literally heard. As if I was in danger sitting there, beyond getting the flu of a lifetime. (I know this sounds like a prank and I feel crazy for admitting I heard/felt that, but you wanted to know everything...) I walked home and as I stood on the driveway, I had lost my key and I sat down outside. I sat there for about five minutes, waiting for housemate to finish putting baby to bed so she could let me in, and I saw something. It was about fifty metres away, the size of half a penlid, and coming diagonally towards me.  It was heading straight for the park.  It was a saucer shape, had some lights... that blurred in my eyes so I cannot say how many but some were larger than others... and I suddenly felt like it was lookingfor me, expecting me at the park, and that I HAD to get indoors. It made no noise, even though it was low down, we have planes that cross over much higher that we can hear (They don't follow the path it took and they are much much higher, always the same route for them.)... it was close, low, and it was upwind, but I still heard no sound from it. I got inside as soon as I could and even though I felt scared, I for some reason went to my room. I lay down. I woke up about 23:00, feeling like I had woken from being under general anesthetic (I had surgery in 07 so I remember the feeling well), all groggy and strange.  Soon I went back to sleep and slept it off. We see many planes going over us but none follow the route this UFO took, they are all heard easily, and they never come down as low as it was. I've seen one UFO before this, but I can't remember what date it was as I was a child, and a strange event happened to me when I was about three or four years old. A huge flash of light during a thunderstorm and more... sound, something outside... but not a lightning bolt (see below), I was scared suddenly beyond anything I'd ever felt(even though I had been watching the storm for about an hour and was used to the lightning), I thought lightning had struck the window... it was that bright, that incredible. I assumed it was a lightning strike outside the window because of the sound/something there... But when I went to parent's room, they hadn't heard or seen a thing. From that day on, I was scared of one type of alien only. ALl others I liked to watch in movies... not that we really watched any at that age...but from that age right to now, I cannot watch sci-fi movies with one particular type of alien. It wasn't that I'd been exposed to alien movies as a child, I was only a toddler... it just always was, I always knew about them, I literally grew up knowing, like I know that there are lions in Africa type of know. It's only recently, since I moved out of that house and bedroom, that I allowed myself to think it was more than a lightning strike.

I live in Norcross, Georgia.  This sighting was on Sept. 31 2008, I was walking down Holcomb bridge road coming from Peachtree Corners/Holcomb bridge rd. area  heading toward the intersection of Holcomb bridge rd. and Jimmy Carter Blvd. As I was approaching the plaza/parking lot where Blockbuster and Papa John’s Pizza is located, I notice a huge black object in the sky directly in front of me.  It was hovering over the area where Peachtree Ind. Blvd. and Jimmy Carter Blvd. intersect.  The object was shaped like a “Blimp” but much bigger! The outline of this object was easy to see, but the actual body appeared like a “ink smudge” no real texture (wasn’t solid)(The object was a little higher than tree level) As I was looking at it, I notice a young man coming toward me,and I stopped him and pointed to the sky and asked him did he see that and if he knew what it was.  I wanted to make sure I was not seeing things!  The young man turned and looked up (it was behind him) and he could not explain it either.  He was the one that pointed out something that was hanging down toward the back of it. We talked for a few second and he continued on his way.  Once I focused on the rear end of the object, it was then that I was able to see some sort of ‘wavy like aurora’ somewhat smoky looking around the back area.  I continue to watch it as I was walking (not very fast), when I got close to the CITGO gas station I notice a small airplane coming south down Peachtree Ind. Toward the object.  I stopped and waited to see if the airplane was going to change directions or something to avoid running into this object also I wanted to compare the size of the airplane to the object. The airplane was coming from my left as I faced the object toward its front end.  I could clearly hear and see the airplane but when the airplane approached the object, (the objected did not move) it passed thru the top portion of the object!!  As it flew thru the object I lost sight of the airplane, but I could hear it and I stayed focused until it emerged from the other side.  The airplane continued south on Peachtree Ind., as if that big black object was not even there!!  By now, I am getting very confused about what this thing is and I wondered if the people driving could see it!  I start walking again still looking at it.  I was walking to the Chic-fila on Peachtree Parkway and I usually walk thru all the parking lots on Holcomb Bridge.  When I reached Holcomb bridge rd. heading toward Panera’s, I start loosing sight of it because of the trees.  When I came to the first parking lot where RBC bank is at, I looked to my right and there it was!  I almost felt as though it was following me because I do not walk fast and I figured it would be gone by the time I get from the area with all the trees.  The object was now flying north on Peachtree Ind. Blvd., heading toward Duluth!  I watched it pass the Holiday Inn Hotel; at Holcomb Bridge and PIB it then started to pick up speed but continue flying along PIB. I watched this object until it looked like a black spot in the sky.  After it got up in the Duluth area, it appeared to stop at the bottom right of the sun!  The sky was blue and free of clouds this morning and this object was completely black.  I know people traveling up and down PIB had to see it.  Anyone in Chic-fila’s drive thru, anyone coming in -out of Paneras had to notice it. It was large to miss!  If anyone seen this Object that morning please report it, I would like to know what it was.  I have never seen anything like this before.  It was Strange & Scary!

This object seemed to be about the same height that a  small propeller driven airplane would be, and travelled about twice as fast. Then about 3 weeks later, I was out at about 5:30 or so in the morning. I saw an object travelling South. This object was the same shape as the vee, only it had lights. One light was in the center, while the other four were equaldistantly spaced outward on the vee. These lights appeared to be on the rear side of the object, as it was moving away from me and the dark shape of the vee was in front of the lights. I should mention that the lights were not bright, in fact they blended in with the starlight all around quite well. The object, when I saw it, was at about a 45 degree angle for about 2 seconds. Then it leveled off and went south for about 2 seconds until that same tree obscured my view again. Once again, there was no sound.

There were four of us, and on a side street we found three more people watching with binoculars.  I looked through the binoculars and could see the circle was made up of a circle of lights.  They'd been watching longer, and said initially it was closer, and sparks were coming off and falling down (though it was still very high up).  The light was intense red, but seemed to be going higher up instead of moving on a northward path as we thought it was at first.

My father, mother, and I had just gotten home about 1:00 am from an auction.  My parents went to bed and I stayed up to watch TV.  I noticed a bright light outside our front door.  I went to the door and looked out expecting to see a patrol car making rounds, or something to that nature.   What I saw was absolutely amazing.  I will try to be as precise as possible.  The craft was about 200 feet in the air above the field and an adjacent house.   The shape was circular and rotating.  I immediately called my mother in to see the object.  She was speechless.  There was no noise.  There were several lights, however, it was more of an ambient light that what you would expect from a flying craft.  It was not the beam lights from any sort of spotlight.  The craft was at least the size of a football field and was not completely smooth.  There appeared to be several points on the underbelly and even one that lo! oked like a platform.   As we observed it rotating, we called for my dad.  The rear, or what I assume was the rear, came into view as we called for him.  It was different from the rest of the craft.  It was square shaped, and had three large white lights that changed to red.  At that point my mother and I both turned to yell at my dad again.  When we turned back, it was gone.  Just 1-2 seconds that we turned away it disappeared.   I can remember this encounter like it was yesterday.  My mother and I still talk about it behind closed doors.   I had to share this to help ease my mind and see if anyone else has seen something similar. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

But even though this was 13 years ago, I remember it vividly.  It has never left me, just for some reason started to think more and more about it lately. There was a small group of us over at a friend’s house, planning to spend the night.  As the evening was winding down, a few of us stepped outside for some fresh air.  After a bit of time the other individuals with me decided to go inside, but for some reason I thought I’d just stay out there a little longer. I remember looking straight up at the sky, and marveling at the fact that it was so clear.  There were tons of stars out.  As I was looking up at the stars, something caught my eye.  At first it had blended in with the rest of the stars, but I soon realized that there were a set of white lights moving with each other, slightly rotating.  (Since the object was high up in the sky and it was dark out, the lights were the only thing I really saw).  At this point, the lights appeared as if they were in a triangle formation, equi-distant from each other.   The object remained in the same point of the sky, but started to ‘revolve’ around it’s vertical axis.   This is when I started to realize that it was a 3D object.    As the triangle shaped set of lights began to rotate at a moderate speed, the triangular plane created by those lights became slanted until I was looking at the very edge of the triangle (for a split second I just saw a line of lights).  As it continued to rotate, the! triangular plane appeared again as if viewing it from the other side.   All this was happening on/near it’s vertical axis, but the entire object start to revolve around the horizontal axis as well.   As it continued to revolve it began moving slowly across the sky.   After moving at that speed for  a bit, it sped up considerably until it was out of sight in a matter of seconds.  It traveled a long distance in a very short amount of time. As I was watching this, I remember feeling that this object was way up in the sky, and very large.  My setting was almost void of any sound, and this craft did not add to it at all, there was no sound (but it took me a bit to realize this, since it was so odd).  I also thought the lights must have been very bright considering the fact they were competing with stars from my original vantage point.   I couldn’t believe what I had seen, and was/am sure it was from another world. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",2009-08-05T00:00:00,38.5234,-91.0332

At first I thought someone had broken in and was going to hurt me. I opened my eyes again and saw them again moving around. At the time I did not think it really happened. I knew it was real but I thought that would make me crazy to admit that it was possible. I started to hear that other people have had similar experiences. I have also heard theories of aliens being able to travel in dimensional spaces unnown by our modern science. Giving them the ability to come and go at the blink of an eye. I had one other experience that was around the same time but I can't remember its been so long. My cousin and I were outside of the house where I saw the beings by my bed. We were there and saw lights in the sky just over the woods. It looked like lights you see on the side of a semi truck at first but there is no road close to that area of the woods and the lights were in the air close to the tree tops which means the lights were levitating. We both saw it. Him first then me. We both ran inside to get away because it was so strange and weird. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Two friends and I had just attended a high school volleyball game in Harrington, Washington.  The two friends were skeptics of alien activity until this experienced happened.  They are both not as willing as I am to tell the story.  I don’t know if it maybe something still in the subconscious mind that does not allow them to be as open as I.  I do know that they will admit to the same as I.  It did happen and it is real.  There is no doubt in my mind. We had left the volleyball game well before the sports bus.  It was a dark evening with some patchy fog along the highway.  Not bad enough to loose your bearings.  Especially on a highway that we had all traveled hundreds of times before.  Highway 2 was our life line to real civilization.   We were approaching the Telford rest area between Davenport, WA, and Creston, WA.  I had set the cruise control at five miles per hour over the speed limit.   We traveled past the rest area just as we had time and time again.  Suddenly, every body in the car had an awakening feeling.  As if you had just been in a deep sleep.  It was almost the same feeling as awakening from a bad dream.   We all noticed it at the same moment and began commenting on the strange feeling we had all just experienced.   Then, we were traveling past the rest area again.  Different cars were traveling toward us on the highway.  We had been put back in the wrong place.  It  is the only verdict that I can come to grasp.   The travel that evening had taken us longer than it should have.  We arrived only a few minutes ahead of the sports bus.  We lost somewhere between 10-15 minutes.  We were gone.  I don’t have any recollection of what happened while I was gone, nor do the friends that were with me.  They say that we hit a time warp or something like that.  I don’t know what really happened to us.   Maybe someday I will? ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of this report, and he sounded to us to be quite serious-minded.

About 1:00 a.m. on April 1, 1997, I decided to go out my back door in Mathews, Virginia to observe the comet, Hale-Bopp. As I was watching to the north sky, I saw something come from what appeared to be from the comet (or behind it). At first, I laughed at thinking a plane was offering me an illusion it was coming from space. As seconds rolled past, I noticed it appeared to drop into the atmosphere and was coming closer and fast. In addition, the vessel had no blinking lights-just solid ones. I remember thinking no plane could travel that fast, for it had flown from the comet to a distant plane distance in less than one minute. The spacecraft quickly dropped to just above the vast forest behind the house, quickly slowing down and coming my way. As it approached, it looked like a plane with solid lights, maybe two lights. I had time to think it through that this slow ship just sped in from space. To my surprise, the spaceship dropped to just above the trees and passed in a straight line over my head.  It passed so slow that I watched the nose go over my head. It was not very wide, and it was almost silent.  All I could hear was a low roar.  The trees did not move from the wind. The body kept getting wider.  I was looking straight up at the dark colored spaceship. It could not have been more than 200 feet in the air.  I kept telling myself to be calm.  I was exhilarated with curiosity. The wing I viewed as the right wing spanned across the house and yard.  The left wing spanned over the neighbor’s yard.   As the wings passed over, I noted the wings were a smooth part of the ship and pointed slightly forward.  As the spaceship revealed its back, I saw a large and brightly lit rectangular window with rounded edges.  All I could see was a wall of something at the back. I kept thinking it was a computer wall or something similar. Then, what appeared to be faster than when it sped in, the spaceship left.  After the ship passed, it made a sudden jump into the sky, curving NNE and then NE and the East and shot over the Chesapeake Bay into space.  In less than five seconds, I saw the ship jump out of the atmosphere. I immediately drew pictures and started researching.  I wanted to report the sighting, but I stopped talking about it, because when I did, I faced ridicule or ignorance.  I never reported it until now. Was this ship observing the comet, and did this ship take a side excursion to Earth because we were so close?  How could a ship travel so fast, quietly slowing to the speed of a slow car quietly, and speed back into space?",2009-08-05T00:00:00,,

I had seen the UFO heading south toward California and it was seen by the others over Medford near the California border, later that same morning. After this sighting when I heard others talking about it on the radio and read about it in the paper, I decided to call Peter Davenport,at the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Peter had been up most all night taking reports with all the sightings in Medford and was very tired and did not have time to take the report, or at least this is what I believe that he said.  I took it personally and thought I would never call Peter again (not Peters’ fault, just my own judgment of the situation. I was helping out a friend in a small store here and told her about it and was still smarting at how Peter had treated me, or I thought he had treated me, and told her about that too. Anyway I was home watching TV, my husband was about to go to bed, he is needs lots of sleep.. he reminded me to lock the back door and put the stick in it.. that way if the cats get ancy we can open the patio door, put a stick in it and let them go in and out at will... anyway I said I would, and did, and he went to bed and I lay down on the couch and was out like a light, fully dressed/shoes too The next thing I remember was waking up and seeing it was time to feed the cats, it was about 7AM.. my husband was in his computer room and the back door was open, the stick had been removed, I got up, fed cats and my husband and was relaxing watching TV news with my second cup of coffee, when the phone rang and it was <former boss>, she was calling me to see if I was alright, and to ask me about the lights, I said you mean the ones I saw the other night? She said NO the ones you saw this morning.. I said I did not see any lights this morning and she said Yes you did, she again said are you OK?   I said YES I was fine, why wouldn't I be.. she said after your call this morning about the lights, I said what call, she said the one you made to me early this morning, she said you left me a message.. I wanted to hear it but she had erased it not thinking about it, but had listened to the message numerous times and had written it down verbatim' and signed the paper.. this is what she said the message said... (my remarks)  <name>, this is CK, I'm really sorry to call you at this time, it is 2:40 AM, in the morning, I am out by North Salem High School ( this is about 3 miles from my home) and I have been watching a bright light in the sky for about 45 minutes. If you know Peter Davenports number or one who does that sort of thing down here (In Salem) they need to be called. I am looking south and a little east and the large light is very bright, too big to be a star. There are 3 smaller lights in a line down one side and I can see two in a line down the other side, but there may be a third one, I can't see from here. It hasn't moved. If you know who investigates these please call them and tell them the information because there is no way this is stars.. End of recording/message.. I told <name> that she was kidding, right? she said ""No I swear its true""  I asked her where I called from, she said she did not know, but that when I was done I did not say goodbye or anything, the line just went totally blank/dead, and it had a empty tinny sound. I called my husband into the living room and asked him when he took the stick out of the patio door? He said I thought you did, the door was open when I got up about 6:00 AM.. I ran to the front door, and it was closed but unlocked, it had been locked and a separate latch used, that was also open.. then I went into the driveway, scared of what I would find, and there was my car, parked on the opposite side of the driveway than I usually park.. I was terrified.. Where had I been, what had I done?  I asked my husband did you get up to go to the bathroom last night? He is usually up 2-3 times a night, NO he said for some reason he had not awakened till just before he got up.. I grabbed my purse and drove over to the high school, I got out of the car near the football field and walked over to the fence surrounding the field, trying to remember what I might have seen, did anything trigger a memory, and all that happened was that I got very dizzy, but walked around looking for some clue as to what had happened.. I remember looking for a tan shingled roof I had been standing near and wanted to check that out on the letter from <name>and was very surprised to see she/I had not mentioned any such roof or color of shingles in the message so it must have been a memory of the event..the only one I have had of that night. I am fortunate to know a lot of UFO researchers and I immediately called my old friend Dr Leo Sprinkle who works with abductees, some researchers or psychologists make the event scary, but if Dr Sprinkle does the same interview the abduction becomes a positive experience not a negative one, a learning experience. I was terrified about what could have happened... what if I would have had a car accident? a flat tire? How would I explain being out driving alone at 2:40 AM?   Dr Sprinkle pointed out that I was likely totally alert and in control till I got home and that is when they took remove any  memory of what happened.. This still haunts me and I still check the doors several times during the evening hours to be sure they are locked. For over a year I had slept fully dressed in a sweat suit complete with shoes etc. Note: Peter is always open and willing to listen to urgent reports. I just took his being tired personally and that was my problem, not Peters’ short coming.  CK 7/31/97",2009-08-05T00:00:00,44.9412471106758,-123.00423516160626

We both noticed that the light in the craft was golden in color, and was flickering like a candle.  All the sudden, the entire craft, ship, blew up, I screamed. Pieces of it blew up, down, and sideways, we could watch the metal burning, and dripping, as I watched the pieces fall, still burning to below the tree line and out of sight. There was no sound.. I ran for the phone and called 911 and reported a “ plane “ might have blown up.  Then I heard sirens and said ‘ Oh someone already had reported this to you? The 911 operator said  “ No, it was an accident on the bridge, “ I said, they probably saw what we did and ran into the wall of the bridge.  So I did report the explosion. Then I called our local airport tower, and no planes were reported in trouble.  I called the military in Portland Oregon because they have a helicopter wing NG in Salem , again no planes or choppers missing or in trouble.  I called PDX and reported it to the tower in Portland , and  then I called SeaTac in Seattle area and again reported the incident. Nothing, but they did take my name in case something or someone ended up not arriving at their destination. I even called Evergreen Helicopters which is located about 28 miles from Salem and again, nothing was reported out of the ordinary. Early the 2nd day / morning sometime after midnight, I was so frustrated that I decided to take a chance and called for the number of Cheyenne Mountain in CO.NORAD might be able to tell me something I called and was very fortunate to have a Air Force man take the call, and explained my reason for the call and he promised to look into it and call me back, I thought I would not hear from him again.  I said, ""it could be a asteroid or something"", but I really needed to know what it was I saw.  So as promised, he called back several hours later. He said “ according to their reports/records, nothing man made entered the Earth's  atmosphere at that time.” I said “ You mean it was a asteroid or something ? “ He said “ You are not listening to me,  NOTHING MAN MADE and he accented the words MAN MADE,  ENTERED THE EARTHS ATMOSPHERE AT THE TIME OF YOUR SIGHTING.” Then it dawned on me he was telling me what I needed to know.  He asked if there was anything further he could do, I said no and thanked him and we hung up.  What was this sighting.. Was it a small craft? Did it blow up or was it shot down?  We watched the molten metal falling, where was it from?   Why didn’t we hear anything?  It seemed a few mere miles away.. how far away was it?  Why didn’t someone else report this?  5/30/1998",2009-08-05T00:00:00,44.9412471106758,-123.00423516160626

It was well after dark between 8:00 and 9:00 PM.  As I was driving, I observed (at about the eleven-o’clock position on the horizon as I peered out the driver-side windshield) what looked like a very bright and low-hanging star.  It was positioned curiously and directly above a cellular tower.  It was much higher in the sky than the top of the tower, but what I remember was how directly above the tower that it was placed.  I began to watch it more closely.  It grabbed my attention, and I began to sense that it was just a little bit too large to be a star.  I observed this light for approximately 2-5 minutes, and it seemed to drift higher (not obviously noticeably) into the sky as I drove closer to the tower and I eventually passed the tower.  And then, as I was looking directly above at the light, it just blinked out and disappeared.  This was VERY unusual to me, and left me talking to myself in disbelief.  After I saw that, I said to myself that for the first time in my life, I had really seen a UFO.  A very short time after this event, I noticed another light which appeared larger and lower to the horizon, and it was located directly to my right, out through the passenger window of my pickup.  I had an even stranger sense that it was something not normal due to its size and location.  It was like it just appeared out of nowhere.  It also appeared like a giant star, and much too close to the horizon to be so, and gave me a weird feeling—like it was menacing.  A short time later, while still watching the light to my right, I could see two or three lights up in the two-o’clock position (through the passenger side upper corner of the windshield) and these were much higher than the one on my right.  At this time, it became too dangerous to try and drive and look at all of these lights, so I pulled over to a well-light service station and got out of my vehicle to try and take some photos with my blackberry (which were inconclusive—lights too small and too far away.)  By this time (approximately 15-minutes since I first saw the light over the cell tower) the largest light to my right had gone away, and I was observing the 2 of 3 remaining lights high above from outside my truck.  One started blinking and moved off, almost like the speed and distance of a satellite.  I saw nothing else similar to these lights for the rest of my drive home, and arrived in Houston on time around 10:00 pm that Saturday night.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,31.2626,-95.8465

I noticed a commercial airliner performing an extremely steep climb which started fom a low altitude .  This caught my attention because I've traveled this route my whole life and have never seen an airliner flying that low in this area .  The airport is on the other side of the city .  Anyway the terrestrial craft climbed till it was about an inch in size by my veiw .  It then leveled out and circled .  Thats when I suddenly noticed a cylinder directly above the centerpoint of the of the circular pattern that the plane was flying in .  This thing was just sitting there or hovering or whatever .  It was still higher in the air than the plane was .  If this object was the same size as the airliner, it would have been pretty high above the plane like a few thousand feet .  It looked like a polished silver beer can sitting on it's side .  With no writing or lable on it of course . I looked away to share in the excitement with my girlfriend who was in the seat behind me and with my father who was driving .  I looked in the sky again about ten seconds since the last time I was veiwing and the object was nolonger there . Or just may not have been visible .  I do not recall seeing the plane either during this second look . My girlfriend witnessed all of this incident as well and I doubt that the plane got zapped away .

UFO Sighting October 12, 2008 at 12:00 PM The Conditions were clear and Sunny. My wife and I left our home through the front door. There were several potted plants on the front porch that we were taking to the cemetery. While I was loading the trunk of the car my wife was attracted to a moving object in the sky. She told me to look at it, but I have hearing problems and did not hear her. She said it was a cylindrical shaped object with a bulge in the center. Why she did not insist on me looking at it I do not understand because I could have easily obtained photos at that time. The object was vertical and she could not determine the altitude. It was moving slowly from the north. It did not have a glow at this point. We entered our car and left for the cemetery. We were driving east on East Luzerne avenue in Larksville, PA.  Coordinates (41°16’27.52”N) by (75°55’07.68”W) (Our location) I looked to my left through the open window and saw a flying object and immediately told my wife to look at it. It appeared to be 20’ in length and was cylindrical in shape and moving horizontally. That is when she told me that she saw the vertical object in the sky when we were in our front yard. It was bright silver (unpainted like shinny stainless steel) and had no visible windows, doors or wings although it seemed a little wider at the back and less in the front and had some contour. It was silent and was traveling at about 50 mph. Very slow for a craft this size to stay aloft. There was a blue white circular glow at the rear of the object that was twice the diameter of the craft being so bright you could not tell were the craft ended. The glow looked as if the sun was hitting a mirror and reflecting at us, the only apparent means of propulsion. It appeared to be 200 ft high at this point and descending. It was between us and a small mountain range. The elevation of the northern horizon at that point is 340m and our elevation was 215m. The distance to the horizon from our location was approximately 800 meters. I could see the detail of the craft clearly and at our line of sight it was slightly above the horizon so I estimate the distance of the craft to be 200m or less. It was traveling east and was obscured by the trees for several seconds At this point I believe it was no more than 100 ft. above the ground. It reappeared about ½ miles away. It flew over the boroughs of Larksville, Courtdale, Luzerne, Forty Fort, and due east until it was out of sight. The last thing being visible was the bright glow. The total time of this sighting was approximately ten minutes. Co-ordinates and some elevations were obtained by using Google earth.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

Before Culver exit, I glanced to the west and briefly saw a nearby tilted disc hovering directly over the northern part of Irvine's Preservation Area. Disc appeared reasonably large - maybe 40 feet in length, but viewing perspective made it appear very thin. The disc appeared to be very 'real' and solid in nature; I did not see any form of glowing or radiation of bright color. Object was gray/brown - I believe. It was hovering and completely/effortlessly static. Notably, it was tilting distinctly to its southernmost side. I viewed the object from the freeway, but could not alert my wife's attention to it quickly enough before a freeway bridge and trees obscured it from my view. I pulled off the Culver exit and drove west over the freeway to attempt a better view, feeling sure that we would be able to view something explainable, but the object was no longer visible. I often question if I had actually seen the object, but cannot account for how I could imagine the length, flatness and angular titling of the disc if I had indeed been confused or subject to some kind of illusion.

Saucer shaped craft seen flying over downtown Denver from about 1-2 minutes.,Denver,CO,2008-08-21T18:50:00,disk,1-2 minutes,"Occurred : 8/21/2008 18:50  (Entered as : 08/21/08 18:50) Reported: 8/21/2008 6:49:28 PM 18:49 Posted: 10/31/2008 Location: Denver, CO Shape: Disk Duration:1-2 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65335.html,"Saucer shaped craft seen flying over downtown Denver from about 1-2 minutes. I know this may sound somewhat ridiculous with most of the media attention surrounding the city of Denver with the DNC and all, but I had to report this. This is my second confirmed UFO sighting of an uknown object here in Denver. These are also my first 2 UFO sightings I have ever encountered. I was watching CNN coverage of the political candidates. I had just finished dinner as I had gotten off at work around 6pm. I walk to and from my office, so I always am on the lookout for anything flying by in the sky, as there always is something to look at. I live on the 3rd floor in my apartment, so I have a pretty good view of the nearby republic plaza, capital building, etc. The skies were clear, the sun was shining through my windows, so I had closed a few blinds, but left 2 open.  I had just finished my dinner while watching CNN news, with a Bill Richardson interview.  I noticed something start to pass by in my left window facing the capital. I see helicopters planes, balloons,and birds pass by all the time, but this looked very strange. What caught my attention quickly was that there was no sound. When something that close flies by, I always hear it coming.  I quickly glanced at the dark object and noticed immediately that it wasn't a plane, helicopter, or balloon. At first I couldn't pinpoint the exact shape, but it seemed to be wobbling, and tipping up and down in that motion.  It was hard to glance at with the sun shinning directly on my view, but I could make out the elliptical, disc shape as it appeared to continue its path of flight across the downtown area. The Object's distance from the ground couldn't have been more than 1,000 ft, possibly even less. It continued to fly North, at a steady speed in the same wobbly, tilting motion. It had given the impression as if it was spinning, and I knew immediately it was a saucer shaped craft when the bottom portion came it to view as it flew further away from the capital hill viewing area.  I cannot determine the speed, but it seemed to be flying at a steady pace, similar to a police / black hawk helicopter.  However, the object seemed to speed up and quickly went out of site in the distance. The only image capturing device I have is a cell phone camera, and that yielded no results, however it does provide a concept of where the object was when the picture was taken, and the time of day. I am not sure if anyone else had seen this, or noticed it going by.  There had to be individuals that had seen this from the ground. Anyone going to and from the 16th Mall downtown had to have a view. I am eager to know if anyone else seen this strange object.  Not sure if the military is flying drones of some sort around the city, or if this was some weird kind of civilian aircraft, but this was definitely not an object being controlled by wind. Weather.com had the winds at 10mph from S,SE during the time of sighting.  This object was traveling way to fast, and at varied elevation increments throughout its path; to be mistaken for any kind of balloon or bag. I'm not saying its an alien spacecraft, but this was definitely something out of the norm. There has to be some explanation of what the object was.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,39.74512637220715,-104.95934593826682

The top of it was like a smaller, upside-bowl, and although it appeared to be solid, it seemed to be invisible except where the sunlight was reflecting off of it, like I was seeing the outline of a bubble in the light.  My second thought was that it was a missile, because it moved like a missile, like it was up so high and was far enough away to appear to be moving very slowly, but it was moving towards the beach.

I as well as my wife and a neighbor were sitting on our neighbors porch as the sun was setting. We were talking about various things when I spotted a light in the sky. It was reddish orange at first sighting and fairly bright. It was stationary to the naked eye and no other visible objects or distinct lights around it. At first I though it was Jupiter and continued to watch for a minute. I then realized that it was to close to the zenith to be Jupiter and began to think it could be Mars but I was not sure due to my not seeing a star chart in about a year and wasn’t sure if Mars was visible yet. So I proceeded to my apartment next door and went upstairs to put my telescope on our porch and try to view it. As time went on the object dimmed very slowly. It was about 8:30 EDST when I got my scope out and had the object in my viewfinder. I then viewed it through my main eyepiece. What I saw looked almost exactly like Mars in size, shape, hue, and reflectivity. It appeared to have an atmosphere/clouds. The object had the orange/ red color but was not emitting the light on its own. As I stared I though what I saw next was caused by my eyes playing tricks on me. I saw a tiny point of white light orbiting the main object extremely fast in a teardrop shape around the object. If the main object were the point of a teardrop than the tiny point of light was moving in a clockwise motion as viewed through the scope. The point of light moved out towards the 10 O’clock  position of the main object and went out approximately 5-8 lengths of the main object in the teardrop fashion. It concluded 1 rotation at about the 1 to 2 O’clock range of the main object. One rotation was approximately 2 and ½ seconds. I started shouting to my wife, who was still downstairs on our neighbors porch, to come up to my scope quickly because I am seeing something amazingly not natural. It is now about 8:35 EDST and she is up with me. Whilst she was coming up though, I continued to view the object throu! gh my sc ope and noticed something amazing. I saw some form of a tether/ tractor  beam that appeared to be connecting the small point of light with the main object. The tether appeared to be the same hue of the main object, reddish/ orange, but it was very faint but defiantly there. My wife looked through my scope and saw what I saw, the point orbiting the main object, minus the tether due to her wearing glasses.  I looked back one more time and stared for about 1 minute than began to adjust my scope, as I hadn’t attached either tension springs.  I attached one tension spring to the left side of the scope. When I finished that I got out a 1.25” 9mm lens and tried to find the object again. I couldn’t so I put on the 2” eyepiece again and found it rather quickly but what I saw surprised me once again. The object had turned blue. It still looked the same as before with all the same features but it was just blue.  Also the small object orbiting had disappeared and so was the tether/ tractor beam. It is now about 8:40 and our neighbor is now up with us and looked through the eyepiece. He saw the blue object and was disappointed that it wasn’t something waving at him. Well I watched it for a few more minutes  and then decided to try the higher power lens. I put the lens in and noticed right away that I had forgot to take the moon filter off and so I quick took it off. It was now about 8:43. Once I put the eyepiece back in I lost sight of the object.  I immediately ran inside and began typing this for accuracy of time/description. This is the best I can do without have the right questions asked. Feel free to contact me for anything more that I may have no added in as I didn’t know the info was needed.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,42.902226093175315,-78.85083919084595

The speed and distance appeared similar to the several satellites that passed over during the same time period (+ or – 30 minutes). The usual west to east parade of passenger jet aircraft was also easily visible during this time. The configuration of this relatively tight formation did not change noticeably during the viewing period. The spacing and colour led us to think that this may have been fragments of a satellite or a meteorite that had split up during entry into the earth’s atmosphere.

At first I thought it was a plan but it was moving too fast and in a different motion than a plane. As I was watching another object looking the same shot up and circled around the other one. The objects were high in the sky because a plane did fly below both the objects at a regular speed and was going straight. The objects looked like they were playing with each other and appeared to be triagular in shape although it was hard to tell. I watched the objects for a long time because it was nothing I had ever seen before. It was very strange.,2008-10-31T00:00:00,,

This was a very unusual light, I couldn’t tell at first but as it got closer I could tell this object was not an aircraft and they were not landing lights, it was the shape of an orb or sphere and orange in color, there is a navigational aid or VOR station that aircraft on this route use, its about three miles south of my home. Once an aircraft intercepts this station they turn northwest, the object in question seemed to stop in midair in the area of this turn point, it appeared the trailing aircraft had to make an early turn to avoid the object, once the trailing aircraft was parallel with object, the object just disappeared right in front of my eyes.

It seems every color in the rainbow was flashing, right before my eyes. I quickly ran inside my home, and grabbed my camera.

Out of the top left of my windshield I saw a bright light and thought a general aviation plane was flying really low with an extremely bright light brighter than I had ever seen on a plane.   I watched it for 10 seconds and realized that the light would appear but be still, then move at a fast speed then stop, the light would then go out and the sequence would repeat.  That’s how it traveled, it was on a straight plain going north along I-5.  It appeared to be 1200 feet in the air.  After the 10 seconds previously specified, I told my passenger to look at what I was looking at and he immediately looked to his left and saw it.  I kept on driving and looked at the light as frequently as possible.  My passenger never stopped looking until it disappeared on the horizon.  The light was so bright and so pure it was incredible, it could be described as a white light and it didn’t illuminate anything.

Just sitting talking, I noticed that these objects were in a strange tumbling appearance and no sound, no blinking, just red lights that moved in a strange silent geometric pattern.  We see plenty of aircraft, both military & civilian, and this looked like none of that.  Neither of us could make out just how these lights were attached because of the way they 'tumbled'.  The other witness thought the lights looked like they were rotating in a circle, but I thought they looked sort of like tumbling cubes with each red light at the cubes corners.  We could not see any body, just these slow moving silent oddly tumbling lights crossing the sky.  It took several minutes for the lights to go out of view in the SW sky.  They moved very steadily and with no obvious perpective (like wings or landing light).  They were very large looking together, but with no sound at all, it was difficult to tell how far away they were.  They moved so slowly we had time to discuss what we were looking at and over the course of minutes, we couldn't figure what it was we were lookint at.  From top to bottom there was a large span and from side to side as well, but they looked like they were equidistant from each other at all times.

Background- Exactly two weeks prior, I had seen another UFO.  Plus a history of sightings, strange behavior/time loss and possible abduction aged 3-4. I was walking home admiring the sunset and the beautiful clouds. I had calmed down over what I'd seen two weeks ago, and didn't expect to see anything anytime soon. I was about to cross a road when I saw something strange very very high up, up above the high atmosphere clouds. It was a long cylinder, perfectly white. I thought at first that it was an airplane making a trail, but as it came out from above the clouds, the 'trail' suddenly stopped and the end of it moved with the front... and I realized it was a cylinder shaped object. It had to be huge- it was almost three centermetres long from my standing spot but it was very much above the storm clouds as they grew. It was white, didn't reflect the sunset like the clouds did, and I only watched it for a few minutes before it went over another big cloud. It was heading into the wind direction, though I don't know if it had wind that high up. Compared to the last sighting, this one was peaceful. I got the impression that it was indifferent to me, it knew I had seen it but didn't care either way. It was very big. I can submit drawings of it but I had no camera on me.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,,

I rushed to the window, realising what was happening. And, not to my surprise; I spotted another UFO, just like my last one, flying across the sky.

On the evening of Thursday, October 9, 2008 I was on my way home from the store and noticed in the southern sky 3 white lights in a row. I immediately called my father and he informed me that it was most likely a blimp as one had been seen in the area earlier in the day. Assuming that was the case I pulled into my driveway fully expecting to see the outline of the blimp as it was a clear night and the lights were very close to the ground. In an instant the lights moved westward and then seemed to disappear in the western sky. Due to the speed in which the vehicle reached a blimp is discounted.

I was working with a guy all day, he was driving, and we were headed back to the hotel, it was just after dusk.  We were about 3 miles west of Post, TX, driving eastbound on US HWY 380.  It had been a clear day, while I was smoking, I caught a glimpse of light due south of us, nearly all the way to the horizon.  I made a comment to the effect of ""wonder if we're gonna get wet?""  I had time to say that and roll up the window of the 4spd manual Jeep Cherokee. Immediately this thing was right on top of us, it turned everything red, like we were driving inside a laser, I could feel weightlessness, specifically I recall feeling my penis lift up off of my testicles(sorry to be graphic).  Guy driving jumped out of his seat, over the center console, and into my lap.  He did so exactly like Scooby Doo jumps into Shaggy's arms.  Then it was all over.  Maybe 5 seconds from seeing the light on the horizon to everything being normal again, and the Jeep having righted itself, with my coworker behind the wheel.  I have no idea if time was lost or not.  if it was, it wasn't very much, because it was still around 9pm when we stopped at the gas station in town, a couple minutes later. The only other thing, is that I went in to the store, and mentioned what had just happened to us.  There was a lady in the store that said she lived about 3 miles west, and her son and daughter had the same thing happen to them going the other direction(leaving Post) after a light night school function.  To be honest, that made me feel a little better, but I have always regretted not forcing my coworker to come into the store and hear the woman's story, just to validate it for him, like it did me, but whatever.  By the way, my coworker was a 19 year old professional motorcycle racer, and I was a 21 year old paramedic. I don't know what to make of any of that, I just know it happened, and it was life-changing for me.  Everytime I think about it, I wonder why, if, whatever that technology was, does exist, why have we not figured out how to desalinate the oceans and make the deserts fertile, etc.  I lost a lot of respect for my government/world community.

I would lay down on the picnic table on the patio with a tube pillow under my head,(to keep from getting a kink in my neck) and binoculars on my chest.. I was watching the local ABC 11 o'clock news, my husband was already asleep, having gone to bed several hours before, (his illness forces him to get a-lot of sleep) anyway I know I looked at the clock at 11:15 PM when I opened the patio glass sliding doors and went outside... I laid on the table for what seemed like about 10 minutes, checking out the stars and planets etc, and then I got up and walked around the patio to get a different perspective of the sky.. all the sudden I looked down the back side of the house (NE SIDE) back of house was facing North, and said out-loud but to myself, ""I need to go make sure my bedroom window is closed it might rain"", keep in mind this was August our hottest month of the year, and there was not a chance in Hell of getting any rain.. I came into the house and walked down the hall to my bedroom, to go in and check the windows, the door to the room was almost closed so I reached for the door handle to push it open and the door SLAMMED in my face with a loud noise, I thought "" it was a draft from the open window"" I put my hand on the door to open it and could not turn the knob, I pushed against it, and pulled on it, yelled at it and kicked it, the door was locked, then I remembered that we do not have any room locks on the bedroom doors.... I remember yelling for my husband who is a light sleeper to come and help me, nothing... then I called him again, again nothing so finally I walked away from the door across the hall and went in and bodily shook him awake and he seemed that he was drugged I explained to him what was happening and finally got up and he too tried to open the bedroom door, pulling and pushing.. finally it opened..and one of the cats slipped into the room and came running out growling with a full bottlebrush tail, I went into the room and I felt a bit of vertigo but that’s all... I looked at my bedroom clock and it was 2:15 AM, it had been over 3 hours since I went outside, but it seemed like only about 20-30 minutes. I checked the window and it was closed (no surprise) and then I noticed there was a box on the floor, it had been sitting under the window on the window-seat and it was about 1-2 feet away from the window-seat upside down on the floor, but the contents were not on the floor, nothing was spilled, I am not sure how that was done.. (all that was in the box was ET reports and information)  Finally I got the cats calmed down, husband went back to bed and I shut and locked the patio doors and laid down on the couch, I was barely dozing when my husband yelled from the bedroom... I ran in to see what was the problem and he said ""Something is touching me"", I asked him what it was, cats were not in the room, he said ""I don't know but I could hear a buzzing sound and when I closed my eyes I could see blue and red lights moving around the room through the crack in my eyes. He said they were not totally closed. He also said ""I could not move"" I said ""Why didn't you open your eyes?"" and I think he thought I had lost my mind, he said he did not want to see them,he lay back down and about 10 minutes later he was in the living room standing by the couch.. I said "" what do you want?"" he said "" I do not want to sleep in there tonight, they keep coming back and touching me""  The next morning except for the episode with the door he didn't seem to remember any of the happenings.. he had multiple small scoop ( bb size) marks on his arms. On several occasions my husband as I said who is a light sleeper did not respond to my calls for help or assistance, and he did not get up in the night and find me missing when I was not there..  I personally believe that is the intention of the Et's to keep him sleeping when they are busy with me.

Prior to the time of UFO sighting I had sighted about six satellites and multiple high altitude aircraft. I had been laying on the ground for about one half hour in a way that no ground based lights were visible. My body was positioned in a north to south direction.  (Location Coordinates  41°37'45.18""N  120°12'50.27""W).  Around 2330 I noticed a bright white light traveling west to east from a point starting on a line about one half of the distance between my north horizon and the North Star.  The light felt like it was shining from a beginning distance of 15 to 20 miles to the north of my position which would be in the neighbor hood of Mount Bidwell (Coordinates: 41°57'57""N  120°9'56""W).  The light reminded me of a brightness of an aircraft landing light except that it felt like it was too far away and was traveling at an angle away fr! om my point of view.  No navigation lights were visible at any time around the light.  The light did not appear to be directional like a landing light. The path of the diminishing size indicated possible travel away in an east north easterly direction, with the light fading and extinguishing from view prior to my north east horizon.  Transit time was in the range of one minute. This path would be consistent with possible travel for a military night training flight from Kingsley field in Klamath Falls, OR (LMT), to the Hart South MOA. However, the transit time across the horizon and perceived distance appeared much too fast for a jet not in afterburner and under the speed of sound. The night was still and no sound was apparent. My position was slightly east of airway V 165 and high altitude aircraft are regularly visible transiting north to south both west and far to the east of my position.  I have never seen a light maneuver like this one, nor have I ever noticed any other flying object that I did not feel could be reasonably explained.

I pulled over next to the guy and he said what the hell was that? I shrugged my shoulders and he drove away. About 5 minutes later I was home telling my wife what happened.

I believed it to be a meteorite, but had never seen one so large. A shooting star, it wasn't. I slowed down to about 20-30 miles an hour.  The road was dark, and no other travelers either way. I should have stopped the car, but knew there was no place to pull over. I watched the road and the fireball. The fields on the left had been harvested, so my view was clear. The fireball was going the same direction as I was, perpendicular to the road.  I watched it for about 3-5 minutes. The fireball went behind some distant trees, then it was gone.

While sky gazing at 7:15 PM yesterday, I noticed a very bright object in the sky due South of my residence in Westlake, LA at the 3 o’clock position in the sky. The object looked similar to a star, except it appeared to be about ten times larger and brighter than any star or planet that I have ever witnessed in my many years of sky watching. It should be noted that sunset this evening was at 7:46 PM and normally stars would not start to appear until about 30 minutes after sunset. (This “star” was out about an hour early with the sun still shining brightly). I watched the object for several minutes and it appeared to be stationary. I then went into the house and got my binoculars to have a better look at it and still it appeared to look only like a extremely large star. However, due to the size of the object and the way it appeared in the sky I would say that the object appeared to be high in the sky but not beyond the atmosphere. At 7:30 PM, I called my wife out of the house to witness the unusual day light “star”. I continued to watch the “star” until 7:55 PM (a total of 40 minutes) and to the eye it appeared stationary, but apparently it was slowly moving to the West as it was now clearly located directly South West (a 45 degree change in direction), but still at the 3 o’clock position in the sky. At this point, the very bright clearly seen “star” got fuzzy and appeared to be starting to pull apart and quickly faded away against the cloudless sky. About a minute after the “star” faded away, an Air Force B-52 flew directly over my house at a low altitude flying South Westerly and flew exactly past the last position of the large daylight “star” that had just faded away. I had called my wife back out of the house to witness that the “star” was now gone, as the B-52 aircraft passed overhead. It should be noted that this is first time that I have ever witnessed a B-52 in flight since leaving the military in 1982. I believe that the closest active military air base to my home in 200 miles to the North in Shreveport, LA and any military aircraft in our area is somewhat rare. I remained outside to document the time that readily recognized “normal” stars start to appear with the first dim star appearing at 8:00 PM and the second at 8:15 PM. The extremely large and bright daylight “star” that faded away against a clear sky never reappeared in the sky by the time I ended my watch at 10:00 PM last night.

Three sightings were followed by the appearance of military aircraft.  08/22/2008 (Friday)  While sky gazing at 7:15 PM , I noticed a very bright object in the sky due South of my residence in Westlake, LA at 45 degrees above the horizon. The object looked similar to a star, except it appeared to be about ten times larger and brighter than any star or planet that I have ever witnessed. It should be noted that sunset this evening was at 7:46 PM and normally stars would not start to appear until about 30 minutes after sunset.

The extremely large and bright daylight “star” that faded away against a clear sky never reappeared in the sky by the time I ended my watch at 10:00 PM last night.  (8/23/08) Saturday  At 7:40 PM, I returned to my backyard in Westlake, LA and started a through watch to the South and South West direction. (The same direction that I had observed the “daylight star” a day earlier.  At 7:50 PM, again a very large and bright starlike object appears suddenly to the South West against the still clear blue sky. (Sunset was at 7:46 PM and the sky was still very well lit up at this time).  I watched the object for a minute or so to make sure that it was indeed a stationary object. I then attempted to get the attention of someone inside my home by knocking on the windows while trying to watch the object at the same time. (I did not want to take my eyes off the object just in case it faded away into thin air as it did the day before after observing it for 40 minutes).  After knocking on windows for another minute or so to no avail, I momentarily took my eyes off the object three times and was easily able to re-sight the object each time until the third time and then the object was gone when I looked back up. I remained outside watching for another hour without ever seeing the very large and bright “daylight star” again. However, during this time frame all of the “normal stars” that I normally see each evening began to slowly and dimly appear starting around 8:15 PM. I did not notice any “normal stars” moving or disappearing.  I do not know what this very large bright starlike object is, but I am almost positive that it is not a star or a planet.  8/28/08 (Thursday)  19:35	Observed reappearance of daytime star-like object against a clear blue sky 45 degrees above the horizon SW of my residence in Westlake, Louisiana. Unlike the first two sightings of this object, this time the object was not extremely brilliant. I then observed the object through binoculars and it appeared to be metallic and chrome colored, shaped like a hamburger bum.  19:37	At this point, I phoned my son who was located 10-15 miles SW of my residence and presumably that much closer to the object and ask if he could sight the object. He easily located the object in the same relative position in the sky to him as it was located to myself. When asking my son if he saw the star, he stated that “the object was not a star as it was defiantly metallic, but he was unable to identify what it was”.  19:45	Shot six still photos of the object on a Sony digital camera. (Object appears in the photos as a round white object against a clear blue sky without showing the chrome color or a detailed shape due to the long distance of the object).  19:47	While attempting to locate the object in the viewfinder of my video camera, my son called back and said that the object had disappeared. I looked back up to confirm that indeed the object was gone and no longer appeared against the clear blue sky. I continued to search the sky for 30 minutes without the object reappearing.  09/03/08 (Wednesday)  19:45	Reappearing star-like object appears high in the sky directly above my residence in Westlake, LA. Object remained stationary in the sky.  19:47	Called my son out of the house to watch the object while I laid flat on my back observing the object straight up in the sky with binoculars.  19:50	Observed a much smaller yet very bright star-like object moving towards the original larger star-like object and then it stopped. At this point, I ask my son if he saw the second smaller object without binoculars and he stated that he did not. After about ten seconds, the smaller object moved toward the larger object again. As the smaller object met the larger object, the larger object appeared to become eclipsed by the smaller object and a corona of light could be seen around the larger object with the light at the center of the larger object blocked out. At the point that the larger object became eclipsed, my son stated that he could no longer see the object without binoculars. I continued to watch the “eclipse star” for a minute with binoculars and then it faded and appeared as faint light in three separate spots and then faded out completely.  20:05	Observed a large twin engine turbo prop military type aircraft flying low directly over my residence located in a populated neighborhood.  20:12	Observed a large commercial airline flying low and banking a turn directly over my residence. (It should be noted that large aircraft are almost never observed flying low over my residence located in a populated neighborhood).  09/04/2008 (Thursday)  19:40	Star-like object appears in the South, 70 degrees above the horizon as clouds begin to break at my residence in Westlake, LA.. The object could best be described as a normal star in appearance against the still blue sky in the background. Object appears in wrong part of sky to be a star and 20-30 minutes early for a normal star to appear. Observed object for 16 minutes with binoculars. During the time observed, the object changed from a pale star appearance to a yellow flattened  shape.  19:56	Object begins to fade against a still clear cloudless portion of the sky and then appears as faded scattered light in three separate locations in the sky before the object is completely undetectable.  20:06	What appears to be a fighter jet passes directly over my residence flying very low. 	(It should be noted that military aircraft are seldom seen in this area over a residential neighborhood, nor are low flying aircraft of any type with the exception of an infrequent Piper or crop duster during the daylight hours).  20:16	What appears to be the same fighter jet makes another very low pass over my residence for a second time.  20:30	Ended sky surveillance without star-like object returning.

As I got closer I realized that the object was not in fact moving but hovering just over the path of the freeway.  Immediately I realized that I was not looking an airplane (due to the absence of the blue and red lights normally seen on the wings of the plane) and as the objects came into view I was able to make out three distinct lights forming a perfect triangle. The entire time I was just saying, “Oh my God, oh my God, what am I looking at?!”  This continued for about 3 minutes until the freeway began to bend in another direction of the lights, and at this point the other two lights began to pulsate in unison. I watched this go on as I made the left bend on the freeway, and the last I could see of the lights is that they began to change colors to a deep blue.  I did not stop because I was honestly too afraid to and still am shaken up by the whole experience.

At 11pm on Friday, August 22, 2008 I went out on my balcony to get some air and saw in the distance approximately five blinking orange orbs in close formation hovering about 500 feet above the western side of the River North neighborhood (possibly a bt further west, above River West).  Very quickly the objects individually blinked on and off in a seemingly random manner, almost like a strobe light atop an emergency vehicle.  I thought at first they were the lights of an emergency helicopter (sometimes I see medical flights to rooftop helipads at hospitals on the north side), but the lights just hovered and blinked, moved slightly to the south, and faded out/stopped blinking.  While ""on"", the light they gave off was an intense orange, the kind you might see at the working end of a blow torch.  Really pure, really bright and intense. I stood there for several minutes wondering what I had seen.  Twice in the past year, I have seen individual unexplained objects above downtown Chicago and the western suburbs (one of which I reported to NUFORC), and I expected what I had just seen was also out of the ordinary. After waiting for the lights to return to no avail, I returned to my apartment.  About half an hour later, through my window I noticed an individual blinking orange orb in a different location but near to where I had seen the original formation.  This orb was low to the ground, about at rooftop level.  It strobed for a few seconds and then disappeared. I went out on the balcony again and waited.  About a minute later, the light reappeared for 10 seconds or so and then faded out.  It occurred to me if the grouping of lights I had originally seen had broken up, I might see other individual orbs above the city. I stayed out on the balcony for about half an hour (by now it was around midnight or maybe a little bit later).  During that time, I witnessed another very intense blinking orange orb above the Lincoln Park neighborhood.  This was not the signal light atop Children's Memorial Hospital on Lincoln (which was also clearly visible) but was east of it, closer to the park itself.  This light moved slightly east and west while I watched it, and blinked in a rapid, staccato manner in three volleys of about 15 seconds each, with gaps of perhaps 15 or 20 seconds between each volley.  The light was as intense as the others I had seen, and seemed weirdly bright given the distance from which I was viewing it.  I had the feeling something was being surveyed by the light at specific intervals.  After a couple of minutes, this light disappeared and did not return. I also saw what may have been blinking orbs in two other locations, both much further to the northwest and closer to the horizon.  However, due to the distance, although those lights were blinking in the same odd manner, I can't be sure.  However, the formation of lights and the two individual orbs that I saw were identical in behavior. The funny part of the entire event, each time I saw the lights I thought, ""you're kidding, these can't be what I think they are,"" and then a few minutes later they would reappear doing the same things I doubted I had just seen them do. I've lived in this high-rise for years and have seen hundreds of planes and helicopters come and go.  I have never, ever seen anything like what I saw tonight.  I looked through the NUFORC reports and found a similar report of orbs over Lake Michigan exhibiting similar behavior on AUgust 8th.  I get the feeling I just saw those same orbs, only this time over the city.  I can't be the only one to have seen these things tonight.

My 25 year old daughter and her 24 year old friend were at the park near Center and Geneva road in Provo, the one with the fort. As they were sitting there they saw a V shaped cluster of approximately 50 or more very bright lights move some what low across the sky at a very rapid speed. It moved like a school of fish, curving in unison, but then splitting apart at times. It  was coming from the north west and moving south east. Various other configurations of these groupings passed every few minutes. At times the lights would flare so brightly it was startling! She called me on the phone and told me to look outside to see if I could see anything, but we have a street lamp in front of our home and we couldn't. They came and picked us up and we went back to the park. I expected to see that it was a search light or something but then one large grouping flew overhead and it was undeniably something unlike anything I had ever seen or could explain. It was like a boomerang shape cluster of up to 50 objects all flying in formation very close together and they just kept coming every few minutes. They were not single file like airplanes would fly, but  grouped  densely together. We had brought our binoculars and  my 17 year old son was able to track one very brightly lit group. He saw individual crafts all clustered together, circular with dark violet lights circling around the outer edge. They were not all identical in shape and at one point they suddenly shot straight up in a deep purple blast. Most of the groupings were in a chevron pattern, but some were just small clusters. When the lights would flare it was stunning! Then they would fade to a dimness that made them unnoticeable unless you were looking at them already. They moved across the sky at an inhuman speed. We also watched multiple airplanes flying overhead and it made the speed of these objects even more stunning.  I am a retired nurse and current business owner in partnership with my daughter. Her friend is a world traveler and has seen other sightings in his life. My 17 year old son is a skeptic, as I am and we both came along expecting to see something that was easily explainable. I don't believe in UFO's never have. I don't believe in anything I can't see and I even struggle with religion although I was raised in the Mormon faith and do still attend. I don't know what to do with this experience. I know I witnessed  a massive sighting of UFO's and I am scared!",2008-10-31T00:00:00,40.27123156626506,-111.62400433734939

We have very dark skies and are used to seeing bright stars, satellites & multiple air traffic.  I am going to report the multiple sightings that we have had in the last few months.  My boyfriend's family has had this land for 4 generations and he grew up here.  He and other members of his family have seen strange things over the years but this year there has been lots of activity.  We are only about 120 miles Southeast of Stephensville & 65 miles from Waco.  There are several airbases and strip mines (lignite & coal) in this area of Texas. I mention the mines because lots of activity seems to occur near them.  I am going to give a description of each sighting over the last few months.  We really believe something is going on possibly military, possibly not. If it is military - it is something unbelievable and the technology is very different. 10/20/2008 - We (my boyfriend and I) had just arrived home and stepped out on the back porch of the farm to look at the beautiful sunset. We noticed 3 long pencil shaped cylinder objects due West of us toward Limestone County (Mexia/Waco) somewhere beyond highway I-45 above highway 84W. At first we thought they might be jet trails. They were suspended at a 40-45 degree angle from the ground. They did not break up like trails and we realized they were solid and very reflective. You could see the reflection of the sunset in them. I ran inside and got my digital camera and snapped a few shots. They were in perfect formation. With the naked eye, nothing showed up on the camera screen but when I downloaded onto the computer we noticed you could see 3 white orbs or ovals in the picture when amplified by 200+. The strange part about this is with a naked eye these objects looked very long and solid like pencils or telephone poles in the sky but on film they were round or oval shaped. We told some friends later in the week what we saw and they admitted that they saw them too and had commented how strange they looked. They were in their car on the way to a restaurant at I45 & 84. They also saw them due West/Northwest. I will try and include a picture with this report. The incident lasted over a 1/2 hour. 10/28/2008 - We had just gotten home and went out on the back porch to feed our 4 dogs at 8:20 PM. I observed a dull orange, red glowing sphere with a whitish glow in the center. It looked like it was hovering or floating just above the tree line in the Southwest sky somewhere between our land and Jewett (near the mine). My boyfriend ran inside and came back out with his rifle which had a high powered scope. We took turns observing the object until 8:33 PM when it either flew over the horizon or descended (we felt like it descended). The next day we saw a report on the Dallas news that the Stephensville lights had returned so I decided to send them an account of what we saw. I contacted the Stephensville paper and reported the object. They asked if they could use our description in an article so I gave them permission. The next day they published the article and there was a picture that had been submitted by an East Texas woman. Our verbal description matched the picture exactly (but we did not take any pictures that night). Others saw what we saw! 11/25/2008 - Almost the exact same sighting as mentioned previously - orange, reddish glowing sphere with white center...almost dull like a halo around it. It was in the same Southwestern area and we saw it around 9:00 PM and watched it for 15 minutes - again it looked like it descended or went over the horizon. Other air traffic could be seen and this looked nothing like the normal air traffic in the area. Since this was the second sighting of this kind we began to investigate our surrounding (helicopter landing sights etc.) but we found nothing. 12/3/2008 - Again, almost the same description as above - we documented it at 8:05 and watched it until 8:22. We could not get pictures because nothing would show up. 12/7/2008 - (This is our strangest one yet and involved three different sets of lights). This sighting started out as the one above. We had just gotten back from Dallas & Waxahachie and went out on the back porch to feed the dogs at 8:19 PM. I saw the strange orange/red object and called out to my boyfriend to come take a look. We watched it do it's normal thing (descend or go over the horizon) but this time as soon as we lost sight of it this bright white light appeared above it. This came on as if someone had turned on a lightbulb. This object began to flash bright multi colors in sequence. The colors were amazing - blue, orange, pink, green, red. It was so bright it was hard to tell what shape it was. We got the rifle scope out again and my boyfriend looked at it through the scope - he said it was hard to tell it's shape. As soon as he handed me the scope the light went off, again just like a light switch. I told him something was still there - right when I said that, 3 small piercing white strobe lights came on in a triangle formation. They kept strobing back and forth as if communicating or sequencing. A high flying jet came into the airspace where this was going on and the strobe lights began to almost cartwheel over each other off to the North at a very high rate of speed. The next thing we knew, we were just looking at the regular air traffic (jets) on their route to Dallas. This sighting really shook me up. While it was happening, my boyfriend called his mom who lives in town, she went out to see if she could see anything and she could not because of the tree cover in her neighborhood (very large Post Oaks). I reported this sighting to MUFON ( I had reported the previous sightings to them). The MUFON investigator contacted me and said that he had received almost an exact report of our sighting from a man that was driving home from Dallas back to Waco with his teenage son (they had been at a football game). 12/11/2008 - This is our last sighting. There is a well being drilled due South of our farm and we can see the rig lighting very clearly beyond our barns. I had gone out on the back porch at 10:00 PM and saw the strange multi colored bright light about 55 degrees above left of the rig. We watched it for 40 minutes, I tried to film it but nothing appears on the video. It was not a star because we know our night sky and there has not been a star there before and there has not been one since. Please consider investigating this area of Texas if you are already investigating the Stephensville incidents. We just want to know if it is military or not...I think NOT.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,31.8035,-96.0894

Now we are used to jets flying at night from Oceana Air Force Base in Virginia Beach, VA, but this was no jet! The craft was very close to us, maybe 1/4 to 1/2 mile and very large in comparision to jets at that range. It was probably 1000 feet in the air, flying behind the tree lines. I watched in disbelief and quickly ran out the front door to get a better view of the lights, but the craft was lower than our next door neighbors house. I could hear engines or some sort of mechanical power grrr through the sky. I ran out back but couldn't see anything else, only the sound fading away. We quickly jumped in the car to take a ride to see if we could get another glimpse of it, but we had no luck. To describe the craft: It looked exactly like a triangle starting with 5 vertical lights, then 4, then 3, then 2, then 1. They were VERY bright lights, not typical commercial flight lights.

It was pink and red in color and it was low, probably less than 8,000 feet.  The body of the craft appeared to be irregular as far as the texture.

We had just been in town at a business meeting, the meeting ended around 6:30 PM and we drove out to our ranch (we live 6 miles from Fairfield). It was a beautiful Fall evening and we have a habit of hanging out on the back porch off our kitchen to watch the sunset. My boyfriend and I noticed 3 long streaks in the sky low on the horizon to our West (toward Mexia/Waco). At first we didn't think much of them as we assumed they were jet trails of jets flying in formation. As we continued to do chores in the backyard, we both noticed that these ""trails"" or ""streaks"" did not disappear. In fact, it became obvious that they were solid in shape and very shiny (the setting sun was bouncing off them and they were highly reflective). We decided to take a few pictures of the objects but we did not get much on the digital image. At the time when I was taking the photos, my boyfriend noticed two more similar objects in the South West that looked like they were traveling South to North. We wanted to get in the truck and get a closer look but we knew they were too far away and we would probably lose them out of sight. Other normal air traffic was visible during the sighting. We see planes, helicopters and satellites all the time and these were not anything we had ever seen before. We told our family about this early Friday, October 24th - that very same night a news report came on from Channel 8 in Dallas/Ft. Worth about the return of the Stephenville lights in Texas. We are about 90 miles from Stephenville and felt that our sighting might be connected.

Up to that point of my life I had seen things which people of that age more then often do not see.  I am just trying to tale my story and see if those out there have seen the things I have. The UFO Chasity and I seen back in 2003 must have been seen by someone else.  So after reading this feel free to write to me. Here it is. Back in the summer months of 2003 me and my family member Chasity had walked onto my front porch.  I remember looking over into the field across the way. I had noticed rising up through the foliage of the trees a white light. I had pointed this out to Chasity and we both watched as the light appeared above the trees. It was a ball of light. the ball looked like a glass ball and glowed a dim but bright white light. It was funny to note that the light of the sphere did not shine of the trees and the light was in and of itself. However, the spherehover above the trees. just hanging there. No noise, nothing, the leaves on the trees didnt even move. When we watched it there for a moment, we noticed that in one instant the ball seemed to zip up into the darkened sky. After a little bit of searching the ball seemed to disappear above the porch roof. I am not saying it was a Alien. However, it was not a fire. It was not a plane or Copter or a fire work.....or anything else. It's nothing I can explain with what I know of the worlds flying contraptions. What I seen was not man made and it is not anything which modern physics can support. I seen it once more. This time me and Chasity and Donnie were driving north and again it was dark, I say about 9pm to 10pm. It was at that time now late october. On the road, I looked over in a field we were driving by and the sphere was there, over a billboard, but this time it had a stream of light which seem to be shining on the ground. Again, everyone seen it. It wasnt anything man made, I assure you. I have always believed in life on other planets and UFO's and all that. I however never thought I would be party to seeing one so close up and so detailed. I am happy I found this. I am 21 now, chasity is in her early 30's.

I'd just like to share my version in a hope it helps shed some light. On the night it happened I was outside our temporary accommodation at a site we were sharing with the Russian army. I was sitting at a table on a patio area we had knocked up watching a DVD on a portable player. The night was very clear and warm. Most of the other lads were either at the gym or the bar. Shortly before the event I was joined by a mate (I don't remember who unfortunately) who sat down to watch the DVD. At some point I leaned back on my chair and stretched my arms out behind me facing straight up at the sky. When I did so the first thing I remember seeing was a big patch of ""starless"" sky. This freaked me out straight away but within the next second it became apparent that the patch was triangular in shape because it was moving. This made me realise that it was not the stars that were missing but something massive, black and silent moving in front of them as at the front of the point of the triangle the stars were disappearing while at the back they were re-appearing. It was hard to judge whether the object was small and close or large and far away because of the lack of sound. My initial reaction and with hindsight I would say that it was a massive object simply because of the amount of stars it was blanking out as it moved across the sky and also the speed which it travelled. If it was a small object it was moving FAR too slowly to stay airborne surely. If I had to estimate, i would say that this thing was at least 500 meters and most likely a kilometer wide at an altitude of around 5-8000 ft. As it passed silently over the mountain horizon I turned to my mate who was also looking up and asked ""did you see that?"" he replied ""yes, what was it?"". He had followed my gaze at the sky and witnessed the same thing. The next day I casually asked my commanding officer if there were any stealth aircraft being flown in the area and he said he didn't think so. I'd seen stealth bombers and fighters before and I know it definitely was not one of those I saw. It had no navigation lights for one thing. I have only just got round to looking into this and just recently googled ""black triangle ufo"" and was amazed at the amount of reports I found. Although it would be awesome to know it was of alien origin, it seems to me (from what I have read) that it could well be a very secret military transport ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Sighting of highly unusual flying object in daylight with excellent viewing conditions in vicinity of jet airliner.,Stanwood,WA,2003-05-15T08:30:00,circle,1 minute,"Occurred : 5/15/2003 08:30  (Entered as : 5/03 8:30) Reported: 7/11/2009 8:56:47 PM 20:56 Posted: 8/5/2009 Location: Stanwood, WA Shape: Circle Duration:1 minute",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71035.html,"Sighting of highly unusual flying object in daylight with excellent viewing conditions in vicinity of jet airliner. I was not going to report these sightings, but following a recent conversation with a friend who is interested in UFOs, he felt that it might be of some statistical value and of interest to those who may have seen something similar. I am a trained observer, amateur astronomer for over 40 years, and have an extensive background in science. The dates are approximate.  On my way to work one morning, I had stopped for a cup of coffee at a small market that sits at the north end of Lake Goodwin, WA. As I exited my vehicle, I noted a new Boeing 767 or 777, (the aircraft hadn’t been painted yet, and was still in the green primer) coming down the length of the lake that runs north south, at an altitude of just two thousand feet and probably less. The sky was clear and visibility excellent. It’s not unusual to see these aircraft in this area, but I’d never seen one this low or flying so slowly. The flight path is a northerly one used out of Paine Field (approx 15 miles to the south) where these aircraft are manufactured and I assumed this to be a test flight. As I watched the aircraft come down the length of the lake, I was marveling at how quiet it was despite its low altitude and mentioned it to a lady who had pulled into the store a few seconds behind me and was also headed into the market, but like me, had stopped to watch the plane. “What’s that?” she asked and pointed at an object in the sky to the right of the aircraft (west) and perhaps 50 feet below its altitude. I had been focused on the aircraft, but immediately saw what she was pointing at. At this time the aircraft was approximately a half mile or less distant. The object was round, bright white, and moving to the east. In size from my location, it approximated a pencil eraser held at arms length. As I watched, it passed directly under the aircraft (that seemed to take no note of it) missing it by about 50 feet and allowing me to estimate it diameter which was approximately 15 feet. In appearance, it was cloud like, but very round with somewhat fuzzy borders. Silhouetted against the blue sky, I could see it very clearly, and it was definitely not a bird, balloon, or another aircraft. I estimated its speed at 120 miles per hour as it covered the width of the lake (a half mile) in about 15 seconds. The aircraft passed over my head a few seconds later, but I was watching the object that maintained a constant course and speed, finally disappearing in the east fifteen or twenty seconds later. I talked briefly with the woman I watched it with and she agreed that it was something highly unusual. A few years previous to this sighting I was a passenger in a car on a highway between Butte and Helena Montana. In the sky that day, (afternoon) and on a southerly course, I saw a similar object (bright white, cloud like, but very round.) It was moving at both altitude (approximately 5000 feet) and speed (approximately 1000 miles per hour) I derived these numbers from the height of a broken cumulus deck that I estimated to be 8000 feet and the fact the object seemed to be moving approximately twice the speed of a conventional jet liner. They are by no means accurate, but probably in the ball park. I could make no estimate of size beyond saying it was small. I had the object in sight for about thirty seconds when it did something damn strange. It disappeared and not gradually. It just evaporated. I mention it only because of the physical similarity to the object I saw at Lake Goodwin under pristine viewing conditions. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in May2003 is approximate.

At 11:35 PM I walked my two daughters to their cars outside my house after a party and we stood talking for a few minutes while Rachel got in her car.  Rachel, age 30, saw a very large shooting star to the West, then a brightly lit ""cloud"" above the same area to the West of our location at approximately 60 degrees from the horizon.  She pointed to the cloud and followed it heading North.  The full moon was out, the cloud ceiling was low and it was windy.  The scattered clouds were moving very fast. It was easy to see the sky, stars, moon, and clouds. At that point, at approximately 11:40 PM, Maria and I both saw a large black round disk-shaped object that appeared to be on it side (top or bottom facing us).  The size was larger than a dessert plate held at arm's length. It was moving slowly from Southeast to Northwest along the bottom of the cloud ceiling, and moving slower than the clouds, which were clipping along at a fast pace. It was very windy.  The full moon shone brightly and I assume that is the only reason we could see the object.  There were no visible lights on the object. Maria, age 32, saw this at the same time I did, but Rachel did not, even though she was looking in the same area.  After a few seconds, the object changed to a gray color, then just vanished.   I then said outloud  ""We want to see evidence of any persons not of this world"" and all of us looked in the same direction where the black object had been and I was pointing.  Right after I said this a shooting star appeared in that same spot.  Then we saw lots of shooting stars all around the sky (probably a meteor shower).  Rachel left for home. Maria got in her Suburban to leave, but I noticed a bunch of tiny twinkling lights above the center of the hood of her vehicle appear for 2 seconds, then they disappeared.  I was looking at this area trying to figure out what the lights were when I noticed a reflection of a rectangular light that came on then blinked off on her hood.  Maria got out of the car and the light appeared again.  I soon figured out that it was blinking on and off every 25 seconds, so we knew it had to be something mechanical.  Being square was odd, though.  So she turned off her car and I turned off all the lights in and outside the house in order to see if we could identify the source of the light.  It continued to blink on and off, being an amber color, white, or blue at different times.  There were two spots close together where the lights appeared.  We could not locate the source. We tried blocking the lights out with our hands, and checked the trees moving in the wind that might be blocking or unblocking lights.  The one light continued to blink off and on at regular intervals of 25 seconds. The only reflection of light on the hood that we could identify was the moon, which was in a different location from the blinking lights.  Then I realized something and said ""OMG"" - and Maria finished my sentence with ""It's something we can't see and it's above us.""  I ran inside and grabbed my video camera which I had charged up the night before and it went dead after 3 seconds.  Maria got her Sony digital camera out of the car and video-taped and took photos of the car and in the sky above us. Note: The photos came out very dark and smudgy. I got the night vision monocular out but could see nothing.  I then saw a tiny orb appear inside Maria's vehicle, then disappear.  I fully expected to see a ship hoovering right above us!  We could feel the presence of something. Then, 45 minutes after starting, the lights stopped at approximately 12:35 AM.  Since this date, strange things have been happening around my house and my psychic abiliti! es have improved, almost to the point of being annoying.  I see a golden glow around all living things, and this is rather distracting.  Also see details in energy fields around humans.

There is more, but I don't have room to put it all down here.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,39.07880845410628,-94.38608574879227

At 3 AM on December 14th 2008 I was on a boat coming in from a long night out.  Our vessel was coming into a pier on the Seattle waterfront. I was a crew member who had to set my lines (to tie up the vessel) on the stern (back of the boat), and we were about 10 minutes out  from the pier. Since the boat was large I could not communicate or see the captain or the mate >>(who was getting lines ready at the front of the boat). << I got my lines ready and was anticipating going home soon. Since I had to stay at the stern, I just waited and looked around.  I looked west across Elliott Bay, across the Puget Sound and to the Olympic Mountains. ( the Olympics are about 40-50 miles west of Seattle) It was a cold beautiful night, lots of stars and a few clouds at the base of the Olympics. At the southern part of the mountain range I saw a shooting star falling hard and fast from the sky . I thought “cool” I’m going to make a wish! The star started to intensify getting brighter. I began to think to myself “WOW, that thing is going to smash into the mountains and there’s going to be a huge flash” But as  it came down, it stopped abruptly halfway down the mountain range, turned a glowing red and shot horizontally northward. The red light never blinked or changed color. It moved so fast that I could not believe what I was seeing!? It moved faster than anything I have ever seen. As it moved, it illuminated the cloud formations nestled along the lower side of the mountain range. I watched it until it disappeared at what I could say was Hurricane Ridge, Port Angles area ( I know it disappeared northwesterly  of the Olympics.)

They were in formation and equidistant from one another. They were flickering like what I would call afterburners on a jet from behind but there was nothing there. The only thing you could see is the four lights and they stayed exactly the same as it traversed from North to South right over us here. I watched thinking maybe I was looking at some birds that were reflecting the early morning sun, but then I saw a bird fly by and it looked totally different. These lights went South for about 20 seconds, not really fast but at a steady rate until they just poofed out of existence. I am absolutely certain that what I saw was not a natural phenomenon. It was four lights attached to something that was apparently invisible. Yesterday here in Denver Colorado it was a record cold day and I was actually wondering if maybe it was something we have built with some kind of new stealth technology but because of how cold it was out the exhaust was unable to be hidden. One last comment is that whatever I saw was close enough to me for me to notice that is made absolutely NO SOUND. I am going to watch with my camera in hand when I go outside from now on just in case I see it again I can photograph it for analysis. Oh, and another thing, I usually do not go outside at that time so maybe I had not ever seen it before because of the timing so I am going to go out at the same time again for a while to see if I can catch it.

I awakened for an unknown reason while sleeping in my bed on the upstairs floor of a 3 level unit. The blinds are the same as the lower level, and the light comes through them well. So, there was a good amount of light in my room. I was still trying to come to a full awake state. My arms and legs were disabled, but I could move my mouth and see with my eyes.  I was sleeping on my right side of my body in a half fetal position. The being was standing at the side of my bed, facing me, at about the halfway point of my mattress. It was staring at me. I stared back at it, and I was a bit frightened by the appearance of this being: especially due to it being at my bedside as I woke. I attempted to move my arms and legs, but to no avail. This angered me. I then proceeded to show my teeth in a fierce manner to this being. I guess I did this because it was my only method left of self defense. I was very unfortable not being able to move my arms and legs. This being disappeared right in front of my eyes. One second it was in front of me, the next it was gone. No movement. Just gone!  The being was brown in color, but unlike the previous contact being. This being had a human-like appearance in bodily form (legs, arms, round head, etc.), but looked nothing like a human in any other way. It had a dark brown color to it. It almost appeared to have a slimy texture to it (outward skin). Further, although I can not completely recall: I think the being could change the coloring of itself slightly. I am not saying brown to blue, I mean dark brown to light brown.  I was scared for a few days after this. I had issues of not wanting to fall asleep. It seems that this is the time they appear, and catch me off-guard. I would much prefer if I was walking in a field, and saw them 30 feet in front of me. Then, we would be on a bit more of a fair playing field!  Whatever is going on, I know that they are here now!

It was on December 17, 2008, on my way home from Marshall, Missouri when I first noticed the strange lights. I was driving North on 65 hwy in the direction towards home.  Not yet out of town, by our local radio station, KMMO, I saw a small red light resembling a planet approx. a mile above the KMMO station.  It was moving in small circles, slowly getting lower to the ground, closer to the hwy and dangerously close to my car.  The light changed in color to a yellow green and white, and a possible shape took forward as a string of lights appeared in a disc shape resembling a Frisbee but I saw only the lights. It was raining quite hard this night. The object got closer to the hwy and my car. When it was no more than three car lengths in front of my vehicle and going no more than 20 mph, I slammed on my brakes, afraid of hitting the object, though all I saw were its vast lights. No more than a few feet from the ground and getting within a car length of my car, I started to panic and dig into my coat pocket for my cell.  I called home and described to my Dad exactly what I was witnessing. By this time, the object had stayed this car length from my car and took up both lanes of the hwy spanning at least 30 feet in length but no more than a couple of feet in height. I was close to my gravel road, country road 425, a right turn from the hwy about 7 miles from town. Hesitant, I turned. The object was out of sight for a moment and I was relieved. My car died and I reached for my cell once again. My cell appeared dead. I turned the key and my car started. The lights came into view again to my left on the gravel road but at least 50 feet out in the fields. Appearing to be intrigued by my vehicle the lights moved as my car moved but remained in the field. At the second turn, the lights still in view, my car died again. The object moved closer, at least a car length, to the left of my car, and though it was raining and I had my windshield wipers as fast as they would go to keep my vision from being obstructed by the rain, it appeared the rain had stopped. I looked in front of me and saw the lights from the church on our gravel road. It was still pouring, if not raining harder. The closer the object got, no rain fell on my windshield. I started my vehicle again and looked to my left. The object had distanced itself from me but continued to follow along side my car. A mile and a half on the gravel road, the object stopped in an empty field to my left at least 100 ft. from the gravel road. The field where the lights settled a few feet from the ground often floods in rain and those crops are lost in the summer. My car dies again but starts easily a third time. I continue to drive home but the object did not follow but remained stationary in the field,  a good 30-35 ft of lights, parallel to the horizon.  The object was still in view a good mile through my rearview but seemed to not move. Over the railroad tracks my car died again. I find the constant dying in relation with the encounter strange, since I had my car only a month and it was fairly new: an 07’. I made it home, the object, I assumed still in that field. I ran to the house, falling a few times in my frightened hurry, to my dad on the computer in our dining room. I gave him a brief summary and suggested we drive down to the object in a different vehicle. My dad was not in a huge hurry. We left a half hour later. Not to my surprise, the object was gone.  I did call the Sherriff's Dept. to report the incident. The dispatcher said they'd send someone out to investigate, but no one came to question me. My family later learned that a number of individuals had reported seeing odd lights near Marshall on the same evening.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,39.0866,-93.1495

There was a thin, high band of clouds somewhat obscuring the sun, and I noticed a 'rainbow effect' by the disc of the sun, presumably due to ice crystals in the clouds.  I then noticed, about 50-55 degrees above the eastern horizon, what looked like a satellite, moving toward WSW in a slow, somewhat halting fashion. After about a minute it seemed to change course to due west. It did not increase or decrease in brightness, as a tumbling satellite reflecting sunlight would. Also, the sun was behind it.  I could not determine altitude using the clouds as a guide, because the object was away from the clouds, but it looked to be much higher than a normal aircraft.  There was no contrail or sound. I wish to emphasize that the object looked very much like a satellite that you see after sundown would.  I watched, craning my neck as far as possible until I had to get up and walk on the gravel driveway (in barefeet-ouch!) I took my eyes of the object for just a second, but could not find it again.  It would have been directly over my house.  I went inside, and it was exactly 0900 hours.  As a sidenote, my Dad was an aeronautical engineer for Boeing,  and I know a plane when I see one.  I am also an amateur astronomer, and this may well have been the ISS space station or a satellite of some sort, but the fact that it changed direction, was slow and halting and so bright makes me scratch my head and wonder what it was.

After knocking on windows for another minute or so to no avail, I momentarily took my eyes off the object three times and was easily able to re-sight the object each time until the third time and then the object was gone when I looked back up.

No sounds were heard, no motors, no engines. There was some heavy winds just before we saw these lights. Then we saw 2 more lights, one was above the other. They sat for a while, blinking silvery lights, then one went in the same direction as the first. After a short time the other did the same thing. There are dogs on both sides on the hills. The dogs on the side where the lights were first seen barked and howled constantly. The dogs on the side where the lights went only barked when the lights passed by them. There was a soft glow where we first saw the lights. After the 4th light left the glow was gone and the dogs stopped barking.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,37.3157,-82.3907

I have never seen anything like this. It actually looked like a special effect in a movie. I am in shock a little and have problems that no one believes me.

It seemed to burn out briefly however reignited at the same intensity, which caught our attn (since normally you would expect a meteor to burn out).  However while still approaching the horizon at a fast speed, we’re thinking it’s going to hit the ground, however the blue flare suddenly shifted horizontally (cardinal West) and faded to an faint orange dot (similar in size to viewing a satellite in orbit with the naked eye). Visibility was great since we were well removed from any city lights; the Milky Way was faintly visible, which for So Cal Suburbs is normally rare. This orange dot then reversed completely 180 degrees then arced slowly counterclockwise to 0 degrees and rose in altitude quite a distance(for about 5-7 seconds). More amazingly is when we saw the same cobalt blue flare return (more oval shaped without the entry trail) and blink every second for a total of 24 blinks as it lowered to the horizon and behind a hill between our city and a neighboring community. It was difficult to gauge the distance of the object from us, but looked to be within the local vicinity, possibly as far as Fillmore, directly North.  Not knowing the actual size of this object, this could have been further North, as far as Bakersfield.

I thought the helicopter was low due to the size of the lights, but then a light cloud passed between me and the object and I lost sight for a second or two.

It seemed to leave a round ""cloud"" of vapor that lasted for perhaps a minute before disappearing and leaving a perfectly clear sky.  The light beam was very high in the sky and we never did see or hear a vehicle.  We don't know what caused this but speculated that it could have been landing lights on a jet plane showing up in a jet  trail or the clouds. Or could it be the exhaust from a military jet (or rocket) going supersonic?  The beam of light seemed somewhat unusual in that it seemed to spread out more, almost appearing like a jet trail. The light beams seemed to point downward to the earth and the direction of movement seemed to be upward.  We get a lot of jet traffic in the sky from New York (JFK, La Guardia) and and Newark airports. But this was different than anything we've ever seen before.

Over motorway On Saturday 20th December 2008, at approx. 18:00 my husband and I were travelling along the A11 motorway just past Le Mans in France, when I looked out of the window and saw what apeared to be a weird cloud formation (fog like) travelling at the same speed as our vehicle (80mph). Then all of a sudden a circle of lights, about 10, with an inner circle of lights, crossed in front of our vehicle, from left to right and then back again. At this point my husband who was driving also witnessed this. Although no solid body of a ship could be seen the formation and movements of the lights would be as if they were part of a solid moving object.  The lights indicated an object that would have been the size of 4 lanes of the motorway, they came across the motorway low flying, stopped, rotated and shot off  at considerable speed, until they could no longer be seen. I thought this would be the end of our encounter, when suddenly the lights were back, crossed in front of us right to left,  rotated and shot off, again disapearing from sight. They returned again and I could see them from the left hand window of our vehicle, slightly lagging behind. The whole incident lasted about 10-15 minutes before I could no longer see them.  My camera was not handy, so I did not get a photograph. I did not want to take my eyes off of the lights for one minute. I should have written every detail down at the time but did not. I counted the outer ring of lights, sure that I would never forget how many there were, I am fairly sure there were 10 but it is amazing how even when something truly amazing happens if you don’t write it down imediately, you doubt yourself.  The lights were dull and smoking which is why when they were side on apeared cloud like. My husband and I were travelling to Switzerland where we were on holiday for 3 weeks. I have suffered from a nervous skin condition ever since.  My husband and I are nearly 50 years old. My husband is an accountant and not the sort of person who imagines things.

I thought nothing more about it until, having parked my car in my garage in Lindfield and walking across the back garden towards the house, I looked up and saw, almost directly above me, an orange glowing object (much the same as I had seen a few minutes previously) moving fairly rapidly roughly on a course of 080deg(T). At first I thought it was an aircraft except that the orange glow was more like a spent firework, there was no sound and no navigation lights. My next thought was that it was the ISS or a satellite. The ISS was ruled out by its appearance and the lateness of the hour and its angular movement appeared to be too fast for a satellite as well as being too large and the wrong colour. I was still trying to decide what the object was when another one appeared, exactly on the same course as the second (and, as far as I can tell, the first).  On this occasion I went out of my garden gate into the adjacent road in order to keep the object in sight for longer. The night sky was completely clear and cloudless and there was complete silence. The object continued on a dead straight course towards the east and gradually faded from view as it became more distant. I waited for several minutes but did not see any further unusual airborne activity.  I am 63 years of age, in good physical health and on the occasion of the sightings, totally sober. I have been employed as a pilot since the age of 18, first as a fast-jet pilot in the RAF and later as a captain with a British airline.  I estimate that the height of the objects was between 1000ft and 5000ft mainly because my first sighting in the car would not have been possible had they been very much higher or lower (assuming they were on the same course). They could have been conventional aircraft except that they were totally silent and also displaying no anti-collision or navigation lights, just a dull orange glow. The speed is very difficult to judge without knowing the height and size but if they had been at 3000ft they would have been travelling at around 250-350 kts.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

We were in the worst part of a windstorm with SW winds sustained at 34MPH (54KPH) and gusts to 62MPH (99KPH).  As she was finishing up brushing her teeth I took a look outside to see the trees swaying in the high winds and saw an aircraft in an unusual position in the sky. Living outside Rochester, which has an international airport, it is not unusual to see planes, mostly incoming, approach from the east, headed west along New York state route 441 which later becomes Elmwood Avenue and leads a nearly straight line to the Rochester airport.  On this night, however, the aircraft I saw was at least a mile north of route 441 and had a spotlight similar to those I saw on police helicopters when I lived in Los Angeles.  It also had blue and red lights, but the spotlight was most noticeable. I opened the door to get a better look. My daughter, a firm believer that UFO’s are not real, saw what I was looking at and her exact words were “Is that a UFO?”  I told her it looked like a helicopter.  However, within a minute it was nearly overhead and we couldn’t hear it.  Its’ speed was much slower than most planes, and the spotlight (which was pointed toward the ground, but slightly to the right of its’ flight path) was very bright.  The speed and the spotlight seemed to suggest that it was a helicopter, except there was no sound. The object continued past our house where it seemed to pick up the path of route 441-west, towards the Rochester airport.  My daughter captured some video on her cell phone but it was captured through a closed window and appears to be a speck of light in a dark sky when viewed.  The flight path, the red, white and blue lights and the speed all seem to point towards a helicopter, or maybe even a small plane flying into a 40- to 70-knot headwind. But why would a helicopter be using such a bright spotlight? There were no police chases here that night.  And, its’ speed was faster than any possible police chase on these curvy, hilly roads.  It traveled at least 5 miles in about 2 minutes. And it was at a height of several thousand feet, too high for the spotlight to illuminate the ground.  It was cloudy and windy, but no fog or rain or snow to explain the use of the bright spotlight.  I also considered the possibility that an aircraft had landing gear trouble. To both of us, this seemed like it might have been a UFO and it might have been a helicopter with a bright spotlight.  It is possible that the wind was howling so loudly that it drowned out the helicopter sounds.  This sighting was unique enough to get my un-believing daughter to think it might be a UFO.  I’ve seen much stranger objects, back when I lived in the Hudson Valley region of New York State; objects the size of football fields that moved unlike any aircraft, and this sighting does not come close in comparison.  The object we saw, though, is still unexplained as far as we are concerned.  We are also aware of the obvious implication of seeing something unidentified flying across the sky on Christmas Eve night, but for now we’ll just call it a UFO. At the time of the sighting, we were at 43.15 degrees North, 77.34 degrees West looking East initially, then South, and lastly Southwest as we lost sight of it.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,43.1550415206858,-77.61785896384644

It was low in the sky and what made me notice the object was the changing of colors. Red, white, yellow and a brilliant blue that sequenced in a rotary manner. The object remained in one position for over forty five minutes and never moved like a plane. It took the object over and hour to move away to the north west.

I was hoping that someone else would report the incident to confirm what I had saw.

It was so unusual and SO LOW in the sky that it appeared you could touch them, i.e. they were reachable somehow at the treetop line.  These lights could NOT be ignored.  Anyone who saw them would have stopped in wonder.  THIS WAS NOT A PLANE OR A BALLOON OR A STAR.

They seemed to have been there awhile, because they were still where we had first noticed them and not moving.  We stayed and watched them, discussing it for about 5 minutes (What to do?  Was this a UFO?), when “it” suddenly “seemed” to move very slowly over a field beyond us not far from its original location but out in the open.  “It” was no longer above the trees but at the same height or a little higher.  It was very difficult to calculate distance from the ground because the lights were so big, they seemed very close.  They seemed to be in the “air” near the ground not “high enough up in the sky” where a plane would fly.  We drove that way in the car, as it was on our way home, and continued to look as we drove by it.  We could not see anything but those lights (white) in the same formation.  Then it literally vanished in less than a second.  No noise was! heard, no perceptible movement in its departure.  We thought to report it, but my husband said “everything is explainable” so we didn’t want to appear foolish.  Others MUST have seen this, though no other cars were on the road where we were at the time.  We laughed about it and our 11 year old said it might be Santa.  We left it at that, but it has been bothering me and thought I should report it.  It was just very strange.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

Fourth Floor of Valley Fair Mall where the food court doors are. I was on the fourth floor of Valley Fair mall in the early morning and was watching the usual government chemtrail's killing us on a daily basis, that's when I noticed a small orb or sphere that could maybe fit a single person in it. It was about 200 to 300 yards away I have more than perfect 20/20 vision I can see perfect far and close. I noticed the chemtrail coming out of the back of the plane when the orb appeared and did three full circles around the chemtrail itself and then flew to the very end of the chemtrail and back to the very front of the chemtrail right behind the plane. After that it quickly broke away from the chemtrail and flew towards Valley Fair mall about maybe 50 to 100 yards closer. It then did a sudden sharp turn and seemed to slowly and leisurely fly toward the Mount Hamilton area and disappeared. The orb was silver and smooth I could not see any widows, lights, markings, or contrails coming from it.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,37.3388420218894,-121.88970568836406
