It was after dusk and my mom was showing me one of the planets that were really bright in the sky. She had gone back inside and after a while I happened to look up and noticed a large triangular object overhead. We were at my aunts apartment and this helped me with gage the size of it.  The length of the craft was 2.5 to 3 times the length of her apartment building and the width was about 1.5 the length of the building.  I hovered, making no noise, about 3 telephone pole lengths above the height of a telephone pole. There were lights on the underside and sides visible that I have not seen since.  I remember looking up at it and then looking down to street level, ( I was in back patio area) and looking to the street only 20ft away, I saw a woman walking west.  All she had to do was look up and she would have saw it.  I went back insi! de and told my mom ""I need to show you something."" she came out and I asked her to look up.  She looked up a little and said ""What?"" I told her to look up higher  a couple times and she looked up and saw it. I remember the look of her mouth dropping open and me asking her ""what is it?""  She said she didn't know.  We watched it and it did move ever so slowly still no sound. It was still there but she decided to go to the phone booth and called the news stations and although they said there had been thousand of calls they could give no info and directed her to call the national guard.  She talked to someone and told them what we saw but they would give no information on  what it was but did ask what our names, ages, location of sighting, and social security numbers. We returned back to the apartment and talked to my aunts room mate and I remember her turning pale, not talking, and leaving. Later she told of following seeing several in the 82nd and Division area.  Forgive me for bei! ng long winded I just wish I knew what it was. I have searched! for loc al articles but have yet to see anything resembling what I saw.  Even other triangle pictures do not look like what i observed.  Can you help?",2011-10-10T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

Date: 8 September 2011  To: UFO Research Web Site  Subj: Encounter  INTRO: I'm presenting this record 35 years after-the-fact as (1) I am now retired and (2) at my age I am no longer concerned about ridicule and skeptics. For the record I have never ""investigated"" UFO's or done any research on them. I only visited a UFO web site once, and that was just yesterday! I will say however, of all the reports I've ever heard about on TV, I have never heard of a incident similar to the one I am about to describe. THE SETTING: LOCATION & TIME: Leominster, MA; Mid-July, 1976; Late evening. WEATHER: Clear, warm, calm winds. WITNESSES: Myself and wife and one neighbor (two days later). LIGHTING CONDITIONS: 	a. OUTSIDE: Dark (no Moon to my recollection) and one Street lamp a hundred yards+ to the NE (across & up the street) . Also, this lamp was blocked by neighbor house, not directly visible. A street lamp directly across the street was not working at the time. 	b. INSIDE (house): Table lamp (2), 40W bulb each, no active TV.  THE INCIDENT: It was a Saturday evening and wife & I had just come home from visiting family across town. I had gone to bedroom on SE corner of house to get ready for bed. My wife had just come out of bathroom and gone into living room to turn the TV on for evening news & weather, when she called me to come and look outside with her. This was at the opposite end of the house or towards the west or NW.  She directed me to the raised (open) window facing west, where our large garden was located. There was a bright beam of white light shining onto the garden from above. The light was extremely bright, in a straight column, not 'angled' at all and I would estimate the width to be 15-20 feet. My first thought was ""Why would a Helicopter be shining a spot light on our garden?"" I then realized there was absolutely no noise or 'wind' associated with this beam of light. Both of us tried to look UP to see what was causing this, but the light was so bright nothing but the light could be seen. As the light slowly moved west-to-east, basically along the north side of our house, it was apparent the beam had defined edges. By that I mean, where the beam ended it was normal dark (outside) and the light didn't 'splash' over or fade away. At this time, while the light was slowly proceeding east, we noticed a faint sound associated with the light that went: TICK, TICK, TICK, BOOM. Where each 'TICK' was like gently tapping two pieces of metal together, and the 'BOOM' was like hearing a base drum from far away.  All were very faint, but auditable and in sequence. The sound stayed with the light throughout the incident. We followed the light and the ""TICK, TICK, TICK, BOOM"" as it crossed the street, went over some woods and then out of sight. The sound slowly faded and was gone after the light was no longer visible. The entire incident lasted approximately 5-7 minutes. The light was visible as it passed across the street, over the woods and then out of sight. Even then, nothing could be seen at the ""top"" of the beam or from where it was emitting. It was simply a beam of light that seemed to have no source, and it was accompanied by that sound: TICK, TICK, TICK, BOOM.

I had come to Laredo to visit my family, as I had been living in Mexico since 1956.   My cousins knew I was interested in UFOs and that I believed there was life in other planets.  They told me that there had been a lot of sightings recently in Laredo with people calling in to tv & radio stations etc. about it.  That afternoon, my cousin drove my mother and me to her house.  She parked her car on Davis St. looking north to let us out and then she started yelling, ""The thing! The thing!"" I looked at her and said, ""What thing?""  She then pointed straight ahead and again repeated the same words.  I looked towards where she was pointing and a short distance away, hovering right above the trees was The  Thing.  It was dusk and I could see clearly the oval shaped ufo with lighted windows all around it.  As my cousing changed shifts to drive toward! s it, it zipped away in an instant.  One minute it was there, the next it was gone.  We were very excited about our experience which I have never forgotten and still tell people about it, especially because it was such a close encounter.  It wasn't like way up in the sky and is it or isn't it.  We know what we saw.   At that time it didn't occur to any of us to report it. Now I wish I had.

I was living in Fremont, California, and my friends and I heard reports of UFOs leaving craters in the hills surrounding Fremont.  We determined to go check them out, and took off for a drive. S had a license and a car, so D, N, and I, and perhaps one other who I can’t recall exactly, drove out to the boonies. D, my best guy friend, and N, my best girlfriend, have stayed in touch over the years, and have said to one another on several occasions, ""That really happened, didn’t it?""   We climbed up into the open hills, broke through some trees, and came to a large open field, with no sign of houses or buildings anywhere. In those days we even had dark skies in Fremont.  There was a small hill about 20 acres away.  On top of it were 2 large, very bright white lights. S was kind of the freaky type, and immediately turned the car around to escape.  But we convinced him to stop, so we could check this out, and we all got out of the car to look, standing at the back of it.  We were pondering reasonable explanations, when one of the lights suddenly floated straight up a short distance and stopped.  Then the second light floated up next to it, and as it arrived at that level, the first light started coming rapidly straight at us, followed right away by the second. D and I were rather frozen. N actually raised her arms and said, ""I want to go with them.""  starting to walk forward. S totally freaked and started running toward the driver’s seat. He was well known for erratic behavior and ditching people at the side of the road. I do think there was another person who ran to the car also. D and I had to grab N and drag her back to the revving car, S barely able to restrain himself. We zoomed back off the way we had come, towards the trees. N was angry and disappointed.  I recall looking out the back window and seeing them nearly on top of us as we entered the trees. The next thing I remember is all of us laughing wildly about how we had escaped them, especially S. I recall that we arrived home quite late, around 1:00 AM, and thinking that we must have gone farther out than we realized. The following summer I was camping with the B family, who I spent most all I spent all my time with. They are a second family to me. We were at the American River, sitting on the bank. I spied a large, orange glowing light hovering over a hillside, and pointed it out to them. We watched the light slowly settle and disappear behind the trees. I was excited, but the parents quickly downplayed it, not wanting to scare the kids.  We headed back up to bed shortly after. I was alone in a small tent, and I have a strong association of the color orange, likely the color of a pup tent back then.  I had just lay down, when I felt completely frozen, unable to move, like a great weight was upon me.  Then I felt, what I’d only been able to describe in the words of my time for downloading, that my brain was a tape, and everything about me was on it, and it was being reeled out of my head. I tried to resist the process and was ""“told"" rather sternly, ""Don’t try to resist, you know we can squash you like an ant.""   So I submitted, scared to death. It seems that throughout this I was surrounded by orange, perhaps light shining through the tent. It took about as long as stripping a reel to reel tape at a quick steady speed.  Then it was over, the weight lifted, and I felt totally exhausted, drained. I explored my mind a great deal to be sure it was still intact. Then I fell asleep once reassured. Of course I told this story to others, but nobody really believe! d me, except perhaps D and N. By the time school started, I was spending nearly all my time at B’s, hanging out and babysitting the kids after school. I had a dysfunctional home.  They lived at the outskirts of suburbia, in the farmland down a long, straight, dark road that eventually got to the main highway and the shopping center. Beyond the shopping center was the entrance to the suburb I lived in. Every night I rode my bike home by the same route, leaving at a time that would get me home by 10:00, curfew.  I allowed a little extra time for distractions en route. I searched the sky a lot on the long, dark road. For about a week I started seeing odd vehicles resembling planes, but with a red, white, and bluish light that differed in color from the panes.  They were silent.  This was a well-traveled plane route, so there were many planes to compare with.  Each night I would see one pass one way or the other, each time a little lower in the sky. I began to be afraid, as it appeared they were coming for me. People started thinking I was crazy when I told them about these sightings, and I made them uncomfortable. One night I convinced D to make the trip with me. He saw one, and they were getting lower now. But he quickly and angrily dismissed it when I said I wanted him with me when they came, I didn’t want to be alone. Then he finally started treating me like I was crazy. One night, I made it past the dark road and through the shopping center, just entering the suburb, when I saw one again. The same lights, as low and as large as a 747 coming in for a landing, came gliding silently toward me, then stopped directly over my head.  I had stopped my bike with my foot on the ground, and looked up, studying this thing. It was black. I could clearly discern a kite type shape, with rounded edges, perhaps more like a Vick’s cough drop. The white light, positioned forward of the other two, seemed very bright. The next thing I knew, I was peddling as fast as I could, head down, not looking back, terrified. I was down the road a bit from where I’d stopped. I got home and immediately told my brother about it. He is a big autistic-genius-science geek who taught and teaches me all about the sky, as astronomy is his great obsession.  He and my oldest brother had taken a picture of a flying saucer in daylight years before, so I assumed he would hear me on this. He got angry, told me I was crazy and started treating me so. I just shut my mouth for good after that. I just had to live with this on my own. I was afraid to even look up at the sky for many years. The oddest thing was, even though I had zoomed home, I arrived 40 minutes late. I was never late. In fact, I should have been early if anything. I checked the time on our clock. It was correct. I thought there might be a problem with the B’s clock that I always used, but checked it the next day. It was fine. I have no idea what happened to me that night, only that it scared the wits out of me for a good long time.  When I finally got brave enough to search the skies again, I had many more strange sightings, and continue to do so to this day.

She did not drink, and I hadn’t for several weeks. (I was 22 at the time.)(She wished not to be named at all.)   From our drivers side, I noticed lights moving slowly over the tree line from our left to our right in the distance.  I of course first assumed it to be an aircraft, although it was not moving fast enough in my opinion to maintain flight. ‘Curious,’ I thought. ‘Were we about to witness a crash?’  As we approached it, and it maneuvered in front of us, (almost directly over us) I pulled the car over to the side of the road to get a better look. I stepped from my vehicle to witness it continue to move slowly to our right, (completely silent), and then over the adjacent tree line.  It made no noise whatsoever. Lights of all colors and “girding,” or a series of railings could be seen, (in an unmistakable “diamond” configuration) on its entire underbelly, at the edge of each of its peripherals. I saw no outer “windows” or “occupants” as are seen by some observers of such crafts.  When “almost” directly under it, it could clearly be seen to be a solid object, as it blotted out all points of starlight beyond, that would have been apparent otherwise.  It was two to three times the width of any man made aircraft of the times, and three to four times the length. I (of course) had never seen anything like it before, nor have I witnessed anything even similar since.  Since then, (as a former police officer), I have estimated the incident to have lasted no more than 90 to 120 seconds. A short time indeed, unfortunately.

As we were driving this winding tree crowded road, we saw glimpses of what appeared to be a strange “plane” with a highly unusual fuselage and even stranger lights through breaks in the tree tops.  My boyfriend was the first to notice this puzzling sight.  He was convinced it was a UFO and hit the gas to chase it.  We were flying down this backroad trying to get to an open spot for a better look before it was gone.  He shut off the headlights so that we might be able to track it’s path better.  Then suddenly we broke out into the road leading up to the over pass for I-684 South, we were near Katonah, and we stopped the car on the over pass and all got out.  We looked around for it and suddenly there it was, about a mile away, coming North directly over I-684, why no one stopped or slowed on! the highway to watch this still puzzles me to this day.  It was huge!   In the shape of a chevron, it’s wingtips  eclipsed the edges of the highway, surpassing it on either side by at least 100 ft. on either side.  We watched it come in silence.  We were all holding our breath, in shock watching this amazing site.  It was no more than 100 feet above the highway and moving slow enough that due to it’s immense size it should have just dropped out of the sky were it using any kind of propulsion that we were familiar with.  It was moving so slowly that it scared us.  We walked from the car to the bridge rails faster than it was moving towards us.  But we stayed rooted to our spots, watching it come.  There were lights all along the bottom outer edge of the vessel, the lights spanned the bow of the ""ship"" from port to starboard, but did not encompass the aft or stern; this area stayed in darkness for the most part.  The lights were multi colored and flashed in a pattern similar ! to a chasing pattern.  The lights were blue, purple, green, wh! ite, red , yellow, pink many colors and the raced about the edge of the ship one color chasing another.  It was amazing to watch, the pattern changed sporadically with some areas blinking a set of colored lights while the rest continued their chasing racing pattern about the anterior.  We stood there for at least 10 minutes watching this, and still it came closer.  At the point where it was almost completely over us we saw a glowing light of a color I cannot name emanating from an area in the center of the underbelly.  We looked for markings but other than the lights saw nothing.  We looked hard at the shell to discern it color and composite, but it seemed to absorb the night around it so that all we could tell was the outline of the vessel.  It was at this point that we realized the only sound we heard was ourselves breathing very hard.  The vessel was utterly silent.  There was an odd occurrence, as if all of this were not  odd enough... not only was the ship silent as the grave bu! t we did not hear anything else, not all of the cars rushing directly under us at 70 mph, this was a Saturday Night and there were cars constantly rushing below us 2 and 3 at a time on 8 lanes.  We did not hear crickets or anything else but the wind, and even that seemed like a faraway breeze.  As we stood frozen to that spot, all thinking similar thoughts the ship stopped for more than a few beats, not moving at all and yet it did not fall out of the sky and crush us.  Now, this hits us all at the same time and the spell breaks.  We all drop our eyes and look around at one another and without a word we all simultaneously start to walk backwards slowly from the rail watching this “ship”.  Someone tripped or something and we all looked to see if he was okay, when we turned back the vessel had started to move ever so slowly north again, we turned with it to watch it move.  And without even blinking our eyes it was gone.  We could not fathom how it just disappeared and looked ! to the skies to see if we could find it, and there it was...ma! ybe 10 m iles up I-684 moving slowly again, directly over the highway and not veering from following it north. I was a 18 and leaving for college, my boyfriend was an advanced degree engineering student at a NYSU school, his friends were all business men from NYC.  We were all sober and not under the influence of anything. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2011-10-10T00:00:00,,

I saw a large perfectly round red ball in the air over a field.  The best way I could describe it would be a fire ball.  At first it looked as if it was falling to the earth but was too slow of a descent to be something falling.  The object stopped falling hovered and moved to the right and then started to ascend back into the sky again.  There probably is some logical explanation as to what I was seeing but for the life of me I can’t think what that explanation would be.

To make a long story short, I saw a UFO that I would like to report however at the time when I saw it, reporting was not an option and access to opportunities such as your sight were not provided. October of 1994, I saw a UFO hovering overhead above my location on the corner of Tremont Street and Anawan Street in Taunton Massachusetts.  It was roughly 250 to 300 feet above ground level, I saw it clearly and know precisely what I saw.  The craft is described as dark in color, circular, was hovering and moved at an estimated 5 to 8 miles per hour making not a single sound. I observed lights moving rapidly at a circular-flashing motion located underneath the craft as whitish/ reddish in color.  I maintained observation of the craft for roughly eight to ten seconds prior to it simply disappearing beyond the tree-line into thin air as if it wasn’t ever there. I respectfully request to report my account as I am prepared under the integrity of my office to make a full statement under oath if need be before the U.S. Congress, or any other agency (Private/ Government) charged with the responsibility of investigating such occurrences.  As a Police Officer, Integrity is hallmark which backs my abilty to openly speak of my account in 1994 these days.  As a former Marine, the courage to follow through with reporting and commitment to the public and people I serve is what makes me want to aide in the disclosure of the Phenomena and report my account (although past) for the world to know.

I was taking my wife home (she was then my girlfriend) down Airport Rd in Longmont. We were heading south and the event happened north of the airport. Back then, Airport Rd was a small, thin two lane road lined with telephone poles. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a long orange glowing object suddenly passing the other direction in the other lane between my car and the telephone poles that were lined up right against the lane going the other direction. The object was floating (traveling, but in the air) about the height of my car window. It was long and continuous, like a floating train passing in the other lane, but with no breaks (no ""train cars""). Couldn't have been a plane because there was no noise, it was long (took several seconds to pass - several), and a plane would have clipped its wings on either my car or the telephone poles lining the other side of the street. As mentioned, it was simi! lar to a train, but probably not as tall - maybe half the height. I never did take a direct look at it - was driving and got nervous - kept my eyes forward. Did not see it coming - it just all of a sudden was passing in the other direction on the side of us. The vehicle behind us (only other vehicle on the back then quiet road) began flashing its lights at us and honking as soon as the object passed (I remember what the vehicle was - but don't want to say in case anyone ever says it was them, so they can tell me what they were driving to prove it was them).  The object itself was nowhere to be seen.  I didn't stop for the other vehicle - I floored it instead - wish I would have stopped to talk with the other vehicle about what we had seen.  My wife usually denies this ever happened in front of other people - only confesses to me sometimes about what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As I was going down the hill, looking at the city, suddenly a huge, immense, flying object started passing almost in front of me, and on top of the city.  I stop the car in the middle of the road as I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  It was flying low, so low I could see how huge it was.  Unbelievable... it was almost at the bottom of the heavy clouds passing the opening in the sky.  I could see it passing, like in slow motion, like almost hoovering, without making any noise, nothing.  It was in a tilt position, like a dish, a plate... Huge, immense,like a football field,looked round but it was so big it could have been oval because the border of the tilt make me feel it was round or oval, looked heavy, the color was clear grey metalic but it was not shiny, on the tilted side I could see, there where four roads of blinking lights, like the christmas lights. I didn't see the top because it was tilted, only the bottom and the lights around the side. After being in my car looking at this scenario, I decided to walk outside the vehicle, to see if someone else was seeing it. But when I stepped out and looked at the sky, the flying object had dissapeared. I returned to the hospital as I was so impressed... I told my story to the ER doctors I work with and everyone believe me.  I was told they see things like that all the time.  For me was the first and the last.  I called the Air Force, the TV stations, the airport, but no one give me any attention.  I do believe that I saw a UFO, I think I was fortunate to see something like that in my life.

Summer  Night 2001  Oklahoma City,  I was sleeping in my bedroom and was suddenly startled and woken by an extremely loud sawing/grinding sound like a jet airliner was crashing into our one story house. I am not sure if the back yard was illuminated or not as we lived next to an alley with street lamps behind a shopping center that also had security lights on the back of their building and light would emit into our yard over our 6 foot privacy fence. I awoke to an extremely loud sawing noise that made me jump a little up in my bed and I was extremely terrified. I looked at my alarm clock and noticed it was showing 3:16 am.  Which struck me because I had recently converted to Christianity and I immediately thought of John 3:16 (for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son). I then immediately felt like something or someone might be in the house and coming to me.  I heard the door that leads out to the garage and to the back yard door open and shut. I was so frightened that I did not move but laid in my bed in fear. It took me a long time to go back to sleep. I kept thinking about all this and also asked my uncle who was my room mate and owned the house if he had gone anywhere early in the morning and he said no.  I knew he had gone to his room to go to bed a few hours before me so I was puzzled at the door sound.  I started to chock my experience up to a religious event and possibly a religious experience where I might have been visited by angels at 3:16am as a religious omen, but cannot explain why I was so terrified at the thought of them coming in my room after the grinding/saw sound.  It’s like subconsciously I new what that sound meant and it horrified me. I must disclose that I had two previously weird events before that I recalled. One was in 1997 while I was alone at night working security at an apartment complex overnight. It was early in the morning around 2 or 3am and a bright light shone down on my car as I sat in it. I got out after a few seconds to see what the light was looking for. I live in Oklahoma City and it is very common to have OKC. P.D.’s “Air One” police helicopter searching the area for suspects fleeing a crime scene. When I looked up at the light it was so bright I couldn’t make out what I was looking at, but the weirdest part was it made no sound and that freaked me out because I didn’t believe the police were using some conspiracy theory “Black Helicopters.” I remember I felt freaked out and went into the complex a moment later after the light left. I just wanted to get near other people so I felt safer. Since then I have seen strange anomalies a few times like cluster formations of what I thought were stars in a clear sky and then suddenly break out in different directions and disappear. When I would see this I would go immediately inside my house and turn on the T.V. and try not to think about what I saw as it scared me.  I have also had fits of sleep paralysis from time to time where I would swear I saw silhouettes near the bed moving around and I was completely terrified and couldn’t wake myself. I just chocked it up as sleep paralysis after some internet self diagnosing.  I feel like I have been visited and know things but can’t remember what it is.  I hope I am not to hallucinating any of these experiences because that would indicate possible mental illness and I don’t feel like I have mental health issues.  These occurrences felt genuine and not willed by thought but sudden instances. Thank you ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was about 100 to 150 feet above the ground moving in the southern direction with us at the same rate of speed.  The only visable feature of this UFO was a band of lights moving in the counterclockwise direction.  The lights reminded me of a track used on heavy equipment like a bulldozer track.  The individual foot pads (like on a track) were lite very bright (kinda white/yellow color) just like the color of a light bulb.  There was even spaces between each light just like the spaces between the pads on a bulldozer track.  The rate of movement on the lights was about 50 t! o 60 RPM.  As I stated before we could not see any shape at all besides these lights, nothing.  The size of this object was about 10 times the size of our vehicle (1977 Monty Carlo).  The UFO stayed with us for 1 to 2 minutes and disappeared as quickly as it appeared.  We did not see it arrive or leave, it just appeared and then disappeared.

Within 5 minutes of leaving my house (6:30 pm) to get an early start on “trick or treating”, I noticed what appeared to be 3 orange balloons in the northern sky above a field.  I told my sister, who’s 2 yrs. my senior, to “ look at the orange Halloween balloons”.  Upon second glance, they came into sharp focus as 3 bright orange, glowing, bell-shaped objects approx. 1 mile north of our location heading east at a medium-slow speed. These were not balloons by any means, but glowing, mechanical, craft not like anything military or commercial.  After discussing this with my sister, we agreed these were something extraordinary.  Based on the speed and direction we looked up at the sky where they should’ve been and they were completely gone.  Vanished. I have not seen anything similar before or after that event, but I still discuss it with her every few years.  Had I saw it only by myself at that age, I may have disregarded it as an illusion.  But the fact that my older sister was there to witness it and still testify it as fact, makes me realize what we saw was a group of UFO’s.

It was when I was walking along Ocean Parkway in the direction of Avenue X from Avenue Z ,heading to the library on Avenue X, that I had my sighting. Off to my left, I noticed a ,seemingly, toy-like object just above the row of houses. Yes, it was that low to the ground. I quickly realized that this was something very unusual. It was a pyramid-shaped metallic object that was rotating as it was ascending into the sky. When I tell people about it, I describe it as being a pyramid-shaped capsule and as being toy-like. I know it was metallic because the sunlight reflected off of it like sunlight would reflect off a shiny piece of metal. It didn't ascend straight up but actually ,maybe, at a 45 degree angle. The rotation or spin seemed to be somewhat slow but at a steady or consistent rate. Maybe less than a minute after first spotting it, it disappeared through the clouds and I could no longer see it. My current thought on it is that it was taking off ,maybe, from someones roof when I was seeing it. I want to point out that this was in broad daylight in the middle of the afternoon and in a main area. It was very busy was alot of traffic and people and there were planes in sky too. There were 2 people that were standing just a couple of feet in front of me ,while I had the sighting. Unfortunately, I didn't say anything to them and I did wish ,afterward, that I had said something. But, there had to be other people who saw it too. I always tell people about it even though the reaction is not good. I made sure that I remembered the date which was on April 06, 2004. I tell people about how  this sighting was traumatizing to me because it ,momentarily, took me out of the reality I was in ,so to speak, and made me aware of another kind of existence. This existence being other-worldly. Being a man of scientific thought, I always try to analyze and understand what I saw. I believe that the object was in some kind of anti-gravity space and it was rotating to provide gravity ,inside of it, for its occupants. But, no matter how much I think about it I can't know how it's doing it. I could only watch in amazement. Just this past year, I came to a startling realization. It is quite possible that these pyramid-shaped objects were commonly seen back thousands of years ago and this could be what inspired the Egyptians and others to build the pyramids. This may be what ancient civilizations did to pay worship to these objects.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

The lights faded within four seconds, all at the same time and left a ""perforation"" circle for each which lasted one second.  Nothing was left in their place - no craft or smoke, just clear pristine air.  Please report back to me on this one.  Has anyone else seen something like this?

I was walking home around 10:30 at night in Arlington, Virginia, just a few miles from Washington, DC.  Suddenly I saw a dazzling white, oval-shaped light fall from the sky at a constant rate and disappear over buildings on the horizon.  There was no sound.  The light was bright enough that it cast shadows around me. The oval was an even and pure white light.  I was bigger than a full moon.  I have no idea how far away it was, but didn't seem more than a few miles if that. I am an aviation enthusiast and have fulfilled all requirements for my private pilots license.  I cannot explain what I saw.  It was not a meteor because it seemed too large and had no tail.  It was not an aircraft.  The light was pure white and dazzling. The next day my carpool mate picked me up.  I was only a few hundred feet from his house when I saw the light.  He had been watching TV in his living room which faced the same direction I had been walking.  He told me that the room had filled with a bright white light at the same time I saw the object.  So I had independent corroboration. I called the Arlington police the next day to report it.  No one had seen anything.  I think the woman at the police station thought I was a nut.

I glance over to admire the view of the ocean, green hills, accented with swirls of mists and fog only to find a peculiarity within my vision.   A platinum colored saucer gracefully glided along weaving between the mists and fog.  I couldn't believe my eyes, but I had to because what I was seeing was real.  It was right in front of me.  I am very observant, especially of detail.  I watched it's every movement.  I was amazed by how it was attempting to subtlety blend in with the mist and fog on the middle to low section of the hills that was but a few hundred meters from the ocean.   As soon as I said, ""Look Mom, a UFO!"", about a millisecond before she turned to look, I saw a bright, but small! , white spark replace what was the saucer, and then its entirety to include the spark vanish immediately in such haste.  I was rather disappointed she didn't get to see it with me as I remain alone in my sighting as far as I know.  There were other vehicles driving on the road with us and I am curious to know if any of them saw the craft.   I have told only a few people about the occurrence, but they remained indifferent.  I imagine I was then placed in their minds with other countless stories of UFO observers that society deems as a figment of the imagination.

It was about 10:00 p.m. and there were about a dozen of us there.  I was facing northeast when I noticed what appeared to be several satellites moving through the sky from different directions.  As they moved closer to each other, I became aware that there were 4 of these lights.  I really did not think much of it until the lights moved even closer to each other and then began circling around each other, as if they were moving in formation.  I’ve never seen satellites do this, but shrugged it off.   Then they all suddenly simultaneously streaked across the night sky at speeds I’ve never seen before, once again in totally different directions.  They did not make any discernible sounds. They moved so fast they were out of sight within a second.

We had sliding glass doors out of our living room that went directly into our backyard.   Suddenly our yard was filled with a bright bluish white light that got the attention of my son and myself.  When we looked out the door, a glowing egg shaped craft, that could only have held one or two beings, was gliding silently through our yard.   We live in the city so we do not have a huge yard.  After it passed out doors, I ran to the front winidow to see where it would go....but it never came out from between the houses, which leads me to believe it took off after we saw it.  Strange to me was the fact that although he was sitting with us...my husband did not see the craft.   Without listening to each others account, my son and I gave a description of what we saw to my husband.  We both saw the same thing.  I am an armed security guard at Independence Hall and have been trained to observe and report things that I see.  I dont think 2 of us could be crazy at the sametime.   Why didn't my husband see it?  I have no idea! The reason I've decided to report this now is that about 2 weeks after the sighting, on Oct. 14,2008, my husband was hospitalized with a very rare brain fungal infection.  His doctors had no idea how he  contracted it...as it appeared nowhere else in his body, as it normally should.   He was in a coma for 2 months before they could figure out how to treat it.  My husband died this past August due to this infection.  I cant help but wonder if this sighting, that he said he didn't see, had anything to do with it.

Until then, issues such as UFO, etc. I thought it was a product of fantasy. But that night, completely changed my views on this issue. Together with uncle for the summer holidays when he was in the village we live together as the event grew out of the village for a night walk 2-3 km away from the village had gone together, while the other stars in the northwest to us, but we saw a little something different to each other without talking about it. I continued to walk about 30 minutes later, he began to approach us and the light was growing at the same time, we got closer we saw about 300 meters away from the ground up to 10 meters 100 meters in diameter, which rose slightly after the body was in that area for a few seconds (50 meters up) and came to us with our full body movements that I was moving without making a sound like a plane or helicopter that is moving and suddenly I realized it was like running out there. He waited a second or two above us, by the way my head, eyeing him curiously, then turned at an angle of 180 degrees, including the fear created by the hand reflexively go rifle hunting was carried with me, but my opinion is currently recording an object. Direction in front of me was going to be my uncle. Loss of a hill behind my back had gone to a full-time. Perhaps these events happened within a few seconds, but for us when he took a longer way if it was quite slow. Description of the location of this event on Google Earth and the observed object We have seen a similar object was colored, the colors do not remember the full round of nested rings and spots, formed a wide variety of colors. I can not remember exactly similar to the colors in the picture below .. Two very interesting observations on this topic, I did notice the following site: I saw this too would like to share.

Around us shared our own in this matter. But when he shared not result in a larger environment, am annoyed with myself right now. May be a situation like this, it would be such a thing again. In my hand than I thought I will better express myself clearly displays information occurs. Can not think of any share in this state will contribute. In this time, news media reported, Dogg Akdo&#287;an UFO Nasa releases and publications on our observations be explained by any natural event helped me to admit to myself. For 3 years have passed since the formation of this consciousness, all events in a corner of my mind, always felt uncomfortable with, I believe that a serious information I 've salt in soup is probably no longer think that reproduces as you share information. CONCLUSION:  Without evidence to believe that science is already against the spirit of scientific events, unconditional, and if such invention would perform a lot of humanity, technology and science could not come to this level. In fact, I can not believe I live event sounds like the only logical explanation for the unidentified flying object, of course, hear the evidence without such a thing from someone like you would not believe me. I witnessed one of those, 46 years old, college graduate, computer programmer I have my own job. Other people who have witnessed the 55 year-old uncle, who live in the village primary school education, farming is one constant. Will make a serious scientific research about this event I would like to refer to an institution Have. Welcome everyone interested to write a guestbook of this opinion. http://users.smartgb.com/g/g.php?a=s&i=g16-05804-15#write Have Do not have a single goal of this event, the emergence of a scientific explanation, what we experienced in the future or even close to what the human face, or a technology in a world where we do not know here? What can be done to me I write, respectively. Things to do to people: 1) Observation of two people who cross the query, the lie machine, a sworn statement, both of us separately, the discovery of the crime scene. 2) be done through hypnosis to sleep for this event, perhaps a subconscious interrogation Have any other information that is currently overlooked, removable, or other scientific methods at the moment I had not thought 3) above us that the process imposed on us radyosyon damage left by magnetic fields, etc., or any other helpful was harmful radiation?  Things to do on-site Event: 1) much closer at the ground observations (5 Senses we have made using the buds, but not enough), it's involvement there is another technique using the method of the magnetic field, radiation measurement, comparison of the values in that region in different locations. 2) Here we do not know, but that would work for their great energy, a mineral that may be converted to fuel type to something like a detector or is there something more powerful search tools to use mine. 3) examination of the area of biological diversity in the presence of a different species I think a lot of time to pass through the trials of this event is a challenge, but still I think that tips can be found. I am ready for cooperation with all kinds of scientific research is actually coming to my mind these are my first ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We have experienced these alone and in the company of others.  By far one of the most dramatic sightings occurred on the night of August 20, 2009, preceded by a strange observation on August 19th. On the 19th, we went to our favorite local star-gazing site, about 20 minutes from our home, on Fisher Hill Road above Lyle, Washington.  This is on the west edge of the Klickitat River gorge.  The sky was clear.  We arrived as the sky was darkening, and set up our recliners to observe the sky for meteors, planets, and satellites in our usual manner.  Various aircraft pass over the area.  There were surprisingly few satellites in evidence that night. We saw a few meteors. We rotated our chairs for several vantages, finally settling on facing the northwest sky.  It didn’t seem like we had been there long before we observed a bright white light appearing and traveling toward us from the NW, at about 45 degrees. It quickly expanded into about the size of a quarter at arm’s length, quite bright, and of an iridescent quality, with brilliant rays surrounding it. We were excited, when suddenly it took a sharp turn to the right, shrinking down quickly to a speck as it disappeared to the north. Figuring that was the best we would see that night, we decided to head home, and were both surprised to find that we had been gone for 5 hours. It seemed like much less, perhaps 2 at the most. The next night we both had a strong desire to return to the same spot. We arrived at dusk, observing a few small, scattered cumulus clouds low in the west. To the north, although the sky was clear, we saw sheet lightening, so set up our chairs facing NE up the Klickitat gorge, where we could see the west edge of Grayback Mountain. As we watched, the sheet lightening expanded into 4 areas of inception which did not move left or right but rather expanded toward us. The nearest area appeared to be right behind Grayback Mountain, the next closest in the direction of Mt. Adams to the NW, and the 2 other areas much farther to the north, northeast. It was an entertaining enough show, coupled with our usual stargazing. As the sky darkened, so began the oddest show either of us had ever seen. Enormous haloed domes began to explode behind Grayback. The interior was a brilliant iridescent white, perhaps twice the size of a large full moon on the horizon. The halos were about half the diameter of the domes, and about half the brilliance. There were so many of them we could hardly keep our eyes still. They also began to explode from the next closest area to the northwest, but the most action came from  behind  Grayback at first.  We began to see enormous lightning bolts emerge from the domes to the east, then arc back toward the center. Some would connect, and some would not quite, ending in forks. The duration of the domes and the lightning was uncommonly long, so that we could actually study them for a good moment. Throughout the night we heard no thunder whatsoever, and it was quiet enough to hear the occasional passing plane. It was thrilling. As a long time fire-fighter, trained in meteoro! logy, I had never seen anything like it. After a while I noticed a bright light toward the top of Grayback, a distance west of a few residencial lights that we sometimes see. I observed for a while, wondering if it was a star rising, when my husband said “Has that light always been there?” I said I didn’t think so, I’d been watching it for a while to see if it was rising. It seemed odd. We pondered it a bit. The domes were going crazy, and as I observed them slightly to the east, my husband cried out “Whoa!” and my eye was drawn back to the diminishing light of an enormous white beam that he had seen shoot out from the small light toward the northwest, extending high into the sky.  After it retracted, we watched the light turn bright red for a long moment, return to white, then  rise slowly above Grayback,  growing in size and brilliance, resembling the light we had seen the night before. Then it sank slowly down, contracted to its original size and position. As if things weren’t odd enough, the light began to exude a sort of mist toward its left edge, which gradually brightened and expanded, revealing a huge rectangular structure atop Grayback, impossibly large, perhaps fully the width of the domes, which were still exploding.	The rectangle had clearly defined edges, was silver-gray in color, and had vertical lines dividing it into five even segments. We were afforded a long look at this object, asking “Do you see that?!” before it melted again into a mist that gradually retracted into the original white light. The domes were really picking up now, exploding over the horizon from the area northwest now as well, backed by the constant sheet lightning from the two more distant areas. Occasionally a plane would pass over, clearly heard. We do not recall if the domes were evident at those times, perhaps only the sheet lightning. But things got even stranger. A white light blinked on to the northeast, perhaps at 30 degrees. It appeared as the light of a low small plane, blinking and twinkling at irregular intervals, yet it remained stationary. Occasionally it would blink red. Then we noticed other similar lights blink on to the east and west, moving south as if to surround us. Indeed they did. There was  a total of seven that surrounded us in a horseshoe pattern, open to the north, blinking wildly. We stood up and turned to look up at them as they moved into formation around us and stopped. Then they began blinking and bobbing about wildly in a sort of dance, and we both lifted our arms and danced with them. We had the feeling of complete exultation. After the dance, they slowly glided off on each side of us, one by one disappearing into the area of the domes, except for the first light which never changed position. We settled back down to watch the dome show, which was really wild by now. We kind of watched our sentry as we called it, the first blinking light. Suddenly I realized that it was a small plane, moving toward us from the east, which could be heard.  As we thought “What the…??” the plane passed, and our sentry blinked back on. After a short time a plane approached it from the west, and we watched it blink off, then reappear after the plane had passed. The domes became less frequent from the Grayback area, and emanated from the northwest area more.  The activity gradually lessened.  At one point my husband turned his back, and I saw a full, brilliant haloed globe leap high into the air, with a perfect arched bolt of lightning reconnecting to it. It appeared slightly more concentrated than the domes, as one might expect of an object cleared of the horizon, the size of the sun at least. It was amazing. As things slowed down to occasional sheet lightning, our little sentry friend glided north toward Grayback, disappearing behind it.  Finally my husband said, ""I think our work here is done."" I agreed. We packed up and drove home, both surprised again to find that we had been gone for 4 hours. It didn’t seem that long. A weird story, I agree.  But that’s what happened. We’ve searched for descriptions of this sort of lightning, but have never found anything even close. I’ve never seen bolts of lightning without accompanying thunder, although none of them hit the ground, they all arched back into the domes, or the globe.  In spite of our many weird experiences and sightings, including a huge green  fireball sighted  a month earlier in central Oregon, and a large, slow, low-flying orange globe observed by at least 4 others later in the summer at the Lewis River, we have never seen anything so incredible.  We just had to finally share it. We welcome any input. I have identified our viewing location on GoogleEarth and can give you the exact location.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,,

Hello,  I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing or not.  I have some fear in writing this, why, I don’t know.  I seen something very strange years ago when I was about 18 years old. I was already married and had taken our dog for a walk around our neighborhood.  I was rounding the last curve on our road before our house when I happened to glance back over my shoulder ( because my German Shepherd was lagging behind a little) and I seen something in the sky.  What I seen I am still not sure. I first noticed what seemed to be a white cloud forming very low in the sky not far from me. It was expanding at such a fast rate I knew it couldn’t be a normal cloud. I became fearful and starting looking around to see if anybody was outside and seeing this as well. Of course like all good stories no one was to be found. I then began to notice what seemed to be lights inside the cloud moving around, almost like big spot lights on a helicopter. I was so scared, but I couldn’t move , I was frozen with fear and wonderment. I just could not figure it out. The thing that scared me the most….no sound! No sound at all! How could a helicopter spray expanding foam clouds in the air to hide in and suddenly appear out of no where without any warning sound of it’s approach or the propellers disturbing the sprayed foam clouds? This was my thinking while this was taking place…How? Just as quickly as it appeared, the lights stopped and the expanding cloud began to do the opposite and rol! l back into nothing at all. What I seen that day I truly don’t know, but I think about it all the time. When I got back home and told my husband, I got that you must be crazy look from him…. that scared me too. I am now in my thirties and have children. I am no longer married to my former husband but I don’t think that my “experience” had anything to do with it. I have tried to put what happened on that day behind me over the years. I have told the story a few times. But for the most part I have dismissed it as explainable some how, until about two years ago when I could no longer deny “things”. I just want to say that I am a normal person with a normal family. I don’t understand what has happened and I’m tired of being scared to talk about things. I feel like I am going to go crazy if I have to keep denying  that it happened. That’s why I have decided to “open up” about whatever this is or was…I’m not sure.  	My thirteen year old daughter and I went to our local Walmart one evening. My second husband was fixing the kitchen sink when we left. When we returned home about 9:00pm we pulled in the driveway which is long ( I now live in a more rural location) and we both immediately seen something over our house. As we got closer I couldn’t believe my eyes, I wasn’t sure what I was looking at. It was three big bright lights almost like big headlights right over the roofline of my house. They were stationary at first and I remember asking my daughter if she was seeing what I was seeing. To my horror she said…yes. We were frozen for a moment, all of a sudden what I thought was one big thing turned out to be three smaller things because they started to hover away in different directions. I got out of the car real quick with my daughter  on my heels. I wanted my husband to see this too. I ran in and hurried him outside only to find them gone except one light between the neighbors house an! d our’s which was hard to make out for sure because of all the trees. In any case that light has not been seen there since he will tell you. My daughter joined us in the yard with a aluminum foil hat she quickly fashioned (so they could not read her thoughts) and once again I was left with this “baggage”. I was angry. Why I got in the car and tried to find it again I don’t know. I just needed some answers. I was unable to find the mysterious lights that haunt my life, and of course the neighbors couldn’t see the lights in their yard. It is now a joke that they love to throw out there every chance they get, and I laugh of course, what else can I do?  	But the fact that my daughter was involved in the second “experience” leads me down the road I find myself on. She talks about it all the time desperate to let it not be forgotten. It has awakened a curiosity in her that I cannot deny her. “It was real, we did see something didn’t we mom?” The sad thing is her father my first husband does not believe her. So she is doomed to the same fate as me “crazy” . The difference is that I was there to, so she will always have somebody to talk to that believes her.

I was standing in the door way looking out into our back yard which is just a giant open empty field with a few clumps of trees and I saw a light in the tree line that I thought was a four wheeler.  Basically I the only way it could have been a four wheeler or ATV would be if it was hanging in the tree.  I screamed for my boyfriend to come out of the bedroom to check it out and when he did he took one look at whatever this was ran out to grab the dog and ran back inside.  We both stood there and blinked to try and make sense of what we were seeing.  The light got brighter and bigger and was just in one spot for a minute or two. I got freaked out and ran into the bedroom and hid under the covers.  My boyfriend stood there and said that after the light became really bright it quickly shot up into the air till he couldn't see it any longer.  I was scared for the rest of the night and every noise I hea! rd made me even more scared.  I almost jumped into the car to go stay at a hotel.  And just so you know I don't believe in things unless I can see them with my own eyes and this made me a believer in something.

At first we thought it was two parachutes or parasails because of the odd end-on view we had.  As they got closer, we could see all the detail – black hexagons with a section missing from the leading edge.  At one point they were about 2000 feet overhead and turning towards the north.  I could hear and see other small planes in the area going to the local airport south of the area.  These things made absolutely no sound, were at least 75 feet in diameter, and maybe moving only 25mph.  We both sketch out what we saw independently and then compared to make sure we both saw the same thing.  We did. I just took my drawing and built it in Google Sketch. I grew up an Air-Force brat, I’ve been an amateur astronomer all my life, I’ve seen things most people would mistake for a UFO. These were really Unidentified Flying Objects.  The reason I am reporting this now, is there was an article in the KC Star two weeks ago about the increase in UFO sighting in the KC area. I too have seen something - extraordinary.   I hope it’s “OURS”. It would explain why “they’ve” cancelled the Shuttle Program – we don’t need it.  If not? I hope they’re friendly, not hungry or kinky..

I heard an airplane that was particularly loud, so I looked up. I saw at first what appeared to be a single, sphere shaped craft that looked to be trailing the airplane.  It was ""silver"" in color when I first spotted it. As i followed the sphere trailing the airplane, it suddenly stopped. I mean it just stopped moving and was perfectly still. I couldn't believe my eyes.  Suddenly, the sphere began to turn baby blue as if it were reflecting the sky.  It wasn't an immediate change at first, but more like an exotic lizard--it didn't take more than a few seconds. Subsequently, it then changed from blue to the most amazing green that would describe as emerald, then red. When changing colors it gave the appearance that the craft was ""wobbling"" as the craft would begin the color change at one end of the sphere and it would make its way to the other side. The best way i c! an describe it alternately is like a modern lighthouse that moves its light beam in a circular motion parallel to the ground, almost like an old fashioned police car siren. I was pretty much just standing in the middle of the street completely mesmerized.  About 2 minutes into this I see another sphere that shot by the stationary sphere at incredible speed. I then moved my focus to the new object. It was identical to the first. In order to keep up with it I was pretty much just spinning in circles. I then see another sphere catch up with the fast moving one (#2). They flew in tandem for a few minutes or so and then suddenly reduced their respective speeds to half that of a conventional aircraft and it was at this point that I noticed the silver appearance began to fade as the crafts began to oscillate and change color, still adhering to their formation. Very spooky. In all I believe that I saw 4-5 spheres--but given their intermittent high speed and hovering behavior, it is hard to say precisely how many there were in the air at that time. Definitely at least 3 as at one point there were 3 craft in my field of vision. The funny thing about all of this is that during this whole experience there were still airplanes that were fl! ying either to or from the airport nearby. The craft just seemed to effortlessly avoid the airplanes and at times they appeared to be chasing them, only to turn around and shoot off in another direction. The whole event lasted approximately 20 minutes as one by one the spheres just seemed to disappear. They didn't fly off into the horizon but just kind of vanished instead. This is the second UFO that I have seen...both sightings within 2 years of each other. Both were here in North Carolina, one in Greensboro and the previous one in Snow Camp, North Carolina which is about a 45 minute drive from Greensboro.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,36.0769630261661,-79.81581387940841

It wasn't going very fast, and it was close enough to the earth to see detail. It reminded me of an arrowhead in shape; it had three points, a light orange light on each point, and the back end of the craft bowed inward between the two end points.  I rolled down my window but could not detect a noise.  The craft had no noticeable markings and seemed to be made of metal, which was a medium gray. It was not shiny; the outside of the craft had a dull finish to it. Both my husband and I watched it as it continued straight, then made a ninety-degree sudden turn to the left. It suddenly started flying off toward the distance at a much faster pace than it had been going, and it was soon out of sight. My husband and I were talking about what we'd seen when a U.S. Plane that looked like a jet came from the direction that the other aircraft had come from. This plane was loud, fast, and a dark gray to black in color. Where the UFO had made a ninety-degree turn, the new plane turned as well, although it didn't turn as sharply or as quickly as the other craft had. It followed the trail that the other aircraft had made, zooming out of sight in the same direction. I wouldn't be surprised if someone else saw this craft in action that day. It was about two in the afternoon in the middle of summer, and the route the air crafts took was along the same route of a popular road in our hometown. This craft was very large and like nothing I had ever seen before, so it was bound to gather attention. I did not hear anything about this craft from anyone else whether through word-of-mouth or media afterwards, although I did look out for more information.

Did not think about it again until,after passing through the town and picking up speed ,I approached the steel suspension bridge as one exits the town . The red lights were on my right  cresting a mountain and appeared stationary . I recalled thinking that there must have been another plane tower  erected or perhaps a cell tower on that side as there already exists a plane tower dotted with red lights across the river on the left side mountain. As I crossed the bridged i was shocked to see the red lights were moving closer and down off the mountain towards me. They crossed right above me perhaps 50 feet overhead swiftly and without a sound then hovered above a man made containment pond about 30 yards off of the highway on farm land. I stopped my car ,rolled down the window and looked up . ! The twin spheres were predominantly red thought they glowed a bright orange then slid into a molten silver before turning red again this color change was cyclical and patterned. The sky was overcast as rain was forecasted . There were no stars or airplanes visible. There was no other cars on the road and i became increasingly concerned the longer I remained stopped for fear of fast coming traffic as the road there is a narrow 2 lane 55 mph corridor .

I felt compelled to leave for fear of arriving late for work and finally pulled away after 10 minutes of observing the globes.

I completely forgot to use my cell to catch a picture or call 911 or even my husband...never even considered it.

It was still daylight so whatever it was that produced the light must of had a lot of energy.  These three lights began to act irratically judging the distance to be at least a mile away I'd say they were going from one side of the sky to at least 5 football fields over in a matter of seconds.  Due to the horrific crash there were at least 2 helicopters covering the scene.  They could have been news choppers but they were black.  As the lights flew around the choppers it seemed like the choppers were trying to follow and make sense of the ufo's.  after bouncing around in the sky one of the lights became brighter and appeared to go from a standstill into full speed with no acceleration time on chopper tried to follow as it left the light returned to its similar associates.  Then about ten min after first noti! cing the anomolies the lights circled one another and just as the other one had burst into full speed before all three proceeded to exit though fast their line of exit was not straight up but probably at a 60 to 70 degree angle assuming the horizon is zero.  The helicopters followed furthuring my assumtion that they were not their for the crash.  Maybe the lights led the drivers eyes of the church van away and thats why they crashed.

I was getting tired around 12:30am and decided to go to sleep around 1:00am. I fell asleep quite quickly in nothing but my boxers.  Before I go into detail about the encounter I experienced, allow me to explain the layout of my room relative to the map I submitted. My bedroom is on the second story on the southwest end of my home. I have 3 windows in my room on the front face of the house and have access to both the attic and the only fire escape on the building. This house used to be an old office building in which my bedroom was one of the offices used. My actual bed is located in the southwest corner next to a window and directly next to the fire escape door. This door has no handle on the outside and only a bar-release on the inside similar to what you would find on the inside of a school entrance door or office building. The door also has a 1.3x1.3 foot window in the top center. The actual fire escape on the outside of the door is nothing more than a metal platform and railing leading down the side of my house with metal stairs. I often use this to have a cigarette when I am at home since smoking inside the house is forbidden by the landlord. This goes to say I am quite familiar with what the scenery on the outside of my home ! looks like in this location. I awoke on this day around 3am based on the dark of night outside, however, when I awoke I was already outside on my fire escape platform. I had not been dreaming as far as I could tell since everything was as it was when I am awake, and have had many vivid almost lucid dreams in the past, and I can tell you this was not that sensation. I was very groggy and confused as to how I had walked in my sleep. I have not sleepwalked since I was about 8 years old, and at this time I was 19 almost 20. I almost immediately noticed something very very large above me after this initial confusion, and took quick notice to my door being closed behind me leaving no way of re-entering my home. As soon as I noticed this however, I felt the urge to look at this large object hovering above me. As I looked up I noticed it was sort of rounded in shape but had many many lights on the underside of it. It was directly above me so I had no view of the sides of the object.  The lights were a very very bright white.  Nothing like any fluorescent bulb I have ever seen. These lights were flashing without any pattern it seemed and were located all over the underside of the object in rectangular and very long trapezoidal shapes.  The object had to have been at least 250 feet in diameter, possibly larger. The underside of the object also had many things jutting out from it with these lights on it as well, but I took a firm notice to one in particular.  There was this large piece with the lights on the side of it coming out from the right of the object. It's shape was like an upside down cone with the end cut off. It resembled an air filter for a high performance engine in a car.  It had symmetrical lights all around its sides that were identical to the ones on the underside of the object, however the bottom of this piece jutting out was a very very dark gray-black color. When I had first looked up, the lights were so blinding that I had to shield my eyes with one hand to see they were flashing and their shapes and locations. I observed all of this within less than 90 seconds before I became very disoriented. I forgot what I was doing, where I was at, and who I was. Almost as if these lights were inducing an acute case of amnesia. The last thing I can remember before passing out was the strange sensation of floating. I had never experienced this before, but it was as if I were suddenly weightless. My feet were no longer touching the cold metal platform and I was no longer shielding my eyes. As soon as I was blinded by the lights that were flashing I seemed to lose consciousness, unless the lights caused me to forget everything leaving me no memory of anything afterwards. Throughout these short minutes the object made absolutely no sound. It was as if it was making everything around it completely quiet. If you have ever heard the saying ""Silence is Deafening,"" I would have to agree, there were no sounds made after I noticed the object above me. This was extremely strange since my home is on a main road, and relatively close to the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Hearing not even the sound of a cricket chirp or the hum of the highway was definitely weird. I also remember the silence being almost suffocating. It felt very heavy, as if it were making the air thick like soup. In my short, and very close observation, I remember the object being about 20 to 40 feet above me and the space in between my house and the neighbors house, and the tree in between the front of our homes was blocking out a portion of this large object. There was no wind, as if Time had stopped in its tracks. This is all simply speculation, but it was what it seemed to me. After I lost consciousness, it got extremely bizarre. I remember waking up without any senses except for my sight and sense of balance. I was laying down with my eyes looking upwards towards what seemed to be a ceiling. My eyes were not working correctly though. It was as if I had been administered eye drops that you would get at the doctors to dilate your pupils. Everything was very blurry and distorted. I remember very little, but I do remember everything was a green/brown/gray color around me. I also remember seeing strange objects above me that appeared to be tools or examination equipment above me, none of which seemed to be created by humans. It was very very blurry though so it was hard to tell if that was exactly what it was. I then remember a figure move into view above me. I was unable to move at all, and my vision was very poor so I could discern nothing about this being other than it seemed a little taller than I am and it had appendages like a human being (arms, torso, head, legs, etc.). It did not speak to me, however, I seemed to hear a voice in my head. It was much less a voice than it was a feeling or emotion being conveyed. The very last thing I can remember was feeling very calm, as if this being was trying to help me in some sort of way. The ""trying to help you"" feeling I received was much less about me in particular, but more of a ""you"" as in ""your race."" I then saw one of the objects above me move slightly, and I lost consciousness again. When I came to I was sitting on the edge of my bed. My bed was made very neatly as if I had never layed down at all that night. When i looked at my alarm clock, the time was about 4:45am. I tried to remember how I got there, but nothing came to mind. I tried to sleep, but my thoughts were buzzing faster than I could even keep up with. I could not sleep no matter how hard I tried that night. The only thing I kept asking myself was ""Why wasn't I scared or afraid throughout this entire experience?""   I am not trying to garner attention in any way shape or form with this.. This is why I am choosing to remain anonymous. I just hope that maybe this can help somebody understand things a little better, even if I can not understand any of this myself. I always thought the UFO phenomenon was a bunch of crap before this experience. Since this experience I have been haunted, and have wanted to tell somebody but have always been too afraid of being called a crackpot. The only person I have ever told this story to is my best friend, and he is probably the only person who will ever know who I am and what I witnessed. I have witnessed a few other strange occurrences that happened after this account I have just given you, but they are far less important I think..  I hope this will help in some way shape or form.

Anyway we were travelling down the road and as we got to the top of the hill above the trees there was a shiny silver cube turned on its side like a diamond. The sun was hitting the object and reflecting of it. Both me and my boyfriend said what's that?. We continued down the hill and when we reached the otherside the object had disappeared. For the last year i have searched the web to see if anyone well saw this, but i have found nothing. The object did not appear to be moving, but stationary. The viewing was only short and nothing was coming out of the object and there were no lights. i just hope th! at someone is able to explain to me what it was that i saw.

The object was about 100,000 feet above me as I traveled at a speed of 55 MPH.  The object moved eastbound approximately 6-8 miles, or approximately North Garland Rd and George Bush Tollway.  Then it moved a mile westward, or approximately Brand Rd. Then it moved back to North Garland Rd. Finally coming back over my vehicle and disappeared over Lake Ray Hubbard. The incident occured in approximately 1-2 seconds. So using simple math I calculated the craft roughly went 6-8 miles westbound,  Then 1 mile east bound, then another mile westbound, then back 6-8 miles at where it began. 14 miles at the slowest in 1 second.  Thats 50,000 MPH in different directions, without a sound or streak of light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Given the color I assumed I was looking at the moon obscured by a cloud of smoke; as a resident of California it is a phenomenon I have seen often enough.  The depth of color was indicative of a very dense, very close fire so for safety sake I scanned the inland sky hoping to locate the source but I saw no plume of trailing smoke and there weren’t even clouds in the sky.  Several things crossed my mind then, it was too early in the evening for the moon to be in a setting position over the ocean, the new moon had just passed so the sliver of moon visible wouldn’t be as large as what I had just seen and lastly the moon wouldn’t be setting in that location of the sky anyway.  So when I looked back at the light it was a little disconcerting to notice it had grown larger and brighter and was definitely taki! ng on an orb like shape.  I was driving so I had to alternate between watching the road and watching the orb and each time I looked back at the orb it appeared larger and brighter as if it were coming toward me which meant that it was moving inland in an easterly direction.  At one point when I looked the orb had changed shape, like a tear drop on its side with the pointed tip in the tail position and it was moving parallel to me only in the opposite direction (southbound) there were also three small lights visible at the top. Because of those small lights I thought “Oh it’s a passenger plane.” I wanted some kind of confirmation so I looked for the fuselage knowing that if I could see the lights of the passenger windows I should be able to see the plane itself but there was no plane and the whole thing was still glowing orange.  It continued southward and I watched it move across the sky until I was almost looking over my shoulder out the driver side window and the glow sta! rted to dissipate then it vanished at a point where my eye cau! ght sigh t of a star in the sky.  The whole incident took no more than two or three minutes and I wasn’t the only one who saw this; there were 15 other vehicles in front of me and several behind.  I watched the orb disappear then turned my full attention back to my driving and realized everyone had slowed down to watch the strange lights in the sky.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,34.29657455830389,-119.23991625441697

The First thing i Found was a Meteorite looking, Soft Ball sized  Rock (1468g) with makings like a Space Capsule Heat Shield with Fresh Reentry Burns and Looks just Like an ALIEN EYE looking at You and A Map of our Solar System. Next to the First Rock was a Second Meteorite looking Rock the Size of a Golf Ball (166g) with a Very Dark Green Colour and a Texture like Reptile Skin. The Third Rock Inches away is a Bust (1466g) of a Reptilian King on one Side and the Queen on the other side Both with a Crown and a Horn on Top of the Head plus Teeth.

In the spring of 2011, perhaps April or May, in the early evening at approximately 5:50 pm or 6:50 pm, I had stepped outside.  The weather was fine, no cloudiness nor precipitation. In the West something caught my eye and I stood looking in that direction a moment to identify what it was. A small light, the size of a distant evening star, seemed to be moving.  As I stood watching it, the light became slightly larger and brighter. The object was moving toward my direction heading in a North East direction coming from the West. My home is in a darkened area, raised away from city lighting and surrounded by mountains.  All nature of planes fly constantly overhead as two airports are located in relatively close proximity, as well as the area of sky above our property is a fly zone for all aircraft.  I am a casual night sky observer, familiar with constellations and etc. and very familiar with observing shooting stars, satellites and all manner of aircraft. As the object was coming in my direction, there was only a bright white light, no plane marker lights to be identified at that angle.  The pace/speed of the object was steady and constant and the light visibly growing larger and brighter the closer it came toward my property.  At this point in time I now suspected I was watching a satellite, as there was no sound, nor other usual plane markers. As the object reached the range of my property I was able to see clearly two separate objects.  Both bright white lights and flying in tandem, as you might see two fighter planes flying in tandem.  As the objects flew by I never took my eyes from them and turned my body in conjunction with the movement of the objects, so that as I saw them clearly I was now facing North.  The objects continued toward the East until out of my sight. The entire flight pattern of the objects was in the pattern of an arc, flying in from the west toward the northeast and flying out toward the east. Unlike a satellite, the objects flew very low in the sky and were both large, very bright, white lights with no other lights, neither flashing nor colored. Neither object had any kind of identifying shape. Unlike a shooting star, the objects did not have any other coloring except bright white, similar to the look of a larger bright star in the night sky.  There was no trail, no sparking, nothing to indicate that these objects were shooting stars.  Nor did they have the speed of a shooting star, as those “shoot” quickly past. Their constant speed was similar to the steadiness of a satellite’s movement.  The altitude was similar to a low flying prop plane.   The speed was not as slow nor as ungraceful as a prop, it was smoother like a jet, but not as fast as a jet.  These objects moved quickly, but steadily. Lastly, from start to finish, there was not a single sound emitted before, during, nor after they disappeared from sight.

It ended about 1:30 AM, and I went up to bed. My husband was crashed out in the basement, so I decided to leave him there. I climbed into my bed next to my daughter (who frequently sneaks out of her bed to sleep with me). I must have been exhausted and just crashed, which is odd for me, because it usually takes several minutes to get to sleep, even when it's late. The next morning, I woke up extremely dehydrated and recalled a very startling and vivid “dream” of being around aliens and UFOs. This was so startling, and unlike any other dream that I’ve ever had, so I decided to explore other options, such as an actual abduction. I’ve heard of the UFO/alien phenomena, but had never given it much consideration till this event. I don't recall being ""beamed up"" but I clearly remember being taken somehow to a place with a lot of hallways. Then I remember feeling like I was being instructed to urinate in a long and wide tube with strange markings on the side. I think the markings indicated measurements or something. The last thing I remember was being on the ground, outside, in what looked like a vacant/abandoned parking lot. I remember the concrete had lots of cracks in it like it was old and worn. There were evergreen trees surrounding this place. There were other people standing around me with cages of small animals, like house cats, birds, dogs, etc. I got the feeling like these people around me were going to release them. I remember feeling like it was approaching morning, but it was still dark outside. I looked up in the sky and noticed several (at least four) UFO craft very near above the ground of this parking lot, just hovering. There were three red lights coming from the bottom of them that ! blurred or blinked till they became one light beam. It's very hard to explain. These craft were larger than I’d have expected for what you see on television. I guess I’d always pictured them being the size of a small bus, but these were the size of a large home. I don’t remember ever being inside of the craft, but being inside of a building or structure near this lot. The other people there, like me, weren't completely in reality. It was like we were in a trance. I remember standing in this lot, looking up, and seeing one UFO fly high, stop, fly a little bit to the left, stop, fly higher, stop, and then flew off and vanished. So, after looking up at these UFOs from the ground, I remember it all of a sudden clicking (like a switch had been turned on) that this wasn't normal... And I remember taking off running as fast as I could. I had just snapped back to reality. As soon as I started to run, I recall the others, which I assumed had also been taken, almost clicking too and ! scattering in all directions. The last thing I recall is some ! kind of luminescent ""beam"" of sorts encasing me as I ran. I woke up very dehydrated, a bit weak, and still tired, but I remembered this almost like it had really happened. After that night, I had a minor sore throat and occasional minor pains in my abdomen. This lasted about two weeks, off and on. Ordinarily, I would have chalked this up to just being a dream or my subconscious manifesting my fears in an odd way, but the next day, my daughter said something extremely startling to me...""Mommy, who were those boys that came and took you when you were sleeping?"" I questioned her a little, but I didn't want to push it with her, so I sort of left it be. She didn't seem particularly worried or concerned about it, just curious. (She was just shy of 4 years old at the time.) I’ve since asked her about it off and on, and she doesn’t appear to recall much more than she already said. Since then, I’ve started to attend MUFON meetings and I joined a group for experiencers and have been speaking with the leader, who is also a regression therapist. I haven’t shared this with anybody outside of this small group about this experience. I’m pretty sure my peers, family, and friends would think I’m crazy, so I would like to keep this somewhat anonymous. Upon reflection of this event, I started to piece together a few of my memories from childhood, and start questioning them more. For example, I remember a period of missing time when I was about 12 years old, where there were several hours unaccounted for. I had never even thought to question the “missing time” or even heard that phrase till after this last event occurred. If any of this seems relevant, please feel free to contact me, but I would appreciate my name being withheld from any public report.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,39.106140833333335,-94.70725125

It was a clear day in early July and the sun was still about an hour or so from setting.  We had a nice view of the town skyline from the bridge.  All of a sudden there were three separate fireballs in the sky that actually appeared to be explosions; they did not appear very large (but I assume that is due to the distance we were in comparison to the fireballs) and were not closely grouped together (one appearing in the far southern direction to our front and right, one directly in front of our position, and one towards the far northern part of town to our front, left). I blurted “Did you see that!?” to my husband, to which he said kind of confusedly “Yeah, what the heck was it?” I mentioned that it appeared to be explosions and suggested that we call the small airport (which was directly west of us) or call the police and tell them, thinking that it may have something to do with a distressed plane.  My husband thought this was kind of silly, because we had seen three fireballs, not one.  There was no smoke, no sound, just three simultaneous round fireballs and nothing more.  There was no indication that there was any aircraft in the sky, much less crashing after an explosion. We considered the possibilities of the fireballs being someone setting off fireworks; however they were spaced too far apart to be the same person doing so, and there was no sound after the fact, not to mention that they happened perfectly in sync and were spaced miles apart.  They also seemed to last just a small fraction longer than a mortar shell that you purchase for the 4th of July, as well as they happened much higher up in the atmosphere.  We are from this area, and we see fireworks set off into the sky every year over the town; that was not what we witnessed with these three things.  They did not occur again, and we watched for quite some time while in town (we were in open air for several hours after arriving, so we had opportunity to watch the sky).  I never heard reports of anyone else witnessing this, even though there was at least one vehicle driving into town ahead of us facing the same direction. These were three fireballs, like you would see in a movie were missiles are exploding in the air.  Perfectly round, perfectly timed simultaneously, and made of orange fire.  The sky was clear, then suddenly, three fireballs, and then there was nothing more. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I walked outside to smoke a cigarette out on my third story apartment deck and was admiring the pink clouds as the sun was setting. I saw an object that was out of the ordinary. The first thing i thought of was a hot air ballon but it was too low for a landing because of all the power lines and buildings in the area. Note there was a dead wind on the ground. I would estimate the object was about 300 feet off the ground. Let me add that i have spent my whole life at airports. I am a pilot and a regular skydiver with over 600 jumps. With that said i am trained to know distances of objects and wind conditions. This was no hot air ballon because there was not a basket underneath. I would also know this because i have many ballon flights as well. The object was flying at about 35 to 40 mph. The object was orbiting in a clock wise rotation from ground view. I would say that the object was turning at 10 rpm. The color of the object was a light rustic brown. I could! tell the object was rotating because there were three indentations on the bottom half, much like a golf ball would have. The object was about 30 meters in diameter. The object maintained heading until out of site. The object was silent. This object was nothing i have ever seen and let me say that in all my years in aeronautics it baffled me.

Very soon after I noticed the stationary objects, the two spheres moved horizontally over my neighbor's house very rapidly, maintaining their distance apart, toward the lake and were quickly out of sight. At the time I thought I was imagining something and would have discounted the whole event except my grandson pointed to where the spheres were first seen and said, ""Balloons!""

I told my sister all about this light a couple of years ago. This same sister was staying with me in July of this year.  One night (approx. 7-20-11)she woke me up to tell me that the light was flying over (22:00 hrs appox.). We both went out on the deck but it was gone.  She was pointing in the direction that it was going (same as 2007 sighting - traveling from NNW to SSE). While she was pointing south I happened to glance up (north) and saw a strange craft. This craft was right above our heads and flying from the SSW to NNE.  It was flying below 1000 feet AND THERE WAS NO NOISE.  It had 3 lights on it (red,green and white) it resembled an large airplane but it was way too bulky (?) to be a airplane in my opinion.  I could see a fuselage and wings but the wings were as thick and as big as the fuselage which doesn' t make any sense to me. The whole body of the craft looked like two rectangle boxes stuck together like a cross.  I could see the craft so well because IT WAS THAT LOW and SLOW!  This craft disappeared over the tree line and about 10 seconds later there was a very loud rumble (sort of like thunder but not) that lasted about 20 seconds.  The loud rumble came from the direction that the craft disappeared (NNE), NOT from overhead. Anyway, about 1-2 min. after that we could hear what sounded like military jets screaming out of Beale AFB (approx. 50 miles S of us).  It sounded like 2 jets but we only saw one fly overhead about 5-10 min. later. The craft my sister initially saw sounded exactly like the one that I saw in 2007.

Additionally, we noticed that as it was descending very fast that it was moving sideways, actually different from the direction the main part of the craft was pointing.  Then is stopped in mid-air.

The object was rounded, almost like a boomerang. There were 3 orange bright lights on the bottom of the craft. They were recessed into the craft and seemed to be made of a liquid or sphere of liquid as I was able to see the substance churning about within.

I looked down at my wristwatch as I  felt the need to make sure and note the time and to my surprise it was hours later than I thought it should be. I rushed inside and woke my girlfriend in a panic and demanded that she tell me the time. She told me it was 3:47 in the morning. My watch read that it was 6:23. Physical Evidence: The watch was given to me not long ago by my aunt who works in a jewelry store. The watch has never had an issue telling the correct time. It is a Quartz ESQ E5460 that is rated at 3 ATM or 30 minutes under water. I find it quite odd that after observing this object at such a close distance, not being able to recall the object leaving, and that my watch was 1:36 hours ahead of when it should be. It is now about a month after the original sighting. There is a rough circular shape of dead grass/clumps of dead grass that is tangent to the side of my house, and seems to fully encompass the area where I was sitting if the grass was extended through the area of my patio. Conclusion: I know that I saw something, and I feel like this something did not want me to remember seeing it, however I can not state that as fact as I simply do not know what happened after the object stopped. Notes: I have selected the checkbox below that states the object landed. This is due to the possible interaction it had with the ground(i.e. dead grass). I did not see the object land, but there is indeed the possibility of physical interaction with the ground.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,31.652585714285713,-94.56937802197803

We have attempted to contact the source of the report, but unsuccessfully.  PD)) WAY DOWN YONDER IN THE CUCUMBER PATCH   Excitement loomed over the ((name deleted)) farm one spring when dad landed a contract with the local pickle factory in town.  Eagerly the ground was tilled with the team of work horses, Duke and Babe, pulling the one bottom plow through the fertile ground. I believe dad had set aside about 10 acres of which we planted all into cucumbers.  I may be wrong about the number of acres but I do know it was a huge amount. After turning the soil, a harrow was hitched behind the horses and dad went round and round, back and forth, over and over the field until the soil was loosened sufficiently for planting.  Each seed was placed carefully in mounds of soil by hand until the entire field was sowed.  I’m sure silent prayers were also uttered to the heavenly Father that he would bless this endeavor.  Anxiously we awaited the first sign of sprouts to poke their green heads from their graves.  The weather was perfect.  Gentle rain from heaven sprinkled at the opportune time.  Delightedly, one morning as ! we gazed out over the terrain, we saw a miracle had taken place overnight. God had awoken those seeds and the field was covered with pale green sprouts everywhere.  Each day we could see the progress of their growth as they grew larger and larger.  Along with the planted cucumber seeds there also grew tares in the field.  Dutifully, we shouldered our garden hoes each day to attack the formidable foe.  Countless hours were spent on our knees carefully pulling weeds from around the delicate and precious vegetation.  The promise of wages when the cucumbers were sold kept us at task.   After weeks of heavy toil, the plants began to blossom and beautiful yellow flowers blanketed the landscape.  Shortly thereafter the blooms began to wither and tiny stubs appeared where the flowers had been. Every morning we hurried to the patch to see how quickly they grew. The day finally arrived when dad said, “start picking.”  How exciting it was. Now we were going to benefit from the fruits of our la! bors and bring them to market. Visions of $$$$$ danced in my head. I w as going to be rich!!!! It was a tedious task.  They needed to be picked every day.  They could only be a certain size, not bigger or smaller.  Every day they needed to be brought to the pickle factory in town.  I began to be weary of this job, but I continued to labor knowing I would soon have some money of my own. One day tiring of pick, pick, picking pickles, I laid down on my back between the rows, put my hands behind my head and rested for awhile.  As I gazed up at the cloudless, clear blue sky, my eyes were attracted to something directly above.  The sun was glinting off an object that was silver in color. It looked like a donut in the sky because I could see the blue sky through the hole in the middle. I lay there and watched for a very long time and it kind of frightened me because I had not seen anything like it before. Prior to this, in my life, I had not ever seen anything in the skies other than clouds and birds. It would be years later when I saw an airplane for the first time. I am unable to place a size or put a distance to this object but I recall that it stayed stationary for perhaps a half hour and then suddenly it was gone. What was it? UFO? Dad returned from town one day and proudly offered his closed fist to me. Holding my hand, he placed a $10.00 bill into it. Wow!!! $10.00!!! All my own!!! All my hard labor over the summer was worth it. Now I could buy whatever I wanted and there was more to come. The harvest was about half over when dad returned from selling the days harvest. With a long face he told us the pickle factory would no longer purchase any cucumbers from us because they had discovered some type of blight in them. Visions of becoming wealthy quickly dissipated. Oh, well, I still had my $10.00. Before I had a chance to go to town, my mother pleadingly asked me if she could borrow the money to buy some food. Reluctantly, I relinquished my treasure and I never saw it again. Times were very difficult in those days and even if I grudgingly gave up my hard earned cash, I knew she wouldn’t have asked for it if she didn’t really need it. Note: After I wrote this story about 60 years later, my older brother and one of my older sisters told me they also remember the object, just the same as I described it.",,46.6085,-95.0523

For what it's worth.  This happened in 1954.  I was 17 years old.  I was with 2 friends, coming home from somewhere.  One girl lived across the street from me, the other was coming home with me to spend the night.  The night was pleasant, and we dilly dallied as we walked.  Was the time of year it was dark between 8 pm and 9 pm.  We were stopped, they were talking, while i looked up into the sky, and my sight was drawn to a light which, if still, would have looked no different than a star, but it was moving.  So i thought it curious, and watched.  It was moving left to right, or north to south, seemingly very fast, tho i couldn't gauge the distance.  It did seem extremely far out there, not a nearby airplane.  And there was no sound.  For it to be any further away than a local small airplane, meant it was going extremely fast.  I said to my friends, ""I think i see a flying saucer.""  In those days that's what we called them, not knowing the term ""ufo"".  They ! told me it was an airplane. I said it was going too fast to be an airplane.  They said it was a meteor then.  I said it wasn't going that fast.  They told me i was not seeing a flying saucer because they do not exist.  I looked away for a while, then looked back up to the area in which i'd seen the light.  It was there, but it had changed directions, and was larger and brighter than an ordinary star.  It was moving more slowly, and instead of moving north to south it was coming westward, at a slower pace.  I said to my friends, ""I think it's coming towards us.""  They both screamed and ran towards home. I really wanted to watch to see what the light was going to do, but the told me to ""come"" and ""hurry"". So the girl that was staying overnight and i ran to my house. But that was not all that happened that night.  I don't know if you want to hear this part.  It involves, not a ufo but what must have been an abduction.  Me.  I questioned my friend the next morning.  Too afraid to mention it to my mother.  ""Did i miss out on some activity, or goings on during the night? too tired to wake up?""  I asked her.  She said  ""not that i know of, I slept well and didn't hear anything.""  She was not in my room, but in a spare room during the night.  The things i was remembering involved activity, moving around, and - flying in and out the window.  I didn't want to mention the part about flying to anyone, not even my friend. This is all i can recall of this event.  I'm 75 now and have had other experiences but this event is the only one in which i may have actually seen a ufo.  I could tell about an alien encounter, but not at this time.",,42.7324,-71.1862

I lived in Upper Glade, West Virginia until I was 11 years old and I believe the year was 1956 or 7.  I was born in 1951.  It was summer time but unsure of the exact date.  My younger brother and I were standing in the road near our home (rural area).  Jets would sometimes fly over our home and break the sound barrier early in the mornings and I had the habit of watching for jets during the daytime. On this occasion I heard a slight whirring noise in the distance. I saw a very small silver object. I knew that jets usually left a jet trail and the jets would usually fly ahead of the jet noise. The object was moving horizontally and then turned toward me. I watched as it got closer and closer and it finally parked itself in the air slightly above and in front of me. It was maybe one hundred feet above me/ It wasn't directly above me because I could see the top as well. It was a circular disk with a smaller dome on it with square windows around the dome. It was a metallic silver in color. I don't know if anyone was in the windows because they were dark. The disk was maybe fifty feet across or a little bigger and about twenty five feet high. It sat there suspended in midair and not making a sound. After a short time it moved on slowly following the same path that the jets flew, over our home. I thought that my brother John was with me but for years I told very few people about this experience and didn't mention it to him later as adults but eventually told my sister. She said that my brother Kevin had told her the same story. I was mistaken about who was with me that day but it verified my story.

Clear bright stary summer night in Southern California, Two 11 year old Friends sleeping in a tent outside in their backyard which was a frequent practice without airconditioning.  Observed two circular spheres flying in formation from the San Gabriel Mountains in a southernly direction towards the area of San Dimas and La Verne CA.  Watched as the spheres stopped in mid air and hoovered at an elevation of about 25,000 feet.  Both spheres were yellowish orange.  No beams of light emitted off of them such as a search light or night running lights.  They were both brighter than the stars in the background and appeared closer then the commercial aircraft preparing for their final approach to LAX.  These spheres could not have been mistaken for airplanes, helicopters blimps or balloons. As we gazed at this abnormal activity we talked back and forth describing our observations to one another.  We both noted that the distance between the two balls of light was approximated at 1/4 to 1/2 mile.  Geographically measuring their proximity I would estimate that one of the spheres was hoovering over the Metropolitan Water District Plant in La Verne and the other was over Puddingstone Reservoir in San Dimas. After approximately 30 minutes, the most southernly sphere (San Dimas) flew away over the Ganesha Hills Mountains and then in a Northern direction closely following Garey Avenue in Pomona towards the San Gabriel Mountians near Mt. Baldy.  The one sphere over La Verne stayed longer and then proceeded straight back towards the mountains from which it came.

I actually did an ink drawing of the event and submitted it to Coast to Coast’s website, which they posted.  My brother is three years younger than I.  When we saw this I must have been around ten.  I don’t know if he would fill out a form like this.  I’d really like to know his blow by blow recollection.  What’s funny is that when I got onto Facebook, before that we hadn't talked to each other in almost twenty years (for whatever reason).  We got all caught up in two days (score one for Facebook).  One of the first things I asked him was if he remembered the night in the backyard when we saw the three UFOs?  I may have been living with an hallucination my whole life.  He told me – Yeah, he remembered it and he thinks about it all the time.  That night has convinced me there is something going on.! I’ve been pro-space and a Trekkie (to a point) my entire life.  I’m now 62 and actually I have been diagnosed with MDS which has really taken me out of the game, it’s a pre-leukemia, may need a bone marrow transplant.  I have a younger brother that already said he would do it if it came to it. Being that my mortality is staring me in the face, I feel like I have to get all this stuff in me – out of me, before I won’t be able to any longer.  I just heard the program on Coast to Coast tonight where you asked to send all this stuff in.  Here’s my two-cents. My Uncle gave me the telescope for my birthday.  It was in November and a cold clear night, but ya gotta try it out.  We took turns looking through it, and I’m sure we saw nothing we could comprehend.  What happened: is that we heard a noise like the sound of a jet aircraft, but we couldn’t see it yet.  We knew it was coming from the East which were houses and trees.  I had an idea to maybe see if I can see the jet in the telescope, close up. What came over the tops of the trees however, where these three classic disks.  They glowed enough that they were obvious.  At arm’s length, maybe the size of a silver dollar between finger and thumb.  What I’ll never forget (if that wasn’t enough), was that they were swerving in and out of each other; like playing, easy as you please, absolutely in control, dancing around each other.  They came over the trees,  came across the sky (clear-starry), maybe 45-50 degrees above the horizon line, which we could not see for the neighborhood houses and trees.  They went across the sky, swerving in and out of each other, go to about where North is and shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.  We forgot about the damn telescope, we were too dumfounded.  I remember running into the house to tell my mother (who was watching television) that we just saw flying saucers in the backyard.  She straight out didn’t believe us.  Why should she?  Not the same night, and I know I was still a kid.  My mother sat under the street light on our front porch, waiting for my father to come home (he worked late as a chef in a restaurant).  This could have been 1 am.  She was alone (yes under a street light at night, dark streets, in inner town Milwaukee – those days are long gone).  Anyway, she swears she heard the sound of a freight train, come from the East going to the West and it was in the sky over the top of houses in the neighborhood.  She curled up to protect herself – I cannot recollect if the same instance is when she said she saw something that was ""cigar""-shaped.  After it was gone (the noise) she said she saw a smoke trail, extend from the East to the West, being blown South from a wind from the North.  It was low enough for the street lights to reflect off it.  I can’t recall where I heard about-shaped UFOs that sounded like a locomotive?

As I continued to look, I noticed it wasn't moving and immediately pointed it out to a co-employee.  I had to point it out to him for nearly a minute before he could see it because it's so hard to see.  This same scenario plays out every day when clear and twice it h! as moved across the sky from east to northwest.  The first time it moved about 3 weeks ago, something similar in appearance to it showed up in the same spot from where it had left.  The object moved again last Saturday and when we had to go back in from our work break, it was almost directly overhead.  We are located in Commerce City, Co and are just south of one of the regular flight paths for DIA.  As we look due east, the object always shows up between 2 and 3 o'clock, looks like it's close to the air space for Buckley Natl Guard base, and seems like it's between 30 and 60,000 feet.  We've seen the object since the middle of August and reported it to MUFON but they want written reports and sketches done independently and nobody I work with trusts the government, our employer (the Postal Service) with personal info so I can't get them to report it.  I've sent several emails to 2 MUFON investigators and they want to close the case now and that's cool.  I almost consider it a waste of time anyway since there was no real support.  I've also attempted to contact some media, but no interest there either.  None of us have powerful recording equipment and the object doesn't show up on film.  Fox News Denver's breaking news reporter was out of the office the day I called and the 50,000 blowtorch or the Rockies, so they advertise, KOA radio blew me off saying they probably didn't have any better camera than we had.  In other words, a big yawn and no follow up, no nothing.  I'm very disappointed on so many levels.  I am a UFO researcher, reading and listening about the subject for 20 years and still to this day, not sure what to believe but nobody is taking me serious though I'm really nobody; just a Postal worker (peaceful I might add).  There have been sightings around Denver for a long time including some video shot in northeast Commerce City very recently but judged as probably airplanes but I am so sure that what we have been seeing is an anomaly, that I'm dying to find out what it is.  I can't believe that it is an airplane, air balloon, celestial body or satellite or space station but I totally can't explain it other than it's a small, white orb of some kind.  I wanted to keep this quiet at first and now, I don't care.  I just want it on record and my hope is that somebody will take me serious and get some serious film on it.  For some reason, I feel confidant that it will still be there for some time, I don't know why, maybe because I feel like it might be some kind of surveillance vehicle.  There it is, that's my story and I'd be glad to talk to anybody.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,,

We were watching the sky for the Perseids hoping to catch some before the full moon obscured the viewing too much.  We were looking towards the southern horizon and there was a bright object that appeared to be heading north.  Our first thought as we saw it at the farthest point from us was maybe it was the space station.  However as it moved closer towards us we realized it was lower in the atmosphere than a jet plane flies and it was completely illuminated bright white like an LED.  There was only one object.  There were neither color lights on it nor any flashing/blinking lights.  My perception was that it had a similar shape of an isosceles triangle or maybe diamond shaped.  There was no sound associated to it like an echo you hear of a jet.  It moved generally north almost like it were following alo! ng highway 89 heading in a direction towards Sierraville (not exactly above 89 just trying to give some map reference and direction).  When we first noticed it in the southern horizon until we watched it head the opposite horizon lasted maybe 2 minutes.  It didn’t move very fast and it seemed to use an easy zig-zag pattern.  It’s hard to explain exactly except when we watch satellites their trajectory appears to have a constant (almost straight to the eye) course whereas this did not.  It didn’t lose its brightness at all while we were watching it nor did it dim or get brighter at any time.  When it was in the farthest side of the northern horizon for our view it still looked bright in the sky like a large planet or something else.

This statement is made to the best of my memory.  It's about an incident that several friends and myself experienced when we were kids around the age of 11 - maybe 1962?.   We lived in the Mojave Desert in a little town called Cadiz, California.  This little town was a railroad living community where Santa Fe employees and their families resided.  Santa Fe provided homes, water, and electricity.   Most homes were cement type dwellings and a few corrugated metal garages were also built.    The Santa Fe Depot and  living community was approximately 1 mile West of our area, and Chambless was around 3 miles away located adjacent to Route 66.  It was a great place to live. People from both communities consisted of many races;  Mexicans, Navajo, Hopi and Apache, Blacks and White people.  Some workers were seasonal or transients while others remained on permanent status.  I guess you would have considered us permanent.  Those in the 1st to 8th grade attended Amboy School around 17 miles away and rode in a bus to school.  We had quite a few kids living in the surrounding area that attended Amboy school.   This above these grades would go to junior high and high school in Needles CA. Often we would gather and play various games, cowboys and Indians, dodge ball, kick ball, and others, but on this particular night when we saw what we saw, I think we were playing Mexican Ring or Kick the can.   I believe the moon was full because I seem to remember the darkness and light and shadows and the ""thing"" was partially lit by the moonlight because it was floating about 1 foot off the ground beside a salt tree near a fuel storage shed that was  circular built from corrugated metal.  Many years later I realized the best way to describe what the ""thing""  looks is a 500yrd Echo target used by USMC for marksmanship training.  It's shape was close to the photo and had a brushed silver metallic look  – not shinny.   It may have been about 2/3 the size of a home entry door or a real person, width was a little less than a door.   It did not move or make noise, it just floated in the air.    I don't recall any distinguishing marks, just a dull silver look and of course not flat as this photo.  The building layout on the PDF may be a little off but I hope it gives a good perspective for my explanation. We were playing between the bathrooms and showers, red area surrounding the pink area,.   I think the game was either  Mexican ring or kick the can, tag games.  It was getting dark, mom came out and told us to call it a night. As a group we always walked our two friends (oldest and younger brother) home after playing since their house was the furthest from the group of homes (blue line to foreman's).   We were aware of a dog that sometimes got loose and bit people, he usually hung out in the area marked - we kept an eye out for him that evening.   As a group we walked towards the fence and then along the fence to the foreman's house.   I’m not sure who it was, but someone screamed ""black dog,"" we all ran and somehow formed a single file and ran as fast as we could.  The next day we realized it was actually some buried pieces of railroad ties that protected a gas or water line.   The older brother was first, the younger second and I was 3rd and the rest were behind me.   We were all glancing back and forth  while running to see if the black dog was going to introduce himself, that's when I ran into the younger brother.  I realized the younger brother had run into the older brother, of course it was! my turn and the others ran into me.   The older brother moved quickly and had already taken many strides in the opposite direction.   The younger brother was next and on his older brothers tail moving faster than I had ever seen him run,  it was then when I saw what they were running from.  I to ran in their direction but not as fast as they did.  I recall I was curious but not scared. I caught up with them inside and we went towards moms front door (red arrow).  The others as I recall followed us but did not see a thing, they thought the back dog had gotten loose and ran away.   At mom's house we explained what we had seen.  Mom gave both brothers a pinch of salt to calm them down  - not sure it worked at all.  I recall Mom and Dad taking the two brothers home in a yellow Ford station wagon.  They were scared half to death especially the older brother, I just thought it was cool.   We talked about it the following day and I went to the site and checked the area for anything left behind or something unusual.  I don't recall if any of the brothers came with me, they usually did, but I'm sure the older brother would not.    The younger brother brought up an interesting point that I did not notice – while describing the thing to each other, he said it had what looked like a baby moon hub cap on its head.   We all agreed it was like a silver silhouette of a pe! rson floating off the ground. A few years ago around 2005, I saw the younger brother that I had not seen for many years at a family function, we talked about the incident and got some pretty good size goose bumps.  Both brothers live in the Barstow CA area today; the other friends  are no longer with us, most moved to the Navajo reservation and are deceased.  We moved out of the desert to the big city of San Bernardino during this period due to dad's job with Santa Fe. I had forgotten this event for many years and I'm not sure why I remembered.   I'm now 59 years old, I know what I saw and want to share it with you because in the ""I know what I saw"" television program I saw a symbol that closely resembled the thing we saw that night.  I have never ever see anything like this symbol in photos, magazines or television shows that even came close to resembling this  item until I saw the program.  I've tried to contact Mr. Fox the producer of ""I Know what I saw"" several times but he has not responded. Cadiz is now gone and it is hard to tell where buildings were.  It's sand and rocks now with a few small salt trees.  I've visited the area on several occasions to see if I could discern anything - it's tough to figure the place settings today.   But it sure was  a brief but interesting event that several of us experienced years ago that we still remember. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

A couple of friends and I were in my front yard talking and looking at the stars.  At one point we noticed what looked like a normal star of average intensity (not particularly bright) almost directly overhead except that it was moving around, meandering around really, in no apparent pattern, over a small area of the sky that was equivalent to about the amount of sky that you could block out with a tennis ball held overhead at arm’s length.  At first we thought it might have been something like a weather balloon that was high enough to still be in sunlight even though it was dark at ground level since it wasn't that long after sunset, and was being moved around by high altitude winds.  This meandering pattern continued for maybe 30 – 45 seconds from when we first noticed it, at which point this single star-like object split into three star-like objects of the same size and intensity as the original single point of light.  Within several seconds, these three points of light aligned themselves side by side by side (like three cars in adjacent traffic lanes) and were uniformly apart from each other (the distances between each of the three lights was about the width of a pencil held overhead at arm’s length).  As soon as they were aligned, the three lights moved slowly off across the sky in a southerly or southwesterly direction at a constant speed, in perfectly straight lines, with the three lights staying perfectly abreast of each other and maintaining the equal spacing between each other.

The orange light goes out when it appears to touch the top of the TV tower  Date: February or March 1969 (approximate; certainly between Feb 1 and May 1 of 1969)  Time: Near Midnight. Location; West suburbs of Omaha, Douglas County, Nebraska, USA  Visibility: Very Good, crystal clear atmosphere on the ground and up to the cloud base. Overcast sky with very high ceiling providing an opaque, starless, moonless background. Situation: Omaha, Nebraska has three very tall TV transmission towers on a hill on North 72nd Street and Crown Point Drive. These towers are about 1200 feet in height from base to the top. They are situated on one of the highest hills in the Omaha area, between Military Ave. ( a north-west to south-east diagonal street) on the south,  and Crown Point Drive (an east-west running street) on the north, with North 72nd Street (a north-south running street) immediately to the east.  The towers are arranged in a more or less North - South line. They are each about 600 feet apart, so the south tower is a total of about 1200 feet from the north tower. The middle tower is offset to the east about 200 feet, though most people think the  three towers look to be in a straight north - south line with each other. Line of sight: Clear, unobstructed view. My line of sight with the towers was almost exactly 45 degrees south-west to the north-south running line up of the towers. I was almost exactly six miles due south-west from the towers. Distance: I was almost exactly six miles due south-west from the TV Towers. Size of “UFO” , my guess, explained below, is that the UFO was somewhere between 50 to 100 feet long. Shapw: It was shaped like an American football; strongly pointed at both ends and completely symmetrical. As it traveled the pointed ends were front and rear. It traveled in a very flat, straight horizontal line. Appearance: The UFO was shaped like an American football. It was a bright, glowing, uniform orange color; much the color of true neon light (not “florescent” neon colors). It glowed steadily with no pulsation or variation in brightness or color. I was driving North on 132nd Street (a north-south running street), just north of Pacific Street (an east-west running street) traveling slightly up hill. That hill on 132nd St. crests just a few hundred yards north of the Pacific Street intersection. As I crested the rise I could clearly see the three towers as outlined by their red blinking warning lights. I was intimately familiar with this stretch of road as I grew up very near there. Again; I was driving and looking due north. I had to look to the right to see the towers as I crested the hill. I saw something I’d never seen before. A small orange light the shape of an American football was slowly drifting from west to east towards the towers. The “football” was moving in a perfectly flat horizontal line and the long axis of the “football” was horizontal, like a football would be if being thrown. To me it looked just like an orange neon light in both color and the way it glowed; very fascinating and pleasant to look at, neither too bright nor too dim. I laughed as reminded me of a florescent orange Nerf Football, though it truly was illuminated. This orange glowing “football” was traveling in a perfectly flat horizontal line, and apparently from my position,  headed directly towards the top-most tip of the northern most TV tower. As there were no other cars on the road, I stopped the car and turned off the headlights leaving only the parking lights on, so as to minimize any extraneous light. I sat there watching this “football” for probably no more than 30 seconds (certainly less than a minute.) until it, apparently from my view point, drifted right up to where the leading tip of the “football” touched the top tip of the north TV tower and then it (the “football”) blinked out, went dark, never to reappear. This left no visible outline. It was as if the “football” just disappeared. I sat there for probably an additional five minutes waiting to see if the “football” would reappear, but it did not. There was NO effect to the TV towers. The red safety lights on all three towers continued to blink normally the whole time. There was NO flash when the ""football"" touched the tower. The orange glow of the ""football"" never varied, never pulsed; it simply went out when it touched the tower. I was absolutely fascinated by this and not the least bid frightened or disturbed, but then again, it appeared to be a fairly long way off from me. Now, granting that I was six miles from the TV towers and it was night, so all I could see were the blinking red safety lights on the towers and the constant orange glow of the “football”, I cannot say for certain how the “football” actually lined up with the TV towers or where it actually was physically with relation to the towers; BUT, from my vantage point it appeared that the “football” was at the very same altitude as the top of the north tower and that the “football” drifted right up to the top tip of the north tower and then went dark when it “touched” the tip of the tower. Having said the above; if the “football” actually did touch the top of the tower, and then gauging its size in proportion to the tower, I would say that the horizontal length of the “football” would have been between 50 (fifty) to 100 (one hundred) feet in length.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,41.254851796008865,-96.06482784922395

I don't recall what time of year it was, but because of the weather I believe it was either early Fall or early Spring.  It was a clear crisp morning with blue skies and no clouds. I was with a small group of students, about a dozen of us, and Mr. Ford the Physical Education coach doing calisthenics near the swimming pool.  We were waiting our turn to run laps, when we were all suddenly mesmerized by the sight of a UFO.  No one said a word as we viewed this object for about 30 seconds before it disappeared. The UFO was spherical in shape. It was a bright silver metallic color.  The sun was reflecting off it's surface as it rotated in a revolving motion.  Similar to a planet rotating on it's axis.  It appeared to be about 200 feet above the ground and 150 yards from where we were at.  It made no sound, and hovered in one position until it disappeared. The most memorable thing about this sighting was how the UFO disappeared. Almost as in slow motion, it looked like the sky opened up and the UFO slipped in to it.  The best way I can describe what this looked like is if you were to lay a coin on top of a piece of paper.  Cut a small slit in the paper the size of the coin.  Then slide the coin through the slit, so you can no longer see it. That's how this UFO appeared to disappear. After the sighting, Mr. Ford was in shock and disbelief.  He told us not to say a word or tell anyone about what we saw. I never understood his reason why.   Years later I tried to contact him.  Unfortunately he never returned my message. As a side note. At that time I was a newspaper delivery boy for the San Mateo Times, and recall reading a newspaper article about UFO sightings near Coyote Point in San Mateo.

On each of these occasions the strange vehicles were observed be flying slowly at approximately the altitude that a small plane would be at, but appeared to be moving slower than a small plane would fly.  The unknown vehicles/craft did not make any discernible noises, but m! oved silently across the sky.  During each of the sightings, none of the mysterious craft/vehicles was observed to make any sudden or erratic movements. During each occurrence the strange vehicles/craft appeared in the Eastern sky without warning and without making any obvious noise or sudden movements.  The following is what was observed by this writer and three others;  •	Monday, 08/15/2011 – initial observation of the above described vehicle/craft.  Two craft were observed.  At approximately 8:40 PM, a single mysterious craft appeared over the tree line, out of the Eastern sky and preceded in a Westerly direction, when almost over our position on the ground, the craft turned in a Southerly direction.  While watching this craft for approximately 1.5 to 2.0 minutes as it was moving away from us, a second unknown craft was observed to come from approximately the same spot in the sky as the first and followed basically the same route as the first in a Southerly direction.  Both of the unknown craft were observed to simply dissolve or disappear while moving away from the campground.  They did not put on any burst of speed, but simply disappeared at what could have been about ¼ to ½ mile away from where we were standing.  This sighting was totally unexpected as we were not expecting anything like this to occur.  We were just sitting outdoors and! playing cards at the site picnic table. •	Tuesday, 08/16/2011 – Nothing suspicious observed as we were not available to be looking at the sky or expecting a recurrence of the prior evenings sighting.  •	Wednesday, 08/17/2011 – second sighting of the same type of the above described mysterious vehicle/craft.  Two craft were observed this date at approximately 8:45 PM.  The first mysterious craft was observed to be approaching the campground from the Eastern sky, in a Westerly direction.  This craft was moving silently and smoothly just as the craft of the Monday night sightings.  This first craft veered off in a Northerly direction and was still in sight when a second craft was observed to materialize from approximately the same area of the sky as the first and then followed the same route that the first vehicle/craft had taken.  In approximately 1 to 2 minutes both of the craft disappeared.  Again this appeared to occur without any increase in speed and the point of disappearance was approximately ¼ to ½ of a mile distant.  Again the four of us were playing cards and not expecting to see anything unusual.   •	Thursday, 08/18/2011 – third sighting of the mysterious, above described vehicle/craft at approximately 8:45 PM.  As described above the mysterious craft appeared in the Eastern sky, heading in a Westerly direction, moving at the same pace and noiselessly as on prior occasions.  The craft turned in a Northerly direction and maintained a steady pace until it disappeared in approximately the same position as the previous evening.  There was only one craft observed on this date.  Due to the two previous sightings we were looking for a reoccurrence of the sighting.  •	Friday, 08/19/2011 – nothing observed, however, it was well past 9:00 PM by the time we remembered to look for any strange occurrences in the sky.   •	Saturday, 08/20/2011 – fourth sighting of the mysterious, above described vehicle/craft at approximately 8:30 PM.  As previously described the first unknown craft appeared, heading in a Westerly direction from out of the Eastern sky.  This vehicle/craft turned in a Northerly direction and was followed in about one minute by a second vehicle, materializing out of approximately the same position in the Eastern sky and followed the route of the 1st craft.  Within another minute the 2nd vehicle/craft was followed by a 3rd vehicle/craft which appeared in approximately the same position as the first two, followed the same route and all three vehicles/craft disappeared within approximately three minutes, without any apparent increase in speed.  Again we were sitting outdoors, playing cards and not really expecting to see anything.  •	Sunday, 08/21/2011 – nothing unusual was observed this date.  We sat outdoors from approximately 8:15 PM through 10:00 PM seeking suspicious occurrences, however, without seeing anything suspicious or unusual.  It should be noted that during the times of these observations there were quite a few airliners and small planes observed in the area.  Engine noises were evident from these normal planes; however, except for the change in course from the first night nothing about the description or actions of the mysterious vehicles/craft deviated in any way, with the exception of the numbers observed daily.  Daily, these mysterious vehicles/craft were very distinctive as due to the flames under the craft, they glowed orange and almost appeared to be on fire, except there was no apparent emergency.  These vehicles/craft were distinctly different from the normal airplanes observed.  You will notice that all four of the occurrences described above happened between 8:30 and 9:00 PM nightly, just about when darkness was falling and making it difficult to obtain a really good view of the mysterious craft(s).  The only viewing device on hand was a pair of 7x35 binoculars which did not provide a g! ood view of these craft. On Saturday, 08/20/2011, I contacted John Ventre, Director for Pennsylvania Chapter of MUFON, (before the Saturday sightings), and he requested that I submit this report and advise what we had seen.  I had contacted him in order to determine if anyone else had reported seeing anything similar to what we had seen and he advised that he was not totally up to date on the reports, as he had been out of town for several days.  I had advised John Ventre that while we were camping Internet access was unavailable and that I would file a sighting report this date after arriving at home and having access to the internet.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,,

Bright Red UFO Seen Over Boise at End of Hyde Street Fair,Boise,ID,2011-08-16T22:22:00,light,10 minutes,"Occurred : 8/16/2011 22:22  (Entered as : 08/16/11 22:22) Reported: 9/16/2011 10:23:08 PM 22:23 Posted: 10/10/2011 Location: Boise, ID Shape: Light Duration:10 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83964.html,"Bright Red UFO Seen Over Boise at End of Hyde Street Fair This event is unique as it is an ANNUAL sighting of what appears to be the exact same UFO over Boise during a specific event.  I have seen several UFO's since living in the Boise area and have reported most of them on this website... including last year's event of the Red UFO above Boise after the Hyde Street Fair.  This sighting occurred less than an hour ago one year after the previous sighting and was witnessed by the same person (myself).  The details are as follows. This sighting is of a Red pulsating light type UFO that made no sound.  The UFO was visible in the sky approximately 15 degrees above the horizon from my perspective.  Note that I have many satellite tracking and planetary tracking programs and always check possible sightings against this database to rule out publicly known manmade objects.  This red UFO is not a publicly known satellite, nor planet, nor star, nor did it behave like one.  It pulsated a pure red glow at regular intervals that seemed to repeat; there was a complex pattern to it that I was not able to decipher--I had enough time to run inside and grab a camcorder to try filming it, but unfortunately could not focus on the object.  Oddly, my camcorder which normally functions perfectly, would not focus with automatic or manual operation. The red UFO bobbed up and down slightly for about 10 minutes, then suddenly moved (as seen from my perspective in the North End of Boise) at what looked to be an incredible speed to the East.  It then faded out of sight within 2 minutes after it exited it's hover phase. Note that the author does not drink alcohol nor is prescribed any medication.  I am a professional engineer and trained as a pilot.  I was completely awake and sober during the observation so nothing was clouding my observation.  I also trained as a Law Enforcement Officer in California in 2005.  So I have training in observation and reporting.  That said, I still don't know what these objects are but I didn't believe in UFO's until I started seeing them with (alarming?) regularity several years ago.  Even after capturing one event at extreme close proximity I still had my doubts; could they not in fact be natural phenomenon?  This event though occurred two years in a row after the Hyde Street Fair in Boise.  The position of the ""craft"" was different (last year, directly overhead/this year, to the East-South-East) but it appeared after the Fair ends.  Note also that I am outside in my front yard looking at the sky with binoculars or a telescope most nights of the year (appro! ximately 275/365) and have only seen this object in the second or third week of September... There is a good chance it will be seen on September 17th at 22:20.  Look for a Bright Red pulsating object in the shape of a light in the direction of the East-South-East from any location in or around downtown Boise.  Make sure there is a fairly dark area of the sky visible with no lights from the ground, and that no buildings and/or trees obscure the horizon from approximately 0-15 degrees above it, as referenced by overhead being 90 degrees and the opposite horizon being 180 degrees.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,43.61444520153551,-116.24467802303263

My wife and I both don't remember it making any noise. So maybe the airplane and the light we saw were connected.

All other bedrooms were on second floor. One night, my room filled with a greenish/blue light. I remember feeling paralyzed.  Awake but unable to move. Could barely life my head and I saw a smallish creature, greenish or grey in color, standing at the foot of my bed.  It was definitely humanoid, two legs, two thin long arms, a large head with huge round dark eyes. It didn't talk but communicated with me some other way. It told me to not be afraid. It just studied me.  At one point it communiciated something like ""You don't believe I'm real?"" ""Here,"" it continued, ""touch me.""  My inability to move was relaxed in on arm as it moved closer to me.  I lifted my hand and tried to touch it. My finger seemed to go right through it's wrist or hand.  There was a membrane but gelatin-like flesh inside of it. There was something else, I recall that there were holes of some sort in its palms. That's all I remember.  That paralysis occured on occasion during my teen years but no more visitations. Was I abducted?  My father incidently was -according to family stories - involved in Blue Book.

This sighting occurred on a late summer evening, just before dark in the early 70s.   I was in my early teens, and we lived in rural Greene Co, between Xenia and Beavercreek, Ohio.   At the time the area was all farm land with just a smattering of old farm houses, including our home.  My younger brother and I were in our back yard when I noticed a USAF C-119 transport approaching Wright-Patterson AFB (10 miles away) from the east.  (I assume the aircraft was one from Lockbourne AFB near Columbus where an Air Force Reserve C-119 unit was based at the time.  C-119s were very common sights as a result.)  The aircraft was probably at 2000-3000 ft, flying at around 150 mph.  As I watched I saw a brilliant light, quite small and very well defined, streak into view from overhead (approximately 30 degrees from the vertical from a southwestwardly direction) heading directly towards the transport.  For the next 15-20 seconds, the light darted around the C-119 at very high speed, performing sharp maneuvers flying above, below and around the aircraft.  The light then sped off in the same direction from which it came, although climbing at a significantly shallower angle than it arrived.  Within seconds it was out of sight.  Total time the light was in sight was less than 30 seconds. During the encounter, there was no sound other than the piston engines of the transport.   The C-119 did not appear to take any evasive action, meaning either the crew didn’t see the light or saw it so briefly they didn’t have time to react.   The C-119 continued towards WPAFB, where I assume it landed. I specifically remember watching the local news for the next few days, and reading the local newspapers to see if the incident was reported.  It was not uncommon for UFOs to be reported on TV and in the newspapers of the day, but no mention of the light I witnessed was reported by Dayton or Xenia media that I could find.

I was at Boy Scout summer camp in a heavily wooded area outside of Goshen, Wisconsin.  Two fellow Scouts and I were walking back to our campsite after a campfire meeting, late at night. We saw a dark shape silhouetted in the middle of the trail, very tall, blocking our way.  Thinking it was a bear, we stayed frozen, stock still. We had been told that if we ever encountered a bear,  the worst thing to do would be to try and run.  A full-grown bear can out-run a human  easily. The ‘bear’ was making sounds, but more like a dog’s barking than anything else: very high-pitched.  The smell was foul, like something rotten.  We still couldn’t get close enough to get a good look. In the next few minutes, an oval blue shape appeared directly overhead, about 100 yards above us. It didn’t have a clear outline but was more like a vibrating glow.  Reminded me of the blue flame from a gas stove. We went back and forth, first staring at the shape in the middle of the trail, then staring up at the blue light in the sky, for what seemed like a long time.  Probably just a few minutes, though.  The thing standing in the trail began to make a rasping breathing sound.  We were scared out of our wits. Then, in a flash, the creature took off running, upright, down the trail.  The blue light hung in the air for a brief second, then shot like a rocket in the same direction as the creature. We were really freaked out, and promised not to ever tell anyone about it, because no one would ever believe it.  As far as I know,this will be the first time that anyone besides the three of us will ever be aware of this incident.  Was is it in fact a bear, or something else ?  The connection between the creature and the blue light ?  Hard to say, no one will ever explain it.  I do know this.  Three of us saw and heard exactly the same thing(s).

I was with my girlfriend at the time.  We were driving from my parents house to her parents house. We were driving east on Pa.route 23, going from about a mile east of Marietta, Pa,.to Silver Spring.   Off to our left up high,we saw a light in the sky that seemed to be traveling in the same basic direction we were. I decided to follow it if I could.   At a certain point it, the light seemed to turn in a southerly direction.   Again I decided to follow. I turned right on the Ironville Pike to see if I could follow it again, which I was, at least for a minute or so, until we lost sight of it.  We continued on the Ironville Pike to a cross-road or intersection, where we saw it again.  But now it was not moving.  It was hovering over the intersection or real close to it.  Maybe a hundred feet or so up in the air. It was real hard to judge distance.  But it was pretty darn close.   We pulled up almost directly under it, rolled down our windows and put our heads out and looked straight up at it.  It was big, real big, circular in shape with different colored lights on it, not flashing. And it was humming.  A real deep reverberating hum you could feel in your chest.  We watched it for a minute or two when it started to move in a westerly direction, slow at first, then it shot off at a very high rate of speed and dissapeared out of sight..

I was a light sleeper at the time because I had a 3 yr old daughter.  Thinking I needed to go to the bathroom and then check on all three of my daughters, I got up and did this. About the same time I kept hearing a reedy voice (?) telling me not to look out the windows or turn on any lights.  I decided to walk down the hall to my living room to look out the door window from across the room (I had sheers on that window and could look out without disturbing anything)I then saw a light traveling down my road in front of my home. It did not seem to have anything solid to it and was about the size of a beach ball.  It was swinging to and fro from one side of the street to the other. I then ran back to the bedroom and awakened my husband to make sure I was not dreaming.  I explained quickly to him what was going on and he followed me back down ! the hall.   When we reached the end of the hall where the living room, dining room and kitchen opened up he listened to me tell of the words that I had heard earlier. He didn't believe me right away when I told him we were not to look out the windows, turn on any lights of try to use the phone because all would be useless. Well..he immediately tried the lights, none of the available switches worked so he went to the bottom of the stairs to the basement and switched all the circuit breakers off and then on and still nothing worked. Three streets over we could see a porch light or two on. He came back upstairs in the darkness and went to the phone and said he was going to call the police or electric company because he felt so uneasy. The phone was dead. Now back in those days the phone did not run on electricity but on the phone line itself and would work when there was no electricity. Then I told him about the light going down the street and also what I had seen out the side w! indow in our bedroom when I first got up. We had a small, deep lake at the north end of our road about an eighth of a mile from us called Earl Lake and I had seen something there hovering above the lake with a ramp of steps going from the lake up to a craft of some sort, it seemed so large that I could not make out its size or shape from where I stood in the bedroom. I did see, however, some sort of beings carrying what looked like sacks upon their backs going from the waters of the lake up the ramp and into the craft.  They were strange looking, dressed in dark coverings that came just below their bottoms with hoods on their heads.   There was light coming from the opening of the craft and below what appeared to be one end of the craft just over the edge of the lake.  They looked to be about 4ft tall and very stocky with strong looking legs.  I could not see their faces because of the hoods. Off to the side at the bottom was what seemed to be a very thin, tall being I could not see very well as it was standing away f! rom the brightest lights. After my husband tried the lights and the phone he became very uneasy and both of us sat down in the hall out of sight of and windows. After approximately an hour I once again heard the voice and was told to resume what I wished and that all would be alright. When we looked out the door window and the north bedroom window facing the lake, we saw nothing. All was back to normal, the lights and the phone were now working. There was never a repeat. After this had all ended , my husband and I agreed to just not say anything to anyone because we thought someone would think we were crazy.  I am now 70 yrs old and have never forgotten this incident. I still remember it very clearly. I had always had the ability to see visions and hear certain faint voices from the time I had been a very little girl. I never talked about it because when I was young I thought everyone had the same ability.  When a teenager and young woman I had told my mom and she said not to advertise it because others would think something was wrong with me.  As I said, I had certain things come to me but not of this magnitude.  I did tell my husband after we were married and was able to prove to him through certain instances that I could see visions and sometimes sense things in the future, although I did not try to cultivate this ability.  So when this particular instance happened I needed a witness because it was different from any other circumstance I had experienced in the past. It so frightened me that I prayed to have my abilities taken from me. I tried for years to suppress it but even at this time in my life I still see things but am freer telling others about what I see. (But not often). In summary:  I tried for years to find someone else that had seen beings like the ones I had seen but didn't know how to proceed in researching any of it. There is more background and instances in my life but I hesitate to talk about them to too many people. When I listened to George Noory on the evening of Oct 25th I heard the request for people like me to report what I had seen.  Since I am now 70 yrs and this happened when I was 35yrs old. I thought someone else should know.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,42.60518613445378,-83.90061092436974

I could not see anything between them and afterwards I realized there might not have been any stars between them either on a clear calm night with plenty of stars out.

We were scared to tell anyone at the time, but just about three weeks later, there was a major sighting in Haslett, Michigan and a UFO hovered right over my aunt and uncles house, they said it light up everything around and the light in their windows woke them up.It was only then I felt I could tell my parents about it.  I was 14 or 15 years old at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2011-12-12T00:00:00,42.8497,-84.1454

Their door was unlocked, as was normal in the seventies.  I walked over to their balcony door, opened it and stood there for a moment, just staring outside.  There was an empty lot between the apartment I was in and the next row of homes, which spanned approximately 100 meters.  It wasn't long before the UFO appeared over the lot, traveling  perpendicularly to my position, just above the rooftops, at about 10 kilometers per hour.  It stopped directly across from me for about 1 minute and then resumed its movement, until I was unable to see it an longer.  It had soft,  multicolored lights rotating around it's center, blinking in unison. I believe it was metallic and about the size of a car.  I do not remember hearing anything stra! nge or out of the ordinary while watching the UFO.  After it left, I closed the balcony door, and returned to my apartment, without waking my parents.

It was around 2:00 in the morning and snowing.  I was just outside of Murphy's, when I pulled over on to a large snow covered dirt shoulder to tighten my tire chains that were hitting against the wheel well of my car.  As I kneeled down to tighten the rear passenger side tire chains, a bright white light flashed on me, lighting up everything around me.  At first I thought it was the headlights of a vehicle coming, but noticed there wasn't one.  I didn't think anything of it, but a few seconds later it happened again. This time the light stayed on, and I immediately stopped what I was doing and looked to see where it was coming from.  I noticed it was coming from directly above me shining through the snow covered clouds.  There was no noise and I couldn't see anything other then the beam of light shining directly on me like a spot light. I wasn't sure what was happening.  Suddenly I felt a sense of panic.  I jumped back in my car and tried to get out of there as fast as I could.  I was about 15 miles from home, but because it was snowing, and the roads weren't plowed, I couldn't drive any faster then 25 miles an hour.  During the trip back I didn't see a single vehicle in either direction.  I felt scared and alone. When I finally got off the highway and into the subdivision where I lived, I felt a sense of relief.  But when I turned the corner to go up the driveway to my house, I saw a bright light at the end of the street shining through the clouds.  It looked like a really large star.  But I knew this wasn't possible, because of the low cloud cover from the snow storm.  I was really frightened by the sight of this.  I felt like what ever it was that shinned it's light on me earlier, followed me home. I ran into the house and immediately woke my parents to tell them what I saw.  They didn't think much of it, and just wanted to go back to sleep, reassuring me that everything was okay.  That night when I went up to my room I was really excited and nervous.  I was so wired I couldn't sleep, and stayed up all night into the next morning. As a side note. I lived in Arnold, California for 7 years.  It's about 4000 feet above sea level on the western Sierra Nevada mountain range.  Living there I experienced many snow storms. When it snows there, a thick cloud cover blankets the sky.  The clouds are very low to the ground, and you can't see through them.  Whatever I saw that night somehow penetrated this blanket.

I haven't told anybody about this, really, because I saw it as a child around 8 yrs.  of age.  I am an artist and have always had a very creative imagination...but I don't believe in  ghosts, and I dont believe in anything I can't figure out. I guess not understanding as a child, it was easy for me to overlook or dismiss what we  were looking at...  But always wondering in the back of my mind, I now am an adult with  children, and I scoff at the unexplained.  I call it the un-understood. I never have nightmares,  and am very mentally organized about what I understand.  But this, memory of when I was a kid  still stands out with no explanation. I remember it well, even watching my father freak out. It must've been like 1983, driving northbound toward North Kansas City MO.  It was my  father, my brother & I singing...as the song ended, we all looked at each other still laughing, in an old fashioned Ford truck. It was then, that I saw something- or I guess we all kinda looked up at the same time..and  saw what seemed to me as a round airplane hovering above our truck. (of course I was a kid  and didnt know what it was)   My dad yelled out, ""Whoa,! Do you guys see that?"" we were like, kind of taken off guard, but we answered ""YEAH!"" because there was definitely something huge,  and hexagonal shape with a cross of blue or green lights. but it was only above us so, we could  only see the bottom of it. The lights were in a plus shape surrounded by a hexagonal or octagonal shape. We stared  at it for what seemed to be the longest red light ever.  Then it went up, up, still we could only  see the bottom..and then it flew away (south west) so fast behind us, that we couldnt see what  the heck it couldve been for sure.. but now I am sure that what I saw, I have never seen again,  nor have I ever seen anything fly that fast ever. Im sure my father and brother wouldn't mind  validating my story, and I would be glad to take a polygraph.  This is the only thing I have ever  seen that I could not explain. This may not be a big deal but I know it's real. Sorry to have wasted your time if it is of no  help.  For us, it was the ultimate ""UFO"" experience.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,39.13,-94.5622

I have two different sightings at different dates and times within days of each other.  On August 16th, 2011 at 17:00 in Kansas City, I was looking out my sixth floor window, facing N.E., when I noticed an unusual object. This object was higher than most planes I see.  This rectangular object appeared as a two-story building, but on its side, not tall as a building.  I remember thinking how it was not very long.  There were evenly spaced rectangular, well-lit openings which I thought at first were windows, but later I realized since they were far away, they had to be more like doors.  Although I did not count them, it seemed there were only about 8 of these openings on the first layer, then below them there were identical openings.  This ""building"" was very still, not moving for about 15-20 seconds.  Then it moved slowly and disappeared.  This object bothered me, but I decided not to report it since I did not have a picture or video. Then on August 20th, at 21:15, I looked close to where the “building” had been, just slightly west of there and I saw 8 orbs, almost like stars, but in a loose group together.  They were a little larger than stars, all the same size.  None of them moved at this time.  After around 10 seconds three of the orbs on the outer edge of the entire group started to move slowly as the others remained motionless.  Taking turns, the first orb of the smaller group went behind a neighboring orb and disappeared.  Of the smaller group this left two and again, an orb went behind the other and disappeared, leaving one and then it disappeared.  They did not leave, they just ceased to be in my sight.  As soon the last orb was gone, the remaining larger group of about 5 orbs moved slowly at the same time but did not go very far.  Then they all repeated the same actions of the first group, going behind each other until they were gone, although they went more than one at a time as before, disappe! aring quicker than the first group.  Wondering how these orbs disappeared, perhaps they were actually going into something that was cloaked, thus disappearing from sight.

After the show we went back to the campground we were staying in, which was also packed with thousands of other people. Around 1145pm, sitting around our campfire, we both noticed one or two orange lights in the sky. Clearly far away, they seemed to be from an airplane. The movements didn’t seem quite right …they seemed to be moving with a speed/motion not consistent with their apparent distance…but all in all didn’t seem like anything so remarkable, so we both forgot about it. But something happened a few minutes later that made me remember those lights. As we sat in our lawn chairs facing south, I noticed something floating up in a southwesterly direction, apparently from a close-by campsite. A couple/few feet wide, it was mainly orange like a Dreamsicle, but also had a round, very bright orange center. It started off low to the ground and just floated up. I thought to myself that it was a plastic bag that was on fire and caught in an updraft, didn’t seem like a big deal. But it kept going; it did not burn out as something like that should. “What the hell is that?” I asked my uncle. “I dunno” he said “I thought it was a bag on fire, but that should have burned out a long time ago.” It just kept going and going and going and going until it became a point in the sky…seemingly quite very far off. It seems most likely that someone at the event set something off. But I have no idea what- it was not a flare or firework that shoots a light trail in the sky before exploding. This thing started off bright close to the ground and just kept floating up. Plus it didn’t move quickly at first like something ignition-propelled should. The image of a jellyfish floating up in water is the best way I can describe it…but then it became a point that seemed quite far away, yet without taking a long time to do so. My uncle and I were drinking a good few beers that night, but not to an extreme point. We both have 20/20 vision. We did ask some of our friends there if they had seen anything; they did not. We were not inclined to go walking around interrogating people…this is a pretty crazy show, it’s a very festive environment. Anyway, I just thought I should reach out, see if anyone else saw anything there/then. We are both down-to-earth people but cannot explain this thing at all. I am 43, live in NYC, and work in advertising. He is 53, lives in Ohio, works in excavating. Neither of us can remember seeing anything quite like it.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,41.39883085106383,-83.65384787234042

In glancing up to the North/East, two unusual objects were clearly visible resting in the night sky.  Each object was about a half a hand outstretched and a hand apart.  The formation on the left had two large white lights - which looked almost like a car headlights to an invisible car. The object to the right looked something like the Pleiades but upon standing stationary and staring, there were white dots of lights grouped in a boomerang shape.  Both objects seemed to have a shape blending with the dark night sky to which the lights were attached.  The two-light object on the left had brighter lights than the one on the right.  The lights were white or whitish blue.  The lights did not blink. The objects made no detectible sound. Both objects appeared to be still but upon closer observation were moving in tandem of! f to the north/east.  While trying to follow the trajectory of the objects on bike and upon crossing the intersection, the objects were suddenly no longer visible.  If the objects were aircraft they would have still been quite visible from a farther distance but it appears as though they vanished from the night sky.

One was shaped triangular and the other was oval shaped. They were flying slow at first, then sped up fast perfectly in sync with each other. I said to my friend wait what is that and she replied I was just thinking the same thing. Next I said to her look there are fast blinking lights coming from them. The triangular one appeared as if it was rotating. It was apparent they were not air planes or helicopters. I asked her for her phone and started taking pictures. Then told her to follow them. They were large about 400 feet in diameter aprox 75 ft from the ground.  They were headed north west  in the same direction as we were. After five minutes They both went off to the east and higher into the sky. Then they just stopped and hovered there. We pulled over on to the side of the road and took pictures and video. The lights were extremely bright, and white. They stayed there for ten minutes. I went running off the side of the road to get a closer look and then they started coming closer to us. So I stopped and then the two objects separated into six flying objects. The one shaped as a triangle became three little objects flying. So did the oval shaped object. They were much smaller (maybe 55 ft dia) now and traveling faster. Because they were rotating fast in a triangle shape they appeared as if it was one large object which is not the case. The same goes for the oval object. Then they started moving further away we got back into the car to try and follow them in the opposite direction. Before they disappeared they were now  headed north east. We turned our car around and proceeded that direction looking for them. We have video of our lights and electronics turnig on and off. They were nowhere in site anymore.  I looked over and saw a police car just sitting on the side of the road.  This was now on E. Cypress and Seller st. I told my friend we have to tell the cop and report this. She said no he will think we are crazy. I said to her he’s facing the direction of the objects maybe he seen them to.  She pulled up next to him and I said hello “ Im not crazy or on drugs but did you just see... and he interrupted before I could say another word and he said “ The flying objects in the sky,  Yes I did”. He then told us he called Travis air force base to see if they had anything in the air and they told him no. He gave us his card with all his information he was actually the sergeant and then said “ Well if I disappear and am not hear tomorrow make sure you report t! his”.

Called the Sonoma County Sherriff dept and they gave us your number.  In our phone conversation- You explained it was Jupiter. In the conversation with you, I shared a UFO I had seen about 25 years ago and promised I would email it to you. Last night I was listening to Coast to Coast (as always) and you were on.  You were great and so clear and the main thing I heard from you was send in the report- no matter how long ago- for your records.  In our phone conversation, I promised I would report this to you. It was New Years Eve about 25 years ago. In my living room- I had 2 couches facing each other in front of the fireplace. My dear friend, ((name deleted)), was sitting on one couch facing me and I was looking out the huge window behind him.  He was talking and I saw an object o in the window behind him.  At that moment, I did not know what it was. It was elongated and had lights at each end and in the middle- seemed they were red and green or blue. blinking on and off but mostly on. I was so stunned  as I looked at it and tried to make sense of it in my mind.  It hung for a moment and I was too impressed by it to interrupt my friend.  I could not miss a moment of it.  After a moment, I swear- it went straight up in the sky- really straight up.  Before it went straight up- I tried to tell him "" look backwards and see this"" by then it was gone.  SO FAST- SO SO FAST There is absolute no doubt in my mind that it was a UFO.  It was long-and seemed to have a cigar shaped center and shorter bottom and top level. I know it was something from out of this world.  The bottom might have been longer- Not sure I will never forget it. I felt so at one with it. It is weird but seemed so far away and so close at the same time.  It was so powerful- so clear. The shape was so unusual and difficult to describe.  The lights were not normal lights nor neon. I do not know what to say about the lights-  They were very bright but nothing I know. They were deeply clear like nothing I know.  The lights were sp strong- so clear- so there- I can still see them but do not really have words for them- round/oval/ perfect in dimension.  Distinct- different- just different This is more difficult than I thought- trying to convey what I saw.  What was there-  anyway ,  Dear Peter- thank you with all of my heart for what you are doing.  It was really difficultt for me to write this. I think one reason it is hard for folks to write is because it is so hard to explain what they have never seen before,   Blessings to all living things.  Thank you It wanted me to see it.

We were at a location known as Soldier’s Bluff and my brother and myself had, around 01:30, left the group to sit at the edge of the cliffs and fish.  While we both sat there on an igloo cooler, we stared at disbelief at the beauty and clarity of the stars that filled the sky.   While staring into the night sky, looking towards the East, I spotted a single light moving across the sky.  As I watched the light, it turned into two lights, with one being slightly above the other at about a two o’clock position, similar to how a plane would appear if it was traveling across the sky and slowly turned towards you.  The two lights became further and further apart, causing me to finally exclaim out loud that that was a HUGE plane because of the distance that they were from each other. (I assumed them to be wing lights on an aircraft). As they grew even further apart at an undeterminable distance, seven more lights appeared one at a time from either within the first light or from behind it and swooped into formation behind the first light as it made its way back across the sky from either the direction it came or in the direction it turned, with the second light falling in behind them.  These objects seemed to emit their own bluish, white light with no blinking lights or colored lights. They traveled in a Westward direction, with the larger, round shaped first light leading the smaller, seven round lights that were closely followed by a large rectangular light. My brother and I watched in amazement as the 9 objects slowly and silently made their way across the sky before and above us. We tried to rationalize the fact that 9 airplanes or helicopters in the night sky would make SOME noise, but we heard nothing.  We finally decided that it must be a smaller plane pulling a lighted banner. As if to prove us wrong, the large rectangular object rose slightly above the line of the formation and shot across the top of the formation to the halfway point, where it stopped and slowly drifted down between the formation to stop below the formation where it hovered in place until the last of the seven smaller lights finally passed over it at which point it rose back up to continue to take up the rear of the formation. We watched the formation glide silently across the sky until we could no longer distinguish the objects from the stars and turned to look at each other for a long moment, then back at the sky. At that point we both arose from the cooler and clumsily gathered up our fishing gear and made our way back to the campsite to find several friends standing there looking at and searching the night sky. I asked if they had seen the lights, and with astonished looks on their faces they muttered a meek ""Yeah, What was that?""    We replied that we were not sure ourselves what they were and we all spent the rest of the early morning discussing the possibilities. At sunrise, we all broke camp and left the camp area and returned home to Dallas, Texas.  The following day I contacted the Dallas Times Herald (no longer in existence) and asked them how I could find out if there were 9 aircrafts in the area on that night, at which time I explained what we had seen.  I was told that their paranormal investigator would contact me shortly.  I never heard from that person and assumed they had discovered some military exercise that had taken place over the area that night and never re-contacted them or attempted to contact anyone else of authority concerning this sighting.  I believe I filed an online report with MUFON a few years back, but aside from that, I have told no one but friends or acquaintances about the incident.

I was babysitting for a lady I babysat for regularly.  She lived just out of town off  at that time very rural road called Old Tuscaloosa Hyw.near Bessemer Alabama.  She returned from a date around 1 am and I left her house soon after that for the aprox 45 min drive home. As was our usual arrangement I promised to call her when I got home to let her know I had made it safely and she could go to bed.  There were very few houses on that stretch of road until it reached the Bessemer city limits and few streetlights.  I can only guess the time as my car had no clock and I did not wear a watch, but I would guess it was between 1:15 and 1:30 am considering the time I had been gone from her house. I had my window down so I could smoke a cigarette without stinking up my car.  I heard nothing but the sound of my own engine, and soft music from the radio.  I saw a light, like a single headlight coming up behind me in my rearview. It looked like it was about a mile or more behind me.  I glanced down for just a second, looked back in my mirror and was surprised to see the light was almost caught up to me and was coming fast. I heard nothing but the sound of my own engine and was startled because I assumed it was a car or motorbike and I heard no noise.  As it rapidly came up on me I thought I was going to be rear ended, so I turned on to the shoulder of the road and braked hard. The next thing I know, I seemed to awake, though I do not remember passing out.  My car was switched off with the keys in the ignition.  It seemed like only minutes since I stopped.  There were no lights around and it was still dark. After a few moments I pulled back on the road and continued home.  As I got into the city of Bessemer, I was surprised to see more cars out and about than there usually were at 1:30 in the morning.  I arrived home and went in.  I picked up the phone and called the lady as I had promised.  She answered on the first ring and when I said I was home she scolded me for not calling sooner.  She said she had been calling me for more than an hour and was just fixing to come looking for me.  At that moment for the first time I looked at the clock. It said 4:20 am.

I was around 7 years old, living in the Hudson Valley in New York.  It was around 8pm  (I know because that was our bed time).  We faced West, South/west and the object headed south (I think)   As my parents were putting us to bed we noticed something to the south.  We lived beneath the landing path of the planes at Westchester Airport, so we always saw planes landing.  This was not a plane. This thing was miles away and, recently, my mother told me it was like a floating stadium.  I remember seeing, what I believe, was a single row of different colored lights.  I think the lights kept changing colors; either that or they did something my mind could not conceive. The object moved very slowly.  I think it floated over the Saw Mill River Parkway.  Because of our location, we looked down towards the Saw Mill River Valley.  This object took up a decent portion of the sky and it did not move fast at all. We ran to my sister's room to get a better look at it. I was young and greatly impacted by this thing.  The one thought I remember was ""who is flying that thing?""  I felt like I could look into the windows to see who was behind the wheel. Were there windows?  I don't know.  I do remember the eerie feeling that someone or ""something"" was watching our world from the inside of that ship. Years later I came across a picture of what might be the craft.  When we saw it, the craft was not tilted on its side.  It was completely horizontal.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,41.1726,-73.7712

I am not quite sure what I saw. It first appeared as dim light in the distant night sky.  The light appeared to be slowly moving from 20 miles away NE to SW. I mentioned to a friend that was there and he noticed it but paid it no mind. We first surmised that it was a helicopter.  Several minutes had passed and I noticed that it was moving ever closer but I could not hear the operation of the machine.  I watched it as it floated directly overhead. It made no sound and appeared to be black or gun metal gray and machined on the bottom (lines or groves in patterns). It was triangular in shape with a light in each corner. I stared at it for a second.  The rest of the group appeared to pay it no attention at all even though it was right above us. It was stationary above us at about a 100 feet.  After staring for a minute it started to slowly move to the east.  I walked the alley di! rectly underneath it trying to follow. As I followed the craft it appear to notice me following.   At that time it started to ascend into the sky. I imagined that it would rise into the clouds but it did not.  After ascending for a couple of seconds it just disappeared completely.  No one spoke of the incident but I have recounted the story many times to my family since it happened.  I had not heard of a triangular UFO at the time so it struck me as a bit odd.  The movie  Contact came out and my brother called me on the phone to state that it was odd that they used a triangular UFO in the movie in light of the story I had always told.  He had never heard of triangular UFOs either until that time. I now know that black triangles are a common siting and that vanishing is a common phenomenon associated with them.  I am sorry that I cannot remember the exact month or year but I know that school was in at the time and it was around 1985 or 1986.

My brother and I were on our way to our elk hunting camp when we stopped along the dirt road to take a break.  We were stopped along the edge of a Forest Service road near the top of Wolf creek drainage north of Highway 26. We stopped the motor of the pickup and stepped outside.  The night was very clear and quiet and we began to talk about being able to see satellites as they were passing overhead. We also noticed that we were high enough that we could see the glow from the Portland, Ore area to our SE. As we were looking for more satilites we both noticed a bright glow in the west that we thought was a distant planet.  The object was much brighter than a satilite and as we watched we realized it was moving in our direction from out of the west. This object passed almost directly over our position then turned at about 45 degrees and headed SE in a direct line to Portland. We noticed that the object made no sound that we could hear, glowed in a white light that did not change color. The object went directly to the center of what we believed was the glow of Portland lights and disappeared into that glow. As we were commenting to each other about what we had just seen and what it might be, about 15 or 20 minutes went by when we noticed that the bright object was comming out of the Portland glow in about the reverse direction it went in. We also noticed after a minute or so that there was another bright object behind it. As both objects got closer to our position we realized that the lead bright glow was the flying object or sphere we had initially seen and the second bright object was a USA fighter aircraft chasing the first object. We estimated the distance between the two at about 1/2 mile apart.  The sphere came over us as it did before with the fighter aircraft close behind.  The fighter aircraft had his forward landing lights on and we could clearly see the front part of the fighter aircraft and the pilot.  Both of us having military backgrounds we knew by the sound of the fighter aircraft that he was going as fast as he possibly could but did not gain on the sphere. With these two together we could esitimate the glowing object or sphere at about 5 to 6 ft in diameter. Again the object did not make any sounds that we could hear or change colors.  The sphere followed the same course it came in on with the fighter aircraft chasing it.  A few minutes later two more fighter aircraft following the same flight path came into our view.  Both flying as fast as they could. The sphere, the initial fighter aircraft and the two fighter aircraft all came over our position, turned about 45 degrees and headed west out of sight and sound. When we returned from our hunting trip about three days latter we checked all the local papers for any stories of Unidentified flying objects and found none.  My brother called the airbase and received the usual answer "" no unusual activity the last 5 days"".   At the time of the incident we both had law enforcement background and training.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,,

I was looking up at the sky and saw what looked like two shooting stars. One of the shooting stars did what shooting stars do, Shot across the sky and disappeared, but the other one seemed to land at the end of the lake.  At this time I was thinking it was an amphibious airplane.  It started coming towards us and I could hear the wind pick up and getting stronger at what looked like a big ball of fog was coming at us.   Soon the bald headed man got up.  He was scared and rocks were hitting his back.  He ran up the hill and yelled at me we better get out of here. I looked at him and the ball of fog and decided I would rather go with the ball of fog.  So I started walking out into the water towards the ball of fog. Then it just vanished.  Just instantly.  The water and wind calmed down and it was quiet again.  I did not know what to make of this.

After hearing Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast AM this evening (Tu., 10/25/2011) urging witnesses to document their experiences, I decided to pull into the nearest late-night restaurant with a WiFi hookup and finally write this down. This is not a report of a sighting (I will submit another report for one of several I've had over a 40-year period), but rather of what I firmly believe to have been an alien presence in my home. It was breaking dawn on a Sunday morning at the end of August, 1988, about 6:00 a.m. when I found myself waking from a very sound sleep to hear my wife, who was sleeping next to me, speaking in a very high-speed whisper.  And then I heard the response from another individual, also whispering faster than anything I'd ever heard like it in my life. I suspect it was the sound of these two that woke me, but the experience of HOW I woke up was unique as well.  First, I was more clear-headed than usual compared to how I typically awaken.  Second, it was as if by instinct that I came awake without either opening my eyes or moving any other part of my body--as if subconsciously I had been preparing for just such an opportunity to observe as the one I found myself in at that point.  But I have no recollection of actually planning any such thing, only that when the moment presented itself, I ""played dead"" and listened. The speed of the back-and-forth whispering was such that I could not make out a single word being said.  It was as if two individuals were trying to mimic the sounds made by an old fashioned radio dial being turned back and forth as it nears a station signal; kind of a ""swishing"" and ""swirling"" of sounds, only being peppered in whispers at machine-gun velocity. I listened intently as this went on for about one and a half to two minutes.  I noticed that there was no emotion, no sense of urgency, as might be expected when someone speaks much faster than usual.  Instead it was more like ""machine efficiency""--a personal characteristic that I would never ascribe to my wife.  It struck me that information (it impressed me as being more like ""raw data"") was being exchanged very quickly, like between two computers, as opposed to a conversation taking place. Then it suddenly stopped.  I have no way to back this up, but it felt like I had been ""caught"" eavesdropping (when I was ""supposed to be"" asleep), which brought this bizarre exchange to an abrupt halt. I don't know why, but instinct seemed to kick in immediately, telling me to pretend like I had just started to wake up.  So I did. The second I began moving, my eyes still closed, I heard the sound of little feet running from my wife's side of the bed, out the door of our bedroom, then fading down the hall.  It was unnaturally fast, lasting less than two seconds from start to finish. At that point I gently shook my wife's shoulder.  It took a moment for her to emerge from a very deep sleep. She remembered nothing of the encounter. I did not dream this.  I was wide awake and alert, and did not go back to sleep once it ended. The situation never repeated.  And I'd never heard of anyone having a similar experience until one night recently on C2C-AM, when George Noory took an open-line call from a man whose experience closely aligned with mine.  But the caller had barely gotten out the gist of his story when Noory had to cut to a commercial, and he made no comment on it afterward.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

On August 22nd at 2:00pm I was outside lying in the grass with my dog looking up at the sky. We regularly relax and watch planes fly over heading to the Richmond Airport. The path is directly overhead and quite low. Looking up I saw something that is very hard to explain. It started out drifting from the same direction that planes normally fly to land. They were higher than normal planes and it was too high to land and it did not look like that was the purpose. There were 5 round metallic looking structures all drifting together. They changed shape and direction but kept going on the same straight upward path over the airport. The 5 silent objects circled each other and did weird crazy 8 like movements all while changing shape and color. I looked away and looked back 3 times and wiped my eyes trying to figure out what I was looking at. I finally lost sight of it when I could no longer look into the sun. It seemed to fly into the Sun or at least in that direction so it could not be visible. They were floating in the same straight path the whole time. They were not balloons and it was not planes flying in formation. I cannot explain much further but I have seen enough to know what it NOT was. It lasted about 4 minutes from the time I saw it to the time it was not visible, but it seemed much longer. I was not scared nor am I now. I am just confused.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,37.5495,-77.3194

I grew up in a small town in northern California.  Cloverdale is situated 90 miles north of San Francisco, at the north end of Sonoma county it is surrounded by rolling hills and vineyards.  The geyser’s (at one time the world’s largest geothermal power plant) sits about sixteen miles to the east.  This area was considered sacred ground by the Indians of the area and they made trips there for healing and ceremonial rites. My father worked at the geysers for about twenty years.  During his many night shifts he and others had seen several un explainable lights in the sky.  During the early nineties the area known as the geysers, along the borders of Lake, Sonoma, and Napa counties was known as a UFO hotspot.  I had many sightings alone and with other people beginning around 1989. This particular event happened in the summer of 1992, along the road to the geysers at roughly 3 am.  I was with two friends C and G who were parked along the side of the road.  We were on a slight bluff overlooking Geyser’s creek, facing up the river valley towards the east and the geysers.  Suddenly C. or G. said, ""What’s that?""   There was a super bright white/blue stroboscopic light, blinking two or three times a second heading just towards us from up stream.  The light appeared suddenly from a hill around a bend in the river.  It was slowly following the path of the creek, at a very low altitude and slower than a plane. It was lower than the tops of the hillsides on either side of the river valley, maybe 100 feet high…  It kept getting closer and closer and all I could see was the light blinking almost hypnotically…  The light was so bright that one couldn’t make out a shape.  It was as if there were no craft, but only a light. Eventually the light reached where we were and passed us just above the tree tops and disappeared behind the hill to the west.  It was heading in the direction of town… It floated by extremely close, within a hundred yards or so and we all noticed that it didn’t make any sound… none… zero… if it had been a plane or a helicopter or whatever we would have heard it the entire time we saw it, it was that close. This is where it gets weirder.   My friends (who themselves are avid ufo observers) got in their car and turned around to try and follow it.  I was left alone with my truck.  I went to relieve myself  behind my truck, feeling quite dismayed by what we had just seen.  All of a sudden I heard a sound that seemed to be the birds in the trees chirping in unison!  Now this is at three in the morning when birds do not chirp.  Suddenly, the chirping became louder and so intense that I could feel the vibrations turning my stomach, not unlike when at a concert, the bass rattles your pant leg.  Although this was an otherworldly sensation, the chirping was at such a vibratory wavelength that it made me feel as if my head were going to implode…  I almost fell to my knees from its force… slowly it faded, sounding like a cross between a flute and a whistle.  That is the closest description I have of the sound…. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2011-12-12T00:00:00,38.7827,-122.9232

We noticed what appeared, at first, to be a plane moving Northeast to Southwest.  Approximately 90-seconds into our observation, it abruptly changed course, going Southwest to Northwest for about another 60-seconds.  We had continued to watch it, because we noticed a very bright white light that would pulse on and off while two, equally bright, red lights did the same at opposing intervals.  Although there were several other lights, identifiable as planes, also moving in other areas of the sky, we could not make out a definite shape of this object, even when it moved closer as it changed direction.  This first object disappeared after a time, but not into the horizon, it just seemed to be gone.  While trying to locate it again, retracing the path it had taken, we noticed three other small orbs of light had appeared.  They did n! ot pulse or waver in color or intensity, were star-like white, one being brighter than the other two.  Or, perhaps it was closer making it appear brighter, it was hard to tell.  They appeared to be higher in altitude than the first object, but no higher than Cessna, or light aircraft, can fly.  They had no sound and disappeared, as oddly as they had appeared, after approximately 2 minutes.  The brightest light, and one of the dimmer ones, moved at a fair pace from Southwest to Northeast.  The third light, a short distance from the other two, moved at a same pace from South to North. (Directions approximated.)  It was as if all of these objects simply went dark or vanished.

We arrived early so I sat on a log waiting for the boats to come in.  This spot was a brief walk from the highway, perhaps 400 ft or so from the road.  My friend sat on the sand, leaning back on the log looking at the sky. He caught my attention by saying, “Look at those strange seagulls up there.”  I looked up and saw five to six ‘planes’ that had a strange shape, bulbous middles apparently white metal for the sun was glinting off of them.  The time may have been an hour later, like 4:30, come to think of it for the sun was low in the sky.  It was a clear day with few clouds in the sky. These planes were more than a mile high by my estimation and way too large to be birds, to appear as large as they did from our vantage point down below.  Further, the metal wings were moving alternately.  “Those can’t be birds – they are too large. Those are planes! Look at the shape,” I said.  ““Gulls are streamlined, don’t have bulging, round middles.”  “And gulls flap their wings in unison. Just as I said that, the planes began moving their wings in unison, as gulls do.  I know it sounds strange, but he and I both remarked that we felt as if our brains were being scanned and picked, our thoughts being read. We continued watching these “planes” flying aimlessly back and forth above us in the sky.  If their shape were not unusual enough, from time to time one or more would “disappear” – against blue sky.  And then reappear.  We got the impression that somehow they were going to and from another dimension. I reported this bizarre sighting to the UFO reporting group in British Columbia, Canada.  Their president returned my call and asked me many questions about the sighting and my personal background and history.  I do legal investigative work for lawyers and am not known for lapses of consciousness or imbibing any mind altering substance, by the way.  If my friend had not seen the same things in the sky, I might not have reported it.  The president of the society confirmed that he, too, had seen such planes over the Campbell River in Surrey while walking his dog.  But he saw just one, not five or six as we had seen.  When I told him of our impression that these were going back and forth between dimensions, he said that was a good possibility from the way they vanished, almost dissolving against the blue sky – and then reappearing. There is no doubt we saw what we saw in this long daylight sighting.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,49.13031102362204,-122.80632944881889

I was sitting outside my house in The Woodlands, talking to my boyfriend. It was a nice warm, cloudless night. Two orangish amber colored fireballs appeared on the east side of the sky, moving west at a relatively slow pace.  These objects seemed to be VERY close-by but I have no way to say how close. They made no noise.  They were at least as big as a half-dollar if you hold it at arm's length. They had an erratic, shaking look to them as they moved directly south of us.  They then stopped and stayed hovering in the air.  Their shakiness stopped and they were completely frozen. One was slightly lower in the sky than the other.  It was very hard to discern what they were. They had a multifaceted look to them, much like reflectors from a bicycle wheel or something. They seemed very flat it was hard to make out any actual 3D form to them.  Then, after sitting there about 5 seconds, they suddenly shifted very quickly in the sky so that the lower one was now higher and the once-higher one was now lower. It is very difficult to explain in a narrative.  They froze again, shifted back to their ori! ginal positions.  They hung for another few seconds and then suddenly accelerated into the stars almost too fast for the eyes to follow.  Almost like how a shooting star is almost too fast to see, so these were gone in an instant. I can say with certainty that they went UP. I have a masters degree in psychology, I have taken astronomy in college. I have lived near air force and other military bases. I have a very rational mind and I have no idea what I saw that night.

As I was coming up to the side entrance of my house I looked up to see a triangular object moving slowly from SW to NE.  I lived at that time in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  The Calgary airport is in a north easterly direction about 10 miles away.  It is not unusual to see airplanes’ coming into land in this area of the city, what is unusual is that the object was only 200 feet above my head, whisper quiet, and had no landing gear extended beneath it.  Also, the speed it was travelling, about 30 mph, would have stalled the engines had this been a jet aircraft.  Most aircraft when landing power up the engines to prevent a stall from happening and the engine sounds are very distinct. In addition, I noticed only two white lights on and pointing straight down.  One light was located at the front of the triangle, the other on the right end.  The lights reminded me of car head lights; the same color white but only larger and much farther apart.  I estimate the length on each side to be greater than 30 feet. At the time I believed the object sighted wasn’t an aircraft.  I scanned a channel on TV recording landings and departures of aircraft at the airport.  The Calgary airport I believe has restricted landing and departure times between midnight and 5am. There was no scheduled arrivals’ showing on screen. I am a regular listener to Coast2Coast and very soon after I learned of a similar object that was seen in Phoenix on March 13, 1997.  I eventually pulled up a photo on the internet of what is now known as the ""Phoenix Lights.""  The photo showed a triangular object with a white light in each corner, but was much higher in the sky.

I woke up six months after I had participated in finding a downed plane in the Angela, Montana area.  What was unusual about that event is that I established a grid pattern outside of the FAA grid pattern and the people who came with me to search in the Angela area found the plane only hours after we started that day.  The FAA led search had been fruitless until that seventh day when people were finally willing to listen to me.  I am a sensitive and was led to the area the plane was found by the dead pilot. Six months later, I am floating in the air with this white R2D2 type unit shining in my bedroom under some sort of white beam of light.  I realize I am paralyzed.  These probe type things snake out and attach to my head.  I cannot speak.  My husband is dead asleep.  I can only scream telepathically, ""In Jesus name, you will let me go! I command you to let me go ...""  Hey, it had worked on what I perceived to be ghouls before. The white unit said, ""Sleep.  You will sleep..."" in this hypnotic voice.  I told him to go to hell.  I was wide awake and we went back and forth while I commanded the thing in the name of the Eloihim and all angels to let me go.  I seemed to be floating above my bed almost to the ceiling with seven things that were making this weird   hum noise attached to my head. This goes on for some time and the mechanical voice keeps saying, ""Sleep ...""  Suddenly, a new voice starts to speak to the angry and freaked out me who is eloquently telepathically telling this robot thing off, and it is a non-robotic, female voice.  She calms me down.  I ask her why they are doing this to me.  She says, ""We have heard about what you did in Jordan (the town larger than Angela) and we have come to see why you can operate on such a high frequency with your mind.""  I get very calm.  I end up losing time.  I don't know anything for a time with this humming noise taking over in my brain.  She informs me they are done.  I ask her what they found.  She replies, ""You are ... a secret weapon.""  I am a pacifist and am very disappointed by this conclusion. I find myself tucked back into my bed and my husband still won't wake up.  I am freaking, but I go back to sleep, still feeling paralyzed.  I wake up, record the 'dream'.  What is so strange about this is I don't believe in UFOs at all at this time.  I have a first cousin who claims she was abducted on Lolo Pass and I have always thought her a nut.  I talk to my husband only about this for years because I am confused to the core over 'the dream'. As a sensitive, I talk to dead people.  Unfortunately, the ETs are making my life too complicated.  They put things into my dreams and I don't like it.  I feel like I'm in some Star Trek episode some nights.  There are definitely a variety of them.  They seem to be extra dimensional.  I prefer a world view that includes my dead mother talking to me or a dead actor telling me he was murdered over these others who are coming through star gates or portals,  Even the little demon type beings are easier for me.  I'm scared of being abducted again.  I'm not afraid of no ghosts.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,46.59667368421053,-112.08131345029241

I've seen three different UFOs in my life. First when I was in elementary school, maybe 7 or 8 years of age. The first incident took place when I was on my way to school in the morning. I was the only kid at the back of the bus. It was a sunny day in my hometown. Through the emergency window, the large window-like door at the rear of the bus, I was watching the sky, when something of an anomaly caught my eye; a bright object was flying in the sky, seemingly controlled by something as it moved. I can't exactly remember if it was following us, or if it was just moving around in one region in the sky. The only way I can describe it is that it was a large bright orb, almost like I was watching a miniature sun that was moving, and I could look at it without it burning my eyes or anything which, as a kid, or an adult for that matter, was and is quite impressive. It suddenly vanished (the whole event only took maybe 30 seconds to a minute) then came back, almo! st like a light turning off then turning back on. After another few seconds of watching it as we drove away, it vanished again, and I never saw it after that. Because I was the only one at the back of the bus and because everyone else was looking out the side windows in their own seat in the middle and front of the bus, I suspect I was the only one who saw it. I never told any of the other kids as I was quite shy in my childhood; I'm sure you can imagine how hard it would be for a young and shy child to bring up UFOs.

First I apologize for withholding this information for so long.  It was late on a cool night around 11  It was not quite summer not quite fall. I was standing outside after walking a female friend home. My friend and I were discussing constellations and stars so we were naturally looking up to the sky. It was a very clear night and you could see the entire night sky over the city. My friend and I ended up talking around a half an hour or so and she offered me something to drink, I asked if I could get some water so she went in the house to get it for me.  She was in the house for around 3 minutes or so and I continued to watch the night sky. I was actually looking to spot a falling star or similar anomaly when suddendly an object started to block my view traveling southwest at a very low rate of speed.  I shifted my view north slightly to see what I thought would be a plane headed to Detroit Metro Airport yet it was not.  This object was perfectly triangular in s! hape, flying at an altitude of 400 feet or less, and was completely silent.  There were hundreds of small lights underneath the craft but they looked to me to be windows like those of a commercial passenger jet because the light did not shine out, it shined through.  There were running lights of some sort at the front tip and two corners that appeared to be externally mounted and super bright white.  They were lit steady and were not blinking. It looked like a flying city and was dark gray or black metal where there was no lights.  I estimated this craft to be the size of at least two football fields across (rough estimate) because once it was directly overhead it was all I could see in the sky briefly.  I watched it another 30 seconds or so and then the object either accelerated away at a tremendous amount of speed or simply turned translucent because I could not see it the distance anymore.  By this time my friend had returned with the water, she handed it to me and asked what was I looking for.  I drank the water and told her nothing, fearing she would think I was crazy.  I never told anyone about this event until recently and even though it was so long ago the sight is burned in my memory as if it was ! today!

It was about 12 feet off the ground maybe a little more because at that point in the road it's a little elevated, it was your classic UFO that people talk about circular and the center was its drive point because that's what was spinning.

It stayed with for that long and instead of taking off in a hurry I actually got to watch take off towards the west at a nice slow pace and disappear over the Rockies.  I was close as 15 yards away at some points, there was no windows or any lights flashing that I could see, even though I only saw the one side.  The center as I said before was it's drive and other than it's spinning, I also noticed how it switched for a better term to raise and lower it's self",2011-12-12T00:00:00,,

I was standing facing west, facing the ocean.  The sky was a clear night sky. A light, very bright in apparent magnitude, entered my field of view from behind me on my right, almost above me.  On the instant I thought it was a meteor.  In the next instant I would've interpreted it as a light of apparent magnitude like Venus streaking towards the east.   For most of my observation it seemed like a star moving and dimming in apparent magnitude as it moved away from me across the Georgia Straight until it was too dim to keep track of. I could not determine an elevation or speed other than to suggest it was moving jet speed but without making a sound.  The initial rate of angular change would suggest the light flew near me because if it was a mile high or more it would've been moving thousands of miles/hour. I could hear and see a small plane in the sky as well perhaps a mile south of me, and I bet the pilot of that plane had a nice view!  I hope this description is reasonable considering it's been 10 1/2 years since I saw it and the details of the exact time are not remembered.

We were all surprised.   As we were all shocked and talking about what had just happened, a formation of about 15 more in a cresent formation went by,but very slow, it was followed by another 15 in cresent formation going by very slowly.  This formation was followed by a huge ship that was rectangular,completely black with no lights at all.  This was followed by two more cresent formations,15 balls in each group, followed again by 15 balls flying at random,but in a tight gride. There looked like there was an observation window in the front of the big ship were you could see the outline of two individuals(aliens?). This sighting happened in broad day light.  I think the most incredible thing is the big ship was surrounded by what looked like fighters (balls of light) which lead me to conclude that were ever this ship came from it needed to protect itself.  Although this ship looked and acted peaceful, it was obviously prepared to protect itself, which in my mind would mean there are aliens out there that are not friendly.

The use of my name or any identifying information about me or my family is not allowed unless written permission is issued by me. Thank You. We had moved into our new California home in July of 2000.  Our residence sits close to the top of a hillside community three blocks from a fenced off mountainous area to the north of our residence.  The incident I’m sharing took place three months after we moved in approx around October 11th, 2000. Also I feel I should note that somewhere to the north east of our residence inside the above mentioned wild uninhabited area is an old oil drilling facility that at the time of the incident had been dormant for many years according to local neighbors. Presently there is a local political and social debate taking place regarding the reopening of the drilling facility. I was told that at this time tests and surveys are being conducted up in that previously abandon drilling area. There is activity taking place in the form of helicopters flying in and out of the area at all times of the day and night. I know the oil drilling has not been approved yet so I assume the activity is due to! environmental study or site preparation in the case of a yes vote on its reopening. But in October of 2000 there was no activity in the mountain area. I arrived home late from work on the night in question at approx. 2315 hrs to find my two young children asleep in their respective bedrooms and my wife asleep in our room which is at the very rear of the house. I checked on them and without changing out of my shirt and tie. I went to the living room and began to watch TV. The living room was dark, except for the light of the television. The only lights that were on in the entire house were that of the kitchen located, based on my sitting position in the living room, directly at my one o’clock as well as the laundry room light that is next to the kitchen. The local news was towards the end of its broadcast as the weather and sports reports is what I was able to view. It was then the incident began. I heard a distinct rustling taking place in the kitchen, like the noise made when one is opening a potato chip bag that had been rolled shut and clipped for a while. The noise caught me off guard because I was the only person awake in the house. From my chair I could look down the hallway to the bedrooms and would have seen if anyone had gotten out of bed and walked to the kitchen. Besides the kids at this age never woke up after falling asleep and if they had stirred awake I would have heard them get out of their beds and they surely would have called out for me or my wife. My view of said hallway was unimpeded and from my sitting position in the living room was directly at my eleven o’clock. My heart raced as I knew none of my family members were actually in the kitchen. I became more alarmed as the rustling lasted a very long five to six seconds. I was in total belief that someone was in our kitchen. The noise was clear, slow and deliberate and there was no doubt that it ! was coming from inside our home and specifically from our kitchen. I was frozen. I blurted out “Who’s up?” for some reason, but there was no answer.  The rustling immediately stopped I assume as a reaction to my verbalization.  I was certain someone was in our home as my senses went wild. My hair on the back of my neck and arms stood up and I felt a burning sensation down my spine. In very stern and aggressive voice I blurted out again, “Who’s up?”  I was frozen in my chair, I prepared for a physical confrontation. I prepared to defend my family.  I thought of securing a weapon and quietly as I sat in my chair took off my belt to use the belt buckle as a striking tool. I slowly began to stand and it was then the electricity to my home turned off.  The TV and both lights in the kitchen and laundry room abruptly turned off.  The house was completely dark and without power. My first thought was that the intruder(s) cut the electricity to aid there activity. I was in full red alert as I was certain I had a home invasion situation on my hands. I stood and quickly walked to the kitchen belt buckle in hand prepared for a life or death struggle. I planned on grabbing a knife the first chance I had.  The soft moonlight that spilled in from the kitchen window illuminated the kitchen slightly.  As I turned the corner from the living room into the kitchen I saw nothing, no one. I did not hear footsteps of someone retreating away from me or out the laundry room door or to the rear of the house.  I quickly confirmed the laundry room door was shut and locked. I realized I needed to clear the house room by room. Could have the intruder fled down the hallway as I rounded the corner from the living room to the kitchen? Possibly, but not very likely as I would have heard such activity. I armed myself with a knife and a flashlight and went down the hall to clear the rooms. My son’s room was first. He was dead asleep. I looked under his bed and in the closet while keeping an ear out for any noise in the hallway behind me or any othe! r areas of the house I had not yet cleared. I moved onto the next child’s room and found him dead asleep as well. I cleared the room as well with no signs of anything out of the ordinary. The children’s bathroom is what I cleared next, nothing out of place. Onto the master bathroom witch is connected of course to the master bedroom. The master bath room was clear. As I began to exit the master bathroom I was moving slowly and listening for any noises in the house. I was at the threshold of the master bathroom entering the master bedroom. At the threshold I was approximately 9-10 feet away from the foot of our king size bed that sits directly in the middle of our bedroom. Once again I was 9-10 feet away from the foot of our bed. I was startled by what I saw next. My wife who had been asleep during the entire incident to this point was oddly sitting upright on her side of the bed. I did not notice if she had been sitting up as I entered the master bath seconds prior. Nevertheless she was sitting erect and this caused me to stop my gait immediately. I was now one foot past the master bath threshold standing in my bedroom, once again approximately 9 feet away fro! m the foot of the bed. She then whispered in a perturbed tone “Why were you standing over me?” remaining still I responded, “I just walked in the room, I wasn’t standing over you.” She replied whispering and even more upset, “Someone was standing at the foot of our bed looking down on me, it woke me up, I know what I saw!” My heart raced again as I placed my index finger of my right hand to my lips urging her to be quite. I cleared our bedroom as my wife sat in the bed with the blankets up to her nose. The master bedroom was now clear. The only place the intruder could be is in the last room of the house, the office! I shushed my wife again not having time to share all that had transpired and deliberately set out to clear the office. I cleared the office in a few seconds finding nothing. I came back to the master bedroom and advised my wife to get up out of bed and to follow me. She tried to turn on a lamp and I advised her that the power was out. She hurriedly followed me as we stopped in to check on each child as we made our way back to the living room. I also cleared all the rooms again as we moved forward through the house. Once in the living room I asked her to describe what she saw at the foot of our bed and she could only convey that it was a tall dark figure and that she thought it was me. I reiterated that I was at no point at the foot of the bed and that I had just then walked into the master bathroom and began to exit said bathroom when I noticed her sitting upright. It was then I was able to describe to her all that had happened to me the past 10 minutes in short but concise detail. She asked several rational questions about the incident and I reconfirmed the points she had inquired about. Sh! e lit a few candles and decided to call the power company to see what was wrong with the power. I peered through our large living room window and did not notice anything out of the order. The one street lamp that sits on the opposite side of our street, three to four houses east, was on as was the power to the residents across the street as I could see a few porch lights on. I opened the front door and walked out onto our porch. I had a strange heavy feeling on my chest and felt uneasy. I found this to be odd as I had calmed down completely from the earlier night events. As soon as exited our front door I felt anxious and edgy for some reason. I noticed that the power was out on all the residences on our side of the street, the north side as it were. There were no porch lights on our side of the street and that was not the norm. I came back in the house and told my wife that I was going to take a walk up the street to see if the power to the residences north of us was out. She went ballistic. She told me under no uncertain terms that she did not want me to leave her and the kids alone in the house especially after the events I had told her that transpired minutes earlier. She grabbed my right arm and begged me to stay in the house with her. I would not be denied. It was as if I was compelled to go outside and take a look around. I felt like I was being drawn to investigate the night’s activities further. What happened next was unbelievable. I walked down my residence walk way and stood in the street for a second or two. There are no sidewalks in our neighborhood so I walked w/b on the street under the cover of the huge 50 year old fichus trees that line the street. I reached the corner which is two houses west of my home. I looked north bound and saw that several porch lights were on telling me that the power was not out in all the residences to our north. I walked north on California street about half a block and a strange eerie feeling came over me again, I felt scared for some reason. I turned around and walked south bound back to my street. I turned left and headed back east bound towards my house. The fichus trees on the block drop theses dark burgundy berry type pods and they were all over the street. If you step on the freshly dropped berries you will inevitably bring them into the home as they stick to the bottom of ones shoes. The berries will stain the carpet as we had found out on a prior occasion. I! was looking down, to avoid stepping on said berries, as I walked back to the house using the faint moon beams that were shining through the fichus trees monstrous branches. My gait could be likened to a person hoping stones as they cross a shallow creek attempting not to get wet. I began to feel slightly more relaxed as I got closer and closer to my house. I glanced up and noted the moon light that was creeping and dancing through the branches and was thankful it was lighting my path on the street. I looked back down careful not to step on the previously described berries when suddenly the entire street was lit up in an extremely bright white light. Initially I stopped walking and was dumbfounded as to where this light was coming from. I looked to my left and right simply taking in the scene that had changed in a second. I then looked up into the trees and observed intense white beams of light piercing through the branches of the trees every chance they could. The light was intense and occasionally I would need to squint because of the brightness. I was frozen as my mind was unable to explain the sudden appearance of the light seemingly out of nowhere. As I continued to peer up at the tree and the light, I could tell that the light source was of course above the trees and was slowly moving in a southerly direction from the mountainside. The light was so bright I couldn’t accurately tell what the height of the light source was or what object or vessel was emitting the light. All I could tell was that it was moving slowly southbound and it was directly over my house now. If I had to estimate the light sources height I wou! ld have to say less than 250- 300 feet. Less than a football field would be my most educated guess. The light continued to move slowly southbound at what appeared to be approximately 5-7 mph at best. The light was now directly over the middle of the street and the light beams continued to shine through the trees branches down onto the street. I remember looking down at the street again to marvel at the brightness of said light.  I took several steps forward keeping the light source in my vision at all times. I found myself not under the protection of the trees any longer. I was now in open space in the middle of my street almost directly in front of my house. The residence directly across the street does not have a fichus tree in the front yard and this allows an unimpaired view of the sky looking southbound. The light source was now more or less over the house directly across the street from my residence. There was no sound emitting from the slow moving light source. No chopping of blades such as you would hear from a helicopter. There was no jet engine or propulsion noise present. There was no green or red aviation flight lights present as well. The light source was too low to the ground to be any craft I have ever seen. Suddenly the light accelerated forward and parallel to a speed I can only describe 10-15 times faster than that of a meteor racing downward and across the sky heading entering our atmosphere. The light source travelled an immense length air space in less than one second. If I had to estimate the distance it travelled I would have to say approximately 30-40 miles in the previously described one second of time. At the time of its parallel acceleration not a sound was emitted from the light source, It remained absolutely silent in its forward motion and the light became smaller in size almost instantly. The light source size was that of a grape from the position I continued to observe it from. Then the light source took a vertical trajectory, comparable to a child sliding “up” not down a slide. The light source during this upward trajectory increased speed and was traveling even faster than it had during its initial parallel acceleration. The size of the light source at its last visible observation as it turned upward was now that of a small pea.  Suddenly it was gone, simply disappearing out of sight and, what I believe to be, out of our atmosphere. I was unable to move, I was frozen staring at the area of the sky where the light source once was. My heart was beating fast and loud. I felt sick to my stomach. I had no idea what I had just witnessed but I knew in my heart that there was no way that source of that light was from anything on this earth. The speed was greater than anything we as a civilization can possibly have at our disposal. I walked up to the front door of my house and my wife opened the door. She had the portable phone to her ear and was on hold with the power company. She slowly removed the phone from her ear dropping it down to her side. She was looking at me with a facial expression of concern. She said “What’s wrong with you, you look like you seen a ghost?” I stared at her without saying a word. She said “Your pale, get in the house, what’s wrong?” My response was “I just saw a UFO. I can’t explain what I just saw.” I asked her if she had seen the light over the house and she advised that she had not and that she had been in the den on hold with the power company. It was then that the power company employee came on the line and advised my wife that there was a small pocket of outage in our area. My wife asked her if she knew why and the operator advised that she wasn’t sure why. My wife asked how long before the power would be back on and the employee stated “We need to find something wro! ng before we can fix it and right now we don’t show any blown transformers or downed power lines.” My wife hung up the phone and not 5-10 seconds later the power came back on causing us to jump. I explained to her what I had observed outside our home and reiterated that when I got to the door on my way back that I looked shaken. The events depicted above are absolutely true and accurate. I have told a few friends and family members of the facts surrounding the events described above but have neglected to officially report said incident.

Okay so im working a midnight at my Job and I go outside for a cig and I notice this light in the sky that seems to be about 200feet up( so fairly close) brighter than the stars.  It began slowly moving in circles, but it was like jerking in circles.  Like making a hexagon circle. Almost like it was scanning what was below. I ended up staying out there 45 minutes watching the UFO move a big chunk across the sky; a big chunk as in the amount of time I was there.  With my peripheral vision of staring at the main object (I didn't say this part when I called) I began to notice 3 little red lights moving even slower in sporadic directions. Anyways, I go inside to mop the floor and I had this urge to go outside and I look directly up and there was, what I think, is another UFO- but more mechanical looking than the bright light still in the air, but at first I thought it was a plane cause it had multiple lights (red, white, yellow) and they flashed, it kept going to the heading toward Duluth, mn.  I ruled out plane because it might sudden side swipe while still going straight; and as far as I know planes don't do that. I haven't seen this one since it went out of my vision  Now between the mechanical looking UFO and the other light kind they didn't interact with each other in anyway, just passing it. It's currently 5:40am now and the UFO is still going in mini circles just in a different area of the sky. I assumed it would probably leave before the sun comes up, but it's still roaming. and there's really not a star in the sky anymore but you can still see it bright as day. This is my first sighting and it wasn't super eventful but its got my attention like a motherfucker. I even tried calling coast to coast am so I could tell them LIVE while it was happening but I didn't get through. Also I did take a video on my iPhone, but the camera is shitty so it looks like just a dot of light, but what's interesting the video could see the stars and you can definitely see the light. It's pretty much the only thing u can see. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly not a serious report.

I still can't believe it. Around 9AM, I was headed SE on Highway 30. I was running late for work due to sleeping in and my having to stop to get gas. Before I reached the Sauvie Island bridge, I saw what looked like a plane in the sky -- white, glimmering, about the right size.  This may sound unusual, but since I was a kid I've looked at planes and always waited to see their wings. This time, however, it remained sort of roundish and slowly turning, since the light reflection looked like it was changing. So I started to wonder if it was a helicopter but very high up. As it turned, it slowly got darker -- and suddenly it was gone. Since I was driving, I really couldn't scan the sky much to find it. I kind of smiled to myself that it was sort of like a UFO sighting. As I got closer to Linnton, however, I saw the thing again! The experience was the same only it took place over about 10 seconds instead of 30 or so. Again, it started out glimmering, then ""turns"", goes dark, and was gone. At this point, I was curious. Did I just lose track of it before? Because I was driving slow this time, I was able to search the sky a bit. Nothing. I got my first stop of the trip at the Kittridge intersection. I look up again and I see the darn thing a third time! This time I had a better chance to watch it while the streetlight was red. There were clearly three lights and a Y- or T-shaped frame that looked like a gray plane without its nose. The lights made me think of the classic ""triangle UFO"" for a moment, which I thought was pretty weird. All of a sudden, the lights on it go out one by one. At first, it seemed like it had disappeared again. But I squinted and I realized that I could see it flying away SE -- a little more East than I'm facing. It was fading away into the sky's haze and moving very fast. I'd say fast like a jet, but the horizon haze gave me the impression it was higher and faster than jets I've watched. I eventually lost sight of it in the distance. The light turned green and I didn't see it again. I hadn't thought to take out my iPhone to snap a picture. Each time I saw it, it was a surprise. And obviously I couldn't take a photo while driving.

The light got closer and moved at a very fast pace.  I said to my husband “what is that? What is that?” We both got up and went outside to my back porch.  It was a very large UFO, perhaps the size of a football field, I am guessing.   Even though it was very high up it was still massive in size and relatively low as we could make out that it was round in shape.  We observed the UFO coming out of the North and heading towards the South.  We stared in awe for a moment as it came towards us.  There was absolutely no sound and it just hovered, then it made a wide U turn towards Tontogany (Northeast) and at that time we were able to see the lower half of the aircraft which had, what looked like to me, at least four circles on the lower half of the UFO.  Each circle appeared white but when I got my camera and took a video the white light came up on my camera screen as being multicolored and blinking o! r flickering, although it did not appear this way to the naked eye only on camera.  In person it appeared solid bright white lights but on camera is was a range of colors blinking.  I have a couple videos, one is very descent but I am somewhat disappointed that I didn’t capture it at its closest range in which we first saw it.  At one point it seemed to lower or drop rather suddenly, which I also have on camera. I only caught about 30 seconds of it before it disappeared above and beyond the town of Tontogany.  Interestingly, we also saw and heard a airplane on the North and opposite side of the sky so we could actually compare how loud and how little that was in comparison to the UFO. Whatever it was, it moved incredibly fast and I believe it had the potential to move a lot faster than we witnessed, maybe even lighting fast.  The first sighting was at about ten minutes til 9 o’clock pm so it was still somewhat light out but dark for the most part.  We live just outside Tontogany, Ohio which is a very small town in the rural area outside Bowling Green, Ohio.  Also, there was an extreme amount of lighting just prior to seeing it and during the sighting as well. Even though there was mass amounts of lighting in the sky, the night was clam and still, with no rain or thunder yet just lighting every 5-10 seconds or so.  Not too long after it disappeared, maybe 10-20 minutes later, we saw it again!  This time it was much higher up and moved at a much faster speed as if it were leaving and no longer observing or hovering over the land.  It went from the North sky to the South sky in a matter of seconds and then it disappeared.  About 10 minutes after it disappear! ed there was a severe thunderstorm in which rain and thunder accompanied the lighting and the lighting even intensified.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,41.4192,-83.7408

There was no UFO to be seen. I wish I had the presence of mind to watch the UFO for the whole time. I might have seen it blink out as the jets went overhead. On the other hand, the sonic booms would have caused me to blink and I would have missed the disappearance of the UFO anyway.

We both later on drew a picture of what we saw and they look almost the same. The features we both noted were:  About 4 to 5 feet tall and ran on the two hind feet. The knees bent backward, not forward as a human. It was extremely fast and made it across the road in 3 to 4 seconds. It had the body of a slim small child, not like a fat Kangaroo. The arms chugged back and forth like a person would run. The head had a pointed chin and a pointed top at the back like a roosters comb. The body looked gray or some other dark color. It was not fat,  but was slim. The thing looked to be an Alien to both of us. We have never seen a picture of any animal that resembled what we saw.

As I gazed at the sky I noticed a strange bright light, brighter than a star in the South Southwest Sky just under and to the left of the Big Dipper.  It seemed as if it may have been 10 to 20 miles away.  It had multicolored lights  moving around the bright light horizontally while the bright white light was pulsating in a rhythmic fashion.  The multicolored lights changed color almost as if the colors were smoothly changing from color to color like a prism or color wheel.  This immediately got my attention. I continued to watch for 15 minutes and noticed that it did not move, at least not that I could perceive. I then went and got my wife whom saw it herself and made me aware that there were 2 additional lights pulsating in unison with the initial anomaly.  The other 2 lights were smaller and only white with no other colors like the initial anomaly.  A three formed a triangle. The other 2 were only visible for 10 – 15 minutes.  When my wife and I confirmed at 22:30 hrs that it had not moved I called my friend who lives 20 miles away and in the direction of the object.  While on the phone with my friend, I described the area of the sky it was in and he was able to locate it.  We were very excited as this is a topic we are interested in and have been sky watchers for some time.  The points that compelled our belief that it was a UFO were as follows:   1. they did not move.  2. No conventional aircraft has lights that are blue, green, red, yellow, etc. &  3. It seemed way too high of an al! titude to be a helicopter. I then went inside the house and ended the phone call with an understanding that he would continue to watch it and call me if he saw any changes.  At about 23:30 I took the dog out and noticed it was gone. I scanned the sky and noticed it was now resting in another area of the sky.  If it were originally at 7 o’clock it was now at 11 o’clock and not moving. I observed for 10 – 15 minutes. This is where it gets strange. I consciously focused on the object and asked a series of questions in my mind. “What are you?”, “What are your intentions?”, “Where did you come from?”, “I want to know”. Immediately, my son came running out the front door in a panic. He told me when he came down stairs for a drink he saw a white hooded figure out of the corner of his eye. He said it looked like a white towel floating in the air and it moved. He said when he turned to look at it, it vanished. He was visibly shaken. I listened to his description then comforted him and tucked him in bed. Bear in mind my wife was sleeping at this point. I played around on the internet and went to bed at about 1 AM. The next morning my wife tells me she came downstairs in the middle of the night and saw a hooded white figure with no face in the same spot in the office as my son had seen. They had not spoken of this to each other. The difference was that she saw it facing her with just a black area where a face should be. She was visibly shaken and had goose bumps as she recounted her experience. She said that although it was very real and bizarre, she felt at peace and it did not scare her. We did not talk about this around our son as he is too young for these things. The possibility of one of them contaminating the other’s memory was very small as I made every attempt to control my personal investigation of the white figure. I had them go into separate rooms and draw what they had seen. They drew very similar pictures. The figure had human shape and only visible from the waist area up. It stood approximately 6’ tall. It moved when my son saw it. It seemingly looked at my wife. Obviously this incident shook us up a bit. I don’t know what the significance of it is is but I do know they are related. We have never, in 7 years in this house, seen anything out of the ordinary. We are sane people. We are confused.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,38.9033,-75.6113

No objects/crafts seen. A report on events experienced by myself in late July of 2004 near Hays, Alberta, Canada.  I do not remember the exact day any more.  Time of event was between 10:25 pm and 11:00 pm (so after dark) and the sky was overcast.  My own position was roughly 50°04’20.91” N, 111°45’37.62” W (on Google Earth, if you wish to see the area). These events were documented right after I experienced them, but I have since misplaced the paper I wrote on.  I did not know of any organizations that I could report this case to, though I’ve told about three other people since it happened.  In general, what I experienced were two separate and distinct events that appeared to be the effects of a release of energy of some kind.  I did not see the source(s) of the energy release(s). The narrative of events:  I was working (for my third summer of employment) on a grazing lease near Hays.  My job was to maintain and operate the pivot irrigation equipment on the lease land.  I was about to retire for the night when I remembered that I needed to check on a pair of pivots, through which we were spreading fertilizer, to make sure they were still running.  I took the farm truck to the site (the coordinates given above) and checked on the fertilizer feed (the pumps were still running).  As the fertilizer was almost gone, I sat in the truck to calculate how much longer it would last so I would know when to close the fertilizer feed (looking at my watch at this point, it was around 22:25 local time). Upon finishing my calculations, I closed the door (which I had kept open for the cab light) and looked up through the windshield in time to see a dull red spot of light in the clouds to the south and a little west.  The spot expanded, becoming a ring of the same red light, and continued to spread across or, more appropriately, through the clouds like a wave created by a stone dropped into water.  As the edge of the ring passed overtop of me, both pumps were shut off (they were electric).  The time from first seeing the spot to the edge of the ring passing over me was 2 to 4 seconds.  I heard no sound that I did not recognize and assume that there was no sound to accompany the red light ring. After wondering at this for a couple more seconds I got out of the truck and turned the pumps back on.  Having to prime them manually, this took roughly 15 minutes.  As I opened the truck door again to get in, my attention was turned to a little south of east, where I saw a bright flash of light that seemed to come up from the ground, its source hidden by the hill between me and it.  This time the light was bright white nearer to the ground and was shaped like a beam from a spotlight pointing straight up.  Higher in the sky, but well below the clouds (probably less than 300 ft) the white light became blue, then purple before becoming too dispersed to see.  This light event took place in a split second and gave me the impression that there had been some kind of large electrical spark or a small, contained explosion, which would be a cause for concern as there are oil wells and a storage area or processing station in the vicinity of where the light seemed to come from.  Again,! the light was not accompanied by any kind of sound, except that of the pumps surging, as if the electricity had been affected by this light or its source. I waited for two or three minutes to see if anything else would happen and to make sure the pumps continued to run.  Then I set out in the truck to investigate the area where the oil wells are, but being already low on fuel and not seeing anything amiss on the other side of the hill, I went back to my bunk, definitely feeling “weirded out” by the experience. The next morning, I told my boss about the second light I saw (but not the first) to see if he knew who monitored the oil wells.  He did, and he called them, but they reported no irregularities in their operation and no-one from their company was around that night.  Going past the oil well sites to check on other pivots, I noticed nothing different.  The pumps where I was the night before were still running when I checked that morning, so it would seem nothing else happened after I left. I’ve never heard of anyone else seeing something similar, but would like to know if anyone has or if anyone knows the causes of either case.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,,

The object than slowly hovered it seemed right over the top of the hotel over my room.   That's when I most definitely saw a triangle flying hovering object not making any sound or noises.

In the woods along a trail in Bellingham, WA (connecting to Alabama St). I was almost to Alabama st, coming from the direction of Haggen on  the trail.  It started with a bright ORANGE (amber) light (like a fire ball) way down the trail.  This was about three am back in August of 2005. I thought  what I was seeing was another person or(two to three people -I thought) with head lamps on their heads (looked like a ball of fire or orb of  light 6"" wide -from way down the trail).  I was by myself and thought -I'll walk towards the lights, they were @ the same level as a person  walking on the trail... but way down about a 1/4 mile from me.  I walked towards the lights and they became blurred -the closer I got, the more  they became one light. The lights were gone when I got to where I thought they'd be -couldn't find them on the trail.  I went to the left of the trail, over a slight  levee like hill that runs along the trail and there it was in the middle of a field. What I saw was a beam of plasma lights in a column (went every other beam was yellow and then orange -yellow, then orange)  The column  was 1 1/2ft wide and 30ft from the ground to the sky (vertical in shape) and it went every other beam, ea. beam about 1 1/2 inches wide and  30ft long -all condensed (fit tightly together) -no spaces between the beams of plasma or lasers. -orange and yellow plasma beams of light all bound up in a tight column reaching 30ft into the sky and touching the earth  (the column was  about 1 1/2 ft wide -I believe it was plasma beams of light, yet I don't know -I was afraid to go near it or touch it) I think it was scanning the ground. The whole column of light(s) was slowly rotating clockwise.  {About fifteen ft up (some of the beams) while still attached in the middle would fan out about 3 ft from the base of the light (as if scanning).} I could not see where the lights were emanating from as if that part were not visible to my eyes but I feel there was something more. What I don't know was WHY or HOW I had even been up at that hour or how I had even been walking on that trail that night. Whatever it was I was seeing frightened me.  I as far as I know only watched the lights for about 45 seconds... then crept backwards to the trail, and walked very quickly home. (Home was about 2 miles from the incident -@ that time I lived at the top of Alabama hill) I kept looking back -and even up to make sure whatever it was?   Was not after me. I told one person, my bf what happened when I got home my bf was asleep, to this day I don't know if he believes me. I remember it like yesterday.  I strangely, remember NOTHING before it happened or why I was there -in the middle of the night.  For some reason -I was walking down the trail and I don't know why -I should have been asleep (I was dressed in a shirt and shorts and had a backpack w/me). I reported this before somewhere on line (may have been here) but feel this is a more complete account of the occurrence.  There may be more that happened.  Perhaps one day I will recall the whole incident.  I no longer live in Bellingham.  One other odd thing is that sometimes I feel as thought if I were to go there to the site where I saw the incident that it could happen again.  I've been told I talk loudly in my sleep and have nightmares which I've never recalled.  I think I'm fine and am not scared of anything (so far).  I don't mind being contacted by an investigator.  I don't need to prove it to anyone -I know it was real.  I could submit a illustration of what I saw if requested.  I did draw a picture of it a while back (can re draw it).

One evening in June of 2006 my girlfriend and I were walking on the beach at Rockaway, Oregon. It was around eleven p.m. and the weather was clear.  We were looking at the stars when we noticed what looked like a satellite traveling across the sky from South East to North West.  I estimate the angle was about eighty degrees up from the horizon.  The speed of the object (still thinking it was a satellite) seemed consistent with a satellite in orbit.  After observing it for few seconds, it slowed down and stopped.  Then it seemed to come lower and became brighter and larger.  The color was a bright golden light. The object then seemed to grow considerably brighter, so much so that it illuminated the ocean in front of us, maybe two three miles out.  Then it seemed if the light became a beam of light as if searching for something. We started backing away from this as the light started coming in our direction. Of course we did not know what to think, we were just caught up in the moment as we have never seen anything like this.  The object’s altitude by now appeared to be about 20,000 feet. (I make this reference as I am a commercial pilot).  The light the object was emitting was coming nearer and we started walking backwards feeling a little concerned now. Then within what seemed a second or two, the object and its brilliant light collapsed upon itself and it appeared to climb back to what an object in earth’s orbit might be, and sped off at an extreme velocity and disappeared.

I had an apartment on the 3rd floor with a balcony that faced to the East. It was Summer time and after 9:00pm. I had been sitting on my couch watching TV when my show ended. I decided to step onto the porch for a while as it was quiet outside and peaceful. I stepped out to the railing. On the other side of the apartment complex were large trees. Coming over the tops of those trees was some kind of a craft. I kick myself now for not having a camera handy. It made no sound. It was triangular in shape and had 3 lights on its bottom side. I would guess that it was 60 to 80 feet across. It came from East-Southeast, over the tree tops and apartments at the other end of the complex straight towards me. It could not have been more than 100 feet over the top of the roof of my apartment as it passed over. Never a sound and not disrupting my TV or lights inside.

At about 2:00  I was crossing the Bonneville Salt Flats and was about 1 to 1 1/2 mile from the eastern edge. The sky was basically clear with broken clouds at 30,000 feet.  I looked to the left, north, and noticed an object in the sky.  It was white and irregularly shaped.   It was hard to tell with the clouds moving all around it if it was moving or not. I watched it as best I could while driving and lost sight of it for a moment when the freeway left the Flats. I looked for it again and found it. It appeared to be in the same position it was in when I first noticed it. I got off the freeway at a rest stop and got out of the car. The object was still there.  It struck me how it vaguely resembled a Boeing “Pudgey Plane”, a caricature of a Boeing airliner that one sees from time to time, except it was all white. I found a spot where I could lean against a wall to see if it seemed to move and in the time I watched the object ! did not move. Clouds passed behind and above it, which suggested it was below 30,000 feet. I tried taking several pictures of it but the pictures didn’t really turn out. I could not see the viewfinder very well and was guessing a lot about how well in focus the picture was when I took it. Still, the object is in the pictures, just really, really fuzzy.  Later on I tried to work out where the object was hovering, how high it was and how big it might be. I used simple triangulation from the point I first saw it and from the rest area. One map noted a military reservation on the salt flats and my triangulating put the object over the south end of the reservation. It was between 15 to 20 miles away and I guessed it occupied 2 degrees of sky. My arithmetic suggested it was 1,000 feet long, but, given how much estimating went into that, I’d be skeptical it was that big. I finally had to leave and it was still there when I left.

At first we thought it was the lights of a plane that was flying directly at us.   This obviously was not the case when the light on the right split into 2 lights. This was not a flare either because the lights were not falling, they were stationary.  This got my attention! I knew then that this was not our technology.  After a few minutes passed the lights just disappeared.   At this point we all were just in astonishment that we just witnessed this.

This is a copy of the report I filed with MUFON. It was an early summer morning, about 0345. Three of my friends and I were out on a second floor balcony, talking and smoking cigarettes.  There is a large tree to your right when you're standing on this balcony looking out onto the street.  The neighborhood is in a condo complex near the water in Foster City, Ca.   Anyway, we were chatting away, when out of the corner of my eye I saw this orb appear from behind the tree.  It arced out from behind this tree from my right to left.  I was the first to notice it as it silently hovered no more than ten feet away from us at eye level.  It was about 8-10 inches in diameter. The only way I can describe it is that it looked like a ball of plasma, the insides of it seemed to be moving.  It was changing colors also, vivid reds and blues, pinks and orange; it was absolutely beautiful, like ""living light"".   It didn't seen to emit light. It's hard to describe.  It's like the light was internal, contained. After a few seconds my three friends noticed it too.  The conversation fell silent and all four of us just stood there dumbfounded, staring at it.  I remember it seemed difficult to focus on, it's as if my eyes couldn't get a sharp look at what exactly it was.  It hovered there for about 20 seconds, then it seemed to notice that we had noticed it (we all got really quiet and were staring at it at this point).   The plasma ball silently floated away to our right and disappeared behind the tree where it had appeared from.   We stood there shocked.  Nobody said a word for a minute that seemed like an eternity.  I asked my friends ""Did you guys see that?"" and they said, ""Yeah"".   None of us could explain what it was.  The funny thing is, none of us ever really talk about what we saw that night.  I'll ask them from time to time if they remember that night, and they do.  None of us can come up with an explanation of what the hell we saw.    Years later, i can't shake the feeling that there was some kind of intelligence behind it.  It's hard to explain.  The way it moved was very precise and deliberate.  At the time, it felt like it was watching us.  I think about it every day and hope to find out what it really is we saw that night.  ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My entire life seems to have some connection with ufo’s and although I never realized until my twenties I've always had some sort of connection with the topic. As a child I frequently had dreams of craft mostly black triangles and rectangles with red light at corners, keep in mind these dreams occurred before I knew anything about ufology and only found out later on that these types of craft were really being seen by people. I disregarded these dreams for a long time.  In 1997 my mom and sister had a night time sighting of a dark black sphere with lights moving across its rim over Camp Pendleton marine Base near our house, it wasn’t till then that I began to start taking ufos seriously. Then in 2009 I went to drive to the beach to pick up my friend to go skateboarding that I had a sighting of my own.  I drove to an intersection near the 76 expressway in Oceanside and at the red light I happened to look up.  In the sky I saw a ball of bluish white light doing zig zag’s and then stopping then starting to zig zag again, the entire sighting lasted only about 7 seconds. Eventually the ball of light dropped down behind a mountain and out of view The sky wasn’t fully dark but was getting dark this happened around 6-7 pm.  This sighting further increased my interest and caused me to become an amateur ufologist in my own rite. A few years later in 2009 I became alarmed after some more intriguing experiences that took place in my room.  One night I was awoken at 3:00 am by a loud sparking sound and I looked up and saw a small orb of light shoot trough the corner of my room’s wall.  I’m not saying this object was a UFO but I don’t know what it was, orb, sphere, was it a ghost I have no clue all I know is it probably wasn’t ball lightning.  After the orb incident a few months past and I had a dream the completely rocked my world or at least it might have been a dream……  The following is what I recall from this dream / possible abduction…….I wake up in a foreign alien room, the walls are green and spongy I soon realize I’m not alone and that I’m with other humans all dressed in normal casual clothes and no one is talking and I’m not able to talk, I then realize that there are other beings in the room, these beings are brown humanoids with extremely wrinkly skin, they don’t have any noticeable genitals or sexually features, they have small all black eyes same size as ours but the whole eye is black, they range in height from about 5-6 feet tall, they have no hair, 5 digit fingers and toes like us, no nails, the mouth was hard to see because of the wrinkly skin on their faces.  The beings do not talk or use telepathy they motion to sit down on these bench type things that are almost like grown from the floor, the room is cylindrical and besides the weird benches it’s empty of equipment.  The brown alien guys motion us to site down once we all ! do they begin to project images that seem to float in mid air, the room starts to seem like a theater now, on the images they show peaceful images of the earth and earth life, then the next image will be a negative image of earth floods, war, dead bodies.  They seemed interested in how we felt about these images and the contrasting of the images content. After all this was over we were taken out into a hallway and the last recall I have is walking down this hallway and seeing this rather attractive brunette girl then the memory just stops, like I wasn’t supposed to remember anything else. I know this sounds crazy but I’ve never head another dream this intense and these aliens look like nothing I’ve heard described before and they sure weren’t grays or reptilian or any of the things I’ve heard of in movies.  If this was just a dream then it may be a dream of a real event coming trough.  I’ve sometimes gone to bed and woke up on the couch and other weird things including unexplained marks on my skin.  I don’t really want to say I’m an abductee but the more I learn about it the more and more I feel I fit the category.  Through all of this I'm still quite normal considering these events, but I know how hard it is to express these things so in hopes that others might come forward and hopefully if anyone has seen similar brown beings it would be nice to share.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,33.247651756440284,-117.33448852459017

When that happened I could see exactly what the craft looked like it was a sphere about half the size of a jet liner with a white metallic on it and a rectangular black door or something on the front.  All it did was go back and forth from where it came from to the bottom of the mountain and incredible speeds almost instantaneously after about 5 minutes of this it shot out over to the beach and disappeared over the horizon of the Pacific Ocean.  I never knew where to report this until now that’s why its taken me so long to report it happened! in 2008. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At first we were certain it was an airplane or a helicopter, and stopped watching it to follow the ISS across the sky.  But after the ISS disappeared, we looked again to the north and this object was still there.  It was about 15-20 degrees off the horizon, and completely stationary for the 30-40 minutes that we watched it.  It appeared to be triangular in shape, and there were at least 3-4 lights blinking erratically - red, green, and blue.   I went inside to get my camera (your basic Canon point-and-shoot) and set it to video mode, and ended up getting a pretty good video of it.  In the video it appears to have multiple lights, of different sizes, and possibly some smaller! lights blinking nearby.  My son has a high-def video camera that we tried to use, too, but we couldn't get a good shot of it.   After watching it for about 15 minutes I went inside and woke up my husband, who is a pilot (and who is very skeptical about UFO's).

Very close observation of a disc shaped craft.,Siem Reap (Cambodia),,2003-03-15T19:30:00,disk,1 minute,"Occurred : 3/15/2003 19:30  (Entered as : 03/--/2003 19:30) Reported: 10/30/2011 7:22:35 PM 19:22 Posted: 12/12/2011 Location: Siem Reap (Cambodia),  Shape: Disk Duration:1 minute",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85009.html,"Very close observation of a disc shaped craft. Over the last 10 years, my wife and I have had what I would consider to be several really good UFO sightings, but none quite as spectacular as this one. It took place in the spring of 2003, we were on a ‘bus’ if you could call it that, traveling  from the border town of Aranypathet-Poipet heading to Siem Reap in Cambodia.  We had been promised a nice comfortable air conditioned bus like the one in the picture, what we got was a microwave oven on wheels. It was 100 degrees, very little ventilation, no suspension, and a washboard of a road that was washed out in several places, such that we had to drive down the steep embankments and into the fields to find detours.  Needless to say, it was the day and journey from hell.  We were told it would be 3-4 hours, it was closer to 9 in total.  I share these details because I think it is important in setting the stage for understanding the frame of mind we were in when we had the sighting. The last hour and half of this torturous journey was somewhat tempered by the fact that the sun had gone down, which brought cooler temperatures and the road and smoothed out a little bit, but by this time we were all uncomfortably cramped and desperately anxious to just get off the bus. Outside it was black, no moon, no signs of civilization, no streetlights, nothing but the occasional dimly lit shack out in the fields, one or two flickered from the glow of a TV, most certainly running on a generator. On the bus, the moans and complaints of the other passengers had quieted, the only noise was the hum of the bus. I think at some point we had all realised that our only reprieve was to go within ourselves, to meditate, breathe deep and think of it as a yoga experience. Those of us who had windows looked out, those who did not, looked down. Off in the distance the occasional lightning strike lit up the sky. There was nothing around, no towers, no buildings, no hills, nothing bu! t rice fields. About an hour before we reached Siem Reap is when we saw it. It just appeared above the field outside my window, like a light turning on. It was a classic disc shaped craft, it appeared to have two distinct levels or floors, windows or viewing ports, the underside had a bluish glow to it, the top was more red if I recall correctly.  I’ve been in construction for more then 25 years, I know measurements very well, and that is why I can say with confidence that this object was not more then 100 feet off the road, and about 100 to 125 feet up off the ground. It was close enough to see detail. I estimate it’s size to be about 75 feet in diameter. I quickly nudged my wife (then girlfriend) to have a look, but did not say anything vocally, she leaned over and saw it as clearly as I had. There was no power of suggestion, merely observation. There was no sound, and it did not move. Because of it’s proximity, it wasn’t long before it was behind us. I don’t know if anyone else on the bus saw it, I suspect not. There were only 5 windows on my side of the bus, and as previously mentioned, we were all kind of ‘zoned’.  I can tell you with certainty that it wasn’t a helicopter or a plane. Further confirmation came when we departed Siem Reap 4 days later during daylight hours. We knew that the sighting had occurred approximately 45 min. to an hour out of town, so both my wife and I visually scoured the landscape for a good 2+ hours after departing.  There was nothing that could have been mistaken for a craft, no radio towers, no hills, there was absolutely nothing but low lying fields for hours and hours. In retrospect I think it’s possible that it was our meditative, Zen state of mind that perhaps allowed us to see what we saw.   What I do know, is that it was not my imagination, what we saw out there in the middle of nowhere Cambodia, was a saucer shaped craft, closer then most people ever see a helicopter. Just for my own speculation, I have no doubt that we ( U.S. or Russian secret military) are now flying antigravity craft, not unlike what we saw, and perhaps if this sighting had taken place out in the deserts of Arizona, one might conclude that it was a secret black-ops test or something like that, but because our sighting took place where it did, I am of the opinion that it was an extraterrestrial craft.  Maybe someone else traveling that same road also witnessed what we saw.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,,

I kept trying to focus thinking how weird this was that I couldn't make out the corner.  All of a sudden a small glowing white ball of light came shooting out!  Then another and another.  Five in all, zigzagging through the room.  No sound.  I got the feeling they were excited that they had made it in.  I just laid there thinking ""what the hell is going on here?""   They all gathered directly over me as if they figured out that one of us was awake and could see them.  One of the orbs shot down and went from the size of a half dollar to the! size of a tennis ball and was about 10 inches from my face.  Here's what I saw.  Energy..a glowing ball of pure energy.  I could see right inside it.  Moving, sparking, like an organic computer.  It stayed there for about 10 seconds then popped along with the other 4. Here's the part that bothers me the most.  Immediately after they popped it was if I had been given a tranquilizer.  I couldn't keep my eyes open and fell asleep.  How could I of fallen asleep after seeing something like this? Why didn't I wake my husband? Shortly after this experience I began vibrating. Sounds weird but, I woke up one morning and I thought we were having a small earthquake until I realized that it was me, vibrating from my core, not my heart.  I wasn't having heart palpitations.  This happened off and on for about a year. I usually would just lay there for a few minutes until it subsides. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Now, my boat is a 40 h.p. runabout and we’ve managed to work our way about 5 miles east from Sheidy Boat Ramp where we put in.   Well it got dark around 20:00 and we wanted to head home because it was a school night.  So it was extremely dark outside with clear skies.  It was so clear that we used the hills around the lake which contrasted the stars to navigate where we were going in the dark.   We were about halfway back traveling down the channel and my brother and my friend were sitting in the back of the boat facing backwards from me spotting for logs and hills with the flashlight.  I was driving looking ahead when I see this saucer like thing with red and white lights come around the corner from the channel we’re on and head straight towards my boat.   I immediately lay off the throttle of the boat and stop in the middle of t! he channel.  My brother and friend have no clue what’s going on because I was stopping and going the whole way back to see where we were going.  They didn’t know I stopped because of this.  Well this object flew down this mile long section of the channel about 100 feet above the water in the blink of my eye until it was just ahead of the boat.  It stopped in midflight and zigzagged in place 2 or 3 times then shot straight up into the sky right in front of me.

After looking through my gas and food receipts I was able to pin down the actual time of my sighting, at 8PM, just one mile east of XXX S Blake Ranch Rd, Kingman, AZ 86401-XXXX on the I40. I saw what looked like 6 LARGE GLOWING PLASMA ENGINES flying over my car while driving west, just 15 miles east of Kingman AZ, 11.3 miles as the crow flies, to the Kingman airport. I saw a giant craft that had 6 large rectangle panels on the back end, that were glowing blue white, like plasma engines.  It reminded me of  the “Millennium Falcon"" from the Star Wars movies.  What first caught my eye was a sparking or flash on the bottom of the craft, as it moved over my car.  Then I saw two rows of 3 large rectangles, of blue white glowing light. Each rectangle appeared to be house size.  They appeared to be at the rear of the craft as it moved away from me. It was amazing how big this looked to me, I said out loud to my self, ""I hope its one of ours"".  It looked like it was about 2000 feet up above me. I could not see the shape of the craft. I was driving almost due West on I40 toward Kingman AZ. I had just passed US93 when I saw the electrical sparks through my windshield to my right.  It was flying along very slow for a jet and it had a ball of light traveling below it near the ground at the same rate of speed. You can see the ball in the first few frames of the video, but it might be a reflection. I grabbed my video camera and while driving started taping.  At the beginning I passed a freeway sign, Blake Ranch Rd. Exit 1 mile. I recorded until just after I pass the exit, the craft was to far away, maybe 4 or 5 miles. It would have passed over or near the Kingman Airport.  Someone should check with them. When I played the tape later in Needles at a gas stop, the time code showed I had traveled one mile in 32 seconds!  No freaking way, I would have had to be going over 100MPH.  I tested the camera and nothing wrong there. I posted the video on YouTube, but its just shaky lights due to being hand held. I also posted this report before but it must have been taken down!  I no longer work for SAIC so I don’t care who know about this report. Originally I didn’t give my name or contact information because I was a contractor with the Navy. I have worked on my video and tried to stabilize the lights the best I can. I will repost it soon. I believe this craft was heading toward Area 51 after researching the angle of the flight and the city lights relative to its direction. I plotted a straight line from my sighting to the base and its direction of travel.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,35.220108796296294,-113.90181018518517

I continued taking photos of the sunset when I felt compelled to look at the object again and that's when I quickly remembered Venus is located further south and is a different color I also noticed this bright, amber colored light was drifting near me and then it arched slowly and drifted off on a southerly direction. This is the 6th time to see this in a year.  I always think it's Venus at first for some reason!  I was able to point my camera towards this object and take a time exposure of it as it glided across the sky away from me.  It's low in the sky, though it appear to be high up in the photograph.

I want another try. It's something you don't forget.  What actually got me thinking about it again, surfing channels,there was a show on Discovery channel and they talked about possible energy forms, mercury being one. My story;  It was a clear day, a few high cumulus clouds and at least 6 airliners at different altitudes, 20-30 thousand feet.  We get a lot of air traffic. I was driving north on interstate 95,exit227 I travel this road occasionally.  I happened to be looking at a cloud when I saw this cigar shaped object moving through the cloud, I might have seen it for 5 seconds It was moving east to west, about the same speed of the aircraft  around it.I thought,how can all these aircraft not see this?I’d say it was 20-30thousand ft high, may be 20 miles out. The airliners were barely visible other than a con trail. This object was a lot bigger,maybe as big as 6 greyhound buses, big enough to see in detail It seemed to be 1 dimension,there were 3 separate  rotating screens[blue like the sky with small clouds inside ringed by this flowing silver[that's where the mercury comes in] I was alone [unfortunately] I only saw one. I mentioned  it to my son afterwards and  he found a picture  on u-tube, they called it a helix. A grainy picture  but the same shape. I’ve thought about going back to that spot ,under the same conditions and looking for it .The experience has been both exciting and a little scary.Was it some sort of craft or a portal?I’v often looked into the night sky and wondered are we alone?Now I know we’re not.One odd thought I did have, the other day my wife and I were headed south on I 95,got to this exit and I wondered aloud,where did that saying every cloud has a silver lining originate?

Our location was Lat 36°49'57.27""N  Long 80°18'59.93""W   I am a police officer in las vegas for 9 years and a former Marine and this event was also witnessed by my best friend a National Park ranger and my father who is a retired Marine who was a scout/sniper and we are all very in-tune with nature and nautical/astronomical events... i had to start out with that because, we together have seen just about everything and are highly trained observers, if that makes this any more believable i don't know.. This happened and stopped our evening in its tracks for hours.. I know what it wasn't but i have no idea what it is.. We were in the blue ridge mountains of Virginia, the nearest large town would be Floyd, VA, at my family farm and we had just gotten done building a deck on a new house on my property. My father was sitting in a chair facing north and me and my buddy were facing him to the south-south east standing up. The time was approx 2000hrs EST on 05-30-2009 and it was still fairly bright and cloudless sky. My father asked ""what is that? is that a planet"" and pointed over our heads toward the north. We turned around and observed a sphere shaped object brightly illuminated and about 3mm in relative size. I later shot an azimuth from my compass and it was 20 deg (magnetic north, declination for that area is 8deg W so approx 12deg true) and approx 50 deg from horizon.  it was the brightest object we have ever seen that seemed to be either a planet, star or a satellite. my dad was still sitting and asked ""is that moving?"" i tried to keep it referenced to the roof of the house to see if it w! as but i couldn't tell. he said that before he said anything to us it had moved down about 10deg.  we all looked through 20 power bino's and all saw that it was round and completely illuminated equally around but nothing else remarkable about it.  we came to the conclusion that it was a northern geo-stationary satellite but were not satisfied with that due to that it looked way to close to our location and from its large size. (after finally getting back to civilization i tried to find what sats are stationary in the northern sky's and couldn't locate any, any help on that? are there any?)  we watched it for approx 45 mins and our talk turned to other strange things we have seen in the sky over the years and about watching satellites floating by.  We all went inside to grab some chow and came back outside to eat and the object was gone. This kind of made us re-think what it was we saw.. So now we were really into talking about what that was and had our heads strained to the sky. My buddy spotted a satellite traveling north to south at around 60deg from horizon. it was now approx 2045 hours and some of the brighter stars are appearing.  i picked up visual of the object and it seemed to be just a satellite, the dull glow, size and speed were typical.  My dad was having a hard time picking it up so i spotted a bright star (Ive tried to figure out exactly which star it was but i couldn't tell you) the star was to the SSE and at around 45/50 deg to the horizon and the brightest object in that sector. I asked my dad to look at that star and i began to call out the position of the satellite, ie; ""its 9 o'clock high about 3 hand widths away, now its 10 o'clock its now at the 11 o'clock"" all relative to the bright star.. and so on, he still was having trouble picking it up. I finally had him look at the 2 o'clock position and a hand width away and me and my friend cal! led it out ""its now at its 12, 12:30, 1 o'clock..."" and as it got to the 2:30 position it just stopped. we both yelled out ""it freaking stopped!"" it didn't slow down, it didn't fade out, it stayed a constant brightness and speed until it just stopped dead.. At this point i was really freaked. my father never did get to see it before it stopped but saw it after the fact but now it looked like a regular dim star.. Me and my bud never let our eyes off of the object for the next 4 hours. we actually took turns resting our necks. we finally just layed down and kept on starring at it waiting for it to move. during this i would see flashes of light popping off in specks near it and other lights that looked like it was radiating out of the object but dismissed them to my eyes playing tricks. at one point i saw a beam of white light come from the 7:30 position from the object and shoot out approx one inch ( these will all be relative size to the object) this lasted a brief second. a few mins after that happened my friend said ""i swear i saw something shoot out of that thing"" and he recanted the same story as to what i saw. about an hour later i saw another beam of light from the object, this time it looked like a harpoon getting shot out, kind of squiggly and again about an inch out but this time from the 5 O'Clock position. we both said ""whoa!"" and both described the same thing to my father independently so we wouldn't feed off each others story.. during this time we saw up wards of 20+ satellites floating by, all stayed on normal path and speed. at one point toward the end of our event we saw a flash of light approx 2 inches to the 5 o'clock to the object and faded to a dimmer light. this object was round and looked like a satellite in brightness after it dimmed. this new object began to track south but after about 3 inches of travel it made a 90 deg turn and tracked easterly and quickly grew dimmer and smaller as if it was traveling to a higher altitude. we lost it after 7 inches of travel.. we continued our vigil to not loose sight of the original object that stopped moving until we lost sight of it behind a mountain. i would have not spent one of the few days i get to spend time with my father and my best friend watching something in the sky that wasn't something that needed attention. i wouldn't have reported this and would have just added this to my list of strange stuff Ive seen if i hadn't heard i guy on the radio saying almost the exact story of what we saw and around the same date but in the western U.S... this needed to be documented. i know it wasn't a crazy story with an unknown spacecraft but like i said before.... i know what it wasn't, but i have no idea what it was. if someone can explain what i saw please do, its bothering me a bit..",2011-12-12T00:00:00,36.9017,-80.3288

I happened to be telling her that she should observe what goes on in the sky at night.  The skies were clear and we could see the stars very well.  I have on two other occasions, in Virginia Beach, have witnessed an incident of a ball of light that I could not explain what it was.  While staring over the night sky, I noticed a light, that was, it seemed to me was trying to disguise itself as a star.  It was like at first glance it looked like a star but after staring at it, I could tell that it was not outside of this atmosphere.  Then it started to move.  It moved horizontally thru the sky, It was completely silent.  It was far away.  We lived in an area that was in a busy flight/landing path of the Charlotte Douglas Airport. There was not a flashing light on this object as airplanes have.  As it moved, it was on a horizontal glide and trailing it was a faint t! rial of light.  It definately was not exhauaust from a plane that will linger after the plane passes.  This light was like a smear behind this object that was flying.  There was no 'exhaust' trail left behind. The further it traveled across the sky, the dimmer the light was.  I have seen many shooting stars and meteor showers and cannot compare this object to what I saw.  I know that it was not ordinary because my sister was becoming uncomfortable looking at it. This object was not a sudden fade like a shooting star...This was a calculated, dimming of the light that I had witnessed before. The very first time I had seen something like this was at my home in Virginia Beach, VA...Right near the Chesapeake border.  I have always liked looking up at the stars and one day I stepped out of my house to smoke a cigarette and while waiting for my sister to come outside, I looked straight up.  That is when I saw a star that was very bright but it has a dull yellowish tint to the light....it was not pure white light like a star...but it looked like a star.  I stared at this object for about a minute and then it started to move. First a slow sway back and forth then it started raising it's elevation.  Even though it did not look like the size was shrinking siginficantly I could tell that the swaying was moving away from me.  For about 30 seconds, this object swayed back and forth like a metronome and as it swayed the ligth gradually got fainter and fainter until it was completely gone.  There was no noise and I know that this object was not a plane or a helicopter. After that, also in Virginia at the same home, I went outside on the porch again to smoke a cigarette.  This time it was right about when the sun was going down.  The sun would set behind my home and it was down far enough that the only thing that was lit was the sky.  The shadows from the house and trees were at their max 'stretch'.  I looked over to my right at the sky.  Some stars were already visible.  I saw this one star that was unusually bright that I know was not the North Star.  It just seemed like it was out of place. We lived in this home for almost 30 years and I had never noticed a star that bright in that area of the sky at that time of the day before.   While staring at this object after about two minutes, I noticed that it was moving...back and forth...It was almost like it moved becuase I wouldn't stop staring at it.  The way that it moved back and forth, made me feel like it was staring at me too.  There was no noise and this light was a perfect sphere.  It ! didn't twinkle like other stars.  As it moved back and forth, I could clearly see that it was raising its elevation and that same trail of light was following it. The higher it climbed, the dimmer it got, still bouncing back and forth until it completely disappeared.  That took about a minute or two from the time that it started moving for it to fade completely out and when the light was completely gone, there was nothing that made me think it was a plane or chopper or any other man-made vehicle.  It is disturbing that I have had three incidents that I have seen an object flying in the sky that I could not identify.  I am originally from Virginia Beach and this is a highly active military area w/ airforce bases and naval bases nearby.  I am not a stranger to seeling military planes and have also seen a stealth bomber fly by...  These objects were not planes. Hopefully this information will be helpful to you in your research.  One thing that resignated with me from watching programs about UFO's is that if there is a race of anything in outer space that has the capability to make it to our planet, how so far we are behind in their technology as we cannot get a human past the moon.

Place:  I was standing in the Cell-One telecommunications complex parking lot talking to an employee/customer who just got off work and was sitting in her car.  This complex is on Hwy 260 in Show Low, AZ, approx. two miles south from Deuce of Clubs. Distance:  Approx. 100 feet away. Time:  Just after 5pm. Appearance:  Object was a glowing, bright white light, approx. one foot in circumference.  Sighting lasted less than one minute. Sound or other emanations:  None. Vector:  Object was moving approx. 60-80 miles an hour in a unchanging Southeast direction coming down over the trees covering the hill on the West side of the complex, across the valley and toward Mt. Baldy area, maintaining approx. 100 foot height. Observations:  When I saw the light, I excitedly tried to point the object out to a woman who was a former customer of mine and had just gotten off work at Cell-One and was sitting in her vehicle.  She would not consent to raising her eyes to look at the object, saying it was probably “just a plane”.   I commented that I have seen plenty of planes and this was much too-close to be mistaken for a plane, and was right over our heads, and that she should look at the object.   She ignored me, and I noticed that she behaved lethargic, almost in a drugged state, and would not get out of the vehicle or look at the object.  The object became difficult to see as it past over the field East of us, and I lost track of it.  The woman’s behavior then appeared normal.  I reported the incident to the publisher of my newspaper, who informed me that these sightings of small lights above or in the trees are quite common in the White Mountains, and are often reported to a couple of the local n! ewspapers that she was affiliated with.  She recommended that I not write of the incident, counseling that I would lose credibility if reported publicly.    Also, there were no planes in the sky until approx. 30 seconds after the sighting.   A small propeller plane was moving in a southerly direction appox. A mile high, and I commented to the woman in the vehicle:  “See, that’s a plane”. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Observations between two sightings. Second Encounter:  Approx. early October of 2009. Place:  I was driving on Hwy 260 due west of Eager, AZ, approx 2.5 miles west of 180 intersection, near a waste transfer site located on the north side of the highway. Time:  16:24. Appearance:  Object was a glowing, glaring white light, approx. 75-100 feet in circumference.  I could see a curved, shiny metallic slope on the north side of the object, like an upper-dome.  Sighting lasted approx. 2-3 minutes. Sound or other emanations:  None whatsoever. Vector and Observations:  Object was moving at an undetermined speed in a Southeast direction over the desert from the direction of highway 60 to the north, heading directly toward my westbound truck.  I pulled over to the right (north) side of 260 and jumped out of the vehicle with my cellphone, which had no camera.  My camera was on the truck console, but I did not remember to use it.  The object came approx. 150 feet from my truck, directly west of me.   The sun was low over the horizon directly behind the object.  It stopped in front of me, and I jumped back in the truck and locked the door.  I called my editor of the newspaper and said “There’s one above me right now!”  She just commented that I was “Lucky”, while I described the object to her.  Reception on the phone was normal.  It stayed for approx. 45 seconds, then started to move in a slight curve toward west, and headed due west and gaining slightly in elevation, slowly, approx.  50 miles an hour.  It became harde! r to distinguish at it distanced.  It then disappeared suddenly. Approx. 12-15 seconds later, two jet fighters came very low and very fast over the southern horizon mountains, moving due north.  They came close to my latitude, turning east and west respectively opposite of each other and circled back 260 degrees symmetrically and crossed paths, at a much slower speed now.    Then a larger jet crossed from west to east at a very high elevation, moving faster than the smaller fighters seemed capable of.  It seemed odd shaped, as if it had an object mounted on top of the main fuselage. Observations:  It was late afternoon, and the sun was directly behind the UFO.  Therefore, the UFO was either creating the light itself or was bending the photons, perhaps.  It was an excellent camouflage, because the further away it was, approaching and retreating from my view, it was difficult to discern.  Also, I distinctly made out a metallic shine on the north (my right) side, not unlike the sun shining on a highly-polished Airstream trailer, and from the outline, it would fit in the shape of a saucer with a highly-sloped dome on top.  The angle was possibly not fitting for a spherical shape.  Later Observations regarding the two incidents mentioned:   Since both objects (Cell-One complex sighting a month earlier) were both approx the same elevation above ground level, the same speed, and came within the exact same proximity to me, it occurred to me that as an observer, I assumed that the size discrepancy between the two objects meant that I was looking at two different crafts or phenomena.  Later, it occurred to me that I was assuming too much based on my past experience with distance and size.  For example, if the smaller, glaring object was the same distance to me in relation to its size as the larger object, it would mean that the smaller object would be approx. 10 feet away.   If that were the case, then that means if the larger object was the same distance as the smaller one in relation to its size, then the larger object would be more like a half-mile away.  Since I could see only the glare of light, not metallic, when the larger object was approaching and ! retreating, it logically follows that if the smaller object was 10 feet away, I would possibly see a metallic property on a vehicle.  My observations here merely taught me not to assume properties by my ignorance.   This whole experience has been extremely valuable to me as a lesson in an even metaphysical perspective:  anything is possible, and as an observer, I should be keen to relationships in various phenomenon, and never make assumptions based on past knowledge.  What if size and distance is merely my perspective?   Please note that in both these incidents, there were no planes in the sky until after the object in question dissappeared from my sight. Again, my newspaper publisher advised that I not write about or report the incident, to save my credibility. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My partner noticed it first, hovering above the Wellfleet Marketplace store and commented, ""Isn't that a flying saucer?"".  As we stood entirely still in near disbelief, I answered ""Yes, it is.""   It was fairly close above the rooftop (about 40 to 50 ft. off the ground), and approx. the size of a VW bug. We were across the street about 50 feet away.  The saucer had a  metalic flat-grey surface. An oval cylindracle,  shape (about 4-5 ft.) protruded from the top center of the saucer-like craft. It appeared viscous glass-like, and very thick.  I saw gray shadows underneath in motion but couldn't make out any figures exactly.  The glass cylinder was covered with a dark, thick, metal crosshatch design, with about 3 or 4 strips (about 6 inches wide) going in each direction.  Out of this glass cylinder was a straight up beam of strong white light, similar to a search light, but much, much brighter. It then disappeared into the night sky going in a horizontal direction, south towards the Wellfleet Harbor. It zoomed off, hovering even and straight and at an extremely rapid speed, silently. I have worked in the airline industry for years from Alaska to the Antarctic and many places in between. I have never seen anything even remotely similar. It definately wasn't a fixed wing aircraft nor weather recording equipment/device. We don't drink alcohol, nor take any illegal substances.  And we aren't religious or new age types of people. Whatever it was that we witnessed that night we believe was not from this planet and remains a mystery to us.  I looked in the newspaper and listened to radio/tv news and didn't hear of anything unusual reported, the following day. Ever since that event I can't look towards the sky the same.

At approximately 20:30 hr., I saw what I thought at first was the Space Station. The difference was it was traveling from the East towards the West. It caught my eye because it was a very bright white light and moving much like I have wittnessed the ISS move in the night sky. What I saw did not move in a straight line and did not disappear over the horrizon.  It made a swooping move that reminds me of the Nike logo in reverse.  It was very bright right up to the arch portion and progressively dimmed moving away from us, yet remaining visible in the night sky.  There was no discernable shape, noise, or flashing lights. What I and my Wife did see returned three times with approximately 20 to 45 minute intervals. It was clearly visible with the naked eye. We live in the flight path of Seattle and Everett Airports and know what aircraft look like in the sky. This did not appear to be any type of aircraft, just a bright light. We both wittnessed it three times. I brought out my night vision monocular and watched for it for about 3 and a half hours. Each sighting was with the naked eye and twice I was able to track it with the night vision. As it swung into the upper swoosh of the arch and became dimmer, I was able to see it become almost stationary for short times then disappear. Also, with the night vision I tracked several sattelites crossing the sky in South to North lines.  What I call sattelites could have been a UFO siting as well.  On two sitings I saw a singular motion enjoined with a second moving almost parralell tracking in the same direction except for one.  The one unusual siting I tracked from the North towards the South which was enjoined by a second that had been heading in the opposite direction. When I claim it 'enjoined' tracking the first, I mean it turned in behind the first I was tracking and they traveled for a distance across the sky and then both stopped. I watched them for a short time and brought the night vision down and lost track of their location in the mix of stars.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,47.8703,-121.88099999999999

My husband and I woke up at 7 am and he looked at me and asked if I was okay.  I told him ""yeah, why?"" and he proceeded to tell me that something happened the night before.  He knew that I have had at least 10-15 horrible nightmares about alien abduction since I was a child (I am 32 now and have been having these dreams since I was 6-7 years old).  He didn't want to tell me, but he told me to make sure I was okay and to go to the bathroom and take a shower and look over myself.  He was really upsetting me, I refused to go and look until he told me what was going on, and finally he told me that he had a ""dream"" that he woke up and something was holding him down and he saw something ""weird"".  I told him it was just a dream and sleep paralysis. My husband is/was more of a skeptic regarding aliens and the conspiracy theories than I ever have been.  And he then said ""no, you don't understand, I don't have sleep issues, and I know what I saw"".  He went on to explai! n that first he heard what sounded like shuffling around the bed.  The lights were off, but due to ambient light from a distant bathroom nightlight, he could see small shadows when he moved his eyes down as far as he could.  He said his first thought was to wake me up, and he couldn't move and he couldn't make any noise to wake me.  He said ""all I could do was move my eyes around, I couldn't talk or move or anything, it was scary as hell"".  He said finally he was able to move his head down a little and when he did he said there was something the size of our son standing right beside the bed kind of ""looking"" at him.  He said when his head moved, this ""something"" jumped back a little, like it was surprised.  He said he then felt like something larger was in the doorway of our bedroom and he heard shuffling again like what ever it was, it was going away from the bed, and he fell asleep.  To let you know, our son was, at that time, had just turned 7 years old and was about 3'3! "" - 3'5"" tall.  He said that he knew there was more than one o! f these things in the room and, again, it was ""like something bigger was in the doorway"" he said to me.  I do not recall anything that happened that evening whatsoever. But my husband was so intent, he even bought a black light to inspect the carpet around the bed and got on his hands and knees to find anything that would prove it to me.  The strangest part of this was that we switched sides of the bed that evening for the first time in 7 years, because I told him ""I just want to sleep here"".  I had no real reason why and I haven't done that since.  As a side note, my husband is not the only person who has told me this has happened to them while I was in the room with them, sleeping.  My father also explained to me that a few times in 1979, when I was a couple of months old, that ""demons came out"", held him down to where he couldn't speak or move. He blamed it on my mother, now his ex-wife.  He said that once he was divorced from her, the ""demons quit visiting the house.""  When they were divorced, I moved with my mother.  He told me that he remembered these ""demons"" holding him down a lot from 1979-1983 - 1983 being the year my mother left him.  My mother collaborated this story when I asked her.  I asked her if anything odd ever happened in her sleep when i was a baby / kid.  She said sometimes she would wake up scared and unable to talk but that it was just ""night terrors"". My father told me this because he was trying to convince me that my mother was evil (bad divorce, even still today), and I personally and directly! asked my mom if she ever had anything weird happen to her while she was asleep around me.  Another time in 1994, my best friend was staying the night with me and claimed to be held down in her sleep.  She said she couldn't see me or hear me but I must have ""drugged"" her because the room was bright white, and she couldn't move or talk.  She was extremely upset because of how scared she was, and continually blamed me.  We were not friends after this because she truly believed I drugged her with something.  My ex-fiance also claimed that he was ""so sick"" he couldn't get up in the middle of the night - (we were both fighting a cold at the time). He said ""I couldn't move or talk or nothing and it was like something was holding me down"".  He also said that when he could finally move that he got up to tell me about it, but I was not there in the house.  He said that I must have got up in the middle of the night to party.  But when he woke up the next morning, he said I was back in bed with him.  He even asked me what time I got back in that morning.  I did not leave and we fought about that.  I do have dreams about abduction, they are very vivid and I can recall a lot about my dreams; however, I do not recall these dreams on the nights that I can remember that my husband, friend, and ex-fiance told me they were held down.  The details and information in these dreams are extremely odd to me - such as the texture of skin when they are holding my hand, a difference in feeling light/heavy, and information given to me.  The dreams have been nightmarish in nature because it's generally scary seeing these things, but things that happen in the dream are really not so bad.  Only once was the dream a complete, horrific nightmare and oddly enough, the aliens in that dream were different than the other dreams.  Is there any explanation for this??

This star was moving west to east laterally, and then just stopped and faded out.  After about 2 or 3 secs, it got bright again, and then moved again, and again faded out. It did this at least 7 or 8 times, moving at a equal distance each time and then fading out again.  It then moved at a upward and outward angle from me, again getting very bright when it first moved, and then fading o! ut.   It then moved upward in a straight line, then stopping and fading out again.

We watched as the red lights climbed in the sky, and soon a fourth appeared.  The first red light in line suddenly flickered and disappeared into the sky, followed soon thereafter by the second, third, and fourth.

Two men standing at the gate of a house saw it too.  They talked about it.  I stopped and watched it crossing slowly the sky coming towards us. IT wasn't getting bigger just a bit brighter. I dismissed the thought of any UFO activity.  I was tired and just wanted to walk home.  But as the light faded i realised it was an object.  At first it was just a dark spot.

One night (Approximately January 15th, 2010, at 8:30 PM) while taking my 19 year old daughter to Best Buy to purchase a video game, we drove down Spring Creek drive from our home in our sub division, through the forest which is a deserted park, due to it being in the flood zone and had been abandoned years ago. We saw (in clear view) a large red sphere sitting on an abandoned road in the forest as we passed by the entrance to the road, which had been blocked off by the county to prevent cars or campers from entering. As we passed by, I looked down the road and saw the craft a few hundred feet from the entrance. I slowed down to give my daughter a chance to view the craft with me and we were convinced it was a UFO sitting on the road. It was a solid red sphere, larger than a car or truck and made no sound or movement and emitted a reddish glow. Due to the necessity to get to Best Buy before closing hours, we continued on and simply had a laugh at the thought of actually seeing a UFO in our forest. Then soon after on Friday night, January 22, 2010 at 11:10 pm, my wife and I watched what appeared to be the same large reddish, glowing colored sphere descend into the woods directly in front of our home from our front porch at about a tenth of a mile from our home. We first spotted it through the front window in our den, while we were watching T.V. by accident. We ran outside to the front porch to get a closer view and watched it as it descended, taking about a minute to get to the ground. At first sighting it was about 80 feet in the air, just above the tops of the trees already in its decent. We watched carefully looking for any signs that it could be identified as an Earthly object. It made no sound at all and proved to be something we’ve never seen before. It was very stable in its control. It was sphere shape at approx. 12 or 15 feet wide and made no noise as it carefully descended very slowly, between tree branches towards the ground, until it could no longer be seen behind the shrubs. It had no flashing lights or created any wind or disturbance of any kind. It did have a small flickering flame at the top that went away during its decent. I grabbed my flashlight and called my daughter to pile into the car, for a closer look, and drove around the corner to get to the road that ran next to the location it came down at. My wife stayed behind in fear of making contact with visitors. This forest area is an area of low level marsh land. No power is present. The trees are tall Pines, Oak, and other hard woods with tall Yaupon growth at ground level. There is a stream that runs through the center of the property usually filled with the songs of thousands of frogs but at this time, they were silent! The weather was cool with overcast and a cloud cover ceiling of about 10,000 feet. It was very calm. On the first pass, from our car, we were looking for the reddish glowing object that was first seen in the air. We drove to the end of the road, watching into the woods but not seeing anything. I made the block and retraced the area for a second time, driving slowly and shinning my flashlight into the forest. Then we noticed a single white light deep in the forest, near the location from where the craft came down, approx. 30 yards from the edge of the road in the forest. It was a light, much like a light emitting from a bulb of about 60 watts but was too deep in the woods to make out its shape or intent. It looked as though it was sitting on the ground. We watched the light for about five minutes with no movement, either around it or near it. Then we slowly moved forward, shining our flashlight into the forest edge, when we noticed the outline of a curved, grayish colored, metal craft nestled behind the dense yaupon shrubbery which was about ten feet high. It emitted no light or sound. We could barely see only part of the round side as the craft was hidden behind the foliage, and we were NOT going in for a closer look! We continued to drive forward approximately another hundred and fifty feet when my flashlight caught the reflection of two very large eyes watching us through the shrubs in the forest edge, set back about 25 feet from the road. I stopped the car, rolled down the window, and shone the flashlight into its eyes and watched as it watched us for about the next several minutes. We noticed that the eyes were about 8 inches apart and glistened like two very large white diamonds in the reflection from my flashlight. They were about seven feet from the ground. Later observation revealed there were no objects in that area in which someone or something could have been standing on, such as a fallen tree. We could not see the body shape as it was very dark with no back light and whatever it was remained hidden behind the Yaupon shrubs. It never blinked or turn away for a moment and made no sound or movement but continued to watch us very closely as we discussed the details of what we were seeing. We ruled out the possibility of it being a deer, or any animals of any type that would be common in the area, and being that we watched the landing of a UFO and sighted the craft just yards away from where it was, it was determined that we were looking into the eyes of an alien visitor. The eyes were forward facing and twinkled as they moved to view us. The iris of the eyes was large, about the size of a quarter and glistened like diamonds in my spotlight and reflected bright white in color. We turned on the car's interior dome light and waved a couple of times to let him know we were just curious and meant no harm. We felt like he must have been alone and came to that specific area for samples of something for testing, maybe bugs from the forest floor? That could explain the light in the woods, to attract insects. We felt like he moved away from his space craft, as we got closer to it and he didn’t wish to be noticed by humans in the event we got out looking over his ship. Maybe he just didn’t want to frighten us or was afraid himself! We felt he was rather curious by our presence, maybe even a bit frightened that we had accidently caught him landing and he wished to be left alone, so he stayed hidden. However, taking the opportunity to observe a human family in our Earth bound, “wheeled” car, checking him out as we stayed calm. I could feel our presence becoming un-wanted as the minuets passed by as he was probably anxious to get out of there before other showed up, maybe not so peaceful and we were taking up too much of his time. As we stared into those large glowing eyes for as long as we did, for some unknown reason, we turned off the flashlight and drove out of the neighborhood and away from the area for quite a distance, discussing the sight of the craft coming down and what a beautiful, majestic sight it was. Only to realize we were driving for no reason away from such a monumental moment in our lives! We turned around and returned to the area only to find that he had departed, light, craft, eyes and all. We believe he sent us subliminal messages to leave him alone so he could pack up and get on his way without being detected any further. I felt the effect of confusion the next few days and found it difficult to focus my thoughts. It was an odd feeling during the sighting, but once you actually see a landing and the occupants of an alien craft, it feels very natural and like it should be left alone as it must only be our neighbors tending to their business in a natural way, and we really don’t have any place hanging about or getting in their way. It was a satisfying experience. It’s nice to think he is telling his story to his friends and family, in some faraway place, of the nice human family that stopped by for a brief visit while he was on his mission. About four days later at approx. 8.00 PM, I watched a saucer shape object moving slowly over the same patch of forest with a single, dim red pulsating light on the top at its center. The light was pulsating very slowly, much less than lights on towers or aircraft and it never completely went out between flashes. The top of the saucer was lit up bright white while the bottom of the craft was dark. There was a single beam of white light shining out of the bottom of the craft shinning downward in a cone shape, very bright but was odd in the fact that it did not shine all the way to the ground. In other words it shown down about twenty five feet then came to a clean stop in midair. I watched it until the trees hid it from view. It too made no sound. Update: Exactly one year later. On the anniversary date (2-22-11) of the Alien encounter, my daughter and I saw the return of what looked like the same red sphere near our neighborhood at 8:45 PM in the sky. It just appeared in clear skies as we were driving north bound on I-45 approaching the Spring exit, when a bright twinkling object appeared in the sky about six hundred feet off the ground next to the freeway in front of us. It appeared to have white, twinkling flames coming from its bottom moving upward over the round craft. It sparkled like a star and was moving southwards towards us at a slow speed. When we spotted it, it was completely covered with the white flames then it ""suddenly"" changed directions and its flames began to subside. It began to pick up speed, now moving north bound next to the freeway. My daughter reached for her phone and videoed it. We pulled over to capture the tail end of the sighting. I watch with my naked eyes as it moved away decreasing its ""flame"".  We could see the red sphere that we had seen in the forest on two other occasions near our home. Then it just vanished from sight, like it cloaked itself from sight. Before it vanished I could see a force field around the craft as it glowed slightly from the energy flame before disappearing. I am guessing that the craft with occupant had returned for an annual checkup on forest samples, etc. It was moving towards our forest near our home. We raced to the house and watched the forest for a while but didn’t see any activity. After all, what the heck can you do in the event that we did find it again? We just felt satisfied that we had been involved with an actual UFO encounter and it’s nice to know the truth! Hope to see him again soon.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,30.106909170305677,-95.4739580786026

It stood aproximately 50 ft. high and 40 ft. wide.  It had what I call legs extending out from the sides aproximately 3 ft. from the body of the craft starting aprox.10 ft. from the top to the bottom. We couldn't see the bottom because it was on the other side of the levy. We were amazed and starred at it for a few minutes. We talked about a camera. We had problems with the boat motor as it failed to start.  Somehow we lossed our memory of what happened from the time we saw the craft to the time we were back at the Hudeman slough boat ramp.  We would have seen it as we passed by the spot at the levy when we headed back to the ramp.

We haven't talked about this to anybody since as we both agree people will say we are crazy, were on drugs or some other comments.

I took the camera's flash card & downloaded the photos to my laptop & pulled up the 1st photo when I noticed something there that I did not notice while tsking the shot! I could see a triangle of 3 white lights to the left & below the moon.  I thought it was most likely an aircraft except that there was no bluring of the image indicating movement! I decided to use the available imaging software to enlarge & enhance the image. To my astonishment as I slowly enlarged the image, it became some kind of vehicle like I had never seen before.

I sent an E-Mail to our paper The Seattle Times offering to send them a DVD copy. They did not respond at all. I contacted Mufon on line & received a response from one of their local reps who asked me to foreward the DVD to him.  I then received an e-mail multipage inquiry directly from Mufon's headquarters that included a multitude of related questions to my sighting. The questions were so lengthy & repetitious & un-related that I just gave up trying to finish them & just closed the site down. I have not attempted to go any further with this siteing report untill now, as I was watching a History Channel special about UFO's!

As I was looking at the sky I noticed an odd colored ball of light coming from the North, going South, it appeared to be orange/red. As it got closer I realized this was not a usual aircraft and ran to the door to call my husband to come out right away.  He did and he also saw it. It continued flying, not fast, and in a straight line. As it got closer over our head, I realized it was not round but triangular, with the point facing North, and very bright orange/red glowing light in the middle,there was a white haze surrounding the object,there was no sound,and it was traveling in a straight path, North to South.  It was not going real fast, so the whole incident probably lasted about 3 minutes. I ran inside to get my camera and ran back out and it was already over the tree line. We both have never seen anything like that and were just stunned at what we saw. I called 911 to report it also.  It looked to be about 4 times smaller than the moon.

It was a very irregular shape. It did not appear to have any lights on it, but it seemed very bright due to what I thought was the reflection of the sun. Our windows were down and could not hear any type of sound or see any type of exhaust. My children were with me and they noticed it also.

August 27 2011 flying object witnessed by 5 people from 3 AM until about 5:30 AM. We were in the backyard,the sky was very clear and so many stars were out so we decided to get a blanket and lay out and stargaze. We seen 3 shooting stars in about 10 minutes time. Then with 30 minutes we seen about 7 to 8 shooting stars(maybe more) as I lost count because it was really something to see.  I began to question was this normal? Next we witnessed a star moving,the light looked different from a regular star,it's hard to explain because I have never seen a light source like it.  Possibly similar to the cars with the blueish halogen lights,if you take away the blue hue it was something like that,very vivid,very clear unlike any light I have ever seen.  At first it moved across the sky in almost a serpentine motion and very fast,we have 2 acres of treed land here so we had to run through the yard to follow it as to not lose it behind a treetop.  It then stopped and hovered and then shot across the sky at a very high speed,like a shooting star,then it appeared to be sea! rching with the snake like movement going side to side as if it was looking for something.  My mind couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing. Now I think that some if not all of the shooting stars that we witnessed may have been this object all along.  We ended up watching it and running all around the yard for 2 hrs+ It was almost as if the thing was playing with us I know that sounds weird,but it would hover wait for us to run over across the yard and then zip off stop and wait and then move... just very odd to me. There seemed to be 3 of these,sometimes they would move so fast it was hard to keep up with more than 1. The sky was extremely clear that night,the moon did not show up until just before sunrise,not sure why that is? But I believe it was about 6% full when it did show. Naturally, we were all tired from this event so we said our goodbyes and I went in to sleep not long after that a military jet the ones that make the sonic boom noise went over and shook my house.I suspect they were looking for these object(s). I searched all weekend trying to find a video of something like what we witnessed and I came across one that is exactly like what we seen on Youtube. The man known as (Magnetflipper) uses a high powered camera and has actually captured 60+ video's of these things. Notes* -The moving star stayed high in the sky maybe slightly under the stars -Time seemed to speed up, it seemed like we were outside like 45 mins to an hour we had no idea that it was 5:30ish am until it started getting light outside and we lost the object and someone looked at the actual time. -Object(s) moved at incredible speeds with precision movements -there was no sound -we did see 2 planes go over during this time, but they were much lower in relation to the object we were watching -Sometimes it looked like a aura was around the object when it was just hovering -When it would zip off it left a slight trail like a shooting star but the streak would hold a little longer than that of a shooting star giving us time to see where it zipped off to, the trail looked blueish white in color. -For the record we were not drinking nor doing drugs,we don't do that anyway but I suspect someone will ask...I know I would if I read this.

I was getting excited so I just began to scan the sky. Ten to fifteen minutes later another orb appeared from no where in the eastern sky and traveled south. It followed the exact same route as the first two.  I followed this one with the binoculars as well but what I seen next I will never forget.  What I saw was 15-20 metallic orbs stationed in the southern skies.  I thought I saw a couple of black orbs as well.  They all held their position and resembled star constellations only this was in broad daylight.  My girlfriend was present at the time and seen them with the naked eye and did not need binoculars.  It was an incredible sight and I watched them until I lost sight of them. After that incredible event I was watching the eastern sky looking for another orb.

The degree of luminescence was a little less than the moon on other nights. It was a soft, ember-like glow. The size, while impossible to judge due to no reference objects or clear idea of how far away it was, affected my field of vision in a similar way that a very large plane would have had at about a mile or two away flying at 500 knots.  At first I thought it was a plane, in fact. It had no blinking lights of any kind and was just a glowing sphere.  The straight line path suddenly and abruptly bent into a new straight line path at about 30 degrees more upward than it was, but it still went down towards the horizon until behind trees that blocked my view.

I will explain the event as if you could hear my thoughts that were going through my mind from the start of the sighting to the end, which was no longer than ten seconds:  What?  Wow!   Those are bright stars!  Those aren’t stars; they’re a little bigger and moving.  There’s another one!  It just appeared and not too far from the others, oh it’s moving to join the others, Oh!  They’re gone. Now to go over what I just saw and put it into words.  When I looked up, I saw three objects very shinny moving very slowly in a northerly direction and side by side east to west.  Then another one not too far away to the west of the others just appeared as if turning on a light and moved to join them four abreast.  As soon as it did all four just disappeared as if you turned off a light. This scenario made me realize that these objects where defiantly under intelligent control. The backdrop to the objects was the sky and stars and my line of sight to the objects in relation to the horizon was about 50 degrees.  It’s hard to say how close they were and how big but the feeling I felt was they were about a mile way and about the size of a car and oval in shape.  The only way to describe their appearance is how liquid mercury appears.  Smooth and shiny and reflects light. I was left with the impression that four ships where traveling together in cloak mode and for some reason un-cloaked and then went back to cloak (traveling while invisible). The reason why I didn’t report this until now is that not then but now I’m curious if anybody else has reported a similar event.

Well, here I am now. When I left work I have to cross the street to get home and always scan the skies to see if I can see anything of interest. Once in a while I will see a commercial aircraft or the odd meteor streak through the sky. This night was different, very different. I turned my head left to check for traffic and looked up to the sky as I always do. I then started to scan the skies and immediately did a double take as off in the distance was an aircraft that seemed to be stationary and appeared to about a mile away. It looked to be about 150 feet above the ground and displayed multiple cells. Each cell was multi colored, kaleidoscope like, almost like what is seen in a (Bell??) commercial on TV. I noticed that the object was slowly getting closer and was moving at the speed that a commercial airliner would be moving in the sky at cruising elevation. I also noticed a single blinking light on the nose of the object and a single blinking light at the base of the object. As it got closer I could see that it was football shaped with the nose and tail rounded. These cells had multiple levels and circled the object, almost as if it consisted of multiple objects that formed one object. These lights in the cells were not static, but had a movement to them that was very beautiful and mesmerizing at the same time. As it got almost directly overhead I could make out a single blinking light at the tail of the object. It was so close and so quiet. I listened closely and could not hear a single sound emanating from it. It looked like a blimp, but no motor sound, no hum no nothing!! All the while these lights, (cells) maybe 50-70 continued to display a light show. I watched the object continue to cross overhead and continue in a perfectly straight line until it was out of sight.

Went out about 10 after 9 tonight and they were there again.  I then looked in a more southerly direction and they were over in that direction also.  Most start at a point in sky and angle down from right to left.  Some were going straight up and some actually did loops.  A couple of times I'd see them appear to stop and turn sharply and go the other way.   Trees still block lower sight. Then I went out into the yard and to my surprise I was able to pick them out almost everywhere I looked. This made me think that maybe they were bats or birds with town lights reflecting but bats wouldn't and they just don't fly like birds.   Tried to imagine they were moths but they sure don't fly like moths either. Don't know how many nights it may continue,2011-10-10T00:00:00,47.1054,-122.0457

Very rural area of Ohio.  No significant airports in the area.  No other aircraft seen in the area at the time. Our position – in back yard of residence seated looking generally westward.  Not totally dark yet but nearly.  Weather clear, low humidity day, light winds generally out of the west  Witnesses 4 adults ages 53, 51, 51, 50. Two male/Two female – All four of us with college degrees, one a city councilman, 2 males corporate business owners.  Myself – I am an engineer who worked for McDonnell Aircraft company for many years.  Well versed in historic and modern civilian and military aircraft as well as astronomy and meteorology.  This was unlike any explainable night flying object I have seen.  The creepy part is that it made no sound and there were 3 lights/objects in a series. Shape/Color of objects (3 of them) - and bright red/orange glowing color and seemed to be changing/flowing but not pulsating, nor were any specific lights seen on the object, ball like shape.  There were no typical aircraft lights seen (ie like the typical red green or white beams, beacons or strobes)  Event – occurred at ~21:05 eastern time 1.	Noticed bright light but still distant light coming into field of view off to our right front (Northwest) and assumed it to be an airplane of some type. 2.  Continue to observe increasingly brighter light and started to notice its shape and color (red/orange and seemed to be changing/flowing but not pulsating, ball like shape). 3.  Next noticed a second and then a third object appear the same shape size and colors.  All then appeared to be equidistant from each other, but one following the other ( ie 3 in a row). 4.  They continued to track to the south getting to a due west position from our vantage point.   At this point the 4 of us were rather mystified by the shape and color of the objects.  They made no audible sound either propeller or jet.  There was ~ 5-7 seconds of time between each object 5.	The objects continued to track due south and toward the southwest of our position until we lost sight of them behind trees.  General track of their travel seemed to be from north to south. 6.  Managed at the last minute to capture a cell phone photo of the third object before going out of our view (sending via email)   The objects traveled a steady pace/speed as would a light aircraft if following the same pattern.  The altitude basically level/constant the whole viewing.   Possible altitude of 4 – 6,000 feet.  Believe that distance from our position at closest to the west was between 1-2 miles.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,40.4132,-82.2906

I wish I could contact you to compare sightings. My sighting occurred in 04/2011, as I was visiting my sister.  I was about midway between Dallas and Fort Worth and about 4 miles south of the DFW Airport.  As I did often, I was sitting on my sister’s patio, early in the night, watching the aircraft going in and out of DFW.  While watching the aircraft it was not unusual to see an occasional satellite cruising across the sky.  On this, forever memorable night, I was on the patio talking on the phone with a friend of mine in Houston.  I remarked to my friend on the phone, “hey Greg I can see a satellite moving across  the sky.”  It was no sooner than I had said that when I dropped the phone on the concrete surface of the patio, breaking the cover off of it.  The assumed satellite I was watching had come to a complete stop.  It remained motionless for about 3 seconds before tearing across the sky at a right angle from it’s former position and covering about one-third of the sky in less than a second.  The object made 4 or 5 more similar maneuvers, all at 90 degree angles from it last position before moving in a straight line and disappearing.  The speed at which this thing moved was incredible, moving across large portions of the sky in less than a second. Thinking about the sighting in the future, it was almost as if the object was surveying the DFW Airfield.  The next day I was at a local restaurant talking with a friend of mine who recently retired from the FAA.  I, of course told him the story, expecting to see a surprised expressing on his face.  When I finished the story he finally turned to look at me and said, “(expletive) Steve, our pilots tell us (expletive) like that all the time.”  Ha!  I felt cheated; as though the most profound experience of my life was suddenly made quite commonplace. There has never been any doubt about what I saw.  I only regret that I was alone. I had screamed for my sister and brother-in-law, but when they arrived, the incident was over.  I am very gratified I have your forum to share this with people who have had similar experiences.  I have no doubt that this object was manufactured, was controlled by intelligent operators and was not in the realm of any technology that I am have heard of.  I hope the person from Kennewick, WA will read this.  Their prior report certainly affirmed my sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

On or about 6/2011 around 2:30 to 3amC.S.T. i was traveling east bound on u.s.hwy 98 when i looked to my left across the west bound lane into the woods and noticed green light emulating from the woods, the first thing i thought was what is a shrimp boat doing in the woods because of the green lights. I looked for the next place i could do a 180 to have a closer look.as i got closer i could tell that the lights were round.I parked my truck on the side of the hwy. and there was about a 3 foot embankment i walked down to get a closer look. My ex wife got out of the truck but stayed next to it.  As i walked down the small embankment and got closer approx.40 yards i stopped and noticed five lights a little smaller than swimming pool lights emitting a light green light.there was approx.3 to 4 feet of space in between the lights that was totally blacked out,also about 3to 5 feet above the first green light closest to me was a 6th light that was more intense and emitting! a bright orange color as i took another step or two closer,the orange light got brighter at the same time my ex told me not to get to close,it was almost as if the orange light was warning me not to approach any closer so i stopped in my tracks and just stared at this craft,something made me look up into the trees above the craft and i will attempt to explain what i saw.What looked to me like thousands of darker green laser lights were shining like laser lights thru every open space between pine needles and oak leaves and as God is my wittness in the dark green laser beam lights going up these lights rather slowly were what appeared to be minute bubbles or tiny metal flakes going up,not down in these laser like beams,as i looked back at the five round lights i noticed that the black out between the lights was so blacked out that you could see that it was blocking out the trees behind it only up to the height of the lights and that if the craft had turned all it's lights of! f it would have been next to impossible to know it was there e! xcept fo r the fact that it blocked out the shape of the trees up to 5 or 6 feet above the ground,i took 1 step closer to get a better look and the orange light jumped up another notch in intensity so i went back to my truck to see if i could flag some one down and there was no traffic.What i would have given to have had a camcorder that night.Ive often wondered what would have happened if i would have stayed until the sun came up.Would it have taken off or would it have simply slowly disapeared as the sun came up.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,30.3979835443038,-86.4573

I was in my car with my door open eating lunch when I witnessed this.  I was looking up at the clear blue sky watching some airplanes fly by in the very far away distance when I saw these spheres appear out of nowhere.  It’s almost as if they appeared just for me, and I say that because they appeared in the exact area that my line of sight was at the entire time I was looking at the sky. After they appeared in the sky they ""danced"" around each other and then finished off with a triangular formation. After these spheres made that triangular formation in the sky I thought that they would be visible for a bit longer so I tried to take out my cellphone and try to get some video footage of the spheres; but as I was reaching in my pocket to pull out my cellphone I saw them disappear into thin air the same way they had appeared.  I also believe that the mood that I was in might have played a factor in their appearance.  I was in a peaceful mood with a clear head, meaning that I did not have many if hardly any thoughts going through my mind at that time.

I had gone to the library after school and spent a few hours there.  After I missed the bus, I sat by the bus stop for the next one.  About 20 minutes after I got to the stop, two of the street lights flickered slightly and one burnt out, I figured it was just a little strange but something that could still happen.   Only a minute or so later, a passing car had to stop from a sudden battery blow out.  I thought again that this was weird, but I tried not to think much of it.  To pass time, I looked at the sky to find some constellations which takes some time, I thought the bus would come when I found a few, but instead of stars, my eyes were directed at a triangular shape making absolutely no noise.  It was made of three yellow lights, one at the top, one on the bottom left, and one on the bottom right.  I heard the person in the broken down car say ""what the hell is that?"" and I figured they were looking at it too but I didn't check.  I stared at it until it ! was out of sight, it moved slowly so that took about 2 minutes.  In that time, I noticed the lights were changing once in a while from yellow to blue, then to red.  Once it was out of sight, I saw about 7 of what looked very much like planes flying together, but of course spaced out, towards the direction the object had gone.  When the planes were gone, I looked around to see if the person in the car had seen what I saw, but they were gone along with the car, and somehow the broken light had turned back on.  That freaked me out, mostly because no one was around to fix the light (no one can fix a light in that little time anyways) and no one gave the car a jump.  I didn't even hear it start.

Since then I have constantly watched the sky with binoculars or naked eye and have seen numerous objects over the years. I dont have the best camera but decided to try and take zoomed in photos now and then of objects I have seen. The camera that took the photos in regards to this report is a Digital with zoom that uses a floppy disk for storage. I have debated wheather or not to file this report and submit the photos since I want to be absoultly sure that what is reported is accurate and not a waste of anybodys time.  The only manipulation that I have done on the photos submitted is to invert color & or zoom in & or sharpen in order to try and get the best view possible of the objects.

Millard Airport is 1 mile straight south. Omaha Eppley is 15 miles to the North East.  I was a jet mechanic in the Navy and am quit familiar with military and commericial aircraft. I have learned the incoming and outgoing flight paths for the above facilities.  I am guessing that the objects I observed and took photos of are approximately up around 30 - 40 thousand feet as they were hard to see with the naked eye but able to watch with binoculars and they still appeared to be distant. When I took the photos - I didnt know if the pictures would turn out or not let alone capture anything since the objects seemed so far distance.  The most common factor in the photos is the small green circular light. I first noticed the triangular object (which was hard to distinguish its shape at the time) and took its picture which I was supprised to see the triangular shape and more important to see a cicular area on the bottom o! f the craft which appears to be some sort of propulsion emissi! on. The two object photo - was one object then two, were there and then were gone. I know what I saw, I know what I took pictures of and I know what the pictures are showing; I know that the objects are not any type of commericial or military aircraft that I have ever seen before. No matter if you are a skeptic of UFO's or a believer in UFO's as I am - here are the pictures for you to view and decide for yourself what the objects are. Mufon or NuForc are encouraged by me to analyize these photos in depth because I would like to know what they decide the objects in the pictures might be.

Yet, the slight movement of the start that that originally caught my eye was in fact darting towards each flash of faint blue light.  I witnessed this for several minutes before going back to the tent.  The ""star"" was extremely high in the sky, perhaps in space itself or the upper atmosphere.  For as high as the light objects were I believe that the slight movements the star made towards the blue lights must have been extremely fast, as it was moving back and forth, stopping, and then shifting toward another blue light repeate! dly.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,37.92709285714285,-91.77891428571428

Light was emitting from the front, but not the sides (like the wingspan of an insect).  As it proceeded to fly overhead, the light suddenly went off. It was high enough that it was momentarily lost in the clouds.  Still could see a small faint red light circling around the dark object.  Then, it started to ""fall"", descending closer to us. The faint light disappeared. Now the object appeared to be only a few hundred feet above.  This time it looked like the object was atom-shaped.  There was a dark mass in the center, with three ""spheres"" orbiting around the object.  It also seemed to have condensed into a 4 x 4 foot object (which is strange because when it was higher in the sky it looked like it could have been a plane). It looked like it could potentially land somewhere, so we started sprinting towards the direction of the object, but lost it in the house lines. The object made no sound the entire time. We tried walking around the neighborhoods, but because it is a suburban area, most backyards are fenced and we couldn't see.  There was also a wooded area nearby where it could have possibly landed.  We couldn't find anything and no one seemed to be outside, which was strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I am not experienced in judging height but It appeared to me to be about 6, maybe 8 story's high and my angle of observation was about 45 degrees. According to Weather History for Lily Dale the evening of our observation it was 70 degrees that evening and the wind was 5 mph. I was reluctant to add my observation as a good deal of time has passed and our location might prejudice readers and we might not be taken as credible witnesses.  I don't think an orange fireball that didn't move in any exceptional manner would be anything that any of us would have thought of as a UFO or worth reporting... and as individuals we are not prone to talk about what happens on our visits to Lily Dale.

My husband, daughters and I were leaving a friends’ house and as we came out the door of the house and stood on the driveway a few of us quickly noticed a glowing orange ""fire"" ball in the sky.  The eight of us range in age from 55-18 years old. At first we wondered if it was a plane in trouble (on fire?).  But then, it seemed to be getting closer to us and my husband said it must be a hot air balloon and we were just seeing the glow of the fire in it.  It was a dark night. We were looking towards the southeast and the fireball was traveling from north to south.  Next we wondered if it was a satellite, but it was traveling too slow and at times it just hovered and didn't move.  That was the strangest thing of all.  It was traveling in a linear path and didn’t change altitude.  The altitude was hard to judge since we didn’t know what we were looking at, but it was at probably the upper limit of what a hot air balloon would travel at. After four minutes of discussing this on the driveway, we all agreed that we had no idea what it was.  We were all feeling unsettled, even my sensible engineer husband.  Then, in about 10-15 seconds flat it flew up and away from us into the darkness.  We watched it until it became a tiny dot and then it disappeared completely.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,,

He came back in right away, and told me to hurry and come outside.   I hurried out, and he pointed to the sky and there, in the West, was a long line of round, orange lights heading straight toward us.  There had to be at least a dozen to 20 of them.  They were in rows of 2-4 each.   I told my son to run and get his dad, because he's a skeptic, and he'd never believe it if he didn't see it for himself.  He came out and witnessed it too.    It was exciting, yet scary too, because my first thought was we were being attacked, and those were missiles.  But as they got closer, I could see that they weren't missiles...they were round objects, that  moved slowly in formation...all at the same pace, and they never moved out of that formation.  All of them were the same size.   There was absolutely no sound coming from them, and no flickering lights as they passed over us.  The sky was clear, with the exception of one small whispy cloud over the house next door.  Every one of those objects went into the cloud, and never came out.  There were openings in that small cloud, and we didn't see any of the objects pass by any of those openings.   When it was over, I tried to find out if anyone reported the sighting, but only one news station answered, and she said they were short handed and nobody reported it.   I went back outside to check the sky, and the cloud was gone as well.   It was very frustrating!  I was kicking myself for not running into the house and grabbing my cell phone to try to film it.  I was afraid if I went to look for my phone, I'd miss the event.   I don't know how high up the cloud was, or how low the objects were, but those objects had to be really big if that cloud was very high up, because they weren't  small dots in the sky.

As I approached the aircraft, I had to slow down because I thought I was going to run into it.  As I went under it, I noticed that there was a bright, white light at each corner and one round, red light in the middle of the craft.  The body of the craft was so dark that I could not see it.  The only way that I could tell its shape was by the strobe lights.  The red light in the middle was not flashing.  It hovered slowly over my vehicle from right to left and immediately in front of me.  It made absolutely no sound.  I had rolled down my window to hear if it sounded anything like a helicopter until I noticed that by its shape and lights it was not.

At approximately 9:00PM PDT on August 3rd of this year, I was taking pictures of the sunset and crescent moon as I regularly due.  As I was reviewing the photos on my Canon G2 Powershot Digital Camera, I noticed that I may have captured the first stars of the evening with the moon.  This turned out to be a big problem though, when I returned to the deck to look for the stars, there were no stars-which should have been brighter by that time.  Next, I went to the computer to do some analysis.  What I saw on the screen was amazing.  Two disc shapes, weird squares, large moon like objects, and also a triangle-missile shaped UFO. Alan Fergason mentioned on Coast to Coast that he didn't see very much until he went to the computer to look, as was my experience, I saw nothing through the viewfinder when I snapped the shot. I took 12 shots of the sunset that night, some have nothing odd, others some, but on IMG_054 the ufo's are are amazingly vivid. It took me some time to believe what I was looking at, until I it coupled with the strange camera battery situation I experienced while taking the images. While taking these photos, my battery read close to dead, even though I was sure it was fully charged.  After reviewing the photos I checked my camera again and it then again was fully charged. Something really weird is going on, I'm sure of it.  I'd appreciate if you would help me analyze these photos further.  I've included the original and some blowups.  I have a PowerPoint poster too, which makes it easier to track and identify the UFO's.

It did seem to almost stop on two occasions and also accelerate very quickly.

I was walking through the public park and noticed half a dozen or so white lights, which I initially presumed where stars, even although they looked strangely close, say no higher than a helicopter would fly and were in a perfect horizontal formation.  So, I stopped and paid closer attention to them using my binoculars and noticed a red glowing light in the middle and that it was clearly some kind of stationary silent craft.  My dog was pulling on the lead, so it was hard to stay focused on it, but I did see what looked like a shooting star shoot down vertically beside it, just before the craft/ufo slowly started moving in a North Western direction behind some trees.

This is a relatively benign wilderness for evening travel with a headlamp and I was enjoying the mosquito free journey through the lodge pole pine and fir forest with the many spectacular meadow rimmed lakes providing wonderful opportunities to see an occasional shooting star or rather (meteorites) from the Persid Meteor Shower.  I usually schedule a trip during this period specifically to see this shower, yet this year, the waning gibbous moon phase eliminated all but the brightest meteorites from visibility.  Upon reaching Second Dinkey Lake at approximately 12:25 a.m., I skirted the west side of the lake, heading south away from the South Lake to First Dinkey Lake connector trail and sat down on the southwest shoreline to take a rest. Looking up in the general direction of the Andromeda Constellation (northe! ast), I observed a red/orange flicker of light that appeared to resemble a meteorite on vertical entry into the atmosphere.  At arm’s length, the length of this flicker appeared to be at least 3/4 inch when compared to the width of my thumb.  As soon as the light faded away, an object, white in color, accelerated at an incredible rate of speed crossing the sky in a southeast direction from the exact location of the flicker. I immediately checked my watch and found it was 12:30 a.m.  Having seen hundreds of satellites cross the sky at fixed rates of speed, this object clearly showed acceleration from the point of origin. This was not a satellite crossing the sky as I would have seen the approach heading toward the location of the original flicker. I immediately stood up, called my resting dog and within twenty feet we were back into the dense forest on the last ascent to Island Lake.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,,

I was so tired, so I just opened my eyes to stare out the window when I noticed to BRIGHT( throbbing) lights about the size of a grapefruit at the base of our window. I lay still to make sure I saw what I just thought I saw, then the lights ""throbbed"" or pulsated again. Me being a skeptic, immediately thought that it was an intruder on the side of our house. I immediately sat up and sat STILL waiting to perhaps see the shadow of a human pass by.   I then got up to check on my toddler who was fast asleep.  I dare not look out the window, in fact it was like the event didn't even happen because I acted like I didn't see what I just saw. I tried to go back to sleep but felt CHARGED as if I had 10 cups of espresso.   Later that! day in Long Beach, we had a small earthquake too.  I felt it because I was laying in the bed, if fact the earthquake centered in Signal Hill, which is just 4 blocks north of where we live ( not sure if it's related) the earthquake was a 3.2 if I remember correctly.  Anyhow, when my husband came home from work, and started running errands together, I finally brought it up about these two strange lights outside our window, come to find out he saw them too!  But he was trying to rationalize what he saw as well. At the time I saw the lights and thought it was an intruder I completely forgot about the motion sensor that would have come on if it had been a person or animal.  The sensor didn't go off. I am so spooked. I don't think I'll ever sleep the same again.  I have feelings of dread going to bed now.  My nerves are frayed every time the baby monitor experiences even a little static.

The most recent UFO I saw was a couple months ago when I was on vacation in eastern Washington at Moses Lake. This was during a hot summer day, the sky had no clouds, the perfect day for swimming. As I managed to keep myself afloat with a poorly performed backstroke, I was gazing up at the sky. Swimming closer to the shore on my back, I continued to gaze upward, when something once again, an orb like UFO caught my eye. It wasn't like a light orb, but rather a gray solid mass. It was not a plane or jet or helicopter, as it made no sound. It moved slowly, but was not a balloon or anything and was quite far up there to be a balloon. Plus it was entirely round. I took another moment to look at it, but became immediately unnerved – I didn't think it was dangerous, I, like most humans, just get a little creeped out by the unknown – and turned over to swim on my stomach back to shore. This is going to sound weird, but I did not point it out to my sisters once I got back to camp – I didn't want to freak them out, but even more than that I didn't think they'd believe me. But again, I was just creeped out that I tried to push it out of my mind for the time being and didn't see the UFO again. With all of the UFOs I've seen, I've had no missing time, no weird marks on my body, no weird “powers”, no strange memories or dreams. I have no clue what they were or are, only what they were not and through process of elimination, those objects were either nothing that we – we being humans – have, or that we – we being the general society of the USA and the rest of the world – know of. They could have been natural phenomena that I cannot explain, but I personally think that these objects did not seem organic or natural and that at least one – if not all – of them even seemed to be controlled by an intelligence. The only thing I can think of is that they are either of these suggestions, or a combination of the following conclusions: they belong either to a certain group of people in the government who isn't letting the rest of the world in, on their technology, or the objects are from someone or something else.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,,

The second UFO I've ever seen was a weird object that was witnessed by not only myself, but my cousin as well. It was still somewhat light out but getting darker by the minute. My cousin was driving and I was sitting in the passenger seat, dully gazing not out of my window, but rather the reflections of the lights of a store we were passing that was reflecting off my window.  This part is kind of ironic and amusing as, still looking at the reflections of the lights, I said to my cousin, ""Wow, for a split second, those lights looked like a..""   Now, the amusing and ironic part is that had I finished my sentence, I'd have said, ""Wow, for a split second, those lights looked like a UFO.""  That's because the reflection of the lights from the store we were passing did look like a large ship, although after that split second when I realized that it was in fact, just the reflection of the store lights, something shot down from the sky. We saw it outside through the front of the car, and the sighting caught me off guard and I didn't even finish talking. This was a light or orb-like object, made of a kind of LED-like light with a blueish tint; however, it was so fast, that the sighting itself was only for a split second. It was somewhat funny actually, because my cousin asked if I saw that and I remember saying something along the lines of, “I'm not the only one who saw that? Good!” 	Besides it just being a light orb, the sighting played out like this: just as I was about to finish my sentence, my shock and surprise of the UFO made me hush up and my cousin and I watched as an LED-like ball of light – a large ball or orb mind you – randomly came out of the sky seemingly from nowhere, but instead of like the first UFO where it just kind of flickered in and out from nowhere, this one came flying from overhead, and it fell or shot down maybe three-hundred yards away from us and “vanished” before it hit the ground.  I put vanish in quotes because there was a solid concrete gate or fence blocking our view from the ground where it would have crashed, but because we couldn't see, we truly don't know what happened to this object; if it had been any other object such as a plane, helicopter, jet or anything else, we were close enough to not only hear it crash but to see any flames or an explosion, but we saw nor heard any explosion or flames. On top of that, planes! , helicopters and jets don't just show up out of nowhere, aren't shaped like an orb or large circle, are not that fast as this thing was – even if they were falling to the ground! – and aren't made entirely of light. If it had been a shooting star, it would have had a tail, it wouldn't have looked like it was made of LED light, it would not have come out of nowhere, and one of that size and magnitude and one falling/crashing that close to us, would have had serious even fatal affects on my cousin and I, as in once again, we would have heard and seen an explosion and maybe would have even died from it.  That is why we think this thing either must have vanished right before it hit the ground, or somehow literally went into the ground.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,47.32144977777777,-122.62237777777777

The lights themselves were circular with almost the same hue as a street light but you could tell they were significantly larger than a street light.  They were definitely at a distance and in the direction of Fort Drum.  Without knowing the size of the lights I cannot determine if they were over Watertown or much farther north.   The lights formed a rectangular pattern. 2 on top. 2 on bottom.  Upon rounding the corner all were fully visible. I probably looked at them for a good 5 seconds before asking my fiancee ""are you seeing this?"".  She did as well see them.   Immediately, the top two lights began to fade out and then disappeared. Immediately following that, the bottom two lights completely disappeared with no fade at all.  It was extremely bizarre and slightly unsettling.

Through my peripheral vision I could see an object moving quickly toward the ground in a straight line. I turned to look at it since it caught my attention. The object was emanating many colors, I couldn't tell what color it was exactly, it was as if it was cycling through many colors at once. There was no point from which lights were coming, the whole object was THAT color or colors all at once as it moved, it wasn't SHINING and it didn't project any beams of light.  The object looked to be round in shape however not a sphere, more like a donut shape or a wheel but no hole in the middle or at least I couldn't see one it moved too fa st. Once it reached near the ground I lost sight of it for a split second as if it disappeared completely. Then it reappeared and moved straight back up. Not at an obvious an! gle like a plane or any angle I could tell.  Simply straight back up.  I was still moving toward the object the entire time (which was about 3 seconds).  Once I saw it moving up toward the sky I tried leaning forward to look and see if I could catch it again but it was already gone. The object had only been gone for a second when my phone started beeping low battery, that scared me further. I had also heard a static noise when I first saw the object, I was talking over speaker phone and over my car's speakers so when I heard the static it was quite noticeable.  The distance from me in my car driving toward it at around 65 mph to where it was is probably about a football field in length, it wasn't very far but it wasn't close enough that I could see many more details and it didn't linger.

Shortly after midnight on the morning of 18 Sept 2011, I was driving south on Interstate 75 heading toward Dayton, Ohio.  As I approached the city of Troy, I noticed a red pulsating (maybe ""flickering"" is a better word) light that appeared to be almost hovering over the interstate.  I first thought it was a light on a cell or other type of tower, but the closer I got I noticed it seemed to be moving slowly to the east.  I'd estimate the altitude of the light to have been no more than a couple thousand feet as I drove under/by it.  There was no apparent noise associated with it, and I'm sure it wasn't a conventional aircraft or helicopter. As I recall, the weather that night/morning was fairly clear, with just enough haze to allow the red light to illuminate the haze around it with a dull red glow.  As I continued south, I continued to observe the light in my rearview mirrors until I eventually lost sight of it.  I'm unsure if the light extinguished, if it left the area, or if I lost sight of it due to the terrain as I continued south.   Total time of my obersvation was probably 10-12 minutes. I made a point to check the newspapers and TV news the next day in Dayton (about 20 south of Troy) to see if there was any mention of the light, but found none.  My thought was it was probably a Chinese lantern, but then I noticed the Sept 25 sighting in Dayton on the NUFORC data base that sounded almost exactly like what I'd seen.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,40.03583043478261,-84.17787898550725

I was picking up my son from a baby sitter at around 3:20 am.  While i was waiting i looked up into the sky. I noticed a large stream of light drop at an left angle from where i was standing.  It was so unusual to me because it only started to shoot down halfway through the atmosphere, and the light was 10 times wider than any shooting star i've ever witnessed.  As the object dropped closer toward me i began to panic and tried to open my car as quickly as possible to retrieve my phone which was completely dead. I did not attempt to turn on my car during the sighting for fear of attracting attention to myself although it seemed as if i were being pulled toward the object regardless.  I noticed as the object was dropping it had a tail behind it about 7-8 inches long but as it came closer to the surface the light seemed to collapse into it once it came close enough to drop lower than the treeline.  At the closest the object Seemed to be about 3-4 inches long and 2 wide so it looked like a huge black oval in the sky surrounded by a white light that looked the same color as clouds.  The white light showed through the center of the oval as well so it seemed like an object projected by light until it reached the tree line, then the light seemed to drop into the blackness and disappear all together. The other thing i remembered noticing was the lack of noise.  There was no sign the it ever hit the ground but i felt an overwhelming urgency to drive in the direction of where i had last seen it fall.  I felt as if it were less than 5 miles away, but i chose not to go because i needed to take my toddler home.  I have yet to get over the shock, and am still noticing unusual movement in the skies after 3 am.  I can try to send a drawing depicting what i saw, but i was never able to make out the object in full.  It did not seem to stop moving, and it feels like once it got close enough to see my mind wiped any other images than the black oval which in itself is amazing because i suppose it means the object was mo! ving faster than light itself.

One morning i think sept. 25th i could not sleep, and i have been having trouble sleeping a lot.  I was lying there staring at my friends computer screen it had a screen saver that was hard to take my eyes off of when i have been awake the whole time my friend was sleeping beside me.  Then the werid notion that i was not the only one awake and that i have been hearing a faint sound of something for awhile but never really relized it was there and it has been there for awhile, and as soon as this idea came into my head i look towards my window that was on the right of me.  My friend had put up blankets to keep the sun out, so i could not see anything.  But the very second i mean (very) second i relized and looked towards the window i heard something shoot straight up into the sky and i ""can"" remember the sound and how fast it! took off.  It was like it knew when i relized it was there and it just took off. And as soon as it did my eyes also caught the computers screen and it froze the second that this thing took off.  Ufo was the only explanation i could think of.   Then i lyed there scared cause i knew that it was out there by me for awhile i never listened close enough to hear the sound. I started questioning why my window, why me?  And i couldnt explan so i just lyed there confused and frightened.  Soon i believe i might have heard some things talking to one another outside my window, I can remember the sounds they were making.  I was very freaked out at this point scared that i was going to come face to face with a thing or things.  I believe i started to cry and turned and woke up my friend in tears grabbing him and telling him there was something outside and i believe that were, aliens.  The minute i woke him up our power went out for about 30 secs to a min. which seemed forever since i was already! terrified.  He said he believed me but i really dont think he ! really understood the fact that those events took place and it was very real. I tried to report the sighting but did not go threw with it, the roomates kinda got me to blow it off. I did tell many people about it.

It was approximately 12:30 PM when I noticed it.   I continued to watch it, and it never seemed to go anywhere.  Even though we'd driven for miles, I could still see it up there, and it appeared to stay the same size.  At one point, I thought it may have had another circle in the center of it...but it could have been my eyes playing tricks on me, since I was watching it for so long.  My husband pulled off the interstate, at a Dairy Queen in New Mexico, and when we were in the parking lot, I pointed at it and said to him, ""See...it's still up there!""  He said maybe it was a weather balloon, but I told him I didn't think we'd be able to see a weather balloon for that many miles.  When we came out of the Dairy Queen, it was still up there in the same spot.   We continued on our trip, and I continued to watch the object.  We passed through to Texas, and it was still up there.  I'm not sure where we were in Texas, but I'd guess that maybe we were 30-40 miles into Texas (still on Interstate 40), when it finally started to get a grey mist around it, and it disappeared.  It was approximately 2:30 PM when it disappeared.   I had watched it for at least 2 hours, and  we had to have driven at least a hundred miles while I was watching it.

The individual lights were not separate objects.  The object made no sound.  It was difficult to accurately judge size, altitude and speed, but it appeared to be very high and larger than a jetliner. The speed was faster than a normal jet aircraft but slower than a satellite, and much slower than a meteor.  The object did not leave a contrail.

What struck me is that the individual who posted their description saw word for word exactly what I saw.  That person wrote: “Set of sky flashes lit up entire sky with out any radar anomaly or storm...It looked like the whole sky took a picture, for what seemed like seconds there were two sets of flashes with a pause between the two….There was no sound or bolts of lightning, nothing on the radar, just looked like someone with a really huge planet sized camera took a picture of our planet with flash….flash was bluish- white and looked exactly like a camera flash…”<- Okay, the only difference in that person’s experience and mine is that after I saw the blue flashes, there was a very brief red flash, just one, but it was almost as bright as the blue flashes. This is not he first time I’ve seen anomalies in that area of the sky he! re in Pasadena; this is the 4th time in 5 years we’ve lived here that other-worldly objects make themselves seen to us.  We’ve also seen the same red/orange orbs someone else here in MD described, floating down our street moments after a terrible electric storm in June 2010.  My husband had the presence of mind to grab the camera and have me take pictures.  I chased them down the street until they floated up over the tree line and out over the waters of Stony Creek.  In any event, the encounters have been more frequent and varied, i.e., we’ve not been limited to just one type of experience since moving to Pasadena, and after seeing those huge flashes in the sky last night, I can honestly say I’m uneasy and really want to take the photos to an expert and have them analyzed, but I don’t know to whom I should forward the photos. I didn’t get a photo of the flashes last night, but I have plenty of the other photos….",2011-10-10T00:00:00,39.1252,-76.5116

The sky was still dark, dawn has not yet begun.  In the South-East sky, I noticed a bright peculiar light I have never seen before in this region of the sky at this time of night/day. I have observed nighttime skies since I was a child as I have always been fascinated with astronomy. I am familiar with the difference in characteristics between observing a planet, stars, satellites and other celestial objects. The object I observed consisted of a bright, solid, white light with less intense, flickering red and blue lights. At first I thought it was just an airliner, but it was not moving in any direction.  I thought maybe it was flying towards my direction, but after 5 mins, the lights showed no changes in intensity, height or direction. I do not believe it was a star, as it did not have characteristics as such. I know for a fact it was not a planet, as Venus was high in the Southern sky and very bright.  I continued to observe the object and it appeared to make subtle motion in a back-and-forth looping pattern, but maintained it’s general position. I got my binoculars to see if I could get a better view.  The object had no direction, but I could see red and blue lights flickering amongst a solid white light.  With the binoculars, I had the depth perception and believe this object was not within our atmosphere, but within the near distance of our solar system. I called my wife outside and she observed the object as well and watched through the binoculars.  She said she witnessed a single white light with flickering red and blue lights as I described. As I continued to watch through my binoculars, the object separated and became two lights moving in a horizontal direction from each other.  A few minutes later, the two lights moved back together to become one light again, with the red and blue flickering resuming.  Moments later, the light separated into two lights again and this time they moved vertically from each other.  Then they slowly moved about each other and eventually came together to become just a single light again and resumed the red and blue flickering once more. Slowly, the light began to become dimmer and appeared to get smaller as if it was moving away from the Earth. I had to go get ready for work so could not observe any longer.  I will go outside again tomorrow morning and see if the light returns.  I am not sure what it was, but it was not an object commonly seen in the night sky.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,39.4835,-86.0478

The fireballs displayed complex patterns of symmetrical movement.   He immediately phoned me and we went out into the street to observe it and saw that the objects were flying over our house in single file and they made no sound.  A new fireball would appear just over the Western horizon about every 30 seconds.  They traveled on the same basic path from West to East.   Each appeared as an orange and red fireball.   The fireballs were about 4 times the size of Jupiter.  They moved past us and onto a point just above the eastern horizon where groups of two or three of them would congregate and then disappear together as a group.

It was an unusually warm night with very clear skies.  At 7:42 PM, my son was driving his car near Buttonwood Park, in the City’s West End, when he saw five bright orange fireballs in the night sky.  The fireballs seemed to be playing tag with each other, and their movement formed symmetrical patterns.  He phoned us about it so we went outside to check them out. Once in the street, we immediately saw the objects flying over the house in single file, and they made no sound. Every 30-seconds or so, a new fireball would appear just over the Western horizon.  It followed the same path in the sky as if in a procession.  Our son arrived at the house and the three of us continued to watch from the street. The fireballs were orange and red on the outside and using binoculars, the center looked bright white. To the naked eye, the fireballs appeared to be about two to three times the size of Jupiter.  Jupiter gives the appearance of a big bright star, and is currently the largest object in night sky beside the moon.  I would guess that the objects were flying well above the stratosphere at tremendous speed as they covered half the sky in about 30-seconds!   The fireballs moved past us and onto a point just above the Eastern horizon where they would congregate in groups of three.  Once the third fireball arrived and completed the group, the three would move close together and then disappear.  One of the fireballs changed color to white and moved just above an orange one.  The two merged together and then disappeared together.  Evidently they don’t need three to make an exit. We could see that the fireballs seemed to be playful in their movement about each other, and they were capable of changing color to yellow, orange, red, or white.  The last fireball reached its Easterly destination at about 8:10 PM and then disappeared with its two mates. We did not get any pictures but found many videos and pictures of fireballs just like them on the internet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides no contact information.

What was odd is that it kept becoming intense black and then fading to the point that I could not see it.  I looked at it through binoculars and saw that it was in fact a higly polished stainless steel object.  It had the form of a beer barell but about 5 times bigger.  No openings or windows of any kind.It was moving and was inclined at a 45 degrees angle.  I think that the reason it changed intensity was that it had such a polished reflective surface that it was changing the way ambient light  was being reflected on its surface. I watched it until it was so far I could not see it anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD)),2011-12-12T00:00:00,,

They are not always traveling from the Southwest to the Northeast.  Over a period of about two years I have seen these same objects, and I have also witnessed them traveling from due South, to due North.  I have also seen them bend their trajectory, and alter their velocity from slow to very fast.  These objects appear at first as a very bright white light, (sometimes amber in color), and appear to be intelligently controlled.  They travel along at a steady velocity, and then fade in their intensity, then just simply blink out and disappear.  These objects are moving far too slowly to be a meteorite, and far too fast to be an airplane.  They appear! to be above the upper atmosphere, as there is absolutely no sound associated with them.

The following is the email that was sent on 14 Sep 2011 by the witness;  (WITNESS EMAIL; UFO was flying SE @ about 30,000 ft. at an incrediable speed, was white in color and elongated like a missile shape maybe 100 ft. in length.  Sitting on right side of plane and saw UFO to the right and below me approx. 1 mile away at about 4pm.  Skies were clear with some clouds UFO entered clouds and vanished from sight.)   Because of the time change, this would have been 3pm Mountain and 2pm Pacific time.  This investigator spoke in depth with the witness, who was not only a USAF veteran of 4 years as a firefighter, but a former city police officer from California.  This investigator also served 3 years with witness in the USAF at the same base. Some addtional information. Witness was flying in from Dallas/Ft. Worth on American Airlines flight 453 which was to land in Portland, Or. at approx. 3:05pm.  Which would of put the time of the sighting Pacific Time about 2pm. Witness was amazed at the speed the object was traveling, which would of been SE to his NW direction of flight.  His duration of the sighting was about 4-5 seconds. This investigator showed the witness a still photo of the Salida, Co. UFO. Witness confirmed that his sighting was simular to that incident, as far as shape and color.  Witness stated that the speed was too fast for any conventional aircraft, including military. This investigator calculated Flight 453 was flying at an estimated speed of 500-570 mph which at the time of the sighting, the witness was over the Idaho/Utah border just north of Salt Lake City, about 500 miles from Portland, Oregon, plus or minus 100 miles about in the area of Interstate 84 and 15 at the Idaho/Utah border. Investigator also noticed from the UTAH map, that the Utah Test and Training Range was also in this general area, as well as the Dugway Proving Grounds. Most of this wide vast area is under the control of the U.S. Military.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,,

I was on a section of the hwy that had a view of direct north with no obstructions. As I approached the highest elevation of that section of the highway I saw a bright light that lasted for about 3 to 4 seconds.  I was on a direct north route and the object I saw was in the upper right corner of the windshield.  I was unaware if the object was there for some time,I believe I saw it only as it came into view of my windshield.  I would say it was about 20 degrees to my right traveling a direct south to north route. The object had no tail so I believe it was not a comet that entered the atmosphere. The best way I can describe it in size and shape would be the same as the planet Jupiter.  I am very familiar with that planet as I see it the morning from my back porch (I use Google Sky Map on my phone) It was round and it moved very quickly.  It was very bright and it was a white light with no color at all.  I see planes and helicopter in this area all the time and it was defiantly neither. The altitude I cannot determine as there were no other objects to reference in the night sky. It seemed to be going due north but not descending.  At one point it was gone I am not sure where it went as I had to get my eyes back on the road.  As I looked again it was gone.  The weather conditions were clear and cloudless. I am not claiming to have seen a ""UFO"" or ""spaceship"" what I saw was a large round bright object in the sky moving at a very high rate of speed.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,41.1191,-100.7915

On Tuesday, October 11th, at 7:40pm, I was heading home when I saw something that resembled an object on fire. It was a reddish-orange light, about the exact color of fire, and was traveling in a northerly direction. I stopped the car on the off ramp and got out for a better look. There was a nearly full moon behind me as I watched the light move across the sky. I hold a private pilot's license, and although at this time I am not ""current"", I've been around aircraft all my life, and I've never seen anything like this. There was a thin/broken layer of clouds I estimated to be about 4,000 to 5,000 feet above ground level. The light was below the clouds and appeared to be the size of a BB held at arm’s length. I applied 'critical thinking' in my attempt to identify the light. I asked myself ""Why couldn't this be _____?""   No aircraft I know of produces a reddish-orange light.  Plus there were no position, navigation, or anti-collision lights visible.  Also, this was not a landing light, as it was Omni-directional, not shining ahead as a landing light would. Then I considered it may have been the ROSAT satellite, which is due to re-enter the atmosphere and burn up.  The light had no trail of fire in its wake, and it appeared to be traveling in straight and level flight. Also the light appeared to be moving fast, so this was no ""Chinese Lantern"".  I would guess the light was at least 3,000 feet, and traveled from horizon to horizon in less than 90 seconds.

These dazzling fireballs displayed complex patterns of symmetrical movement.  Although he was only a few blocks away, he immediately phoned us so we went out into the street to observe it.  Sure enough, the objects were flying over our house in single file and they made no sound.   A new fireball would appear just over the Western horizon about every 30 seconds.  Each appeared as an orange and red fireball.  The size of these fireballs was a little smaller than the size of your pinky’s fingernail if you stretched your arm out in front of you.   They moved past us and onto their rendezvous point just above the eastern horizon where groups of two or three of them would congregate and then disappear together as a group.

In a dark area between stars the flash occurred lasting about 1-2 seconds.  It reached a brightness dimmer than ISS but brighter than many stars. It went from 0 brightness to full brightness and back to 0 at equal speed, I'd say 1.5 sec total.  I did not move at all.  I am an amateur astronomer and I know the stars and satellites, this was nothing I'd seen before. If it is a man made satellite then it's a geosynchronous one but why would it flash?  If it were tumbling like an iridium flare it would pulse at an even rate not flash once.  This flashed once and then again about 10 min later in I believe a different area but close.

It was raining slightly and I noticed what looked like the moon trying to peer through the clouds.  As I drove towards the Dresden Nuclear Station it became apparent that this was not the moon. It looked to be a blimp traveling west and it was ahead of me and to the left.  I noticed the “blimp” had a greenish – blue glow around the bottom, a metallic whitish gray just above that and a white glowing dome. I turned left on North Dresden Rd. The “blimp” was now on my right and we were on a path to intersect. The strange lighting had my attention and I began questioning whether it really was a blimp. I drove on, keeping an eye on it out of my passenger window.  The closer I got, the surer I was that this was no blimp…it was no helicopter… and it was not an airplane!   It was moving slowly across the sky and looked to be within a few hundred feet of the ground.   I kept asking myself- “what the hell is that?” out loud…  I could clearly see it now. It was only about 300 yards away, but it was now going to pass behind me.  I stopped and rolled the window down to get a good look- I saw a somewhat domed top and a flat bottom.  It made no sound as it passed within a hundred yards of my car.  I would guess it to have been at least 100 feet across, maybe bigger. I watched as it floated/glided over the road and across the fields on my left. For over a minute I sat and watched, but I had to get in to work so I drove on. Still watching this object out the window I pulled up to the Security Checkpoint (it had passed within ½ mile of the plant).  I asked the guard if he knew of any blimps that may be flying in the area and he said no…I then pointed out the object to him. The look on his face was enough for me- but he maintained his professional composure and jokingly said…”huh, may be a weather balloon!”  After I parked my car I began walking into the plant, still watching this thing in the distance now. I asked a co-worker if he had seen anything in the sky. He told me he really hadn’t looked up so I pointed to the object and it got his attention too. We watched it until it disappeared behind the steam of the cooling towers. Over the next day or so I found 2 other co-workers who witnessed this event.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,41.3926,-88.4455

As usual while out front, even though we have a street light in front of the house and there's a lot of light from Castro Valley and the surrounding cities like Hayward, San Leandro, San Lorenzo and Oakland, you can still see most of the brighter stars in the sky - like the Big Dipper, Orion's Belt and some of the Zodiac signs.  There's been a couple times over the last several months that I've seen something strange, but I am not about to say it was a UFO - as I was alone with my dog and I know it was not a meteor or a plane.  At any given time you can see on an average of about 7 to 8 aircraft at any given time in different parts of the sky around the SF Bay Area, most have just their navigational lights on and a few occasionally have their landing lights on. Tonight, like before, I was looking up towards the west (approx 264 degrees) and I saw that I thought was a bright star or possibly be a planet, then I looked down and saw my wife's car coming down the street and turn and start to park out on the street. While she was doing this I returned and looked to the west at this ""object"" but it wasn't a star, it was small like one of them but it was more of a bright white color and appeared closer than the ""normal"" stars, and it was moving sorta towards our general direction (which I later determined to be towards the south or south east). As my wife walked up the drive way I didn't turn to look at her, instead I kept my eye on the object and it was continuing to move - not real real fast, but appeared to be maybe the speed of a plane or a little faster. When she asked what I was staring at, I told her I don't know that that is up there, I told her I didn't see any navigational lights on it and she looked up and with her typical doubt she said it's probably a plane. I was just about to agree when it started to get dimmer, like someone hit a switch and it dimmed real low and you could still see it but there was a definate difference in brightness.  I told her look, it's getting dimmer and as we both watched it seemed like it was going up and got dimmer and then totally disappeared. We both looked for about 15 to 20 seconds trying to find it but it was not there - this was at approx 9:25pm. She then said mayby it WAS a UFO. I know it was NOT a plane, the only plane that I have seen that would do something similar to his is the U2 Spy Plane and Nasa still uses them, I""ve seen them take off numerous times at the old Navy Moffett Field in San Mateo County over the years - saw one not more than mayby 1 month ago.

(goto http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeQtnheMM6c for a small portion of the video)  I was in Ventura County California and in broad daylight(2PM PST - 10/22/11) I witnessed first what looked like a ball of neon blue light as bright a giant star, to my north-east, moving slowly across the fully lit sky moving north.  My first instinct was something from space falling to earth, like a meteor but it surprised me that it was moving so slow and I was able to see it in the daytime.  After 30 seconds I suddenly noticed there were many more of these ""lights"" (around at least 6-10)across a good portion of the sky northeast of me, all moving north.  Its kinda funny, I kept thinking to myself ""wow these things are so bright how could I keep losing sight of them"" and as soon as I'd think that they'd be gone and I have to refocus my eyes to find them.  They were barely pinpoints in the sky but they were super bright.  What really stood out to me at this point was 3 lights that were in a triangle formation(I will admit at this point I was seriously contemplating if they were UFO's)  The leading ""light"" was bright red(I remember thinking it was the color of those tiny little red mites you find in grass).  This was the only red light I saw.  I ran in, got my camera, and filmed about a minute and a half of, what before editing looks like, a blank sky.  Because it was so bright outside I didn't realize what I had caught on video until I edited the brightness/contrast the next day.  After what I saw I don't know what it is.  My best guess is I filmed a satellites reentry into the atmosphere.(a faulty German satllelite was supposed to fall to earth later that evening over the Indian Ocean/Thailand around 7 hours later and, as of yet, there have been no sightings and it been almost two weeks)  Whatever it was changed speed and at one point one even appeared to stop, and on the video one appears to split into two ""lights"", and one of those split into two.

It was a metallic chrome with hardly any sound, very slow and low to the ground Alright, so around 3:15am CST on (Oct. 22nd, 2011) In Wausau, WI.  I was laying in my bed facing northeast, when I noticed a very bright light behind my neighbors house (I thought it was them pulling out of their driveway with their brights on), but I didn't have my glasses on so I tried to find them so I could see it better.  Once I found them, it was now over my neighbor’s house, in a crop field behind their house.  Since these are my only two neighbors and I live in the country, no other cars were on the roads or fields or anything.  It seemed that the UFO was right in the field. The object had 3 bright ""headlights"" and 1 red light on the backside of it.  It was somewhat hard to tell the size and shape of it at this time. I then went to wake my mom up, so she could see it too.  I had to go lookout my kitchen window which faces northwest so I could see it and we could, since it was moving so slowly. We then decided to go in the car and try to follow it. We got i! nto the car, and got to the end of our street, which is about 50 yards.  We got to the end of our street and then I looked up in the sky and noticed it was way up in the sky now, about the normal height to fly an airplane. It was just sitting up there, not moving at all. (Impossible for a plane to do this, and it wasn't a helicopter) We decided to then turn off the car. And then all of a sudden it started coming toward us, very slowly. We stayed in the car until it was directly above us; I then stepped out to see if I could hear it. It was a silent, clear night, and even though the moon was full, it was still extremely bright.  The sound could only be heard when it was close to us.  It sounded like someone exhaling, not like a normal ""engine sound"". Once it was past us, now going backward (to the southeast) and still at the same height in the sky. Also, another important note, is that when I first seen it, the headlights were in front, as if it was a car. But when it went of u! s in the opposite direction the 3 lights were now in back of i! t.  Since the moon was bright and it was so clear out, I could now see the shape of it and the color due to the reflection of the moon. It was a metallic silver and oval shaped. Its size would probably be close to if you would take two 727 planes and stuck them together and took the wings off, but then made it more oval shape and a little wider. After this we then watched it until it disappeared into the southeastern sky. All in all its pattern that it fly could not be a plane, or satellite. It didn't have any blinking lights under the wings (if it had them) which a plane is required to have. Also, a helicopter is not that quiet and wouldn't be flying like that. I think that's about it though, and that's my experience with a UFO. It all ended at 3:45am.  - I couldn't get any pictures or video. I tried to, but my phone isn't that good, and I don't have a good camera at my house.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,45.01047409326425,-89.62716787564766

The night sky was clear showcasing all the stars, milky way, and constellations. I seen an object that looked just like a star in the night sky with the exception that it was brighter than the rest of the stars out. The shape would have been round I guess since it looked exactly like a star in the night sky. The color it was emitting was a mix between white and yellow. I jokingly told my friend ""Is that a UFO?"". He said he didn't know what it is, maybe a space station was the only answer he could come up with. Being an avid skywatcher I quickly went through my options. Falling stars and space debris follow a trajectory and I quickly checked that off the list. The object was moving fairly fast towards the southeast. Kansas has wide open sky's and airplanes you! can usually hear and see the blinking lights on them or the red and blues on the wing.  This had neither.  Plus with the object heading southeast of my position and away from us, you wouldn't be able to see the front headlights on an airplane.

The lights were still flashing, now from red, blue, green to yellowish. More morphing into each other than flashing. Then it started to move around and hover. I looked down to focus my eyes, notice the pattern the street lights were in, looked back up and saw the same pattern (5 stars). So I looked above that and saw a pentagon of which all had moved or I saw lights. Shape from where I was at; if you lift your hands straight up and out, and have a two inch space between index and both thumbs, that’s roughly the size of the pentagon. I went back to the first one and it was slightly moving and lights still, fairly, going. I then focused and physically saw my vision make a tunnel to the “UFO” and I then immediately saw 1-3 shooting star looking lights fly between the two sets of  stars.  (My mind is kind of fuzzy, it was either one with 3 points that connected, or 3 different ones that mesh together) I, then again, look back at the first craft I saw and watched for another minute and then it had dropped something.  A very small, smaller than the stars around, object/s lofted off the craft.  I keep watching for awhile, they do nothing but slightly move and just hover.  I look back towards the first one and made a connection in my head that I had seen a UFO and then I saw another craft take off as if it’s a shooting star.  Then I start to go back inside, decide to take another look, walk back and look between the trees (where my first sighting was at a different location) and see another one flying.  Then it stops! directly in the center of the surrounding trees, hovers, lights are going, and it just stayed there.  Then it took my breath away, and I went back inside.

I saw a cigar shaped ufo while on a hike with my children 20 years ago and have been watching the sky ever since. I once reported a ufo event witnessed by myself and strangers who all stopped our cars on a highway to watch what was going on.  I called the police and was directed to call the airforce and they took my information.  This event was about ten years ago.  My son and I were returning videos in the next town and driving home.  We saw a very bright green flash of light like a sudden explosion lasting about 15 seconds (or something hitting the atmosphere like a meteor, there was a loud boom).  I stopped the vehicle and pulled over.  I was concerned that there was some type of chemical explosion as there are old military facilities close by, and I was relatively new to the area.  An elderly gentleman in a Lincoln Town car pulled over and asked if we saw ""that"".  We watched the sky as it glowed green along the horizon for a while and faded.  Soon a helicopter flew over and shined a very bright light on to us as we just watched.  It quickly went away.  The only other interesting par! t was three dim yellowish lights appeared in the direction behind us (over Ithaca, NY).  They just sat there high above the city about the same width apart (many miles apart) not moving (arranged in a straight line, not a triangle or other popularly reported shape) until they slowly just became smaller and blinked out...gone. So we went home where I called the police. Tonight, my dog was growling at a skunk or something so I looked out the screen door.  I saw one of the many bright points of light in the sky begin to move.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me as it was subtle at first.  I thought maybe it was a satelite as we see them move regularly.  However, this one was different.  It was very very far away so I could only see a point of light.  It was above the lake in the direction of Cortland, NY.  I decided to report it as it's movements were clearly different than the usual.  It moved very slowly (almost undetectable if you weren't staring at it closely) in the direction toward Ithaca, NY.  Then, and here is where I became interested, it stopped and much quicker began to go the opposite direction (the direction it had just come from).  It did not turn, loop or stray from the line it had been in, it simply went backwards.  It did this for a short time to about the same place it had started (or as I had noticed it) and sudde! nly plummeted toward the ground so quickly that it blurred with a streak.  My logical brain said oh, see, it was a meteor until it stopped suddenly and shot back up to where it was before.  My logical brain does not think meteors do that.  I watched it for a very few minutes (maybe 7 all total).  It moved around slowly now toward Seneca Falls, NY.  It made an interesting loop like it was going back toward Ithaca but continued the loop back toward Seneca Falls and I lost sight of it from the trees. I saw an almost identical event as the one I just described several years ago as I was out on my lawn watching the fireworks over the lake.  At that time, the point of light was larger and moved impossibly fast zipping around this way and that until it flew away straight up and away. This is not a popular topic among sane normal everyday working people.  So, I appreciate the opportunity to share this information. Thank you",2011-10-10T00:00:00,42.6855,-76.8032

We watched the object head due-north for almost a minute, then it pulled a HARD bank to the left forming a 90 degree turn and flew due-west towards Nevada until it disappeared over the horizon. I know an argument can be made that perhaps the angle did not allow me to see the nav lights. And that would be an understandable argument… if not for the fact that the object, having pulled a sharp 90 degree turn in the sky above my head, showed Me two sngels and still no lights.

(I usually sit outside viewing for up to three hours and as long as five).  It seems important to me to state that I live in a flight path to the local international airport that is approximately one mile east of me.  Two objects in particular are of interest since both seem to be “planted” nightly in the same approximate area but appear to move  very slowly with the night sky and at times appear to be attempting to make corrections moving up slightly then re-positioning.  They are not satellites for they are two low to be confused with that technology.  One is a star- shaped object (definitely not a star) which flashes red and green light and rises behind the treeline of my backyard.  It can be seen with binoculars very distinctly.  The other is a very large brilliant white orb which rises to the east of my backyard. I have become aware that these star-shaped objects are “stationed” above my home and appear more brilliant in the night sky then stars and they too flash red and green which can be seen with the naked eye.  They have a tendency to “mimic” traditional starscapes like the big dipper. All of this came to my attention after experiencing a craft of some sort (one large white light with two red flashing lights on each side that caught my sudden attention in my dining room window.  Located below the tree line of the backyard, it vanished quickly and from that point on I have been diligent in searching the night sky.  I have also seen a ship appear from a brilliant white halo of light and vanish.  Both of these objects were what seemed no more than a “stones throw distance to my house”. Observations have included orbs that fly across the sky at great speeds and hide in distance, something that looked like a rocket(no wings). I know that these discoveries seem outrageous but I can only state what I have witnessed. Also, in witnessing these events I have brought it to the attention of others both in the household  and not who are astonished that my small window of the universe is affected in this way and they are now included in those that believe because of the nature of these sightings.

Our house faces South and when he parked his car, he was leaning against it, facing West.  I was standing about a foot away from him and noticed a strange orange-red light that was circular in shape, with a section from the center missing. It was almost as if the light were two seperate pieces and were not stuck all the way together.  I said ""What the hell is that?"" and he turned to look. There were clouds in the sky, so at first we thought it was possibly a plane and the light was reflecting through the clouds but it slowly faded from view as if on a dimmer switch.  Right after it had faded all the way out, two more lights popped up, right next to where the other had just been.  They shimmered in and then faded out as well, almost as quickly as they had come. Neither of us were sure what we had seen, but with the Luke Boys flying overhead all the time, among with all the other planes we see flying in, we are pretty familiar with our skies.

I was driving eastbound on Hwy240 in Kennewick Wa. on my way to work (only here for two weeks on a business trip).  I was looking in the sky a little bit south east of the road because the moon was in an almost perfect crecent.   As I looked into the sky an object appeared just a bit to the lower right of the moon. (At this time in the morning it wasn't really dark out).  The object was like a fluorescent light in the sky (Extremely bright and white).  The shape wasn't very clear but the raident light kinda gave it a Seattle Space Needle outline look.  At first I was excited thinking that I was seeing a shooting star or some kind of satellite falling through the atmoshere.  But was intrigued that it had very little light trail (like a meter etc).  What happened next, will be remembered by me for the rest of my life.  It stopped and it took a 90 deg angle back the other way.  Then stopped again.  It then took another 90 deg across the sky, stopped once again and ! then shot directly outward almost as if it shot straight to the right of the moon and dissapeared. I've seen my share of air shows and military jets perform..etc.  I've never seen anything this fast nor maneuver the way that this object did.  The thing I most remember, is when it stopped and turned back the other direction, I remember telling myself to clear my mind and focus on what I was seeing.  I did so, and remember my hair standing up on the back of my neck.  This was a great experience for me ans will never be forgotten.  I'm an engineer, a video gamer, an athlete, a dog owner, an uncle, a brother..etc  ...  But definetly not a nut job.  I saw what I saw (alien craft, meteor, new military plane) whatever it was..and have no problem explaining to anyone.  But, like most it seems, my sighting was short and now is gone.  I keep replaying the scene in my head so that I don't forget the specifics and most importantly so that I don't skew any of the facts.  As I want to remember as accurate as possible forever.

He said he is a friend of yours.  I also mainly submitted this, to see if anyone else had seen what I saw.  There were plenty of other people on the highway at the same time as me.  I asked a fellow co worker on the Hwy just moments after me if he had noticed the crecent moon, and he replied ""oh yes definetly"".  I kew he would because the size of the moon and the perfect shape was right over the highway and was a great view.  With the fact that the moon was hard to miss and everyone was most likely looking into the sky near it as I was, there had to be more people that saw this object as well.  I would love to know I wasn't the only one!!  Thank you for your time",2011-12-12T00:00:00,46.17882291666667,-119.16297812500001

I just got back from a run on the track of North Del Rio School Park in Sacramento CA.  At 1:14am Pacific time on 09-02-2011 I was on the north side of the track facing east (approximately 38.621686,-121.452999 according to Google).  I had just finished my run, and was looking up to stretch my neck. I was looking at the sky and what I saw amazed me.  From out of nowhere appeared three white lights clustered closely together in the orientation of a triangle pointing upward from my perspective. In the span of about a second, perhaps a little bit less, the three lights, maintaining their position relative to each other, streaked across the sky from south to north. The lights left a very bright streak of light across the sky.  Actually they left three distinct streaks, one from each light.  The streaks were very close together, and so they blended a bit, but I could still distinguish three separate streaks of light. It's difficult to gauge distance, especially since I am not sure how high up the object was in the sky. But it was close to the Big Dipper in my field of view, so I can say that it traveled about 2.5 to 3 times the width of the Big Dipper's cup.  It started about two cup widths to the south of the Big Dipper, and streaked north crossing the Big Dipper's cup then disappeared instantaneously.  The streaks remained in the sky just a fraction of a second longer, then also disappeared.  The three lights, and the streaks that trailed from them, where extremely bright; brighter than any star in the sky.  I would have taken this for some sort of shooting star, except that I could distinctly make out three points of light giving me the impression of thrusters, like those on the back of the Space Shuttle.  I would like to make clear that I could not see the shape of the craft, and I do not think that the triangular formation of lights represents the shape of the craft itself.  Rather I suspect that the triangular light formation represented the craft's propulsion component only. The shape of the rest of the craft is unknown. There was no sound, and it lasted just a second at the most. I continued to walk around the track for about five more minutes, but I saw nothing further of note in the sky, so I headed home. Once again, it's very hard for me to gauge size or elevation of the object, but the three lights occupied a space that would have fit in the circumference of a dime, or nickel perhaps, from my perspective. And if I had to guess, I'd say it would have had to be up around 18,000ft a least. If I'm right about the altitude, and I may not be, then the size of the object would have to be rather large to occupy the circumference of a dime. While the probability seems remote, since the phenomenon was so brief, I'd be very curious to know if anyone else has had a similar sighting.

On september 2, 2011 I was walking my 2 golden retrievers before retiring for the evening.  I was at the end of our drive way with one dog and had turned to look towards king about 3/4 mile away. We do see military as well as civilian aircraft at night as well as the occassional space station and other satelites sightings but what happened next, I had never seen before. Several evenings before I was out with the dogs and had seen the space station go over,kind of just plowing along in all its shiney silvery radiance. At 9:22 pm sharp I saw a bright redish orange ball of light heading from west to east along county road QQ .The night was rather hazy with broken clouds through which stars could be seen.The ball of light seemed to be traveling about the same speed that the space station travels when it goes over and even the local foundry jet appears to be going about the same speed visually as its going to land but why reddish orange ? The ball of light got pretty close to my location when it made a turn and headed due south and as it did the color didnt change it stayed reddish orange . At this time from over a willow tree in my yard another ball identical to the first one came over the tree,then right over me also headed from West to East and as the other object was now headed South,the one that just went over me now turned slightly and headed I would say in a south south East direction and also never changed in color as it passed over head.Niether one of the red orange balls made any sound at all ! At one point two cars headed west and I thought they would stop and watch but continued on into king. Having been a photo interpreter in the USAF during the 1960's and having also been stationed at a fighter wing I have seen hundreds of jets taking off and landing and many after burner runs and believe me.a fighter makes alot of noise,especially when they some times would take off two abreast. I couldnt make out any particular shape other than they were round reddish orange balls of light and the size was very similar to when you see a jet with its landing lights on coming toward you from perhaps3/4 to 1/2 then 1/4 miles. It struck me that it almost seemed like the lead ball of light had a wing man traveling about 1/4 to 3/4 miles paralell. It took a long time to finally get to sleep and I now see them in my mind constantly-Oh yes-I was shaking like a leaf and still am.Any clue as to what they were or where from is a mystery.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,44.3223,-89.1207

When I looked closer I noticed that it was also higher above the street lights and that it was hovering in the air independently.  At this point I drove past it and could no longer see it, but then ahead of me to the right, over the water I saw something else, at first I could only see reddish lights, but they were not blinking like the lights on a plane. It was also moving much slower, and was much lower than planes fly in that area.  It was moving slowly towards me and then at a certain point it flew across the road, a little ahead of me. It was low enough so that I could see it's shape. It was triangular, with red lights on each point and a white light in the middle. Then it flew out of view.  I don't know if it is important or not, but less than an hour earlier, the causeway had the most awful traffic. I was driving home from work and what usually takes 20 minutes took me two full hours.

Sightings in Candler, NC Multiple/Re-occurring U.F.O. Sightings -As seen by more than 4 people at once; some of which, are my neighbors-    I dated this report on 10/26/11 because this was basically the clincher after a few months of activity (starting around the beginning of August). I had been looking up every night since the very first time I saw; at night (around 1am), an orb of light that almost seemed to know that I was watching it.  Almost like it danced for me, and I couldn’t move while watching it.   I had my girl-friend come out and look after about 20mins, and we watched just as it zipped a further distance away gracefully.  The peculiar thing about its movement was mainly the vast distances it could achieve in a short time; the sharp angular movement that seemed to allow easy movement in 3-D. travel (in other words, they can go any direction fluidly), and without making a single sound. Up to this point I have seen in the area around Candler, NC: the visit of fast, slow, lingering, and bolting away night-sightings. During the day; only most recently, I have seen silver-like, oblong, and ""saucers"" (around 1pm-3pm).  This was what really made my heart race, I had finally found that they were in our atmosphere, and I got glimpses of their minute-long little strut.  Then they just go off, and even into clouds to never re-appear. Believe me when I say, I have been interested in the stars since I could look up, frequenting the high-powered telescopes as a youth. Never in my life have I seen any un-identifiable/irrational-anomalies that I could not disprove. Now I have many. After I started telling more people near-by, they tried to rationalize what I saw, but I put a sock in each of their mouths when I came knocking for them the hurry and run to see around the trees before they were gone. Everyone was stunned, and the all felt that same “awe” that I explained. The people I live next-to are the most skeptical people you could meet, and they had to tell me that they could not explain what they just had seen. So, the clincher tonight was a red orb being followed closely by a blue orb (maybe opposite at times). It/they moved very fast, turned a near 90-degree angle, and went over-head making no noise. The odd thing is, nearly half the time these things happen a non-commercial/unmarked plane flies near its’ trajectory. This time, there was a helicopter flying under it and making noise. The craft (or two) made that angle towards over my house, and the helicopter went off over the next ridge. As the craft/crafts went along and got closest to me, there was no noise at all. They/it soon went over another ridge. 	These have been frequent, and so much so that I sit outside in the cold every-night. It’s very hard to ignore it, and i just think that I should put it out there. This I merely a statement to tell whoever is listening, the Pisgah Mountains have unexplained orbs, crafts, and “saucers” in its’ skies. Increasingly.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,35.5119,-82.7037

One orange-ish red, the other blue-ish green. There was no other light so I couldn't make out a shape but these lights were not separate entities they were definitely both apart of the same object. At first I shrugged it off as an aircraft, turned the other way and finished my cigarette. 2 or 3 minutes later when I turned to go back inside I looked back to the North and the aircraft was still in the same location. I stood and observed it for another 2 or 3 minutes and watched as it seemed to hover in place. My next instinct told me because of the size of the lights, much larger and brighter than any of the closest stars, that it was at a lower altitude, and because of this and the fact it was hovering I assumed it might be a helicopter. However there was no audible engine noise which would be impossible for an Aircraft this size at this altitude. Unless of course I have serious hearing impairment which I do not. Another remarkable thing about this object was that the lights were near perfect spheres, no blurring, blinking, or flashing. Just nearly perfect luminescent spheres. Also the Orangeish and Greenish lights were the only lights I observed. No blinking lights on the belly or tail like you'd come to expect from a commercial or passenger Aircraft. Lastly the position of the object would've placed it between Forest Park and downtown Portland, in my opinion a precarious, and somewhat suspicious position for any conventional aircraft to be flying, especially considering it's somewhat low estimated attitude. To end, I'd like to add that I worked nearly 2 years as ground crew at Portland International Airport. During my time there I've worked on all types of aircraft from small commuter planes to Airbus 330's. I'd like to think of myself as fairly knowledgeable when it comes to identifying the various Aircraft the fly in and out of PDX. However I could not identify this as a conventional aircraft.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

It then dropped what could have been one hundred feet (more or less, as I had no idea how far away it was).  At this point, my friend and I were intrigued and I pulled over to the side of the road.  Again it hovered, but this time it looked almost as if it was spinning very fast and I noticed a gold tone within the red light. I put my car in drive and moved forward about 20 feet.

Important part is that it hovered in the exact same position for the majority of the 50 minutes.  I would guess the altitude at 15,000 feet.   We live along a landing approach to Hobby Airport in Houston so we often see speed of planes on approach to Hobby.  When this object moved away, it moved at at least twice the speed of typical approaching airliners.   When it did speed away, the object erupted in a number of lights, all along one straight line. Also of interest is that soon thereafter we noticed an airplane that seemed to be leaving Hobby Airport to the east.  The lights were blinking at a regular interval and were red and blue and easily identified as an airplane.

The ship was not moving like a flying object but appeared overhead and I was just somehow made to look upwards. Do that a lot to view the start anyway and just had a strange like feeling i was suppose to look up. There were no lights of any form i could see and there was no noise. The craft was not complete formed when i did look up and it just sort of materialized into a full form after about 1 minute. I continued to view the object and was in hopes of some contact with its crew if able and had a small laser pen light key chain in my pocket with keys. I made a few flashes at the craft which wasn't to me very high maybe 500 yard off ground. The craft is the same shape and appeared exactly as one before happened when I was in 7th grade. The one then did not reflect sun light as it was in day light and it was only there maybe 2 minutes. This one made me think maybe they came back to communicate as it was exactly like my first sighting as a kid.  Wasn't lucky I guess!  The craft did not reflect the laser light or even show a beam from the light such as a metal object will do.  The only thing different about this sighting is that the time was much longer and to me it was only like a minute or two but when I went back into the house my wife asked what I was doing so long.  I said i just went outside to check the property and fence to be closed and didn't realize that ten minutes had elapsed. I will assume i have had my second encounter with the same craft again now.  Sure wish I could get some form of contact with them.  Has to be a reason why i now have seen this twice in my life. Guess I will never know for sure the reason but then again I might be a lucky person one day and be taken to the craft someway and fly through space with whatever life form is piloting this craft.  They have to be very intelligent to develop such a craft for great distance travel.  I don't think i was abducted but I do think I was somehow being close to the craft and observed by the craft changed in respect to time dilation of some sort as It didn't feel like the length of time I watched the craft was that long.

There was a light colored torso and I believe arm, and head.

I noticed a large group of people (approx 10 or so) standing outside pointing at something and saying things like ""Do you see that?, What is it?, Look at that thing!""  I began looking out my window to make sure I wasn't about to hit something.  I could only see the houses on either side of myself.  As I turned right to go around the corner I had an unobstructed view out of my passenger window and I saw what was a bright orange glowing ball in the sky.  It appeared to be quite a ways away, but was very large and brightly illuminated.  It looked as if it was over the area of Hiwasse AR.  My first though was an airplane as XNA airpor! t is not that far away, but as I watched it I realized it was not moving.  Hovering in the air glowing bright orange, with no flashing lights that are the norm of an airplane.  It was like nothing I have ever seen.  I see airplanes often, I have watched satellites move across the sky.  None of these things are even close to what I saw.  It was round glowing fire ball.  A bright orange that would change to more of a burnt orange and back.  It then suddenly disappeared.  It didn't dart away, just disappeared.  I was so shocked that it didn't cross my mind to pull out my phone and take a picture or video. I was caught up in watching it and trying not to lose visual.  I pulled into my driveway and ran out into the road trying to find it again and it no where in sight.  I then noticed my neighbor out in her yard watching it as well. She had stepped out to let her dog out and noticed it.  She said she had been watching it for several minutes.  It was a glowing orange ball and she! said at one point it would dart away and then shoot back and ! hover. It did this twice.  At one point the orange glow went away and a blue beam of light came from it. It then flipped back to the orange fire ball color.  She watched it until it disappeared.  I have searched the internet and the newspapers trying to find reports of this and have found none.  I know what I saw and it was nothing that I have ever seen.  Not a plane, not a satellite, not a hot air balloon, and not a sky lantern.  I am hoping by posting here that someone else will confirm what I and at least one other person that I spoke to saw.  What I saw does match some descriptions of others from July 4th of an orange glowing ball that were in nearby cities from where I saw this one.

Minutes before 9:00 p.m. (Eastern) on Thursday, October 27, 2011, as I was standing in an open area in front of my home with my two dogs (one adult and a pup), I saw two brilliant, blinking red lights in the south-eastern sky traveling side-by-side (about 3 fingers held up apart) moving straight west.  The lights were more intense than night aircraft I commonly see and were easily noticeable.  The weather was cold and clear with no clouds, no moon, and the stars were bright.  I live in a semi-wilderness/rural portion of the central Upper Peninsula of Michigan, near Lake Superior. As the two lights approached, they at one point came together, close but did not merge, and flew in that position for about 10 seconds, then parted and flew side-by-side steadily as before, continuing west.  Curious, I waited to see green and/or white lights, such as would be visible on aircraft, but the lights only remained red and blinking.  The blinking lights were not synchronous. As the duo flew (to my south) and passed my position on the ground still heading west, I expected to hear the usual sound of a jet or motor or helicopter, but my ears picked up no sound whatsoever.  However, just after the lights passed me, my adult dog began to furiously bark and would not stop and my pup as well.  We do have wild predators in our location, so having a hand-held spotlight with me, I began shining the weeds and surrounding forest around us looking for ""eyes.""  That is when I lost track of the flying red lights, as they probably passed beyond my vision behind the spruce trees to the west.

There were three or four flashes about a second apart.  I checked for movement by using some nearby stars but it seemed to be stationary.

For three nights this week I have been watching some very interesting craft fly around in the south west direction of the sky from Penn Valley with a few of my friends. So far there are 3-5 craft that fly around in what looks like a big circle. We can see them brighter as they get closer and dimmer when they are farthest away making this huge circle and as they move they form a triangle several times. One night there were four and I saw them for almost 2.5 hours. Another time three of them were out and they have been out almost every night since late August. Tonight there were four of them again and they flew the same pattern for an hour. These are not aircraft.  They were filmed by Nevada City TV and I will have a CD next week. When zoomed in you can see some small orange and blue lights and you cannot see any exhaust of any kind, so they cannot be internal combustion engines. So, another option is battery power, but batteries are very heavy and I don't see how we could have anything that would keep flying for that long on batteries. So what power source? Could they be UFO's. You be the judge. They flash slowly with white light. The guy who filmed this from Nevada City TV was bit of a skeptic, but now that he saw them for 2.5 hours, he said - I don't know what they are. He zoomed in with his big camera and filmed it for about an hour and we could see a bit of orange and blue then, with mostly white light that slowly fades and gets bright in about 3 seconds. They are there every night at around 8:30 and stay for hours. There are ! always 2 and up to 5 flying around. I contacted Beale AFB and a Staff Sergeant in public relations was interested, and said she would ask around to see what they could be. I haven't heard from her yet but I did tell her anyone can come up and see them. A guy from Nevada City TV said he was going to see if he could get Sierra College to use their telescope to see them. I will be calling the FAA and Sac airport to see how they respond. These appear to be about 30-60 miles away. A video has been made and can be sent next week to investigators. Everyone tells me it is military but these are not in my opinion, even though they are flying right over Beale AFB.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,39.1866,-121.20109999999998

The whistling sound did resemble the tone of a birds whistles, but it sounded very large & had a slight guttural sound to it. Just to note, we did see 3 separate helicopters in the area after it was flying around for about 10 minutes.  Two of the helicopters left the area.

It was just above the tree line and was a very large craft.   As it moved past our house, he could see rows of diamond shaped patterns of! lights on the bottom of the ship.  It gained speed and moved away into distance.  We heard the sound of engines much like an airplane, but with a rumbling whine and wooshing sound.  We heard this sound for several minutes after the craft was out of sight. Our three dogs were very nervous and ran back and forth inside and then outside. Very upset. The entire incident took over 10 minutes.  I have never heard of a craft that large hovering for such a time and can't imagine the power it would take.

I felt a spontaneous need to go outside and purvey the night sky (this was at about 12:43-ish a.m.) right after brushing my teeth to go to sleep for the night. I walked out onto my roof, and within about two or so minutes or browsing over the constellations and various objects in the sky, something suddenly caught my eye. Three dimly visible pairs of white lights. About as dim as your average star in the sky - nothing especially bright, but not so, so dim that you really have to focus to see it. I was looking almost directly upward, and then somewhat towards the west. What I saw were three craft. Each consisted of two dim white lights at either end of what would be considered their wingspan. The eastern-most and middle craft were spaced about 1/4 to 3/8 of an inch (in terms of holding up a ruler against the sky) apart, with the western-most about 1/2 to 5/8 of an inch from the middle one. In terms of my viewpoint, they were arranged like so: top--middle----bottom - top being east, bottom being west. They flew basically northeast to southwest, possibly over the ley line labeled 8 to 16 in this picture: http://www.crystalinks.com/becker-hagensmap4.jpg   They flew at perfectly equal speeds to each other.  They were at an what I would assume was an incredible distance, as like I said, they were as dim as your average star in the night sky.  They traveled at what I would also assume was an incredibly high speed, given the distance I was viewing from. I stared for about 12-15 seconds, then turned around to look across to another apartment complex where two men were sitting on their balcony, curious if they were aware of the same thing (they weren't), and when I turned back about three seconds later, I was unable to re-spot the objects. These were absolutely not any type of stars or satellites, as there were three of them, all moving together across the sky at perfectly equal speed. They weren't human-built airplanes of any sort, as no human craft is even nearly capable of such absurdly high rates of travel. A military plane (what appeared to be a fighter jet, devoid of any flashing or bright lights [which you never see around here]) flew over at give or take three to five thousand feet in the opposite direction of the three UFOs about three to five minutes after I lost sight of them, so obviously someone at some level of authority saw the same thing I saw. I can't help but believe this is somehow connected to 10/28/11 being the end of the Mayan Tun calendar. My mind is blown.

It was around 8:00 to 9:00 pm in late July or August (don’t remember other than it was a warm time of year and in the evening and in New England so it had to be mid summer) and was getting dark out but still light enough to see details in all objects (trees, house and vehicles). I was in my car with my son (about 10 years old at the time) and we were backing out of the driveway, which slopes up from the house to the street. As I approached the street I saw this large saucer/disk shaped object hovering directly above (less than 100 feet) my house. My house was about 45 feet long and this object was a little larger than the house, so I would estimate it was about 60-70 feet in diameter. When I reached the street and backed out into the center of the road (this was a circular dead end street) the object moved towards me and again just hovered over my car. I opened the window and stuck my head out to get a better view and also to see if I could hear any sounds, ! which there weren’t any. I am a very mechanically oriented person (I worked as a mechanical designer at a model shop) and kept looking at the ship to see what is was and if I could detect anything that might indicate it was a hoax or some type of simulated ‘space craft’. The ship was a disk shape with a dropped central area on the bottom with windows all around the vertical surface. There was a soft green lighting effect inside as though there were lights coming from below the windows or back away from the windows, like you would get from lighted instrument panels. I could see seams on the outside surfaces defining the ‘metal’ panels that made up the skin of the ship. It looked just like a typical aluminum aircraft construction. There were no exterior lights that I could see from below. (At this point I am convinced this is a UFO type craft and started to look at the details.) The ship started to move away from me, following the street above the trees, and I proceeded to fo! llow it, all the time with my head out the window. I was movin! g at abo ut 10-15 miles per hour and kept up with it as it moved down the street.  I never heard any sound coming from the ship and it remained just above the trees, so I would guess it was still about 100 feet above the street level. I followed it down to the end of the street and then all the way to the end of the next street where it dead ended and the ship ‘shot off over the woods’ and disappeared into the night sky. I had heard from some of my relatives that it was seen about 15-20 miles away the next day near Mahopac, NY. I have been an office manager, mechanical designer and Security Officer for my company in Oak Ridge, TN for almost 30 years and did not want to ‘go public’ with this as I was concerned that it could affect my job and/or credibility in my position. After seeing and reading about so many reported sighting of UFO’s (lights in the sky and small blurred images) but never anything as close as my experience, I decided to tell my story now that I am retired and would like ‘let it go’.

This was a spot I had camped at several times, just off of Route 302.  I had always been there with others previously.  This time I went up alone, on a motorcycle. The campsite was in a wooded area, but by the river there was a clear view of much of the sky. It was probably the latter part of the evening, so it was dark.  No rain.  I think it was a reasonably clear sky. I went down by the river, maybe to get some water, and I happened to look up at the night sky, as I typically do.  I noticed a round white light.  It was maybe twice the size of any of the visible planets.  It was stationary, until it moved, with no acceleration, from where it had been to another point, stopping immediately with no deceleration.  This sequence repeated itself a few times over the next several minutes.  It was hard to tell how high the object was, because there was no way to tell how large it was.  It made no sound, but the river runs rather fast along this section, and is shallow and rocky, so the noise of the river may have muffled any sound.  Nothing other than this transpired.  No one else was at the site, so I couldn’t get anyone to corroborate.  It was getting late, and no new developments seemed likely, so I went back to the campsite and ultimately to sleep.  But I was wondering who else in the area may have seen this, so, the next morning, and the mor! ning after, I checked all the available newspapers, but to no avail.  I didn’t report anything myself to any authority, though I’ve told the story to various people over the years when I thought they’d be receptive.

The ships were traveling from West to East and took approximately eight seconds to pass completely overhead, until they became obscured by a row of large trees at the East end of our property. The three ships were flying in a V formation and were identical to each other in shape, size and color. They were shaped like birds; similar in shape to the dove logo used on ""Dove"" soap.  The  nose at the front of each ship was turned slightly downward, as were the wings; with one wing located at each side of each ship.  The tail on each ship was turned slightly upward and was slightly pointed at its tip.  The ships made no sound and there were no blinking lights nor any other colors; only the bright, glowing neon green color which emanated from the ships. The surface of the ships were smooth, like glass.  I did not see any windows nor any other markings on the ships. I pinched my left arm very hard to make sure that I was not dreaming as the ships passed over me.  After the ships passed overhead and behind the trees, I climbed down from the roof and ran to the West end of our driveway to see if I could get another look at them over the tops of the trees but they were no longer visible. I ran inside and watched the news on TV that night and also for the next three nights and checked the newspapers too but no one ever mentioned these ships.  I went out onto the roof every chance I could for the next week or so and stared off into the sky, hoping to get another look, but the ships never appeared again. I have never heard of anyone else seeing ships like these on any UFO show.  I also did not see anyone on this web site mention seeing this type of ship.  It's always the same: saucers, triangles, cigars, orbs and the like. A few days after my sighting, I remember speaking with my father about it.  I was frustrated that I hadn't seen any news story about this amazing event.  My father said that I must have been dreaming. But I know that I was not dreaming and that I really did see these ships.  I was not intoxicated in any way and I know that what I saw was real.  The sighting was not due to some sort of psychological trauma either. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time, I guess. Years later,  I thought that it was strange that the ships I had seen back in 1975 had a shape very similar to the Concord, which did not enter commercial service until 1976.  The Concord was designed to travel at supersonic speeds, with the most aerodynamically efficient shape.  How could I have known what that shape should be at the age of 13, without ever having seen the Concord?   Although the nose of the ships I saw were pointed slightly downward like the Concord, the wings of the ships I saw were quite different.  They were more like a bird's wings that arced downward, which were slightly pointed at the tips, rather than the horizontal/flat shaped wings of the Concord.  Plus, the ships I saw made no sound, glowed green and flew in a V formation, so I am sure they were not Concords. If anyone else saw these type of ships, I would love to hear from you, as I feel like a freak amongst UFO witnesses and that is a very sad thing.

This article will give you some information about my sighting of the ""Moon of Memphis"" and topics that the spirits talk and focus on.  This article may seem to some to be a UFO religion but the information is UFO evidence and spirit communications designed to integrate into your present beliefs and religion, not to replace them.   Hopefully this UFO sighting and news will improve your belief and devotion to God, other people, and all things living.  My UFO phenomenon began on the way to visit my grandmother in western Kentucky. We were riding north on Highway 51 late at night listening to the AM radio when we heard a news report of UFO’s seen in western Kentucky and western Tennessee. I looked out the back window at the stars above stating that I wish I could see a UFO. Twenty six days later I had my wish. I was back at home in Memphis when my mother asked me to take out the garbage at 10pm  Sunday 22 November 1964. I went out back and I looked up and saw a white full moon above then I looked around and to the east I saw an orange moon rising. I looked back above and noticed the white full moon shaped UFO again for a few minutes until it ascended in the sky looking like a bright star at high altitude. I believe this phenomenon was outside of my head and it was fantastic.  Since it appeared over the Holy Hills of the Frayser community of Memphis, I call it the ""Frayser Fatima"" of the ""Moon of Memphis"".  At 10pm 22 November of 1964 in Memphis Tennessee (USA), I was asked by my mother to take out the garbage. I went out back and I noticed a bright white full moon above. I looked closer and I noticed it had uniform whiteness with well define circular outline but I was not able to see the shades of white or grey that made the man in the moon face. It was equally as bright as the real full moon, bright enough to create a moon shadow. I looked around and I noticed another moon that was bright orange. This other moon was rising over our neighbor's house to the east, as I looked through the side yard from the back yard to the front. It had the features that created the man in the moon, so I believed that it was the real moon. I looked above and stared again at the white full moon for a few minutes, then it made a rapid ascend in the sky. I estimate the ascend speed between 180 to 300 knots.  As it rose, it became a smaller and smaller moon until it appeared to looked like a bright ! star, then a dim star, then disappeared into space. It reminded me of the Star of Bethlehem when it was at high altitude.  The event occurred within a mile of the Area 51 of Tennessee, that is near Highway 51 over the Holy Hills of the Frayser neighborhood of Memphis, Tennessee and the event lasted about fifteen minutes.  I was only seven when I witnessed this UFO that I now call the ""Moon of Memphis"". I had a good memory of the event so that when I was trained in the Air Force as an instructor navigator, I was able to analyze the event better with my aviation experience. I estimate that the ""Moon of Memphis"" was at twenty thousand feet and was about ten acres in size. I developed this information from watching the ascend of the ""Moon of Memphis"" through some high cirrus clouds that I estimate was at sixty thousand feet. At twenty thousand feet it would have taken four 747 aircraft parked in a circle to cover the area of the ""Moon of Memphis"" UFO, thus creating a ten acre size estimate. When it hovered above me and 10 ten degrees south, it was exactly the size and shape of the real moon when seen high in the sky.  Most observers probably could not tell the difference between the ""Moon of Memphis"" UFO and the real lunar moon when it's hovering above.   In 1964 the “Moon of Memphis” appeared at 10 pm 22 November over the city of Memphis. It was a night with two moons in the sky, the “Moon of Memphis” overhead and the lunar moon rising in the east. There is significance to this event because the timing of the event has biblical implications. First it appeared in 1964 which can be analyzed to derive meaning. If you take the alphabet and match the letters with numbers then you can derive a numeric number for words. I analyzed many religious words and I found two that are interesting. The English words ""Israel"", ""Zion"" and ""Jeshua"" decodes to 64 sixty four. Israel is a word that has meaning to the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religions. The word Zion is a word that means Israel and Jerusalem in particular. In Revelations of the Bible, there is writing about a New Jerusalem or a new Zion. Could the timing of the “Moon of Memphis” mean that it was God’s New Jerusalem or Zion?  ""Jeshua"" is the Messiah of Israel that was translate! d to mean Jesus Christ.  The day of the month was the 22 twenty second which added to 11 eleven for the month of November equals 33 thirty three which is a religious number for the English word ""Amen"" and the crucifixion date of Jesus was 33 AD. If you count the 22 November to 25 December, then you will have 33 thirty three days.  Twenty two is also the sum of the word ""Lead"".  If you take the numeric sum of the appearance date: 11-22-1964, you get 26 which is the sum of the words ""God"" and ""heal"".  Also, my birthday 11-04-1964 of that year also added up to 26 and will always be the sum of the ""Moon of Memphis"" appearance anniversary which helps explain why I was given the honor to view it.   Lastly, the decoded English word ""Mercy"" equals 64 sixty four.  The UFO event occurred at 10 pm. Ten coincides with the English letter “J” which could mean Jewish, Jehovah, or Jesus.  The sum of the word ""ten"" equals 33 thirty three, a number often associated with Christ.   If we added the 10 ten to the 64 sixty four then we would get 74 seventy four. Seventy four has some religious meaning. The English words ""Messiah"", ""Jesus"", ""Cross"", and ""Jewish""  decodes to 74 seventy four. Seeing meaning presumes that God intended for the year and time numbers to be added together. If we subtract 10 ten from 64 sixty four we get 54 fifty four. The English words ""Islam"" and ""Love"" adds up to 54 fifty four.  If you take the number of witnesses of the event 1 one and subtract 64 sixty four then you get 63 which is the sum for the words ""Saint"", ""try"", ""gentle"", ""agitate"", and ""Divine"". If you add the numbers of 1964, you get 20 twenty and if added to 64 sixty four you get 84 eighty four which is the decoded sum of the English words ""Savior"", ""evolved""! , "" Patmos"", ""forty"", and ""Charity"".   If you add 33 thirty three to 64 sixty four you get 97 ninety seven and the English words ""convert"", ""story"", ""buildings"", ""control"", ""sixty"" and ""Hinduism"" equals 97.  If you decode the English word ""November"" the you get 94 ninety four which is also the decoded sum of the English word ""respected""; if you add the 10 ten to 94 ninety four then you get 104 one hundred four which is the decoded sum of the English word ""Jerusalem"".  If you take the decoded sum of the English word ""Memphis"", you get 83 eighty three which is also the decoded sum of the English words ""percent"", ""prayer"", ""prepared"", and ""South""; and if you subtract the time 10 ten then you get the sum 73 seventy three which is the decoded sum of the English words ""Joseph"", ""children"", ""thanks"", ""nation"", ""living"", and ""Ezekiel"";  If you take the sum of ""America"" which is 50 fifty and add 33 thirty three you get 83 eighty three for the sum of ""Memphis"".  If you add my age at ! the time of the event 7 seven to 64 sixty four you would get 7! 1 sevent y one which is the decoded sum of the English word ""spirit"" and ""Temple"".  If you subtract my age 7 seven from 64 sixty four then you get my birth year of 57 fifty seven which is the decoded sum of the English words ""Moon"", ""Jews"", ""Bless"", ""Mary"", ""birth"", ""human"", and ""city"".  I hope this analysis can help you understand the religious nature of the ""Moon of Memphis"" appearance of God which seems to reach out to believers of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and others.   This witness of the event was born on 11-04- 1957 and 57 fifty seven is the numeric sum of the English word ""Moon"" and the English words ""Bless"", ""Mary"",  ""birth"",  ""city"" and ""Jews""  which suggest that we should bless Mary and birth city of Jesus the Christ and Messiah.  The sum of my birth date is 28 which is the sum of the word ""Eden"".   Also English may have been chosen because England equals 57 fifty seven.  If you take the difference between 64 sixty four and 57 fifty seven you get 7 seven which subtracted from 57 fifty seven you get 50 fifty that decodes the words ""America"", ""second"", ""lands"", and ""helped"".  If you take the sum 67 sixty seven of my last name ""Bickers"" which is also the sum of the English words ""trees"", ""West"", and ""work"",  and add the time 10 ten, you get 77 seventy seven which is the sum of the English words ""Christ"",  ""wrong"", ""Power"", ""character"", ""Taoism"", and ""Judaism"".   If you take the sum 79 seventy nine of my first name ""William"" which also d! ecodes the English words ""Nature"", ""hereby"", and ""Virgin"", and subtract the time 10 ten then you get 69 sixty nine which is the sum of the English words ""message"", ""animals"", ""redeemed"", ""people"" and  ""Jehovah"". If you add 10 ten to 79 seventy nine, you get 89 eighty nine which is the sum of the word ""religion"".   If you take my middle name ""Harding"", it decodes to 61 sixty one which is also the sum of the English word ""Church"". If you subtract the time 10 ten you get 51 fifty one which is the sum for the English word ""Thor""; and if you add the time 10 ten you get 71 seventy one which is the sum for the English words ""Zeus"", ""spirit"" and ""Temple"". If you take the sum of the neighborhood of the event Frayser then you have 92 which is the sum of the word ""reasonable"".   In addition, my initials WHB equals 33 thirty three and the English word AMEN equals 33 thirty three which is also associated with Jesus' crucifixion date (33 AD).  I am also 1/64 Native American (Cherokee).  ! Lastly the event was seen on a street called ""Leweir"" which d! ecoded t o 72 seventy two and it is also the decoded sum of the English words ""monks"" and ""world"". If you add the time 10 ten to 72 seventy two, you get 82 eighty two which is the decoded sum of the English words ""forgive"", ""Eastern"", and ""saints"".  If you subtract 10 ten from 72 seventy two then you get 62 sixth two which decodes to the English words ""gives"", and ""Think"".  These religious words decoded from my birth year and name may be factors in understanding why I was chosen to view the event and evolved into an UFO Prophet, Ambassador and Messenger of God.   Why was the city of Memphis chosen in 1964?    Several highways enter Memphis with interesting meanings and if you take the number, add or subtract the time of the event 10 PM to the highway number and match with the sum of words. Highway 64 and the event occurred in 1964 plus 64 decodes to the English words ""Mercy, Israel, focus, attend, never, and Zion""; If you add 10 to 64 you get 74 for the words ""Messiah"", ""objects"", ""abortion"", and ""Jesus"";  If you subtract the event time 10 from 64 you get 54 which decodes to ""Islam"", ""those"", ""Gabriel"", ""right"", and ""Love""; Highway 51 which like Area 51 can be suggestive of UFOs and 51 decodes the words ""Michael"", ""Indian"", ""saved"", ""Fatima"", ""avoid"", ""preach"", ""more"", ""Great"", ""Dixie"", and ""Catawba""; If you subtract the event time 10 from 51 then you get 41 which decodes to ""good"", ""fun"", ""gone"", and ""King""; Interstate I-40 which 40 decodes the word ""Buddha"" suggesting peace and harmony and the words ""Holy"", ""asked"", ""seek"", ""harm"",! and ""Maya""; If you subtract the event time 10 from 40 you get 30 which decodes to ""Peace"", ""Bible"", and ""due"";  Highway 70 and decodes to the English words ""Yahweh"", ""honor"", and ""Cherokee""; If you add 10 to 70 then you get 80 which decodes to ""Throne"", ""Creator"", ""values"", ""your"", ""miracles"", ""wildlife"", and ""religion"";  If you subtract 10 ten from 70 seventy you get 60 sixty that decode the words ""over"", ""mislead"", and ""believe"". Highway 57 and decodes to the English words ""Bless, Mary, Birth, City, Jews, Human"", and ""Moon""; If you subtract 10 from 57 you get 47 which decodes to ""Beast, Radio, Judge, obey, Isaiah, John, and Osage""; Interstate 55 and decodes to the English words ""Heaven"", ""Aztec"",  ""show"", ""part"", ""sky"", and ""Satan""; If you add 10 to 55 you get 65 which decodes to ""Seven""; Subtract 10 ten from 55 you get 45 which decode the words ""say"", ""Daniel"", and ""East""; Highway 72 and decodes to the street where the event was witnessed ""Leweir"" and the English words ! ""Judging"" and ""World""; If you subtract 10 from 72 you get 62 w! hich dec odes to ""Think"", ""first"", ""Comanche"", and ""tribal""; If you add 10 to 72 you get 82 for the word ""forgive"";  Highway 61 and  decodes to the words ""Church"", ""Roman"", ""sins"", ""coming"", ""homes"", ""UFOs"", ""Yankee"", and ""Navaho""; If you add 10 to 61 you get 71 which decodes to ""Catholic"", ""forget"", ""Moses"", ""advocate"", ""native"", and ""Pueblo"";  Highway 14 and 14 decodes to the English word ""Dead""; Highway 79 and decodes to the English words ""Nature"", ""should"", ""words"", ""your"", ""honored"", ""elaborate"", ""Cheyenne"", and ""Quapaw"";  If you add 10 to 79 you get 89 for the sum of the words ""hunting"", and ""honors""; If you subtract 10 from 79 you get 69 for the words ""Jeremiah"" and ""enjoy""; Highway 78 and decodes to the name of the Native Indian tribe of Memphis region, the ""Chickasaw"" and the words ""repent"", and ""enjoyed""; If you add 10 to 78 you get 88 which decodes to ""Woodland"", ""Sikhism"", ""peoples"", ""nothing"", and ""Ghosts""; Highway 86 which decodes the words ""Mounds"", ""insight"", ""waters""! , and ""souls"". If you add 10 to 86 you get 96 for the word ""opposes"".  These are most of the highways in Memphis and may be important clues relating to the ""Moon of Memphis"" UFO event.  The ""Moon of Memphis"" also represents the Great Spirit of the Chickasaw, Cherokee, Quapaw, Navaho, Catawba, Mounds, Osage, Pueblo, Woodland, Cheyenne, Comanche, Maya, Aztec, and other tribal Indian peoples.  Using many of the words decoded, this is a possible message:  To the peoples of the world, I William of the Divine God, the Holy Spirit, the Great Spirit, and the Good Creator greets you with this message and Fatima. The 1964 ""Moon of Memphis"" honors the Messiah Jesus Christ, the Savior in Spirit and the Virgin Mary, the Holy Mother.  Jehovah and Yahweh of the Jewish people of Israel and Zion gives thanks to Joseph, Mary, Jesus, the birth city of the Savior's spirit, the Cross, and Jerusalem. The  peoples of religion of Christ, Judaism, Islam, Taoism, Sikhism,  Hinduism, Buddha, the Great Spirit and more should show love, peace, honor, and charity as asked from your Good Creator of the ""Moon of Memphis"",  over America.   Also say a prayer, bless, and show mercy to animals; plus enjoy and forgive children . Trees and nature should also be enjoyed and respected.  Avoid the beast and harm nothing; if you do harm, be prepared to elaborate to a spirit.    Always love the message of Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Daniel, and Isaiah; plus the story of Mo! ses and of Elisha.  Obey the God and power of the ""Moon of Memphis"", which can think and radio to humans,  and is our Savior in Spirit.  Messiah Jesus Christ, the King on his thrown, is helped by those who preach, believe, and convert in the East, West, and South; by those who attend or lead a Bible Church, the Eastern Church, a Catholic Church or the Roman Catholic Church; and due to the work of saints, Saint Gabriel, and the Archangel Saint Michael.   Beware of Satan and in Heaven we are judging the living and the dead.  First repent of your sins, then the Jesus the Christ, your advocate, will forgive you,  forget your sins, and try to heal you.  Preach the gospel and seek insight on the Bible.  Focus on and believe in the words and values of the Messiah Jesus Christ. Saint John of Patmos was mislead; Jesus Christ, the Messiah and a part of God, was never gone so this is a gentle second coming.  UFOs are miracles of God. Abortion is wrong but birth control is right.  God ! opposes hunting wildlife for fun.  Monks should agitate huntin! g.  Use at least forty percent of your nation for native nature and wildlife.  The souls and ghosts of the living and the dead of animals, humans, homes, buildings, objects, lands, sky, waters, and trees of good or reasonable character of this world, respected by the Great Spirit, the Holy Spirit, and the Good Creator of the ""Moon of Memphis"" of 11-22-1964, are hereby honored, redeemed, and saved by your Divine God.  The “Moon of Memphis” was possibly the same object as the “Star of Bethlehem” but at a much lower altitude. The Book of Mormon states that a bright light appeared in the sky over Bethlehem. Was this the Star of Bethlehem at a much lower altitude like the “Moon of Memphis”? The “Moon of Memphis” ascended and appeared as a bright star until it ascended out of sight. The symbol of Islam is the moon and star. Was the “Moon of Memphis” trying to send a meaning to Islamic believers? At high altitude it appeared like a bright star reminding me of the “Star of David” or the “Star of Bethlehem”. It seems that the “Moon of Memphis” was trying to relay meaning to all of the religions of Zion; Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  The ""Moon of Memphis"" may also be trying to connect with those who believe in the Wicca religion or those who worship the Great Spirit in Native American religions, and Indian religions.  The rising to space of the Holy and white circular ""Moon of Memphis"", symbo! lically suggest the body of Christ being taken by God to the heavens as a communion act and evidence of Jesus Christ being accepted as a Lord and Savior of Earth.  If you see the communion wafer used by the catholic church, then you can imagine what the Holy ""Moon of Memphis"" looked like in the sky.  This event also suggest that the ""Star of Bethlehem"" appeared as a very bright star from a distance but appeared as a full white moon to the people directly under it giving a moon-like light to the community below and baptizing the people with the Holy light of God.  Was the “Moon of Memphis” a sign to tell the believers of all religions that they have a common God who is known by many names? Was it a sign of peace or the return of the messiah? Much change in the human condition have occurred since 1964 suggesting that it meant both a sign of the living God and his commitment to the earth to improve the world. Was the appearance over Memphis, Tennessee (USA) a sign that God has chosen that city as the New Jerusalem mentioned in Revelations of the Bible? This city may very well be a gateway to heaven. Something to think about if you really want your prayers heard. It might be a city worthy of a pilgrimage.  The message analyzed from this event seem to suggest that the event symbolized a common God of all religions, peoples, and life.  The “Moon of Memphis” is a sign, the lamb of God, of the return of the Messiah for it is written:  Revelation 21:23 “The city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it. The Lamb is its light.  Revelation 22:5; “There shall be no night there: They need no lamp nor light of the sun, for “the Lord God gives them light” And they shall reign forever and ever.  With the “Moon of Memphis”, the New Jerusalem will be made and with its power, the people will have light. This Holy city may not come about anytime soon according to scriptures, but the “Moon of Memphis” is proof that God can make good his promise to bless this new city with heavenly light not from the sun or the moon. Since the “Moon of Memphis” appeared over Memphis, Tennessee (USA) in 1964, it is possible that this city is similar to the New Jerusalem, an important city of God. The “Moon of Memphis” proved in 1964 to produce light as bright as the moon and I suspect that it could produce a much brighter light if it had to. It is a commitment to the earth to always be with us during good times and bad times. The “Moon of Memphis” is the lamb of God and also the Holy Grail or Holy light of Christ. Celebrate and be exceedingly joyous of the truth and existence of the “Moon of Memphis”.  As a seven year old boy, I was baptized by the light of the lamb, the Holy light of God.  In the Bible, Luke 24:51, “Now it came to pass, while He blessed them, that He was parted from them and carried up into heaven.”  This was the Ascension of Jesus and a phenomenon that I want to discuss. It is my assertion that Jesus went into something like the “Moon of Memphis” of 1964. The “Star of Bethlehem” which was similar to the “Moon of Memphis” had to of descended to a low altitude to be carried up into heaven. Though nothing was mention of a craft, the event suggests that such a event had to have happen for this to be true. As a witness the “Moon of Memphis”, I believe that the “Star of Bethlehem” was the same object as the “Moon of Memphis” and it actually took Jesus aboard so Jesus could establish his church and religion from celestial assistance. The success of the religion also suggest that a higher power and probably from what we now call UFO assisted Jesus as God in his mission. If this is what occurred then it would also suggest that the “Moon of Memphis” was the second coming of Jesus in the spirit. I believe that the Messiah,  Jesus Christ, returned to the earth in 1964 and we are li! ving in a new age of life.  God chose one individual to witness the return of the Messiah.  Jesus said in Matthew 5:8 ""Blessed are the pure in heart:  for they shall see God"".  Maybe the Spirit of Jesus of the ""Moon of Memphis"" felt that I was pure in heart as a seven year old boy.  Like the first visit to earth, the messiah chose a simple humble and meek way to make his return known. Also, the Messiah, Jesus Christ, had the privacy to work with humanity to make it more peaceful and comfortable. Most would have expected a more visible and public return but that would also cause many to resist change and expect instant success. God chose a seven year old boy to show his presence and return and much change has occurred over the past few decades. Glory to God and we welcome the return of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who returned in the ""Moon of Memphis"" in the spirit to be a partner to humanity and all life to make the world better. Amen.  The historic battle of Armageddon was probably the famous Six Day War of Israel in 1967.  This war fulfilled prophesy and it occurred just several years after the return of Jesus Christ's spirit, the Messiah, and other new Messiahs that came in the ""Moon of Memphis"" event.  Apparently Jesus knew that with the turmoil in the world and Middle East, He and other Spirits of God had to appeared or return to work with this earth to make it more peaceful.  The Cold War with the Soviet Union and China were also very serious concerns to God.  Many prayed to God and Jesus to help and their prayers were answered with the ""Moon of Memphis"" appearance and influence.  Maybe prophesy of gloom were indicators when Godly influence was necessary to help humanity.  Maybe every generation in need get their own second coming of Jesus or appearance and influence of God.  For this generation the 1964 appearance of the ""Moon of Memphis"" was our second coming of Jesus and coming of new generations o! f Spirits of God made from collected spirits from the best of God's creation and the best of humanity.  In the New Testament book of Revelations from the Bible, John of Patmos may have been mislead because of his association of disasters and end of the world in association with the return of the Messiah, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ had a good character and kind personality and his return has created a world that is more in tune with him as a Messiah and a Savior.  To believe that Jesus has not returned or has ever left the world is to believe that Jesus Christ is not a part of God.  The Divine God of many names and those who believe that Jesus Christ was gone did not fully understand his Divinity and constant presence on this earth both in word from the Gospels and in the Spirit as God.  The ""Moon of Memphis"" event is proof that God and Jesus Christ in Spirit is here on this earth and the true antichrists would make you believe that Jesus as a part of God was ever gone to begin with.  This is why John of Patmos vision may be a seed of Satan designed to make you fear Jesus Chris! t as a part of God or wish the end of this beautiful world.  God with Jesus Christ as the Son of God, known by other names in various religions, have worked hard to make this world better.   Do not be so vain as to think that humanity did it all alone without God.   We see the understanding and appreciation between nations and cultures; we see many nations dedicated to preserving peace and cooperation; we see much charity from many nations to other nations; we see animals receiving preserves and protection; we see kinder view of other religions; we see advancement in construction, science and technology; we see the human race living more comfortable and entertained; we see cooperation between nations to prevent and resolve issues of war;  we see remarkable improvement in medicine and health;  we see racial and sexual equality; and we see the advancement of food production. These are but a few of the many things that also truly mark the return of the Messiah for Christians and coming of the Messiah for other religions. A true sign of G! od, the ""Moon of Memphis"" is a sign that a kind God is with us and dedicated to all things living. Do not follow prophets of gloom, but understand that disasters are natural phenomenon that can not easily be predicted but we can overcome the trauma with our faith in a kind God and Messiah. The best of your religion will not fail you if you try to be kind in every way and not lose reverence to our kind lord, our God.  Since I was fortunate enough to witness the appearance of the light of the lamb, the ""Moon of Memphis"",  God and Jesus Christ love the world so much but understand the need for some to have the Revelations prophesy of John of Patmos fulfilled so the prophesy was completely fulfilled within the mind of me, William of God.  Within my mind was a world or earth that the spirits had made and everything that Revelations said would happen, did indeed happened according to scripture and prophesy.  I read Revelations in the New Testament and some of the events were in the physical world like visiting Whitehorse, Yukon twice without understanding the scripture significance of the White Horse.  Other event occurred with spirit visions in my mind that I could see and monitor.  This completed the Second Coming events of Revelations and allowed God and Christ to work with the world and earth of those who had not witnessed the Second Coming event of Jesus to use character, logic, reason, a! nd grace to help humanity to improve the world and work to make a heaven on earth for as many people and earthlings as possible.  The activities of God and Christ continues to this very day working with the spirits and humanity to make a peaceful and wonderful world for all life both physical and spiritual.  Minutes after this paragraph was added to this article, I heard a loud boom and power was cut from my residence and neighborhood at 1507 or 3:07 PM this clear sky Friday 18 November 2011.  By using his power to affect the transformer, God is saying that he is powerful and a transformer of life.  In 1990 at age 33 thirty three,  I was traveling to Washington, D.C. to my next assignment at USCG Headquarters.  I was on a highway from Florida north to Washington D.C. when I decided to say a prayer to God to help me on my next assignment.  At the moment that I said ""AMEN"", something happened.  My fingers were froze in the extended position and I went blind for almost my total vision. I could see just a little through a small tunnel and the rest of my vision was red.  It was just enough vision to get off the expressway where I stomped the brakes and waited fifteen minutes for my vision to return and my fingers to return to normal.  The phenomenon could have been a strike of lightening or it could have been just a mind phenomenon but when my vision and movement of my fingers became normal I was able to hear the voices of angels.  At age 33 thirty three the spirits of the Lord started to speak with me after being blinded for fifteen minutes after a prayer to God. The spirit gave revelations to me and in 1997, 33 thirty three years after the event,  a color vision of ""Jesus Christ"" appeared to me. Jesus talk many days with me about life on the earth and problems that exists with all of God creations.  Christ basically said God wanted humanity to be more reverent to all living beings and animals. The consciousness of each being or animal is precious and must be respected more. Before animals are killed, they should receive anesthesia and be put into a deep sleep. Anything less is cruel, heartless, and disrespectful  to animal rights and  to God.  Humanity should find a way to eat without killing animals, but until then, we must not kill an animal while it is awake. Treat innocent animals as you would like to be treated if you were in their place.  Many species of animals have a covenant with God that if! they are well protected and allowed to become numerous with the help of humanity,  then they will give their life when required to help humanity and earn a right to live in the heavens made for them.  At times some species are favored over humanity to help them, protect them, and increase their numbers.   If you put a human brain the form of most animals they would probably act as the do now.  To have dominion over other living creatures or animals requires that you treat them as you would like to be treated and that should be with kindness and mercy to avoid God's judgment or wrath against you.   The ""Moon of Memphis"" is proof that God does exist and we should obey Christ's message for us to be more kind to each living being and animals.  Each species of animals have their own lifespan which also dictate the time necessary for the young to be raised.  During their lives they have challeges that require much intellect.  The challenges of finding food, of social behavior, of mating, and of parenting their young.  Many species show much success, devotion, and intellect compared to many humans that exist in this world.  Though they have a smaller brain, they seem capable of showing human-like intellect.  This is because they have a God that assist them like humans or they somehow have human spirits in their minds.  God must create mind waves that help animals in a similar manner as God helps humans.  Because they have a God influenced mind from everything that exist, they must be revered more.  Human bigotry against animals is a form of prejudice that causes many humans to be heartless against them and for other humans as well.  If God shares it's mind with other forms of life, then do you think that God respects! those who seem to be insensitive, heartless, or cruel to other God influenced life.  An animal with a shorter life span probably values it's short life even more than humans.  It's life is precious and many religions totally ignore the santity of life of other earthlings to the point that they disrespect and get cursed by their God that suffers in these other harmed earthlings.  Those that connect true character with the respect and reverence of every form of life will be blessed, those with careless prejudice engrained through culture and religion will find their lives afflicted with pain and sorrow.  Nature is not dead in the mind but a very conscious and active God-like mind that will make life and death decisions based on the management of the various species.  Will the grim reaper think that you as an overpopulated human a kind credit to earth and it's many species or will you have to be weeded out with bad luck, disease, or spiritually warfare because of your heartle! ss closed mind to other living kinds of life.  If you neglect ! to learn from this article, then you many suffer a fate with a delusion that God doesn't truely exist and then suffer the consequences of nature.  If you are wise then you will learn that everything that exist is alive in its own frequencies and probable have a human or God like intellect that must be respected which includes each species of animals, trees, structures, lands, and even sky.  Jesus' birth in a wooden manger full of animals represents the specialness that Jesus' mind and nature had in common with the other special creatures of the earth; the animals and the trees.  His mission of salvation was meant for all things and life of the Earth and God.  He died to show us what was happening to the animals and trees who were very alive and needed humanity's love and understanding.  They needed help, respect, and salvation.  True salvation comes from understanding what God and Jesus was trying to tell humanity and only by kindness, respect, love, and avoiding harming these creations and life can God and even Satan give you peace.  Through the Christ power, the mind and spirit of trees, land, waters, and good animals have God's power and dominion over humanity and lesser spirits and lords to protect and preserve nature and require mercy and spiritual equality with humanity.  Jesus' suffering, death, and resurrection helped Jesus Christ to experience and unde! rstand what all life that is sacrificed and harmed experienced thus helping him as Lord and God to minister to the life that suffers and to strengthen his resolve to protect better and defend the life of animals, trees, humans, or spirits.  To avoid curses, retribution, and suffering, you must not harm anything because any harm has a price upon humanity and yourselves.  Those with a true love for Jesus and those he represent will find forgiveness and salvation; however, as he once stated, ""what you do to the least of mine people, you have done unto me"".  The manager full of animals and wood of trees with Jesus born to their witness reflect the people of Christ needing salvation and appreciation.  The enemies of the living things and creatures of earth; humanity and their spirits, also needed salvation for their sins against others that they harmed for their needs. Jesus showed the peoples of Christ how to face death, forgive those who harmed and killed you, and the miracle ! of resurrection by God that will be given to those good beings! who are sacrificed by God and humanity.  The Communion is remembering and honoring not only Jesus Christ but all life that is sacrificed for humanity and God's will for this world.  God wants people to be at peace with those who worship God in other religions. If a person or nation is reasonably kind regardless of their understanding of Allah or God, you should be friends with them. Do not war or jihad against reasonably kind and friendly individuals or nations. Work within yourself to be kinder and a better example of kindness to others and to animals. God’s character of kindness is true so do not follow those who urge you to harm or terrorize. God blesses any belief, religion, or culture that teaches kindness to others and to animals. Those who are mean spirited and cruel are not blessed by God and do not be deceived or lead by such individuals or organizations.  God believes that he has been fair in sharing the lands of Israel and Palestine. He believes that the followers of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are the chosen people or Jews. Each is a religious belief of Jews of Allah or God with Holy books to learn of Allah's or God's will for you. Since Christians and Muslims are also Jews, Allah or God have allowed the religious and peaceful individuals access to these Holy Lands. Anyone near the Holy Lands of Israel or Palestine who is not a kind peaceful person will be cursed by God or Allah for violation of the peace and good will that God commands for all the Jews - the Bible Jews, the Koran Jews, and the Torah Jews.  God kept his promise to give the lands of Canaan to the Jews and he has done precisely that.  The Lord God asked Noah of the Bible and Torah to take care of wildlife.  The spirits of the Lord of the ""Moon of Memphis"" wants you to also help animals and plants and give land back to wildlife.  If you own a large section of land then give at least 40 percent to the wildlife.  Forty was chosen because it would create refuges all over the country side for the wildlife and plants to flourish and survive.  The word ""Buddha"" equals 40 and he would say 40 percent would make the most peace and harmony.  Forty is also associated with Jewish and Christian religions.   If you own small parcels of land then serious consideration should be given to allow the land go wild.  You can even plant some fruit and nut trees to help feed the wildlife.  If the animal has wings, then they must be Angels of Nature.  If you have a city or town lot and home, then try to feed the birds or angels to receive a special blessing from the Lord.  Your offering to the creatures of God in the form of food! and land will ease your spirit and soften your heart to all matters concerning life.  Your health will improve and you will receive blessings from God and you will help make amends for the sins that you want forgiven.  Many human illnesses, war, sin, and crime are caused when the spirits and God of land, fields, waters, trees, and animals war against humanity for cruel conduct against them.   Wildlife enjoy their life of freedom and it is possible for your spirit to be put into wildlife as a form of heaven for those who appreciate living free with nature.  Others may be required to live in animals minds that you harm to evolve your spirit to respect life more.  Many wild animals eat poisonous plants including agricultural plants with herbicides and pesticides, and have viruses that can contaminate your home so eating wild animals can cause you to have toxins and little known diseases that can cause shorter life spans.  Many small animals that rarely cause a problem to humanity or habitat should be protected like songbirds and never be hunted or killed by humanity. Natural predators other than humans should be allowed to affect them.  The wildlife covenant with God is to accept  a merciful ! move or possible death by God or humanity, when their numbers become too many and causing  significant harm to humanity or habitat, rather than a slower death by predators.    God tries to preserve their soul,  grant them land to live, and give their spirits good safe heavens such as in the minds of comfortable humans, other animals, land, trees, or sky.  What humans do to other earthlings will affect what the God mind in any geographic area does to humanity.  Hunters each year go to the wildlife areas to commit massacres of tribes of earthlings and cause their spirits to legitimately war on humans.  They can cause all kinds of mental and physical illnesses due to the trouble that hunters cause.  If you think that hunters have a God given right to murder other earthlings without retribution, then you are seriously wrong.  You should show God that you are reverent to all that God has made such as birds, animals, trees, and plants.  God will respect you more and love you mor! e if you can help the Lord take care of the other creations of! life.  The Bible, the New Testament, and the Koran speaks of phenomenon occurring when a tree is bothered.  The scriptures suggest voices and wrath could occur when trees are harmed.  The spirits of the ""Moon of Memphis"" suggest that since there is much electricity in a tree, it is possible for trees to think, dream or possess a form of consciousness recognized by God.  Trees may be a plant animal so be careful when harming a tree.  If it has nerves then winter is the season to prune them so they will not feel pain and curse you.  Cutting a tree at night may cause less pain since their consciousness are possibly stimulated by sunlight.  If you must cut wood then use the wood in a structure so the weight of the wood can reorganize into a acceptable consciousness and thus you will be cursed less.  Pray for your trees and pray about cutting them and if you feel it is wrong then don't cut them or harm them.  Show reverence to trees and save yourselves.  The parents who have children must apply kindness and justice to their discipline of children.  Never beat, hit or  whip a child just because they get on your nerves.  Harsh punishment and training should be reserved for the most malicious, cruel, or mean conduct. Evil conduct is dealt with more sternly than nerve troublesome conduct and honest mistakes should be dealt with a understanding, kind response. Do not be cruel to your children or you will be surely be cursed and many phenomenon of health could occur to you for cruelty.  Do not forget that as you want the Lord to forgive and give mercy to you, when a sorrowful child cries out for forgiveness and mercy, you represent the Lord and should not let your temper ignore your heart of kindness.  The spirits of God, Christ, and Allah the “Moon of Memphis” say that most rebellion and crime in most nations is the result of government failure to fulfill its role to its peoples. This can be discrimination against some segment of the population such as minorities or peoples with mental and physical disabilities.  In the more modern nations, minorities have rebelled and sued the government for equal rights and opportunities. Presently in most of the countries of the world the disabled have difficulty getting help in a timely manner. Disabled people, those with low learning abilities and mental disorders plus those with physical disabilities have been forced to suffer or forced to engage the sale of drugs and prostitution to sustain themselves to survive when the neglected by government and uncaring majorities. Government has a duty to provide the disable with a healthy pension or job so they can live a normal life and live a peaceful life free of crime and rebellion. The i! mprisonment of the disabled in most world countries by naïve and uncaring governments constitutes a gross civil rights abuse and cruelty. It is a violation against the duties of government and God to neglect and abuse the disabled and those who continues to ignore the disabled and abused them will be cursed by God and they will suffer mental and physical illnesses and bad luck from the spirits of God, Christ, or Allah.  In your memory of people you know, your mind makes spirits patterned after them. Sometime these spirits are loyal to the person they are patterned after. If you talk bad about a person then that person's spirit sometimes work against you by giving you bad subconscious advice and emotions and may be able to affect your mental and physical health. If you behave poorly, they may turn against you because you have lost their respect and love. If you keep bad friends then these poor or bad spirits may behave like your friends, saying things in your mind subconsciously to cause you to make poor decisions and make trouble for other people. You must not gossip or talk bad about others, especially against those you know closely and you must not get to know bad character individuals if you are weak in moral or law abiding behaviors. From watching television, you can even create spirits of people in the media or government. These spirits represent society and if you don't act right, the! y too can turn against you and make you ill. Everyone's mind makes spirits but most of the spirits influence the subconscious mind. Some people are disabled because they hear these same spirits in their conscious mind and sometimes they learn how to make changes in their lives and get along with them. Spirits are a fact of life but the Spirits of God are made from the ""Moon of Memphis"", the Earth, and from spirits that are especially good and kind; often influenced by religious texts of kind religions.  The spirits of Earth and sky can communicate with the spirits of your mind to influence your mind and body for various reasons and can create structured realities to affect you in usual positive ways but occasionally to bring you bad luck for something you have intentionally or accidentally harmed on this Earth.   The spirits of the land, trees, animals, humans, and sky can collect in the sky and make a glowing UFO that can be many acres in size and create light. Like phenomenon of dreams created from smaller size spirit matter in the brains of animals, in the UFOs, they can hover in space above a city or country and produce radio that is of good quality and very similar to human made radio. This is why some of the music and radio messages seem to be talking to what is on your mind because the spirits inside your head receive the signals also and guide your thoughts. These thoughts are designed to make you kinder, understanding of others, and forgiving to make you better and help you overcome negative thoughts planted from less honorable information given to you by other humans or human spirits and media sometimes behaving as the devil or Satan who may want you to be prejudice against others or act in a way that could cause you to harm others or become harmed. Listen for the kind thou! ghts and kind messages from God's UFO radio in words or music and receive security and wisdom from God.  This information is derived from analyzing the ""Moon of Memphis"" UFO phenomenon and radio phenomenon associated with God's spirits and voice phenomenon. Since the UFO produces light, there is no logical reason that would prevent it from producing radio and my personal experience strongly suggest that this capability exist.   The God of the ""Moon of Memphis"" would like the youth and adults to focus on character traits to improve themselves as citizens of this world.  The international scouting organization have focused on twelve traits and have lead this living witness to learn and live by them.  They are trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.  Your religious leaders, parents, community leaders and teachers may have other good character traits that you should also focus on to improve yourselves and be a honorable citizen of your community and God.  As Will-i-am of God,  a son of forests, fields, deserts, tundra, waters, land, sky, and cities,  I have asked the good Spirits of God of the ""Moon of Memphis"" to save the people of this world with good character and kindness to all earthlings.  They include the animals of Nature, food animals, trees, objects, structures, land, waters, sky, humans, spirits, God, and other forms of life.  These Spirits of God of the ""Moon of Memphis"" said that they would save them and try to bless them.  They ask the saved to help other people to develop good character and kindness to all earthlings so they too may be saved by the God of all kind religions, the God of the ""Moon of Memphis"" that appeared in 1964 to this honest living witness.  The God of the ""Moon of Memphis"" chose a boy named William to appear to because his name means ""protector of the weak and innocent"" and God of the ""Moon of Memphis"" also tries to protect the weak and innocent. The good spirits of the ""Moon of Memphis"" hav! e the power to save.  Jesus Christ is one of the good Spirits of God of the ""Moon of Memphis"" who also saves. In Matthew 5 of the New Testament of the Bible he says:   3aBlessed are the bpoor in spirit: for theirs is the ckingdom of heaven. 4Blessed are they that amourn: for they shall be bcomforted. 5Blessed are the ameek: for they shall inherit the bearth. 6Blessed are they which do ahunger and thirst after brighteousness: for they shall be filled. 7Blessed are the amerciful: for they shall obtain mercy. 8Blessed are the apure in bheart: for they shall csee God. 9Blessed are the apeacemakers: for they shall be called the bchildren of God. 10Blessed are they which are apersecuted for brighteousness’ sake: for ctheirs is the kingdom of heaven.    These verses show, for example,  some categories of people that the Spirit of Jesus of the ""Moon of Memphis""  saves regardless of their beliefs or religion as long as they have learned to be good and kind.  The Spirit of Jesus of the ""Moon of Memphis"" appreciates the groups and churches that teaches his ministry and lessons devoted to character and to God.    God of the ""Moon of Memphis"" is not responsible for many natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornados, floods, droughts, and earthquakes. God is also not responsible for accidents and acts of violence but God can help you a little and maybe that will be enough to protect you most of the time.   You are loved by the Lord, our God, and God is dedicated to recreating many of the dead and injured by these disasters, accidents, and violence.  Do not be demoralized by them for the Lord cares about you and want you to not be harmed.  We may sense reasons for the disasters because there are many sinners in the communities but God prefers to work with sinners on an individual manner and chooses not to use disasters to harm a few individuals at the expense of the many.  God prefers and is limited sometimes to helping you by affecting your thinking so listen up to your conscious and subconscious mind for good advice to improve your safety and security. In addition, God of the ""Moon o! f Memphis"" uses its spirits to organize society to create schools, religion, industry, science, and government systems to improve society's behavior thus creating as many decent well behaved and helped citizens as possible to minimize suffering, dangers, and crime.  The spirits of the “Moon of Memphis” have moved me to comment on various topics. God wants you to pray to the Lord about your problems and hopefully, these comments will start you in that direction.  God  please help the hungry. If you are hungry and suffer, God will take away your pain in time. Those that feed the hungry will be blessed for their kindness.  Do not do evil while you suffer and the Lord will recreate you in better times if you stay honorable and endure faithfully.  God please bless the poor and improve their condition. If you are poor, do not do evil to sustain yourselves. God will try to improve your community if you live honorably and try to improve yourselves. If you die poor, God will try to remake you in more successful families so do not give up hope because this lifespan will one day end and you will get a new beginning.  God please heal the mentally ill. The Lord knows that you are suffering and do not give up on life. It may take a while for the Lord to help you but he is searching for people like you. If you perish, God will give you a new mind in your next life on this earth.  God please heal the physically ill. God will try to heal you with doctors and religious people. You may try to prepare yourself for you disability or death by being kind in every way imaginable. End the conflicts in your life and mind and know that you will one day inherit a new body and spirit.  God please help the lonely.  May your God open your mind and speak to you.  Avoid finding fault in others and be helpful to others and you will find friendship and love.  Do not give up your life to evil and harmful conduct and the Lord will bless you and you will not be lonely for a long time.  Try to improve your heart and character so others will like you better.  God please help the desperate men and women.   May you find each other to help each other with love and gifts of love to sustain you.  If you cannot find work then with your consciousness and God as your guide, try helping each other without being cruel and heartless. Be honest and honorable to those who befriend you to help you.  Do not have contempt in your hearts to others and they will sense your kindness and will help you with your needs.  God please bless the elderly and widows.  You are special people weakened by age and the loss of your love ones and friends.  Those that help you with friendship and love will also be blessed with God's friendship and love.  Make peace with your family and receive their considerate love and care.  God will one day welcome you to new dimensions of life so you must prepare by being full of grace and kindness.  God please stop the evil sinners. If you are a evil sinner then your fate cannot improve unless you immediately repent and follow a better behaved spirit. You will have much bad luck until you change to a kind decent individual. You cannot have peace in your mind until you change. If you are captured and imprisoned, then know that the Lord will work with you to help your bear your punishment honorably. If you must die for your sins and crimes, the Lord will try to help you live again in better circumstances so that honorable life will be easier to live.  God please help me to deal with enemies.  To love your enemy you must try to understand their culture, mind, and perspectives. From this understanding you can try to reconcile your differences with them. Examine yourself to see whether or not you are a good being or people. Correct your own culture, mind, and perspectives before acting against others or for God. War with your enemy only to defend yourselves and help God to stop their evil against yourself and others. If your enemy is generally good, kind, and honorable then lend yourself to their influence and love your enemy.  God please bless the dead. Do not grieve excessively for the dead for they are in God hands and they will be dealt with in a fair manner. The weak will be strengthened and the righteous will be rewarded. Others will be remade on this earth in better times and conditions. Rejoice to the wisdom and fairness of God.  God thank you for the blessed. If your life is good then try to be an honorable example of kindness. Your luck is intentional so you can carry the spirits of the less fortunate in your minds. Many lives have hoped to live in the minds of the blessed so enjoy your life and remember others that you share reality with. Charity and kindness should be your passion.  The spirits of the “Moon of Memphis” stated that billions Messiahs will be born on the earth. Some have already been born and are now youth and adults. These Messiahs will be from all the nations, all kind religions, atheists, most animals, and spirits. They will have much character and kindness to all earthlings.  They will be both male and female and they will be Holy.  These Messiahs will be of religion, science, industry, government, military, parenting, business, medicine, entertainment, land management, food production, judiciary, construction, charity, and many other fields and occupations.  Look for these Messiahs for the Lord has returned to the Earth to rule and assist this world. You will know the Lord by many names but the fulfillment of prophecy will occur. This world was visited in 1964 with the “Moon of Memphis” a sign of the spirits of God, messiahs, and prophets. They do have the Christ or Messiah mind that they radio into the minds of the good and kind of t! his earth. The Holy light will be visible by those who are fortunate and the kind spirit will be heard by those who are blessed; and they will be living witnesses of the return and presence of the Lord, our God.  The Revelation from the Christ of the “Moon of Memphis” explains how we will live again on this earth. We never die on this God blessed planet because it has life and it has a soul. The soul is everything outside the body that influences the brain to recreate the mind of a human. That is geography, language, history, religion, culture and species. These external factors create the mind and consciousness and will recreate you after you die. You pop out of life when you die and you reenter life by the ""conscious creating soul"" within a short period of time. You will probably have amnesia of your past life but you will certainly have consciousness again. If you made the world better and safer in your past life then you will come alive again in a world that you help create.  When God is at rest or allowing the natural world to recreate you then you have the phenomenon that was mentioned in the previous paragraph. God can collect your spirit by setting off a radio in your brain when activated by signals from the ""Moon of Memphis"". This would probably occur day or night when the ""Moon of Memphis"" is high in the sky or space above. When hovering it would be hard to tell whether it's the moon at low altitude or a star at high altitude.  When God wants you to be held accountable for your actions or if God wants to give special consideration to your spirit for it's accomplishments then you may experience unique mind phenomenon. Your spirit collected can allow God to do things to you in your afterlife. Heaven and Hell are two places that your spirit can go. It is possible for God to put your spirit in other people or in animals to help you understand them and their plight. If you are insensitive to others then God may recreate you in beings that you care little about. It's God's justice and you sometimes must evolve through those you don't care about. These might be animals that you harm or people that you cannot understand or help.  If you are a good influence then your spirit may be able to enter the minds of those you prefer.  Worship God, Christ, and the power of the ""Moon of Memphis"" and may God bless and have mercy on your spirit and soul.  Because animals have the goodness and kindness of nature, they should be never be harmed.  They have a lifestyle that humanity needs to respect and understand.  They must be allowed to roam the land without being molested or murdered.  God places the spirits of humanity often into animals as a heaven that some want or deserves.  If you grant the animals peace then your heaven will have peace but if you violate the heaven for animals by molesting their habitat and murdering them for fun and recreation then you will have to answer to God.   A good and kind heaven requires humanity to respect nature, the lands of nature, and the animals of nature, for the trees will be the pillars of your church called nature and in the minds of animals you will return to the garden of Eden, one type of heaven.  The UFO phenomenon may be the result of a natural intelligent life form that scientist have yet to understand and explain. I will offer one theory of how the UFO is formed and why they are of an intelligent life form associated to God.  I believe that there is a structured electro magnetic nuclear form that exist in space that absorbs light energy and it is a stable form made from light photons that no longer travel and other energy that no longer travel or move. It has a fabric or form that enables it to organize as a brain and store memory and information. It is an energy or spirit life form that collects and grows from light and energy. Over time, matter starts forming within it so it basically helps energy to reform into matter. It probably starts out is life span as a marble size intelligent life and grows into much larger size and eventually becomes meteors, comets, moons, planets, and stars. During it smaller youth size, it can enter there atmosphere and also enter to objects such as land, plants, animals, and clouds. Its can give consciousness to anything that it enters and in humans, it can cause people to hear voices of spirits and produce dreams. In trees, land, and clouds it also can produce int! elligence and phenomenon that is often associated with God.  These wisps of spirit energy beings can learn and affect other life in good or bad ways. These energy matter beings can also be religious or atheist in their outlook of themselves and humanity. They can come together, form large bodies of spirit energy matter beings, and form into impressive UFOs and start to glow from these collectives of spirit energy matter beings. Since they are intelligent, their collective can be organized into large multi-acre starships usually round in nature that can travel in the atmosphere or space. If they want to they can travel to other stars and disassemble and influence the mind of a planet and act as the God spirits to the life there. They could just find a star and grow to such a size to precipitate star energy into matter and form a planet. Other collectives can also in coordination with other collectives form into moons for the planet. This is how the spirit energy matter beings can influence reality and act as a conscious God to form pla! nets and UFOs.  If your mind has this type of spirit energy matter being in it, you probably are influencing it to create a spirit within it patterned after your consciousness and personality. If you die this being will probably leave your brain and carry your spirit to another location. It might take your spirit to a collective called heaven or maybe into a UFO or even choose to enter the brain of another person, animal, or other objects such as land, trees, or clouds. Great opportunities exist for those who are lucky enough to have one of these energy matter spirit beings in your brain.   If you want to signal the ""Moon of Memphis"", then put color lights on your front and back porch and color lights in your windows and light it every night for months and years. This will get God's attention as you stand out in the night and you will probably notice more dream activity. I have displayed color lights at my house for several years and it really works. This will help you get your spirit collected without harming the flesh and provide more peace and security to your mind as your lights call out to God for attention, love, and help.

Notes about author: I have worshiped in many churches such as Baptist, Methodist, Lutheran, Episcopal, Pentecostal, Assembly of God, Anglican, Catholic, Presbyterian, Church of Christ, Church of God, Military, TV and Mormon churches.  I believe that worshiping with others help you overcome prejudices and become one with the body of believers.  I also believe that every kind religion is another testament of God and much can be also learned of God by studying other religions.  I have visited some other countries and lands over my life.  The places that I visited are:  United States, Canada, Mexico, England, Scotland, Spain, Guam, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and the Bahamas.  I learned that we are very much alike all over the world.   Please show this article to your friends, family, and religious leaders if you could be so kind.  Everyone deserves to know about the ""Moon of Memphis"", the appearance of the Messiah.  Other evidence of a God both outside of my mind and inside of my mind is a piece of land that I bought at age 19 which just happen to be 6.4 acres of land that I bought to give back to God by allowing it to go wild.  It is my little Israel or Zion on the floodplain of the Loosahatchie River bottoms near Firestone city park of Memphis in Frayser.  This river is 64 miles long by the way which may be another reason the  1964 ""Moon of Memphis"" appeared within a mile of that river.   Another instance was when I had to find a house to rent I was not very conscious of its number significance until years later when I wrote this article.  My address was on a street in Frayser neighborhood of Memphis called Adair Street.  ""Adair"" has a numeric sum of 33 thirty three and the block was also 33 thirty three.  My initials equals 33 and I started to hear voices of spirits at age 33.  These two examples show evidence of a God in the community working structured realities with the cooperatio! n with the spirit of God inside my head.",,35.12547266265719,-89.92692482230727
Bright blue flash which lit up the night sky like a blue neon daylight.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I have had three different experiences.  This is the first. 1.  I was working an evening or overnight shift (I can't remember which or exactly what time it was but it was well into the night) in a local rock quarry and was high on a rock pile in my quarry dump truck so that I could see above the tree line and obstacles and out across our large lake, Kentucky Lake.  I was looking roughly south and southwest.  From somewhere behind me came a massive blue flash which lit up the sky almost to the level of daylight.  I could see the horizon in front of me for miles just as if it were daylight except it was a brilliant blue color.  I thought it must be some sort of nuclear attack or explosion and I waited for the shock wave for probably a minute.  During this time I contemplated taking my truck the 2 miles to my house because if I were going to die, I wanted to be home with my family.  These trucks are very large and not street legal so the thing I was contemplating seriously would have gotten me in a lot of trouble. I composed myself and drove down off my rock pile and returned to the quarry where I was now facing in a north / north-easterly direction.  The sky off in the distance (if I had to estimate, I'd say 8 to 12 miles away, had (from memory) about 5 planes circling in the general direction where the blast came from.  I never heard a sound with the blast.  This area is an hour's drive by Interstate 24 from Fort Campbell Army base where the 101st Airborne Division is based. I was shaken up pretty badly for a while.  I'm sure I must have discussed this event with some of the other workers at the time but can't remember those conversations.  Nothing of this event ever showed up in any local media.  I suppose it could have been a meteor but that wouldn't explain the circling planes in the area where the blast must have originated.  I was absolutely perplexed at the time.  Now, after several other experiences, I feel the event must have been a UFO encounter with a military jet.  I have only spoken with a few people about my belief in UFO's and have found two other people who have had dramatic daylight experiences.  I'll encourage them to make posts here.

I lived in a rural area with my closest neighbors being a mile away.  The road I lived on was a dirt road not very often traveled by others. It was a warm night in November (for Indiana) and there was no wind at all. It was a new moon so it was a great night to go fox hunting so I got my shotgun and red head lamp and started to the field.  I had to cross two triangle shaped fields, one was approximately 500 yards by a quarter mile the 2nd field was approximately 300 yards by a quarter mile. As I stepped into the first field I looked up and saw two red lights about 100 feet apart.  I knew there were two radio towers in that direction so I did not give it any thought.  It was about midnight and very dark so I did not look up again until I entered the next field.   When I did look up the lights had changed directions.  The lights had made a right turn and now were crossing in front of me heading south at a very slow speed.  The craft was over the fence row that separated the 2nd & 3rd fields.  The field I was entering was 300 yards across and the craft was about 200 feet up. When I saw the craft it scared the hell out of me.  I got behind a big tree and turned my light off. It was a still night and the craft made no sound at all.  It was 80-100 feet across and shaped oblong with two red lights on the outer edges.  I saw no windows or any other lights I watched from behind the tree for 15 minutes or more, the craft seemed to stop once and then moved on.  When it got to the long end of the field it turned right and slowly moved off out of sight. I stood there for a while trying to decide what I should do go hunting or go home.  I was 24 and needed the money so I went hunting.  I went into the third field and set up in the middle on top of a hill.  As I sat there not able to take my eyes off the sky I saw another craft a mile or so away.  It was also going very slow and was zig zaging between the houses.  I watched this one for an hour and a half by that time it was close to 2 AM.   I decided to give up on fox hunting and go home for the night.

I was walking the 1/2 block home and my mind was preoccupied with whatever it was that had just happened at work.  This I can remember for some reason.  I recall seeing something about the size of a commercial plane (I don't remember it being overly large or small) that was not so very far off the ground, maybe a half mile.  This was after dark so I don't remember seeing a shape per se.  I do remember that it was silent and had lights rather like windows.  I remember thinking that it was strange that it made no sound.  I remember it passing over at a leisurely speed, slower than I'd expect an airliner to be going.  I did not believe in UFO's at the time so I didn't really pay it much attention as my mind was focused on whatever problem had occurred at work.

I pulled to the side of the road and grabbed my camera I was able to take 2 photos before the objects swirled in unison and moved up and forward quickly and disappeared north and west. I turned the car around and headed up the ramp of the parkway toward the beach to try and see if we could see them again. Nothing, so I turned around and was coming back in the same exact direction approaching the top of the hill again when 2 more of them appeared and this time they seemed MUCH lower I noted again that they made no sound at all and that there was no flicker, like a flame but did appear to have a glowing ember type of quality to it but it seemed to be 'containe! d' in the sphere. In other words it didn't seem to have a fire or flame quality, just a glow of red orange and bright yellow. These 2 discs went in a quick formation of up and down and zoomed to the right before quickly zipping to the north and west again and disappeared. We waited there for another 2 minutes before driving off and just then 1 more appeared directly in front of us just above the tree line and hovered and seemed to get bigger as if it it was coming straight down and toward us, then quickly went north and west in the same direction as the others and disappeared. Again, there was no sound from them. It was eery and unbelievable. I do not believe in such things but I cannot explain this. I reviewed the pictures with my husband when I got home and they are amazing and show the exact shape as well as a hazy silvery glow that appeared as the discs disappeared.

This evening I was in my kitchen late night to get something to eat.  I live in a home with an Ocean front view in Pacifica, CA.  At 1:45 PM I noticed some lights out on the ocean while I was in my kitchen.   A quick look from inside the kitchen it looked like maybe a few boats were out on the ocean and one appeared to be big. It might be a cruise ship I thought.   I turned off the lights, grabbed my binoculars and went out on the balcony to see if I could get a better view of the cruise ship at night.   The cruise ship was very far out so I was not able to get a good look. As I pulled the binoculars away from my face, I continued to look out towards the ocean; I noticed a large object that was not moving in the sky.  Maybe a mile or so out.   I first thought it was a plane or helicopter but it was not moving at all and if it was a helicopter, the light pattern and size were not consistent with anything I have ever seen before except in a movie theatre. It was rectangular in shape with the left and right side being slightly longer than the top and bottom.  The lights were mostly white and they were in about six rows.   They were not all next to each other but they seemed to have lights all along the bottom and on the top, mostly left and right sides with just a few in the middle.   There were red lights mixed in with the white lights and one or two orange color lights.  Some of the lights seem to go on and off intermittently. II noticed that the ocean below seemed to be lit up in certain places.   Interesting that the parts of the ocean that were lit up did not seem to have a light source.   I did not see a beam of light coming from the object. The object stayed in one place for about 3 minutes (zero movement) and then moved slowly away towards the western sky. Note:  at 1:00 PM this evening there was a small earthquake that woke me up. Observer:    I am a college educated white male in my mid 40's with a professional job. I have never seen a UFO in my life time.   ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Specific times of sight were 8:39pm on 10/28, and 8:15pm on 10/29. Flight behavior shows descent, but with sudden, curving and complete shifts in directional movement. There is no organized formation. They initially appear with long streaks of flame, already in a steep descent. The relation between the ‘flames’ and objects are like that of a comet- so judging from the flames, which seem to only come from one side of these objects, I could determine a curved silhouette. Full shapes, however, were not seen. The flame will go out on one at a time, leaving a small white light, then spontaneously reignite with an equal amount of fervor. Each flame and object seem uniform in size. The colors of the flame range from white, yellow, and orange. No other lights on the objects were seen, other than the single light when the flame temporarily extinguishes. Both nights these objects descend into darkness, or have fallen from view, just before they drop below the horizon line.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,33.56413757440476,-111.9050830357143

I turned my attention on a star within the Southwestern part of the nigh sky, at this moment, The star seemed to just ""go out, like a light"". I couldn't believe what had just happened, and immediately this captured my full attention. just then, I began to notice the other stars to left of the star that seemed to have just disappeared a moment ago, also began to go out one by one from my line of sight. I began to strain my eyes to better adjust them with the darkness of the night sky. There were some street lights nearby, but they were behind me at the time, and did not have interference. As I stood there watching the stars seem to continue going out like lights one at a time, I took notice of a large black silhouette in the sky, all I could make of it that m! oment was just a giant black mass, shape still unclear. The unknown object was traveling South, then it began to tilt, and turned towards the south, southwest, now, moving away from me, at the time it tilted to the right, I then noticed it's shape. It was a giant ""V"" shaped u.f.o. It had no lights, no sound. It was just a black Silhouette, V-shaped craft. My guess would say it was about 300 yards long, and about 1-2 hundred yards wide. A huge craft! I was truly shocked, and amazed. I thought to myself it was larger than entire football stadium. It drifted silently a few hundred feet above the trees, totally silent, A capitol class cruiser. I don't know why, but this thought just came to mind; ""A capitol  class cruiser"" . That night in particular, there was a new home improvement store opening on the opposite side of the highway from where I was when I encountered the sighting. At that time, there were two searchlights used as an attraction for the new building. To me, the c! raft seemed to be heading over the highway, as if to be attrac! ted to t he traffic on the road. But the way it suddenly pitched to the right, away from the highway, it now seemed to me as if it was trying to avoid the searchlights which were still in operation.

The size in relative terms was about the size of a #2 Pencil Eraser held at arms length.  I described it being eclipsed, but it wasn't because of another object.  It looked like a total eclipse of the sun, but you could only see the shadow.  Maybe it was turning, I'm not sure, it was very small from my vantage point. It was the blackest black I'd ever seen, it looked like the period at the end of a sentence floating in mid air.  To go from a silver/gray object to total black was weird. I thought for sure others must have seen it too.  And when I said it vanished, it did exactly that, vanished,  It didn't accelerate in any particular direction. It was just gone. Reminded me of the Dot you used to see on the old Black and White TV sets when you turned them off, just blinked out. This happened around Four O'clock in the afternoon, I was making my way home from work.  Although the Gerald R. Ford Airport is less than a mile from where I was.  It wasn't any kind of aircraft I'd ever seen before.  The weather that day was Sunshine and Blue Skies, that's why it stood out so much. Air temperature in the mid eighties.",2012-01-12T00:00:00,,

Matter of fact there were 3 of them together. One short, one medium and one that was taller than the two. They looked in on me and ducked out of sight as I looked to see them. Just out of sight. I never got up to even investigate. I knew they were only spirits. Yet much like the aliens we see on TV. So a night or two of visits and I just prayed and rolled over as I might if a demon or something was around. I knew faith was my only protection. Then the taller one on the third night came in my room just before time to sleep. I rolled over but watched him as he came around the end of the bed. He took the image of a device or sensor and stuck it in my knee. My body went paralyzed for a brief. Like an epidural shot. So I just waited until I felt ok. No real problem since he left right after that. Never opening any doors just appeared in my place. The next night the little on came up to t! he side of the bed nearest to my head and I could see him but like always knew he was in spirit form so I’d never be able to touch him or defend myself besides faith. He got up kind of close, about a foot, if even that much from me and said the word”THC”. I smoked right much marijuana back then so it wasn’t a surprise to hear the reference. Then he said a word I’d never heard before “Transduced”. I had a dictionary in the drawer by the bed. I looked in it right away for the meaning. Low and behold it means “by supernatural means” to travel in spirit to another place is to transduce yourself. I knew that I had really seen Aliens in my home. Then years later I had a bone spur in my heel. I worked at a temp service and was working extra hours on a good paying job. I had put in overtime and 12 hours that day even. My heel was hurting on the cement floors all day. Another alien came into my sight. In spirit and said he was send from God. He asked me if I wanted him to make it go! away. I just thought back to him. I think telepathically the ! answer “ yes” and a glow of light came from his head toward my heel. I felt it warm a brief. The pain ended, and I never felt it again. I did go get the spur removed as normal but never felt any pain to mention from it from that day on. A little on jokes with me all the time in the spirit realm which I see in both realms, gifted I suppose. He says he is from God sent to watch over me.  I think angels come in different forms. I believe I saw God even in person the same way. Once as an old man and another time as a big greenish grayish blackish supernatural being I think. Maybe even in flesh somewhere in space. He projects himself having instant Daffodils and honey bees, dipped in olive oil or with white wine sprinkled over the flowers as one of his favorite things to eat. Said he had only revealed himself to three men that in any way of the sort.  They were Rafael on a boat, Moses and then me the as the third, if you count me twice. Then it’s four. I lived in Israel 2000 yrs. ago. I w! as told by 3 psycic people that I was Messiah. I am supposed to reveal myself 2012. God hasn’t affirmed it. I just know Antichrist will rise and you won’t be able to put money in a drink machine and get it to work. God will give him that kind of power as best I have seen it. Then after brutalizing me as a young man and losing my friends and family, finally come looking for my resolve of his rein. Kill him and war it out before he gets more powerful. 40 days of war has been prophecied. I pray for you all. The number will be in telepathic form sent out for all who will receive. Your answer in your heart and mind already you see. Like a bad acid trip. Spirit romping it all down for the devils last stand.",2012-01-12T00:00:00,33.9541,-81.0601

September 4th, 2011 -  Somewhere around 4/4:30 am, as I turned the corner onto a local street near my home,  a “light ball” sped overhead across the sky from behind my vehicle toward downtown Dallas (Texas).  The basic direction was from WSW to ENE - horizontally, and fairly low. This object consisted of a single, bright, white, continuously burning light. Size was indeterminate but it was rather large, much like a small meteor.  The speed would suggest a falling star or meteor and was out of sight as quickly as either, however, neither travel horizontally or as low as this object did.  It was far too fast to be a helicopter or airplane.  I had the windows rolled up and the radio on, preventing me from hearing any sound associated with this object. I considered the possibility that it may have been a street light reflection off the windshield. However, I turn this corner every single morning at approximately the same time and, not only have I never seen something like this before, there is no street light nearby. In my 55 years I’ve never seen anything like this and the hour may be prohibitive for many others to have witnessed this object.

After that we lost track of them and just stood looking in that direction just confused. 10-15 minutes of discussion still steadily keeping track of the area we noticed a Chinook.  It landed in about the same vicinity of where the two craft descended. We decided to keep watch by climbing on about 10ft posts.  The Chinook ascended and ended up flying over where we were and that is when we were able to confirm it was a Chinook.   We got slightly uneasy about this and ran back to my friend's house to think about what we just saw and how we would describe it.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,35.353695348837206,-94.38678217054263

It was about that high, when they are bookin from one place to the other.  It continued to come towards me from the south but I never heard anything.   As it got closer, I decided it couldn't be a helicopter.  It had a glowing yellow cylinder type body but not very defined (kind of fuzzy) and on top was a red light that looked like a dorsal fin (best way I can think of to describe it.)    Anyways it turned to the east and then another one came behind it and then another.  All turning and going east, real lazy, no sound.

I looked up to the southern horizon and observed 3 red/orange lights moving in a northern direction.  All three appeared to be at the same altitude and appeared to be moving together in a line one behind the other.  The first light was considerably further in front of the other 2. They appeared to shimmer (for lack of a better word) they did not pulse or flash.  They appeared to be both red and orange.  They moved slowly like you would expect to see a high flying plane however they did not appear to be planes.  The movement was unusual and not consistent with smooth flight of a plane.  They also did not appear to be at an extremely high altitude.  Both my friend and I were having difficulty understanding what we were seeing. The first light made it to a point in the sky east of our position and at that point disappeared from sight.  A very quick fade would best describe it’s disappearance.  The other 2 lights appeared to change position slightly pulling together closer with the 3rd light appearing to move slightly under the 2nd light.   They both continued to travel north and faded quickly from sight at exactly the same location as the first lights disappearance.  While there was light cloud cover, the clouds did not appear to occlude the lights. The lights were considerably disconcerting, and we both remarked that we had just witnessed something unusual.  We both questioned aloud whether they could be flares but discounted it because of the apparent flight path of the lights.  We questioned as well whether they might be rockets but discounted that as well.   Total time observed 4 minutes. Conditions: 40’F Light cloud, no breeze.

Literally, the resort is just a few sandy mountainous “hills” away from the military base. I was living in the midst of undeveloped desert land which somehow allowed for clarity... I was getting into my car to drive to La Quinta and I looked up and saw… not an ordinary BLIMP… but some silver-colored aircraft resembling a BLIMP in shape — but far more MASSIVE hovering above the houses. It was simply immense. Perhaps as large as 2 or 3 city blocks in Manhattan… And I would say it took up about 1/4 of the panorama.  It was floating in the sky fairly low. There was a thin ribbon of moving rainbow colors traveling around it’s girth like a belt and when I squinted, I could see it was actually a moving line of colored gases… I assume fuel.  This thing was so frightening, I hopped into my car and bee-lined it towards La Quinta with my dog. As I drove away, I turned back around for a moment to make certain I was not overreacting to this thing… but I hadn’t. It was just as frightening driving away. It was DEFINITELY NOT alien. This was home-grown from 29 Palms Airforce Base. I am certain that the aircraft I saw was either a WARSHIP… or a MONSTER SURVEILLANCE apparatus [to be used on American citizens... rest assured]. NO ONE reported a thing on the local news about it which only solidified my conviction that it was from the air force base! I personally know that their technology is about 100 years ahead of what they claim, so I had no illusions about this being extra-terrestrial. Another night ... late ... and right after 9/11 I saw a huge, black triangular aircraft that also just hung practically right over my house in the desert — without moving. There were lights beneath it but not bright and that too WAS NOT A UFO. You can take this for what it’s worth... but the feeling I got from this aircraft was very negative... even sinister. And that was not my imagination. I am posting this now because I was alerted minutes ago that a Blimp-type aircraft was seen in Stephenville Texas recently.

Just after the count down to the New Year, my friend and I noticed a bright red sphere moving unusually across the black sky.  The red sphere moved sideways, up and down, and back and forth; unlike a plane or satellite.  When it came to a stop above us in the sky, we thought for sure it was a UFO. My friend took photos of it on my camera, but he didn't zoom in or take actual moving video, which discouraged me later.  The red sphere made no noise or sound whatsoever.  It looked like it was parked to view the fireworks going off in the West San Fernando Valley.  It looked like it had large round ""windows"" around the orb itself. The first photo shows the red sphere moving, and the other photos show it still in the sky.  After a few minutes, it either disappeared or its lights simply went out.

I decided to take a quick couple of photos while at a stop light since it looked so cool.  When I checked out the photo shortly after, I ruled out the look of the sun in the pic as an optical illusion from taking the pic in the direct sunlight, but the sphere in the top left hand area of the photo I always found very interesting.  You also see a jet plane streaking underneath the sphere going East to West.  As I was going through my family photos I came across the picture once again along with a second picture I took around the same time.  In this second picture the sphere appears to have moved and is more in the center and below the sun.  This is when I said okay maybe the sphere is not an illusion and maybe the jet planes were checking this thing out; far-fetched theory but very cool pictures.

Bye",2011-10-10T00:00:00,,

Then as I did a double take I noticed that the perimeter of the “owl” was lit up, as if it was lined with small pin lights. The object glided over the back yard and headed south.  Before I could get my husband to look up it had glided away.  I told my husband, “I think I just saw a UFO!”   We talked about it for a few minutes but when he didn’t really believe it was a UFO I convinced myself that yes it was a large owl and the neighbors’ lights had lit up the underside of its feathers. About 10 minutes later I decided to go back inside and when I stood up to get out the object flew over the front yard area of our house.  I was able to say, “Look, look there it is!” and point quick enough that my husband saw it too.  He was shocked and immediately called it a Dinosaur!!  It had the shape of a Pterodactyl with its full wing span spread out wide.  Again it glided over the house and was gone.  I mentioned the lights to my husband and he didn’t remember seeing them, I saw them plainly the second time it flew by. My husband was ready to go in at that point, so we jumped out and headed into the house.  Once we dried off we walked out of the front door to look up into the sky but of course it was gone and we saw nothing else.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,39.11910000000001,-88.5702

I was having a cigarette on the back patio of a local pub when the  incident occurred.  It is important to not that I was not inebriated at  the time.  Nor do I believe the individual who first spotted the  objects had been drinking. I was engaged in conversation with this gentleman when he exclaimed,  ""what's that,"" and pointed to the east.  Looking up, I saw what seemed  like a fireball in the sky.  My first impression was of a burning  airplane.  The 'flames' seemd to subside, leaving the object with the  shape of a sphere, glowing with an fiery orange color.  I soon made out  several more such objects. Given the position angle of the objects and their relation to  surrounding buildings, I would estimate their size at about six feet  in diameter.  I would estimate their heading at about 340 degrees. Their speed would probably have been about forty miles per hour. There  were about six of them, and they were in a staggered line. They  emitted no sound. They also seemed to have mass; ie they were not  merely light. They travelled in a staggered line. There was no wind. The objects continued on their north-northwest course, maintaining  their altitude.  They were followed by another group of identical  objects about a minute later. We continued looking at them until they had travelled a mile or so.  As  the lights reached some unmarked terminus, they seemed to extinguish  one at a time.  But I could still make out some of the objects.  They  looked almost like giant glass spheres with a smoky iridescance.  I  continued looking until the second group reached the same area, ceased  to glow orange, then disappeared from view. There were a couple of other people watching on the patio.  I was too  engrossed by what I was seeing to pay much attention to them during  the incident.  Afterward, we speculated as to what we had seen, but  could reach no logical conclusion. I have been unable to find anything in the news regarding the  incident.  I even spoke with a couple of police officers to see if they  had heard any bizarre radio traffic during the time in question.  They  were polite, and did not treat me like some lunatic, yet told me they  had heard nothing. Note for clarity:  I was in North Little Rock at the time of this  occurrence.

The line was moving at a very slow pace through the moon. I also noticed that this line, from the earth to the moon and from the outer rim of the moon out through the night sky, the dark line was connected to a sun-beam-like light. As the dark line moved to the right, finally completely off the moon, the dark line vanished and formed completely with the ‘light’ line. In my opinion, this object seemed to bend light. By watching this line for 5 minutes or so, I realized that this line was very long.  Possibly as if it went from the side of Earth, through the moon and continuing through the night sky to reach the other end of the Earth. I was not the only one to see this.

At around 6:40PM Eastern Standard Time, I went outside to have a ciggarette.  A few minutes later I looked up about 15 degrees west of overhead to see what looked to me to be initially, a bright moving star. It was too far away to be an aircraft and was obviously both too high and moving too fast.  It was about as bright as Jupiter in the night sky its color was white with a very slightly yellow tint giving off a near constant light, but dimming as it approached the horizon.  I remember distinctly that the object was moving faster when it was over head, than when it was off closer to the horizon.  The object dimmed in a regular (almost linear) fashon. The path of the object started from about 15 degrees west from overhead, and continued to about 45 degrees over the southwestern horizon before fading away.  The whole occurance occured over about a 15 second long period. I thought to myself; ""what if that's an asteroid?""   I thought this was potentially accurate because typically meteors move faster, and are only visible when they burn up in the night sky, and usually they leave a streak.  This was just a bright object like a star. Leading me to infer that what was producing the light was was reflection from the sun.  I wasn't sure exactly how big an object had to be to reflect an amount of light bright enough to be mistaken for a bright star but I assume it has to be at least 30 feet in diameter.  So I believe the object was rather large, perhaps as large as a plane or maybe much bigger. I supposed it might be the International Spacestation. But from what I know the spacestation moves in a roughly opposite direction from the object I saw. The object was heading almost exactly southwest. What I can also infer from my observations was that the object was moving tangentially with respect to the Earth. This would explain both the slowing of the object as it approached the Southwestern horizon, and it would explain the behavior of how it faded away (because it reached an angle with respect to me where the suns light no longer reflected off the object). The arc length was approximately 30 degrees, maybe more from when I first noticed it. And the whole event lasted about 15 seconds. Given my observations, I can conclude that in all likelyhood, the object was not an asteroid but it was probably (though not definately) a large meteor. This conclusion is based upon the theoretical limit for meteor speed, which is roughly 160,000 miles an hour plus or minus 3,000 depending upon its relation to the rotation of the earth at its surface. This theoretical limit itself is based upon escape velocity, or velocity at which objects would not be pulled back in from the sun's gravity. Not much more can be inferred from my observations without making assumptions because the exact trajectory (particularly along the y-axis {the axis perpindicular from the ground to space}) can not be known. If I assume delta Y is 0 (which it must approximate to by about plus or minus 30 degrees) then a rough approximation of its distance can be calculated. From my observations I know the arc length was approximately 30 degrees over a period of approximately 15 seconds. My initial reports were inaccurate both in its trajectory and in the angle to which it faded. After revisiting the scene I can say with some certainty that the object disappeared about 45 degrees above the horizon (not 20-25) and started about 15 degrees from directly overhead (or from when I first noticed it). Because the object did not appear to burn up or leave a streak, it is safe to infer that the object did not burn up in the atmosphere meaning it was at least 62 miles above me. *62 miles is the approximate distance from the surface of the earth to the outer edge of the atmosphere given the two constrants (maximum speed limit of a meteor and the minimum distance from the surface from the earth, I can make rough approximate limits of its size and speed. Assuming the smallest possible size of the object (in order to be able to produce that light) is a sphere 30 feet in diameter. Assuming delta Y of the meteors trajectory is 0. Assuming delta X is 30 degrees. Assuming maximum velocity is 160,000 miles an hour. *http://www.amsmeteors.org/fireballs/faqf/ Assuming minimum distance is 62 miles. *http://www.universetoday.com/25410/how-far-is-space/ Assuming delta T (or change in time) is 15 seconds. Assuming the meteor had to be at least 30 feet in diameter. (at a distance of 62 miles)  Calculations suggest the distance of the meteor could have been anywhere between 62 miles and 958.27 miles away.Based on assumptions the size of the meteor was 30 feet in diameter at a distance of 62 miles, the maximum potential size would be 463.68 feet in diameter, and it would be traveling at a speed of between 10,351.92 miles an hour to 160,000 miles an hour. If the absolute maximum assumptions are taken to be true, then it is possible that a small asteroid passed earth. But given how unlikely that is, it is probably more accurate to assume it was probably between 100-250 feet in diameter. It is also probably safe to assume that the object was larger than the minimum. Due to the unliklihood that a meteor was going slower than what is generally observed with meteors. The range of speed of meteors almost always ranges between 7 and 45 miles a second  *http://science.howstuffworks.com/question486.htm. if the minimum distance of 62 miles is taken to be true. the speed of the meteor would only be 2.87 miles a second. Judging from this, the distance was at least 151.22 miles away and was therefore it can be assumed that the object was at least 73.17 feet in diameter. So did the world nearly end? No in all likelyhood not.  Even if the meteor had hit earth, it wasn't nearly large enough to be able to cause serious damage.",2012-01-12T00:00:00,38.4628,-79.0704

The first appeared very bright and travelled away from the direction of the moon as it went it dimmed as it should when it exceeded the reach of the suns light.  The second was flying perpendicular to the first. Rather than travel in the typical straight line it made a minor deviation in it flight path but still continued in the same general direction.  It appeared to first turn right then left again and still maintained its general course.  After discussing the satellites for a moment we started our walk travelling northwest down the street. We walked and talked about random things and revisited the satellite topic which prompted us to look up frequently. We walked about three blocks down the street and through a lit intersection. Just beyond the intersection the street turned dark again.  It was then that my wife said “Oh my god, check that out.” I followed her finger into the sky and immediately locked onto the object as it flew towards us from the north. It was a triangle of dim white lights with a slight blue hue, six of them arranged in an equilateral triangle. I would estimate its speed between 200-300 mph at an altitude of 500-600 ft.

It went over the house and out of sight, so I ran through the house pulling my girlfriend outside to see it too.  We both stood on the front porch and watched it until it dissappeared.

I am a resident of Northern New Jersey and my power was out until late last night. Though I have been eager to spread my news I was content and sure of myself and  of what I saw and this will be an experience I will never forget.   As i faced south  east from my balcony on the 8th floor in Hackensack there were jets of some sort  lining the sky as they normally do.  This time they were grouped, 2 here streaming, 2  more there streaming and one far behind but all going farther south*.  Then this  bright dot appeared in the sky! from nowhere.  Not from behind scattered clouds, not  from behind the falling sun.  From mid air it came, looking like a bright  chrome/metallic round thing.  No lights just an Orb, I'll describe it that way  because it seemed to be glowing or in a constant state of shape-changing but never an  obvious triangle or elongated shape, and rather than flying or propelling it would  dim and re-appear what could be miles away.  That's when I became amazed.  It changed  locations 5 times before disappearing for 20 minutes but then it returned.  I think  it would fade when other aircraft came around.  This is a busy sky but my friend  and I had never seen anything like this.  My friend and I were smoking cigarettes, he  was on his phone playing games and I gazed.  I would love to tell more, I'm looking  for other means of putting my sighting out there because it was real, breathtaking  and definitely defied our science.  No jet or earthly aircraft I've ever seen can  move from two points so far apart, so quickly, and not ever seem to have twisted or  propelled or anything.  When it would move, it would dim, as if shrinking and when  shrunk passed visibility it just appear somewhere else.  After having watched it for  more than 45 minutes, it got darker out, it moved farther east but did not dim  anymore.  This was about 10 minutes before total sunset.  I was able to put a  telescope on it (very amateur) and what I was able to focus on was something that  looked like an Atom.  2 glowing yellow orbs that never detached, which seemed to move  around this 3rd non moving yellow orb that was wrapped in a moving red octo-hexa type  of box.  That's when I started to think laser or some thing very Alien.  Please record  this sighting and inform me if anyone else saw what I saw.  We couldn't have been the  only ones  with all that time the orb spent up there but then again, this is the  eastern-city skies that no one really cares to gaze at.  But i'm sure that whoever  looked up at it would not be able to identify the object just like my friend and I couldn't.  My friend was so scared that he chose not to continue watching.  He went  in and was silent.  He did choose to look through the scope.  I almost forced him to  because I this couldn't go unseen...it was obvious and really there.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,40.8859,-74.04677331536388

There is a small bridge north of the stadium, where after the game everyone walks in large crowds back to their cars, or to tailgates that are still going on. At about 11:45 I was walking back to meet up with my three cousins (who are brothers) who went to the game, because they were my ride home. On the bridge, about halfway, three round glowing lights in a perfect triangle formation came flying from the west very fast. I was walking slow in the crowd of people looking at these things honestly thinking that they were jets because of their formation. Once they got about parallel to the bridge they STOPPED.  They were close, like three times as close as a typical plane. They were very bright and clear, and literally looked like fireballs.  Orangish red, and almost pulsating like they were some sort of aircraft or something. there was no shape to them though, just br! ight lights.  Right when they stopped, i stopped walking and started asking people around me what these things were.  About 5 or 6 people stopped next to me and we started talking and looking at these 3 things in this hovering triangular formation. Ive never seen anything like this, and i am usually the type of person to make fun of people who say they saw UFO's, or religious signs.  Anyway this gets even stranger. Almost a minute of me (and now about 15 or so people around me) staring at these things, the one closest to us MOVES INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE OTHER TWO.

We saw this thing just perfectly glide in between the other two, forming a PERFECT FREAKING LINE.  This was after one of the biggest games of the college football season, so MANY people were drunk, i was not though, because i had to drive home.  The people around me i could tell weren't either becaus! e we were all talking going what in the hell is going on? I ha! ve to te ll you i was on absolutely no drugs nor under the influence, because after the objects form into a line, we all start yelling because there is a FOURTH ONE coming from the west (the same direction the original three came from). This fourth one is flying. It was going so fast, almost looked like a missle or something. It was exactly the same as the other three though. This thing comes near the three that are in a line, and stops right near them. Yes, it STOPPED. It makes NO SENSE AT ALL how anything in the air can stop after going so fast. After it stopped the first three literally freaking SHOOT towards the south. I dont want to say disappear, but these things went from just being stationary to going very fast. in about 5 seconds they were to the point where we could not see them because they were now so far away. However, the fourth one that came up, stayed stationary for about 5 more seconds, and it slowly started to move to the south. We all watched this one go off for ab! out a minute into the distance, much much slower than the other three. I was standing there (and still am) trying to figure out what in the hell this was. My first guess is that it has something to do with the game, but that doesnt make any sense because THIS WAS AN AIRCRAFT, or some type of object. I want someone to tell me that it is something that i can look up and then confirm that its not a UFO, but nobody can. And this was a a pretty long sequence, about 4 minutes. Literally, like 20 people around me on this bridge one this fourth object was flying in were all talking to each other trying to figure out what was going on. I found a number of videos online that show similar looking things in the sky. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woCXh2kaw78&list=PL5AA853A833B2D26B&index=16&feature=plpp_video This one shows exactly what they looked like, even though the ones in this video dont show the same maneuvering characteristics. I have no idea if this video is real or fake, all im saying is that what i saw looked exactly like this. Please, if someone has any idea of what these things could have been besides some type of aircraft that doesn't belong to earth, please tell me because its one of those things that if it actually was just mistaken for something, i really want to know. Also if you read this and you were on campus that night and saw this too, please please let me know",2011-12-12T00:00:00,40.0034168732507,-82.99822087165134

Well around 10pm we notice a strange group of ligts that appeared to be marker lights similar to conventional aircraft but blinked in multiple colors and in a random pattern. After watching this for a few minutes I realized the speed this object could move across the horizon and the speed it could stop and change direction was something more than a conventional aircraft.  We continued to watch this for 25 minutes and were both convinced we had our first UFO experience and we decided to keep this information to ourselves. This was a Saturday night that we witnessed the UFO and when I returned to work Monday morning in Granbury Texas the president of my company called me to her office to notify me that my best friend a 59 year old man that was well respected in the community had committed suicide on Sunday morning/Saturday night. Of course I was upset about my friend and no longer was thinking of the UFO I had sighted hours before.  My friend that had committed suicide was  not mental, was taking no drugs and had no reason to step blow his brains out on the back porch of his $250,000 home that resides near Comanche peak Nuclear Power Facility. A few days later was the funeral, he was cremated and the event was standing room only and had many well respect members of the community.  After the funeral I stood outside hoping to give my condolences to his brother mother and family and as my girlfriend and I were waiting I was confronted by another close friend of the deceased.  He pulled spoke softly and asked if I had seen the deceased the week before and I replied no, that I was planning on a visit this week, he continued and said that the decease had been historical about an alien encounter Saturday night march 12/2011 and had the neighborhood security searching the area behind his home and was convinced of alien activity in his neighborhood. My girlfriend and I were blown away and believed every word of this because of our experience, but I also know that this area the people are close minded and this would be swept under the rug and never investigated. Rick (the Deceased) was a good friend and a good person that would not likely believe in UFO/aliens and would poke fun of anyone that did. Suicide was not something he would do, and after speaking to the security at his neighborhood and hearing their stories I am convinced he had an experience that lead to his untimely death that is worthy of further investigation.",2012-01-12T00:00:00,,

I was at a 4th of July weekend picnic but can't recall which day of the weekend it was.  I was standing with a friend talking when he looked up and saw a round, white light drifing slowly from southeast to northwest.  It was difficult to determine exactly how high in the sky the light was.  If I had to guess, I'd say if it were a 50 foot wide circle then it would be about 4,000 feet high in the sky, probably less than a mile but I'm not trained in this type of analysis so that's just a guess.  It appeared to be perfectly round and reminded me of a bright white heat lamp bulb shining down toward the ground so that all that was visible was the photons from the light, nothing else.  But as it drifted away (silently) I thought I saw (but can't be sure) a bit of darkness at the top of the light as if something solid was coming into view as the angle of view changed. My friend and I discussed the possiblity of UFO's and we decided that it wasn't anything we could think of that was manmade.  It wasn't just reflection from the setting sun as it was definitely a light shining downward.  I see commercial jets fly over all the time at dusk and can easily recognize them as such.  I was an airman in the USAF from 1973 to 1976. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2012-01-12T00:00:00,,

Night was clear, other planes and their lights clearly visible.  Altitude I would best describe as about double the height of a standard helicopter flight altitude.  Much too high for any helicopter and I am sure I would make out the lights if it were a conventional aircraft as it was much lower than the other 3-4 planes visible in the sky in different regions. The other planes lights were very clearly distinguished.  There was definitely no blinking pattern, but rather a pulsing - very similar to how fire behaves - no pattern and no pauses like a conventional aircraft, just different intensities. In both cases the shape could not be determined other than oval and the lighting had a glow circumference I would estimate to be about the same as the crafts radius. Flight path was steady and straight.  Both craft had the exact same heading.  Both craft were identical.  Speed w! as nothing out of the ordinary that I could distinguish from other traffic.  I was able to really study the lights as they did not speed away too quickly.  Both slowly dimmed then vanished completely as they approached my nine o'clock direction (I was originally facing due north, 12 o'clock where I saw them approach from my 11 o'clock). The size was a bit hard to judge.  At first glance I swore it was a helicopter but it was just too high.  I have never seen a helicopter fly that high, especially so close to 2 different airports (one commercial, the other for private flying). But the size could come close to that of a helicopter if it were that high. No distinct sounds heard - too much background noise to hear any plane.

On the date of Wednesday, September 7, 2011, in the city of Pflugerville, TX, I was driving east on Parmer Lane between 9 and 10pm, stopped at the traffic light about to turn north on Harris Ridge Blvd when I observed what I thought initially was a standard commercial airplane flying along the horizon northward.  Having looked at a map I would approximate it was on the latitude between Elgin and Bastrop, TX.  The craft was an estimated 3 to 20 miles away (distances are hard to approximate). It consisted of 2 to 3 yellowish orange lights that moved in exact unity, so as to give the appearance of a single craft. Initially it was moving at a normal speed for a commercial aircraft.  (I assumed it was an airplane since I live north of Austin airport and regularly see airplanes at night.)  After 5 to 8 seconds of flying parallel to the horizon, it suddenly made a swooping descent, covering what I estimated to be at least 3,000 feet in less than 2 seconds, then disappe! aring behind the trees near horizon. My reaction was to think, ""Wow, that airplane is going down!""  After several minutes of thought when it disappeared, I realized it could not have been a standard plane for 2 reasons: 1) It was clearly going too fast, even for a downed aircraft, and 2) A standard aircraft doesn't spontaneously change speeds like that. The descent of the craft was not straight down but rather in an arc motion, appearing as if it was not a fall or trajectory but a controlled descent at a speed which was alarming enough to grab my attention. After it disappeared behind the trees, I did not see it again.  Several days later I thought to look on the map (this is how I estimated the geographical area and direction) and made a connection that this was near or around the Texas wildfires in Bastrop area. At the time of witnessing the event, I made no connection between the UFO and the wildfires. After connecting the two, I thought it might be explained as an aerial firefighting craft. But then discarded this idea for two reasons: 1) Nothing was dropped by the craft, but rather the craft itself dropped, and 2) I called all the police departments in the area and was told there were no downed aircraft of any kind.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,30.441564516129034,-97.59894516129032

It was approximately 7:15 p.m. and I stepped out to get a breath of fresh air.  My deck faces East towards Lake Washington from Lake City Seattle. Upon having my attention directed to an orange object in the sky by my wife I observed a glowing orange orb moving from North to South across the sky at a high rate of speed over Lake Washington.  There were no flashing lights on the object and it was moving steadily at a rapid  speed across the horizon.  The object did not change direction and I observed it steadily for approximately 30 seconds until it disappeared behind the large trees in our yard. I would say that from the skyline the glowing orange orb was at an approximate angle of 40 degrees from tree line.  My best estimate at the size of the object would be that it was roughly 1/4th the size of a large full moon, or roughly as large as my thumbnail with my arm fully extended towards the sky.  The object did not emit a detectable sound. It is worth noting that about 15-20 minutes later an airplane flew directly overhead from moving from West to East.  Comparatively, the airplane was moving at a much slower speed. Later that evening I once again stepped out on the deck and was observing the sky due to the earlier occurrence.  Curiously, I spotted a similar looking object in the Southern sky.  This time the movement pattern was much different.  The object was much higher (roughly 75-80 degrees from tree line) and appeared to be much further away.  Still, the object was approximately two to four times larger than any star or planet in the sky.  This time the glowing orange orb was moving much slower and was zig-zagging East to West as it continued moving South.  My second observation lasted approximately 2-3 minutes until the object again moved behind tall trees that at last obscured my view.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

It came from NNE and moved SSW, visible for approximately 3 seconds.  It came out of the darkness and disappeared back into the darkness- very stealthy!  Its length was approximately 20 full moons (if the full moon was directly overhead- that’s the size I mean).  It was illuminated as a white tendril (like an elongated “U”).  Approximately 30 minutes later, I saw a black and gray checkered bird-wing-like object pass in a short North to West corner sweep.  It appeared to the west of my yard, seeming to be directly above the ground a block or two away.  It was visible for approximately 2 seconds.  It seemed lower in the sky than the tendril object, maybe 100-200 feet high, and covered an area approximately 2-3 full moons.  If it was an owl’s wing (it was night), it would have to be, I’m guesstimating, at least 20 feet across.  Approximately 30 minutes later, I saw another tendril object.  It seemed to be about half the size of the first tendril object and a little lower in the sky than the first one.  It passed just slightly to the East of the first tendril’s position but along the same general trajectory.  It was visible for approximately 2-3 seconds.  Approximately 30 minutes later, I saw the last tendril, about 1/4 the size of the first, traveling even more eastward (nearly straight south), visible for approximately 2 seconds.

I went in and called out to my wife to out on our balcony, she tried to tell me they were planes, I told her plane planes aren't orange amber, they have blinking lights, etc...  she went to the bedroom to look again, because she didn't want to be on the balcony; cold.

My wife, now with a warm view, could see it as well.  They were oval translucent orange amber color, solid.  When looking out over next buildings roof, and in the distant s.w. sky, there was a lot of them, they appeared to be coming up from the ground, then at a certain point leveled off from west to east, then went up on a 45 degree angle upwards to the southeast, and gone.

I then looked more up to see if I could see anything more, and I noticed way up to the south east, which would have put them in plain view of the base, by the way; I seen four stationary ones just sitting there.  They were in a box pattern.  Then I noticed the top two seemed to be fading, and the two bottom slowly slide up, and two from departing group would now take the bottom two box spot.

My first instinct was something from space falling to earth, like a meteor but it surprised me that it was moving so slow and I was able to see it in the daytime. After 30 seconds, I unfocused my eyes for a split second I suddenly noticed there were many more of these ""lights"" (roughly 10-30)across a good portion of the sky northeast of me, all moving northerly. Its kinda funny, I kept thinking to myself ""wow these things are so bright how could I keep losing sight of them"" and as soon as I'd think that they'd be gone and I have to refocus my eyes to find them. They were barely pinpoints in the sky but they were super bright. What really stood out to me at this point was 3 lights that were in a triangle formation(I will admit at this point I was seriously contemplating if they were UFO's) The leading ""light"" was bright red(I remember thinking it was the color of those tiny little red mites you find out in your lawn). This was the only red light I saw, but later in editing I noticed more red lights than blue. I ran in, got my camera, and filmed about a minute and a half of, what before editing looks like, a blank sky. Because it was so bright outside I didn't realize what I had caught on video until I edited the brightness/contrast the next day. After what I saw I don't know what it is. My best guess is I filmed a satellites reentry into the atmosphere.(a faulty German satellite was supposed to fall to earth later that evening over the Indian Ocean/Thailand around 7 hours later and, as of yet, there have been no sightings and it been almost two weeks) Whatever it was changed speed and at one point one even appeared to stop, and on the video one appears to split into two pieces, and one of those split in two.

A few times in the past five months. I have noticed what looked like stars (or indistinguishable from stars) flying across the night sky. The first time in August 2011, my girlfriend and I watched two fly across the night sky in the Nevada desert, about 100 miles North of Reno. They were far apart and were obviously not a single aircraft. The lights were traveling South-East to North-West at exactly the same rate of speed, never altering the distance between themselves. They took nearly twenty seconds to make their way out of our sight. The second sighting occurred in November 2011. I was walking to my car after eating at a McDonalds 16 miles South of Seattle, when I looked up and saw a single star-like light traveling across the night sky. I proceeded to watch the light for about one minute as it made it’s way out of my range of sight. I immediately called my girlfriend to tell her. However, on Christmas night 2011, I was staring out my bedroom window (not far from the previously mentioned McDonalds) when I saw a star-like light flashing between white, red and blue while producing very peculiar flight patterns. The light would jolt randomly within a very small radius as it made a linear path across the night sky. The due path was South-East to North, while the jolts were sporadic in direction. The time for this light to traverse the night sky was also about one minute. I am sure this object was not an illusion produced by the lights on the underside of an airliner due to the elevation, the apparent movement of the single light and no appearance of aircraft body within the jolting radius. Also, a satellite has no way of producing this random jolting. This occurrence was by far one of the most bizarre things I have ever witnessed. I even woke my girlfriend up to ask if she could see what I was seeing and she was just as amazed as I was.

Then after looking at it, I realized, no, it wasn’t stationary, it was moving slightly left then right, then left then right, the up, then down, then left then right, etc.  It also changed shapes, and the colored lights changed from red to blue to green to yellow, etc.  In wonder, I yelled for my husband to come see.  He was downstairs, I was up.  Instead, he yelled, “What is it?” To which I told him I was looking at a UFO.  He looked out the window and just moments later yelled, “I see it!” and then verified where in the sky I was seeing it.  It continued to “wiggle” in the sky and change colors.  It also changed shapes from round or spherical to oblong or blimp shape.  As it changed shapes, the colors changed.  It was almost like it was rotating.  We called our son who lives about 1/6 mile down the road.  He went outside and he saw it too.  He reported seeing the shape stay the same, but the colors changing and it appearing to move.  We could see the color changing and movement with the naked eye.  We looked at it through the binoculars, and it was DEFINITELY colored.  It was like looking into a spectrum.  All kinds of color!  Yet the next time you looked at through the binoculars it was all white.  Mostly it was colored.  It appeared to be high in the sky like a star, light up like a plane, and hovering like a helicopter.  It was too high to be a helicopter and it didn’t make any noise that we heard.  It stayed in the night sky and we decided to go to bed.  The next day, I posted on Facebook and friends told me it was a planet or comet or something.  November 6, 2011 –Again, we saw the same UFO in the night sky, again changing colors just as much, but moving back and forth and up and down just a little less.  Of course- when we saw it this night, we were at my Son’s house and remember he didn’t report seeing the same movement we did.  January 3, 2012 - My best friend – who lives about 15 miles away saw a UFO, possibly the same one.  Tonight, January 4, 2012 - Due to her sighting, I looked into the night sky, and the color changing orb is back.  Movement is not as strong, but the color changing is definitely there.  We talked on the phone and although trees and such near her house made it where she couldn’t see it earlier in the night, she did spot it later this evening.  Commentary - It might be a star or planet or something, and maybe pollution is causing the colors, but what is causing the movement?  It is usually about in the same spot (when it’s out there – it’s not always there) near Orion’s Belt.",2012-01-12T00:00:00,33.5146,-81.8168

I didn't think about the fact that it was very cloudy out (and I was unable to see any stars when I looked up) but I saw this in my peripheral vision and wrote it off as a really bright shooting star.

My brother is really into UFO's and has been talking about them a lot recently. I said to him ""yeah, yeah, real cool. I'll believe it when I see it with my own eyes."" Literally five seconds later I saw a strange light move around from where the other shooting light had come from and I said ""whoa"" which made my brother look! up in the same direction as I was.  Above my friend's house and just below the clouds, we both saw a large yellowish orange concentrated ball make itself visible and move at a steady pace at about a 100 degree angle across the sky.  It was going much faster than an airplane and much slower than a shooting star. It was one solid light, not many small ones.  It was completely silent. When it got to the end of that stretch it disappeared into thin air.  It moved at an upward angle, but not straight up.   We both saw the whole thing and can't figure out what it could have been.

We were all sitting around talking, listening to music enjoying a chilly evening like we usually do.  We often sit on this driveway just to enjoy the outside air, and to lay on our backs and look at the stars at night.  We look for meteors and interestingly shaped clouds and such because we all tend to have a pretty decent repect for the beauty of nature and planet earth.  Some of us are artists or musicians, while others are simply just free spirits with open minds. Around 11pm central time, we were all still gathered in conversation and laughter when my sister said she saw the most beautifully bright shooting star, and we all moaned for we had missed it.  She said that she had never quite seen anything like that before, which got me thinking... was it an extraterrestrial vehicle?  I began to meditate deeply as I do everyday, except I was trying very hard to visualize what she had seen.  Before long I could feel something very different and began to see the most beautiful shapes and geometry in the backs of my eyes. It was then around 11:20pm that we were all somewhat quiet and the music had stopped when a large, bright, amber in color, and extremely fast light shot out from far behind a tree in the front yard and sped in a very oblong arc across the sky first going higher and then lower again and disappeared into a cloud.  When it first appeared I stood up from the ground very quickly shouting ""Whoa!"", trying to get a better look at it because it was moving very fast, and I didnt want to loose sight of it.   My sister then saw it too from my reaction and direction of gaze.  It looked to be about seven to eight-hundred feet high, the arc of travel spanned a local angle of approximatley thirty to fourty degrees, lasting somewhere between 3 to 5 seconds.  It was maybe 3 to 4 times the size of a star, 10 to 15 times brighter than any star in the sky, and about one tenth to one eighth the size of the moon.  It made absoloutley no noise whatsoever, and as it dissapeared into a relativley dark and ! unviewable cloud above the horizon it seemed to make the tiniest ""hole"" or impression where it had gone in.  I knew right away that it was too bright, lasted too long and far too low to be a meteor.  I estimate that it was traveling somewhere around eight or nine thousand miles per hour, and the intensity of the light never faded save for with distance and cloud interference.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,42.27738134206219,-89.04477790507364

It appeared to move not only up and down but also in a circular pattern twice over the 30 minute period. It mainly ""quivered"" from its original spot in between two nearby stars, which, to the other witness and I, provided a point of reference to verify that it was in fact moving. It appeared to have a halo of incredible darkness around it that sometimes restricted how much light we could see from our viewpoint.  It also appeared to be spinning on an axis at a perfect 90 degree angle, which revealed ""pillars"" of light (for lack of a better descriptor) that emanated outward every 45 degrees around the edges of the base sphere of light that seemed to be constant. The second strange light was seen in nearly the exact opposite direction of the previous light, but it was lower in the sky and seemed closer to us.  This light appeared very much like the first one but was much more active.  It moved in a pattern that resembled the symbol for infinity for a few seconds, then would slowly creep back towards its original position, then move again, slightly yet definitively and quickly.  This second light even made a zig-zag pattern to the left and right of its original position relative to the nearby stars.  It too even showed a pinhole-effect (restriction of light) which seemed to be caused by a ""ring"" of darkness around it. Both of the lights also had a constant ""flickering"" effect to them that seemed like it was inconsistent, and may have been a result of the light's spinning, as when the pinhole effect would take place the light became much smaller and perfectly spherical.  These were the two brightest things in the sky besides Jupiter at this point of the night, and your eye was drawn to it.  They moved fluidly and unlike anything I've ever seen, almost as if someone had an incredibly powerful laser pointer and was trying to hold it steady, but the light came down on us and not from the ground up. Like I said we were all very far away from it, and when we saw planes fly near them from our point of view they seemed to be possibly as far as in orbit around our planet, and possibly as close as 50,000 feet up. Both of the lights were viewed extensively and this was the second night in a row I have seen them both in very similar positions in the sky if not the same position.  I downloaded an app on my phone that shows all of the stars in the known universe by pointing at them in the sky and both of these objects did not register with the app as anything known to us in the sky.  This includes planets, constellations, galaxies, and even satellites (there are even Russian craft). I have also been recruiting more witnesses since yesterday and tonight three more of my friends verified that they too were seeing the same event of these incredibly strange lights.

It was Sunday, evening between 8:05 and 8:10pm on November 20th, 2011. My daughter, (age 33) who was driving, said, “What was that! Did you see that?” She immediately stopped the car and we both looked to our left. We were in a heavily wooded area. What we saw were many, many bright lights. The lights were so bright they looked like burning magnesium. The lights were beyond the trees. My daughter describes them as more blue than I do. We were puzzled because they most appeared like fireworks but did not act like fireworks, in that they were not falling and fading out. What my daughter saw initially she describes as maybe a comet with a tail exploding. I did not see the initial “comet.” In reference to the many bright, white lights, I said, it is strange what would someone be celebrating on a Sunday evening in Snohomish. I erroneously thought we were looking due west towar! ds the town of Snohomish. We watched the lights for about 30 seconds and I said, “Let’s go up on the ridge to see if there are more lights.” So, instead of heading right at the intersection, towards our home, we headed left. (Given that we were in a heavily wooded area, there is no way to have seen a comet with a tail streak across the sky.)  About 1 ½ miles from where we saw the lights first we stopped. I realized the lights had been almost due north--not west. There were no more lights but there was a glowing gray/green column. The sky was fairly clear and the sky dark. We stopped the car and turned off the car lights to look at the glowing column. The glow was not such that it would jump out at you if you were scanning the sky but yet was very visible. The column was between 40 and 50 degrees on the horizon. We watched for maybe 30-60 seconds, and I said, “I’m tired, let’s go home.” My daughter had picked me up from the airport as I had been out-of-town for five days.  Just as my daughter started up the car and turned on the car lights, three bright white angular objects appeared and disappeared into the column or the column enveloped them. I said, “Oh, there are three more.” My daughter did not see this as her head was turned left to do a U-turn to head back home. Two of the angular objects were about as large as a VW bug, one was a little larger. I have no idea why I chose the VW bug as something to compare the size. I cannot describe the shapes---only that they were angular. I cannot say if they were triangular—just angular. They did not line-up but were somewhat in a vertical line. I had the feeling we were very close to whatever this was.  It struck me just how weird this all was when we neared our driveway I called my husband and said to him, “There has been an event in the sky, come and meet us at the end of the driveway.” He did, we drove across the street and up the hill. He saw the glowing column, but no lights. There was also a second, but much dimmer glowing column to the left of the first one. We watched it for maybe 5 minutes and then went home.",2012-01-12T00:00:00,47.91181404255319,-122.03520680851064

It appeared to be too close to be a star but also not moving,so I decided to check on it once in a while. The next time I looked at it,about 10 minutes later,it had moved a considerable distance west towards Shell Lake. My boyfriend also saw it. He walked outside and told me to come look at it out there because it has gotten closer and lower in the sky. It was close enough for us to see the colors. My boyfriend estimated it to be between 1 and 2 miles away in the woods. They were flashing red,green,and blue. It was round or maybe oval. We both watched it very slowly make its way to the ground. It was in and out of view for us,as it was moving through trees. It moved so slowly that we went back inside our apartment. About 5 minutes later my boyfriend looked outside a different window and saw the light completely gone,followed by an explosion of light that illuminated all the trees ar! ound it. He said it was a big area of light.  The light explosion only lasted only a few seconds. We assumed it landed,and shut its lights off because we were unable to see it anymore. Later on we were driving to the gas station and saw it moving east towards Long Lake higher up in the sky. We have both seen this same flashing colors type of light multiple times,usually while driving. We have sighted it in Long Lake,Spooner,Shell Lake,and Rice Lake. It is usually hovering or moving slowly. It usually appears mostly blue in the sky. There has been no order to the days we have sseen it,just at random. They have all been in December of 2011.

We took the next exit ramp to get back north-bound on the 805 to try and film it, but the phone camera wasn't equipped to handle the distance and low light.  As we got closer to the bridge where it hovered, it began to ascend straight up (perpendicular to the bridge) and then it stopped to change direction to ~45 degrees up, and westwardly. It turned from an orange glow to a bright red the farther it went.  Then it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I fired 23 continuous frames in high speed mode using a RC D700 Nikon.  I focused on the stars and started taking a series of rapid fire images.  I had to focus on a star, and set the lens to manual, then start the burst of frames with the remote control.   When I loaded the data into the computer, one of the objects thought to be a star was in motion.  The samples show the object, though in a straight flight trajectory, the frames show this object was sweeping, each exposure sample showed a different flight angular positioning of this object relative to the stars around it.

I download my iPhone photos and to see my surprise I saw a cluster of 3 white lights high above. I was taking photos using the passenger mirror. This is no trick.  Also I seen a orb on 12/3/2011 next to a charter plane.  Near Portland airport. Sighting Time: 7:16pm Day/Night:  Nighttime   No. of Witnesses:  1 Duration: 1 minute   Appearance / Description of Object(s)  cluster of 3 balls of light UFO in the sky behind us.   When I looked at it taking photo's it was so blurry it was pulsating. Just all 3 big balls of light together.  No unusual sounds.  There were no beams at the time just what I described. It didn't move by the photo's. Size of Object(s)  The scale of the one light, comparing to a plane just over my head just about tree level was around the size of a street light.  There was no outline of wings of blinking lights nor a red blinking light. Description of Area / Surroundings We are near a think rural area.  Close to Route 112 about a block over.  There was no street light there or that even can be that height. Also the nearest airport is 3.5 miles.  It is a charter plane airport only. Full Description & Details I am educated in the UFO and abductions for 6 years now.  This year is the first experience I had 3 so far with in 2 months.  I am a amateur photographer as well and have a sharp eye. The family on 12/11/2011 stopped at a house full of lights.  It probably lit up the sky!  We are near a think rural area. We were near Route 112 north about a block over.  There was no street light there or that even can be that height. It was 7:16pm.  No moon. Clear sky, a few stars. We were listening to music.  Everything was working in the van and running.  I put down my window where it was a unusual warm December. I put the side window down.  The kids were pointing and looking out our van window. I thought it was cute so I took many photo's less than 1 minute.  I do remember quickly, only because I was into watching and listening my kids. The object in the sky in the mirror was very blurry to the naked eye. It was pulsating. Just said to myself, what the heck is that. So I ignored it. The closet thing I can describe was a strobe light. I have seen all planes shapes and sizes. During the day and night. For 3 years I even lived next to a airport. I know it was no plane. There was no outline of wings of blinking lights nor a red blinking light. Just all 3 big balls of light together. No unusual sounds outside. I download them and always delete no good photo's. To my surprise, there it was clear as day a I got 7 total with the mirror shot. The first one the UFO is not there. Then the next 6 in the mirror there is a cluster of 3 white lights, and what the camera got was a clear shot of it. Can sighting be explained as any conventional man-made or natural object? no, I seen them all in the sky night and day and know there sounds. I seen a commit and watch satellites as well. Witness Background I have my HS diploma. I took 2 year of business clerical. I flagged for about 3 years. I am a artist and photographer. I love details in all art work.

This year is the first experience I had 3 so far with in 2 months. my first was 2005. I was looking at stars and seen one ""star"" same color and size, move close to another ""star"" and at the same time they took off in a blink of an eye. I always believe, even as a child growing up in a sheltered life. I just know. I read all reports and books on the subject and want to work in this field down the road. I also watch many tv shows about real sightings. I will also add my other photo's another day. There's something going on in Maine. I also seen a report and a photo of a UFO on 12/11/2011.

I was not able to get any pictures or video because the encounter was so quick if I would have hesitated to look up into the sky I would have missed it. Earlier that day I had an intense feeling of being watched. It felt almost as if there was someone watching my every move through out the day. As I drove down the highway from Northern Indiana back down to Muncie I had noticed a blue orb hovering in the sky. At first I thought nothing of it thinking it was just a nearby radio tower or an airplane. As time progressed I kept looking up to see if it was still there and it was. Suddenly the orb started to move erratically in the sky and the light had gotten brighter and brighter the faster it moved. All of the sudden it shot forward in tremendous speed behind a cloud and all I could see after that was a large explosion of blue light.
