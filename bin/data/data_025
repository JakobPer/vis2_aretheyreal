I work at a coal fired power plant, I was outside (smoking a ciggarette) looking toward the coal pile and noticed two bright lights heading toward me. The craft was moving very slowly, it took about 1 1/2 -2 minutes to cover the distance of the coal pile kitty corner. This is ruffly the distance of 2 football fields I guess. I watched it, trying to figure out why a plane would fly so low or close to the buildings. As it reached the coal belt tubes I could see it had two huge flood lights on the front. It then banked off to the west and I could see the shape. It reminded me of the stealth bombers. It also had three smaller white lights underneath it. I later described the craft to a co-worker who has military experience and asked him what sort of craft it was. One other thing that is probably important. I never heard any sound from the craft except possibly a very soft high pitched whine at he edge of my hearing but I wasn't sure if it was from the craft or the plant behind me. I thought the craft. in a blink it was gone. Anyway, my co-worker said no such craft exist as we know it. A stealth bomber is niether slow nor quiet. A hareier (?) jet would be the only thing that could fly that slow and they are not quiet either. He said either I had good drugs, which I don't, or it was a UFO. I don't know. Only know I saw but didn't hear. This was not the first time I saw this craft or one just like it. On sept 11, 2001, yes, the day the towers were hit, thats why I remember, I went to the store in the evening, probably around 21:00 hrs and on my way home saw the same type of craft coming toward me just above the trees. It too, was moving very slow and not making any noise. I put my head out the window and looked up the craft. it was almost directly above me, I felt I could have reached out and touched it. I watched it for a while, it continued as it was for a few minutes then took off. As it was heading in the general direction of Mitchel field where there is an air force base, I assumed it was a stealth bombe! r called out because of the events of the day. Until I talked to my co-worker about the latest episode I was unaware of the actual flight limitations of the stealth and that 'stealth' does not mean slow and quite but un-detectable by radar. So I don't know what I saw. Maybe you do. ((ADDENDUM TO REPORT ABOVE)) correction to previously filed report. I was able to determine the correct date for a report filed for 11/06/02, The correct date is 11/11/02.

My window is facing eastwards. I suddenly saw a small light in the distance- it was like a tiny star-at first i thought it must be s star until it started moving. I then thought that it must be a meteor-but then this was wrong again because it started moving in a strange way-bobbing up and down in the sky and moving all over the place. Because of it's movement i deduced that it could not be a satellite or a meteor or a plane, helicopter or any other type of known aircraft -i have seen plenty of these in the night sky and it was not like any of those that i'd seen. It was not an illusion for certain- i was so curious that i switched the radio off, jumped out of bed and opened my window-and there it was-travelling across the sky! It was not extremely fast as it took quite a while for it to travel across the sky. It was a very bright object but also distant-so i coudn't quite make out what it was. It was the queer way in which it moved that puzzled me more than anything- sort of hovering and bouncing up and down! I watched it till it went out of sight-it was quite low in the sky when i last saw it.

I came across this website today, and thought it important to report this even though this was an event that occured a fair time in the past.  I was 11 about to turn 12 in August 1987 and was staying at my father's house at West Lake (just outside of Prince George, BC, Canada).  It was a clear day although briskly cool and more like a fall day.  I was standing in front of our large living room window and looking out over the lake (southern part of the lake, looking east).  I noticed a dark almost black cylindical object vertically positioned almost directly over the middle of the lake.  It was perhaps 50-100 meters above the water.  Oddly I did not think much of it when I first saw it, but then I started to look at it with greater attention.  It was fairly small, I would guess that it was maybe, at most, a meter wide and 3 meters high.  At the middle point there appeared to be a band that was rotating, not really a light, but the band was of a lighter color.  The object stayed motionless, just sitting there for approximately a minute.  I called my dad, but he did not come.  While I was still viewing the object it sped away at a great speed to the upper right at almost exactly a 45 degree angle.  The speed at which it left was easily faster than any object I have ever seen in the air prior or since although it was visible as it sped away.  It left behind a 'very' thin black exhaust trail that lingered for at least a minute and disappeared, but never really dissapated.  I can remember that I ran to my dad and told him regarding the object, and he never really reacted to what I stated, more like an approving nod.  The rest of the afternoon I spent outside with binoculars.  We never talked about it much afterwards.  To create a better image of what I saw, it appeared almost like a black lipstick casing with a brighter band in the middle.  The thing it reminded me of the most when thinking about it afterwards was the probe druid in Star Wars.  The object I saw had little detail bit it just sat there above t! he lake, motionless except for that band.  I am 27 now and this small incident in time still remains a bizarre little fact in my life and I thought I would share it.  I am not certain of its origins, but I am certain it was not a figment of my imagination, nor anything else easily explained.  I would qualify it as an unidentified flying object and that is why I am choosing to share this information here. Here is a link to the Park on the Northern part of the lake, fyi:   http://wlapwww.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/west_lk.htm I would also like to add something to this information which is likely unrelated, but on the very slight chance it is I will include it.  About a month before this sighting.  I was standing on our dock on the lake fishing.  I had put some water in the bottom of the canoe about 4 or 5 inches deep and any of the fish I caught I put in the canoe (the squaw fish as we called them were intended as cat food).  The canoe was tied at both ends parallel to the dock.  The weight of the water in the canoe was significant and I weighed at least 120 pounds at the time.  I was standing beside the canoe holding my fishing rod and looking across the lake (my line was not out at the time).  The lake was calm that day but I noticed an extremely fast rippling across the water that was coming toward me from the right.  The force of the wind picked the canoe out of the water, slammed it across the dock and into my leg knocking me into the water on the other side of the dock, with my fishing gear in hand.  All of the water and fish in the canoe were released, the canoe rested on top of the dock turned upside down and I was sitting in the water wandering what happened???  I was just in awe of how wind could pick a very heavy canoe out of the water and knock it into me causing me to tumble over into the water.",2003-03-04T00:00:00,53.84763564814815,-122.85669027777777

In January 1990 I was a student at the University of Wisconsin in Platteville. I held a night job in Dubuque Iowa, which is about a 30-minute drive from Platteville through mostly rolling hills and farmland. One night at about 1am, during my drive to Platteville from Dubuque, I noticed some lights in the distance going back and forth over an open field. I wondered why a farmer would have his equipment out at that hour, especially in January when there is so much snow on the ground. I was puzzled but I didn’t put much thought into it. As I drove down the hills, I would lose sight of the lights but as I came back up I could see them again. There were three colors: white, red and dark yellow/orange. The lights continued to pass back and forth along the countryside. I drove down another hill and lost sight of whatever it was. I was almost back to the school campus, right on the main highway going into the small town of Platteville. Suddenly, the lights were right in the middle of the road, right in front of me!  Not more than 40 feet!  It was hovering over the road and the lights were rotating. I was absolutely terrified! Plus, it was difficult to see. I had to make a choice, either keep driving straight, which would take me directly under it, or make a fast turn onto a winding back road. In a split second, I decided to turn off onto the back road. I was consumed with fear. I just wanted to get away from the lights. I barely used my brakes as I made that turn. I’m not sure how I didn’t lose control of my car. I kept looking in my rear view mirror to see if the lights were still there. Nothing. I calmed myself down a little and tried to rationalize that whatever I saw was sure to still be on the highway. It must have been a semi or emergency vehicles or something! My heart was still racing, but at the end of the road, instead of making a left to go back to the campus, I decided to make a right turn back around to the highway. There was nothing. No lights, no semi, no emergency vehicles, no farm equipment. Nothing! Surely, if the lights I saw could be attributed to any of these things, I would have still been able to see it from the highway. I will never know exactly what I saw that night. All I know for sure is that I have never felt terror like I did when I had my close encounter. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is January 1990 is approximate.

The UFO flew steady and straight maintaining a constant speed and direction and then once over Augusta made what seemed to be a 90 degree angle and bolted off towards Whitefield.  Within 30 seconds the light had vanished and 30 seconds later I could see the clear, dark starry night. To back this sighting up, here is more evidence.  My uncle was up at the same time in Farmingdale getting ready to go hunting.  He was in his living room and noticed the light coming in through his roof windows and then noticed the same ball of light going over head towards Hallowell.

PD)) A black triangle was seen flying over Sedona, AZ the evening of July 5, 2003 by six eyewitnesses At 11:15pm on July 5, 2003, I and five of my coworkers were chatting on the balcony of a house our company is renting. I, being a stargazer and a former member of Arizona MUFON, was watching the sky when I saw a tiny orange-ish light moving in a southeasterly direction.  I called my colleagues' attention to it, thinking it was a satellite.  A female member of our group brought my attention to two more lights following the one I saw.  All were identically small and illuminated.  There were no conventional anti-collision lights strobing, only a faint but steady light from each.  I thought initially that it could not possibly be three satellites in a parallel formation moving at identical velocities.  Then the realization that we were having a bona fide UFO sighting occurred to me. The shape the lights formed were an elongated isoceles triangle - I would guess the three angles of the object were 30 degrees at the bow and 75 degrees for the two rear angles.  The object occluded the stars as it passed, leading me to believe it was a solid triangle, not a ""boomerang""-shape.  There was no sound from it.  I would guess the object may have been moving at an altitude of at least 100,000 ft. and would have been over 1/2-mile in length. I ran upstairs to get my binoculars.  This took less than 30 seconds.  When I'd returned, the object was gone.  The manner in which it vanished, according to one of my fellow eyewitnesses, was it seemed to ""fish-tail"" like a car upon hitting a slick surface. The ""bow"" light then disappeared, followed by the other two lights.  It was described to me as it had gone through a rift or gateway in the sky. This is quite different than those objects that appear to suddenly vanish in a supposed ""hyper-jump."" The object moved silently at what must have been supersonic speed to cover the distance it did in only a couple of minutes at great altitude, from initial sighting at almost 90 degrees directly overhead to 50 degrees to the southeast within two minutes. All of the witnesses, myself included, are in the performing arts, working with a Shakespeare company in Sedona.  Our ages range from 17 to 42. Four of the witnesses were male, two female. Myself and only one other witness in our group have any background or interest in such phenomena.

No noise. Hello and thank you for your services. It is 3am on Sunday the 6th of July. At between 12:03am and 12:05am the 6th of July, i was sitting on my balcony of my appartment and looking up at the night sky. The sky is quite clear tonight and there are a dozen stars visable.  I noticed a pale colored object moving slowly due south across the sky above me.  I stood and squinted(ive lost my glasses)and noticed it was not lit with strobes or anything that most aircraft are required to have.  Then i ran in and grabbed my binoculars and came out for a better look. At the same time i yelled at my girl friend to come look, because she has better vision. I was not completely alarmed when i first saw it, because i thought it was much higher and possibly a sattelite.  When i put the bino's on it, i then freaked out, because what i saw was definately not a known aircraft.  My heart was racing. The craft appeared to be a ""V"" shaped thing, or a ""boomerang"" shape.  It was tilted roughly 45-65 degrees from the horizon and from my perspective seemed to be between 1500-3000 ft altitude.  It was a pale color, possibly white, and seemed to only be lit by the city lights. I was a bit shakey with the bino's at first but could make out some rough details.  It had some kind of dark/black trim work, but i dont believe it was a silver colored object, because there was not glean or glint from the city lights off of the surface.  Its rotation was counter clockwise and probably no more than 1 revolution per second, but its spin changed slightly from half of that, more or less during its path.  Its path was steady, and in a south direction.   I live just north of the capitol building in Salem, and this craft was just north of being above that building.  Just further south is our airport, and it looked as though the craft got to the vicinity of being above the airport and then it stopped its flight path and hovered, while still spinning.  I climbed my railing for a better look because it was just about to go behind some trees in my line of sight.  When i got up the railing 2 seconds later, and put the bino's on it again it was simply gone.  I immediately called 911 and reported it, if nothing else, there's a record of it if you call them i believe.  I asked if they had any other reports and he said no. I asked if he had a number for the airport. I wanted to contact someone at the radar station, but he said Salems airport(traffic control) was closed at this time of night.  I had about 25-30 seconds of nice veiwing of the craft through my binoculars and have made detailed sketches.  The craft made no noise. It filled my view in the binoculars.  It was roughly 1/2 to 3/4 the size of a full moon from my vantage point.  If i were to make an amature guess, i would say it was possibly close to the size of a chinook helicopter.  It seemed to be traveling at the rate of a helocoptor moving at a fairly slow cruise. But it certainly wasnt any kind of craft ive seen before.  Temperature 65-68 F Clear skys, some slight haze.  Some light polution No other oddities to report, expept a strange encounter with a homeless fellow in a near by park by me and my girl friend 3 hours earlier.

I was sitting in a hammock in my backyard when a jet passed overhead at relatively high altitude.  It appeared to be a commercial airliner with 2 engines located at the rear of the fuselage.  It was flying in a SW direction at a high altitude, probably too high for it to have just taken off from nearby Logan airport (approx 10 miles away). As I was lazily sitting in the hammock while grilling dinner, I looked up at the plane and saw a smaller object flying directly behind it at close range.  My first instinct was that it was a fighter--it had the same general shape and was proportionatly sized compared to the airliner but from that distance, it was impossible to tell.  My instinct was that it was escorting the airliner due to some sort of hijacking incident.  I watched as the two craft disapeared from view (trees and houses block out most of the sky from the yard) and either the unidentified craft drew closer to the airliner or it appeared to due to perspective.  I went inside to check the news for any sort of breaking report on a hijack but nothing.  Now, 3 hours later, I'm still baffled.

It was 9:30 pm Sunday July 6th at the Hecla Provincial Park (120 miles north of Winnipeg)  My wife and I saw an aircraft travelling east.  It was very high in the sky as I could not identify aircraft wings and could barely discern the faint sound of jet engines.  The aircraft caught my eye because it was shining brightly (probably due to the reflection of sunlight at sunset) and I found it odd that there was no vapor trail from the jet engines.  The speed of the aircraft was constant (not unusually fast or slow).  The very strange aspect of this sighting was that the aircraft did a very quick and very sharp U-turn.  It took less than two seconds for the aircraft to change directions and begin flying on the same path it had been travelling.  I work in aviation and know that vapor trails are not always visible due to air temperatures but jet aircraft cannot change directions that quickly.  I hope someone else saw this as well.

I became very excited and ran out back to get a better view. When I opened the back door, my mom heard this and woke up. She was amazed at it as well. She figured it was something to do with Ft.Lewis (the gigantic forested army base within 1 mile from our neighborhood, Northwest Landing). I made no reservations as to what it was. The shape changed, rather, the angle changed as I went out back to get a better look. From then on, it just looked like a blob of vaguely 3 orange lights in a triangle pattern. Within about 15 minutes, it had moved somewhat to my right. I noticed this because when I went back to my room, it had become obscured by the roofline of the house, meaning that it moved to the right. Another interesting thing is that the orangeness emmitted a glow. Together, the 3 oranges formed a saucer shaped halo in the sky. It looked so much like a street lamp just sitting there. That is what mostly caught my attention, the aura of it. I knew it was not a star or a satellite or a helicopter or an airplane. It was completely unique.

The objects appeared as a shadow in the sky and perhaps the size of a small plane but did have some allumination but not brightly lit. They seemed to be rectangular in shape but hard to say for sure because of the darkness. It appeared that we were looking at the underbelly of the craft as they headed in a north westerly direction. There was no sound of any kind. The most unusual observation was the manner in which they moved. They zig-zaged and criss-crossed in a way we had never seen any aircraft manover before. As they  moved further away into the distance they appeared as a bright light, continued to zig-zag then disappeared in the horizon.

Fiery object emits fire like objects that float down to ground. On December 24, 2002 I pulled up to one of my friends house, him and another friend said they were going up to the construction site of a new hospital where my friend worked as the night secuirty guard. (Only person at the site at night) The security guard had called terrified, babbling, and literally crying that a UFO was hovering over his office(the guard is 6'2 and weighes around 200 lbs.)  I immideately drove to his work located about a mile and a half from where I was at.  On the way up I saw an orange light in the sky but thought that it probably was just a airplane and didn't notice when it must have disappeared. When we got up to the hospital the security guard was still hysterical and was trying to tell us what it looked like and what it was doing.  We kind of joked with him for about ten minutes when we all went into his office that was located in a modular next to the hospital.  I called my father who is the chief of one of the fire departments in town and asked him if he would call dispatch and see if anyone had reported anything.  One of my other friends called his girlfriend on the office phone.  The guard sat down in his chair and said to me I was looking out this window when I first saw it, as the security guard pointed out the window to show me where, he said, ""Oh my god there it is again"". When I looked out the window I saw an orange light that was bright orange.  It was somewhere around six hundred feet off the ground and about a mile away.  I could not pick out a shape of the object only that it was emmiting a light that looked like fire and that it was coming closer.  I immediately called my dad who lives up on a hill about the same distance away and told him that I didn't know what this thing was and for him to try to see it from his advantage.  Then the UFO started emitting little tracer fire balls that looked like they were floating down (swaying back and forth).  It must have dropped around 8 of these.  I then became frantic when my friends started screaming in terror as this object is slowly coming towards us.  My parents immediately hung up on me when they heard my friends screaming to come to where we were at.  At this time I felt that it was time to leave so we ran to the cars.  As we were running a car came over the horizon and the UFO dissappeared like turning off a light bulb in a dark room. Friends of ours and my parents and grandfather arrived shortly and we stayed there for a while but it never came back.  The security guard said that when saw the UFO the first time a car stopped alongside the highway to watch.  But never heard any other reports.  Would love to know if anyone has seen anything similar in the North eastern California, South eastern Oregon, or North west Nevada area.  swanpig_33@hotmail.com",2003-03-11T00:00:00,40.57106543209876,-120.61862962962964

""They said if there had of been any change in direction, meaning towards them. They don't think either of them would have been able to move"". Large, very bright white lights were noticed shinning on the water, and this is what caught their attention to the craft. Since the object was so low, and casting a bright light onto the water, it lit up a good sized area which made a portion of the object visible to them. No other lights were reported being seen, other than what they saw hitting the water's surface. It made no sudden moments until it gradually gained altitude to climb up over the mountain. The men witnessed this event for approx: 2 minutes. I witness said they both knew for certain that what they were looking at was no normal aircraft that they new of, mainly due to it's size and speed.

A couple driving home from Prince Rupert to Terrace, B.C. and approx: 85  kilometers west out of Terrace when they witnessed a huge object travelling north across the Skeena River. (HBCC UFO Note: The Skeena River widens out a lot at this point and can be up to two miles or more across the valley as it heads to the ocean). The object itself was dark in color, or black. Again what caught the attention of the motorists was the bright lights which were seen on the bottom of the object. Two large, almost rectangular lights could be seen glowing from the bottom of the object. Also they said it moved so very slowly which they found really strange. When I talked with the husband, he said he wanted to pull over to get a better look as he was driving, but his wife was frightened, crying and ""insisted"" that he keep going and quickly. No noise again was reported coming from the object, but the couple were in their car travelling around Highway #16. It was certainly a disk shaped craft. He also mentioned that there were other vehicles on the road at the time, (not many) and someone else must have seen it. The sighting lasted for approx: a minute and a half at the most from what he told me. I asked the husband roughly how high the object was off the ground as it travelled. He said it was high enough to clear all the mountains in the area. (HBCC UFO Note: On this route from Prince Rupert to Terrace you travel straight through the West Coast Mountain range which is very rugged. I am not sure as to the elevation where this event took place, but it would have to be around 2500 to 3000 feet. I will be checking this out as well. I plan to meet with all of the witnesses just as soon as the weather cooperates. Anyway, this gives everyone an idea of what just took place, three reports, one coming from Vancouver Island, Kitimat and in between Terrace & Prince Rupert all on the same night. Plus there is not a lot of time difference between each of the sightings. When I meet with these folks I will see if they can draw a rough sketch of what they saw, and of course try to get a lot more detail on these sightings.

This man, a logging truck operator left the town of Houston driving up the Morice River Road heading approx: 100 kilometers out across the Reach to pick up a load of logs. He went on to say when he reached the 30 kilometers mark on the Morice River Road,  he witnessed  ""one"" bright white light high in the sky heading in his direction. As the light got closer to him, he watched the light split up into two parts, with both pieces flying in different directions. He said one part went west and the other east. What was so amazing was that the two lights shot back up into the sky and disappeared. The sighting lasted approx: 6 to 7 seconds at the most. He was so surprised and excited at what he just saw, he got on the trucks radio and asked other drivers on the road if anyone had witnessed what he just did. Two other drivers who were in the same area reported back to him that they also witnessed the same thing. HBCC UFO Note: I have the name of one of the other drivers and will be speaking to him tomorrow to take his report.

I received a report from a witness (today - May 17, 2003) who resides in Houston, B.C.. One witness on his way to the Huckleberry Mine outside of Houston. At approx: 70 kilometers south from town he saw a multi colored object sitting in one position in the distance a head of him. He said to me that he thought it was a bright star due to it twinkling different colors. But after a second or two he thought it could not be that as it was totally over cast. The fellow said he had some extra time before he had to be at his work place, so he stopped and watched the lights for approx: 4 to 6 minutes before it dropped down suddenly behind a mountain. He also claims that the lights dropped ""straight"" down rather quickly. Because he was at a distance from it, he certainly could not hear any sounds coming from the thing. The lights/object did not make any sudden movements, it just sat in the one position before disappearing behind the mountain. In the area there are no towers, or anything else which would cause any strange lighting. The area in question is very rugged and wild.  HBCC UFO Note: When the chap was telling me the story, I first thought it may have been a star also, but after hearing it was a overcast night/morning and hearing that the lights/object dropped quickly straight down behind a mountain, I kind of ruled out this sighting as being a star.

I was sitting at home, my girlfriend was at a girlfriend of hers, and she came in early with her friend. They had been sitting on the roof terras drinking and chatting as  my girlfriend looked up and saw a triangle or diamond shaped luminous object. Color was like all colors of the prisma, but subtle like a cut diamond. The objects were at least 5 a 6 times the size of the biggest stars we could see As they where looking at it they spotted a few more. She told me to come outside and see for myself. They spotted at least 6 other objects but 2 of them I have seen with my own eyes. IF you looked very concentrated it looked as if there were three light or that they where triangle. One of the objects was in front of the house and one on the other side of the house. The distance was far, but objects were subtle changes in color. In the south of the Netherlands were i live, we don't have so much light pollution and it was a clear sky, so the view was perfect. The object on the northside of the house, was there for about 2 and a half hours. In a steady position, so stars where moving, but not the object. We ran a few times from the front to the back of the house, and i was also running in and out of the house posting messages on http://www.angularmomentum.net and ran upstairs to a friend of mine, the building is the old townhall of Hoensbroek, so we live with few more people there. I asked the guy if he ever seen a ufo, his girlfriend was there too, and she thought I was joking, I got them to the window on the other side from where they live and the object was there. Clearly visible. My friend looked at me in disbelieve, but his girl was enthousiast what she seen. I ran down again and one of hour neighbours who was walking the dog late, was curious what we where looking at, when I explained she was like totally amazed. Stars dont twinkle like this object did and it was there already for at least 25 minutes. We where thinking it could have been a plane in the beginning, because we have a lot of awacs flying over.! We got Seedorf, brunssum and other american milletary basis in the neighbourhood. But when we saw a airplane fly over, we had a good reference that it wasn't an airplane. On Januari the 27 2003, we have seen the same object in another place, but relatively near the one that we were seeing on the northside (front) the 15 of april. That object was slowly descending, we had to get home, and we weren't sure, so we lost interest. Anyway, The plane crossed our viewpath of the object, so that must give you some poor reference how far it was. I can't tell you how far the object was, but it must have been at least 3 or 4 kilometers. I am not experienced observator. I talk about this stuff on message boards, but never have seen actually until I moved to the south.  We have been watching for half an hour and i have been checking on it every ten minutes and it was there until a two hours later when. I am sure we will have more sightings here because I have seen three of them on two occasions, but my girlfriend has seen more as she had a better view from that roof terras.  Maybe i can ask her if she can send you guy's a report, because she has seen objects coming out of objects, but that was high up in the athmosphere. Also satellites were that night clearly visible. I am from Amsterdam and there is no stars in the sky, to much traffic lights, here in Hoensbroek you can look at the milky way, quite amazing.  I talked to my friend upstairs a few days later and he told me he had never seen anything like it.

I talked with a witness twice, but today ( May 21, 2003) I received the rest of the story on the sighting the two witnesses had which took place between April 20th and the 24th. I was very interested to see what the exact date would have been for their sighting, as I had a good report come into me of a large triangular craft which was seen approx: 2 kilometers east of Houston, B.C. on April 21, 2003. The witness I chatted with today was not completely sure of the exact date her and her husband witnessed, but it could have been on April 21, 2003.  I telephoned the witness I met today ( May 21, 2003) and made arrangements to meet at their home to discuss what it was they saw. This sighting took place approx: 8 minutes west of Houston. These folks, who I can say are very credible people and have a beautiful home sitting on a large parcel of land. The view they have of the surrounding area is really something. They also have a great view of the Telkwa mountain range where so many strange lights/objects have been seen.  We sat down and she proceeded to tell me the details of what was seen that night. The couple had already put their young children to bed earlier, and they were getting themselves ready for bed when the wife went to close their bedroom curtains when she saw a tight cluster of lights just sitting stationary in the sky, and not very far from their farm. The formation of lights also were not that high in the sky. She called to her husband to come and have a look with her, and he also was shocked at what he was seeing and could not figure out what the lights were. He proceeded to go and grab his binoculars and they both took turns viewing the lights. As they now had a better, and closer look at the lights, I was told that although it was dark, they could see a shape to the object. It looked like the letter ""C"", but with lights on the outside, or the curved surface of the object. The colors of the lights went from a yellow/white, red and green. Another interesting thing about the lights were that each light took it's turn growing in brightness. This continued on for some time while the object sat in the one position. They also told me that the object did not move from it's position. The sighting lasted for approx: 20 to 30 minutes. (HBCC UFO Note: Due to the length of time the object/lights sat in the one position, I wondered if it could have been bright stars they may have been observing, but they told me that they told me whatever it was, was sitting far to low, and pretty close to their location. Both of them thought the object may have been hovering over highway #16, or at least close to it which is not far from their farm. Also other objects in the sky did move slightly (stars) and this object did not move as they had it lined up with a popular tree on their farm). They did open the window to see if any sound could be heard coming from it, but nothing. I also asked if they noticed any kind of reactions coming from the pets they have, and none was noted. Object/lights seen in the southwesterly portion of t! he night sky.  After watching this for a while, they closed over the curtains and went to bed, but having this still on their mind the wife got up and peeked out the window shortly after they settled in for the night and the object was gone. She told me this really frightened her, now wondering what it was they were looking at. I am sure many or all will not remember a sighting back in August 23, 2002 of a HUGE object in which these same folks witnessed, and captured on video. Not a half hour after she shot the video, and doing the rest of the dishes, she noticed another object and again caught this on tape. And I have viewed the tapes, and have them both here with me. So these local residents are seeing some strange things here in Houston, B.C.  Thank you to the witnesses for their report. Computer images, maps, etc.. of this object will be posted to my website soon.   Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

I was coming home from work after midnight like I have done for the last 4 years.  I was headed south, and from the east, I saw 2 lights approaching.   The 2 lights where up in the sky, but not too high.  So my first response was that it was lifeflight (the helicopter used to fly critically ill patients from accident scenes), but then the thing got close enough for me to see that it was not a helicopter or a plane.  This thing was really weird; So I reached for my cell phone and called my supervisor back at the hospital because I knew she would be awake and I could talk to her.  I kept thinking no way!  But this thing was right there.  It was round, but it had edges kinda like an octagon, but I could not count how many sides it had.  It was pretty big. The thing stopped on top of the high way (13), but a little to the right, so I was not directly under it, but could see it perfectly.  Now I could see that it had 4 yellow light on the outside of the body and one big red one in the middle.  The one in the middle had a beam of light coming down, but the beam was not red, it was yellow. When I say yellow, I do not mean yellow like a banana, I mean yellow like a regular light.  I slowed my car down, but I did not stop, I was scared.  My supervisor, who I was describing this to, asked me if it made any sound, and I could not hear any sound, even after rolling the window down. Then, the thing started rocking back and forth and the beam appeared to be sweapping from side to side over the highway.  It did this 5 times, then, it was still again, and it took off in the same direction that it came, first slowly, then it totally disappered.  I described the whole thing to my supervisor, we both were laughing, and I kept thinking, no way!  But it did happen.  I was not the only person wh! o saw it, there was also a car driving north, and I saw them stop too, but I did not talk to them. I kept driving home, and forgot about what I had seen.  This is what keeps freaking me out.  I forgot to tell anybody about the experience until I talked to my supervisor and she reminded me.  I think the experience was just too traumatic for me to remember.  After I was reminded, however, I remember the whole thing, I just wish I had pictures or something because I know how unbelievable my story sound.  I am an honest person, actually, I am the most honest person I know, and anyone that I have told my story to believe me because anyone who knows me knows that I would not want to be perceived as a psycho.

Huge cylindrical object paced airliner for at least half an hour off the coast of Portugal.,East Atlantic Ocean,,2003-05-09T17:00:00,cylinder,30 MINUTES,"Occurred : 5/9/2003 17:00  (Entered as : 05/09/03 17:00) Reported: 5/18/2003 4:11:00 PM 16:11 Posted: 5/27/2003 Location: East Atlantic Ocean,  Shape: Cylinder Duration:30 MINUTES",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28834.html,"Huge cylindrical object paced airliner for at least half an hour off the coast of Portugal. The object was sighted by two eighteen year olds on a flight which left Tenerife in Spain at 15.20 local time and landed at Manchester airport in England at 19.20 G.M.T. Around 17.00 G.M.T. the young lady looked out of the window and down at the sea.It was a cloudless sky with good visibility.The aircraft was at cruising altitude and speed.She was amazed to see a long cylindrical shape which appeared to be under the water.At first she thought that it might be a very long chain of dark grey rocks but quickly realised that this was not the case because she could see both ends of the cylindrical shape which was keeping pace with the aircraft in which she was travelling.The aircraft was probably cruising around 600miles per hour.The object was definitely not visible when she first looked out of the window while they were over the sea.The enormous size of the object was only made apparent when a large ship sailed diagonally across the object.She estimated the object to be at least 40 times the length of the ship.The object's shape was in the ratio of 12(length)to 1(width). The young man accompanying her also saw the object.They were concerned that it may have been a trick of the light through the window and so they looked from different positions through that window and then they took another look through an adjoining window.It was still visible.After watching the shape for around half an hour and being unable to resolve the mystery,they gave up watching it.Please note that they assumed the object was beneath the water because they could not see anything below them which could be casting such a huge shadow on the ocean.As a U.F.O. researcher of many years experience,I consider it highly unlikely that the object was travelling at 600 mph beneath the surface, although I suppose that anything is possible for the E.T.s.We do have two cases from a couple of years ago in Cheshire,England;where pilots in light aircraft were overtaken by a triangular shadow on the ground below them.Despite urgent efforts by the pilots to locate the craft responsible, no other aircraft were visible at any time.Therefore the E.T.s employ stealth technology which makes them invisible to the human eye but at the same time casts a shadow on the ground below.I believe that the same scenario could apply in this case.The two young people concerned wish to remain anonymous and were reluctant to tell me about the event.I have reported it to you in the hope that someone else may have seen the same thing or something similar on another occasion.The problem with this type of sighting is that the object seen appears to be too big to be feasible,and so such reports are probably seldom made. ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS)) #1 Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),  Thank you very much for the report.  Were you sitting on the left side, or the right side, of the aircraft, please?  Cordially,   PD Dear Mr Davenport,                           In answer to your question,the two witnesses were  sitting on the right side of the aircraft,and in front of the wing.                                     Best Wishes------------ ((name deleted)) #2 Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),  Thank you for the prompt response.  Based on your description of the ""object,"" combined with the new information you provide below, I suspect that you were observing a shadow cast by your aircraft, and the presumably short contrail generated behind it.  I doubt that a sub-marine ""UFO"" would track your aircraft over several hundreds of miles.    Also, you may have observed a bright spot at the head of the elongate image you saw.  Is that the case, by any chance?   Thank you for the added information.  We probably will post your report, but we will qualify the object as a probable non-UFO.  Cordially,  Peter Davenport ((END)) ((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS)) Dear Peter,                With reference to your reply,for which I thank you.The proposal that the U.F.O. was a shadow from the plane does not seem to me to be the likely cause.The reason being that the plane was at cruising altitude.At 30,000 feet,I would have been surprised that any shadow from the plane could have been discerned on the ground.Also,please bear in mind that the shadow or whatever it was ,appeared to be a very dark grey in colour as if the source of the shadow was quite close to the sea.There were no bright spots anywhere on the shadow.I fully accept that there may be a perfectly  sensible explanation for all this,but as yet I do not believe that we have found it.If you enter this case on your notice board I would not blame you in the slightest if you qualified it as a probable non-U.F.O.

I looked up into the night sky to see what if any stars I could see when I saw the following:  From my vantage point I could only see the shape of a square bottom surface about seventy five feet by seventy five feet and nine circles in a 3 x 3 grid. Each circle was protruding from the bottom like a squared edged donuts about 5 feet deep. All were the same size and equally spaced apart.  The object seemed to be floating above the south edge of the airport at about one hundred to one hundred fifty feet. It moved very slowly across the sky about five to ten miles per hour toward the west.  The object had no lights at any point during my viewing. The only way I was able to see any details at all was due to the light reflected from the surface.  I felt no magnetic or electrical fields, but I was never directly under the object.  As I watched the object float by, I moved to get a better view, it never picked up its pace or altered its altitude. I heard a door open and saw my friend come outside to say good bye to me, I ran up to her and pulled her into the street to show her. She did not see what I saw because as I showing her the object, it became blocked by the trees. I ran futher down the street with her in tow and although I could still see the object, it was hard for her to see it as it had no lights. I ran us back to the house and jumped in my car and tried to follow it but as it was not following a street it soon was gone from my sight as well.  I can give no reason why this airport would be of interest because as of now, it's closed down and a new airport is in operation. The only US Air Force base was just a reserve station at the time and shut down soon after Desert Storm. It became Austin's new airport.  I finally writing about this because I've never seen anyone else describe a square object, and I thought someone else may have seen something similar. It has always made me wonder exactly what it was that I saw. I know I'll never know but the experience was awesome. I keep looking up in the night sky to see what I can find.  As for me, I have spent most of my life around US Air Force bases. My father served and I served as well. For the first 28 years of my life I lived on or near a base. I watched SR-71's lift off from a California base, U-2's from a Florida base, I was on the Cape to watch a Shuttle launch, seen countless air shows, and once I saw a F-117 take off from a Texas base in broad day light. The F-117's profile was so strange I thought I was seeing my second UFO, but then it banked I saw the wing shape. My job during active duty was in electronics and communication devices, during my reserve years I loaded aircraft, C-130's to C-5's.  I like to think that I know aircraft, I've built many models and continue to keep up with new aircraft design, as best as an ex-military man can. Generally I know what I'm looking at when I look up into the sky but on this occassion I did not have one clue. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The area it was in is protected airspace as it was under the flight path of McCarran International Airport. The course it was on would have taken it past Sunrise Mt. and directly over Nellis AFB. The local news did air a report that night of a green light sighted, however it was reported some 15 miles north of where I saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As I drove up on to the canal I looked to the west I could see that the beams were still moveing east at me.The major surprize was to come,as I looked down the canal to the north-west a huge black object,about the size of two football fields moving east also.No lights,no noise.At this point I went back to the road because I was not going under this thing.It was about 1000 yards away from me at the road as it passed in front of me the beams fanned out about 500 feet in front and rear of the object,so as I watched the object the first beams were comeing over my head.I waited until this thing went down the road before I went into the field,and let me tell you I DIDNOT WANT TO GO!Anyway these lights reappeared three months later,no ""ship"" just lights over my back yard in Delhi Ca.and they were up much higher,about 2000 feet but cars on hiway 99 were stopping on the side to look at them.At this time there was ten spikes of light.I see these things about three times a year and it's only one at a time,I wish to know of anyone else has seen things,I wish I had called the police on the first time and had a witness to my story.I tried to write Siteing show but no response.

About 6:35AM i had just passed outside the village of elbridge,ny on rte 5,approaching the hill going towards camillus,ny. i approached  some high power lines going across the road (near pirro brother's ford dealership,feeks rd) and i see a large object between the 3 suspended wires. at first i thought it was a large balloon craft,but there was no basket attached. i looked at it trying to figure out what it was? my mind was searching for a familiar object to answer my question. as i got closer to it,i discovered that the object was a ""PERFECT TOP"" shape(like a kid's top) and it was a beautiful copper color like polished copper pipe. to give you a idea of the size,stretch your arm out directly in front of yourself and spread your fingers out wide. it was as tall in the sky as the distance between your pinky to your thumb(8-9""high). i estimate the distance away, at 1 mile, and a about half mile high to the right and away from route 5.so,it was quite large. size was very hard to judge because there were no wheels,antennae,pipes,etc,it was just a ""DIVINE SHAPE"",a perfect example of ""SACRED GEOMETRY"". the most divine thing i've ever seen. then,my mind continued inquiring""WHAT IS IT?"" then,the hair on the back of my neck started to stand on end. ""OH MY GOD,IT""S A UFO""!. this is a very creepy feeling to look at something that big in front of you and not know what it is. it's very twilight zonish.then my mind said ,""duh!,that's why they call them""UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS"". at that moment i realized the very ""meaning"" of those words. i didn't know if it was a craft,an entity or what.i continued to drive up the hill.looking back and to the right and seeing it. i felt safer driving and watching it,i didn't feel good about stopping the car and getting out and looking at it,i think i ! was worried about getting beamed onboard. another unusual thing was it was perfectly ""still"" in the sky,it did not move an iota. anything manmade moves in the sky.this was strange also,i was the only one on the highway that saw it,i kept looking to see if anyone else stopped or slowed down. there were cars ahead of me and behind me on both sides of the road. NO ONE ELSE SAW IT ! . i got farther down the road to route 690 and finally got to work. i couldn't wait to tell my 4-5 co-workers i knew i could trust in confidence. when i walked in to the office we had a group meeting,with 25-30 guys,so i couldn't say anything immediately,there were too many guys. during the meeting  a ""bizarre"" thing happened to my memory. I COMPLETELY FORGOT THE UFO AND DIDN""T REMEMBER IT UNTIL APRIL !5TH. my mind went completely blank for 2 and a half months!  On april 15th,i was home watching ""unsolved mysteries"" and all of a sudden it ""clicked in"",i told my nephew jim that i had seen a large MOTHERSHIP and had never told anyone! i couldn't believe i had forgotten it for 2 and a half months! i called the state police and reported it,also i wanted to know if anyone else had seen it. no one had. i also called a lady(an abductee) in syracuse that took UFO REPORTS. she told me that my memory lapse was completely normal and that it happens all the time. i didn't have any ""missing time"" that i'm aware of. this is not the end of the story. in october of 1999 i met a clairvoyant in border's bookstore in syracuse,she had just recently written a book on future incarnations called""sparks through time"". i went to her booksigning and lecture.at the lecture i won a free clairvoyant reading from her. i told her i would call her at a later date after i figure out what i wanted to ask. i gave her no previous information. on december 13,1999 i called her and carefully phrased my questions. i asked if she could give me the significance of an incident that happened jan 30th 1995 at 6:35 AM in elbridge,ny. she contacted her guides and paused for a! few moments and then announced,""YOU HAVE BEEN SHOWN THE PRESENCE OF ALIENS!"". i was completely flabbergasted,it was so absolutely true,it just blew my mind she said that! she had verified my experience. she also told me that this was my 3rd experience(i don't remember the 1st two,it may have happened when i was a kid).but,it was also not my last either,i have others coming up in the future. this is not the end of the story. in february of 2001,my artist friend jack and i went for a ride and retraced the original ride and area so that he could do a painting of the original UFO site. we took many pictures from different angles,i wanted him to capture what i actually saw that january 30th morning. i told jack let's take a ride to the area a mile away which would have been exactly and directly under the UFO. from route 5,we turned right on lynch rd,went about 3/4 of a mile to the "" t "" and turned right on to halfway rd(i had never been in this area before). i told jack the that the UFO was still a ways a way and the very next left and half mile up that road would be where the ufo would have been. as we approached the next road,a tingling sensation went up my back and jack's also.THE NEXT ROAD WE WE TURNING ONTO,WHERE THE UFO WAS, WAS""CAMPBELL"" RD(my last name). the topped shape-UFO had hovered over CAMPBELL RD like a gigantic exclamation point pointing the way. jack and i took this as a major sign and and confirmation of what i saw. after i saw this,i never had any doubts about my ""vision"" and that i was supposed to see this as part of my spiritual growth. this story is the absolute truth as i know it.

I was assigned to the communications dept. Our Department and the Air ops Department had interchanged personel in the CDC prior to a upcoming deployment for a better relationship and understanding of each others jobs. Our ship set sail to a military operations area known as the SOCAL Naval Operations area. During one of the nights I went to the I had went to the smoking sponson on the outskirt of the ship. There were 8 other people pointing to the sky I looked up and saw a very odd triangle shaped object with 3 distinct light at each point moving very unusally. They Ask how are our jets moving like that. I had told them that our ship had not launched a jet nor even had any to launch and we were on a ship board training mission and did not envolve any aircraft. Also that we were alone in the entire Operations area. No other Ships or Aircraft was in the area for days. We had stared at the object abit then I had went to get a freind to witness this. At that time I realized I was in a place to go catch this on a radar. I went back to the Air ops station in the CDC and told the radar specialist to look at this object. He Stated that is was nothing other then a invalid track. I ask what makes this invalid. He had stated that the object was at 1200kph and speeding up to a unrecordable speed by our radar system thus for the system reports as invalid. I ask why then the system displayed it as a fixed wing craft. He stated for some reason the the object had a IFF system aboard. It was stating that is was a comercial aircraft. Something like a beoing 707. I had logged our current position and the path of this object and it was on a desert course towards the state of Nevada. The Obejct was large Triangle and had 3 unusual looking white lights. Being around many aircraft when i was watching this object move i was looking closely and the craft did have any port,starboard,foreward or aft light systems.

PD))   Triangular craft followed on foot, and gray at my window. Seperate and presumably unrelated experiences Hello Again.  I have decided to contact you about another of my past sightings. I never remember the exact dated, I probably should be writing them down, but at the time of the event I never seem to think about that, only wishing that I had a camcorder or decent camera to capture my experience. It was again in the summer, and later in the evening probably about 11:00 and my brother, and long time friend were outside looking at the night sky. Because the three of us have a history of being in the right place at the right time we often look for ufo's. Most of the time we go inside without any remarkable events, but sometimes we do see something we can't explain. Most of the things I've seen were just odd lights behaving oddly, and could be anything really. But this one time it was definately a craft of uncommon design. Now weather it was experimental earthbound technology or extraterrestrial I will never know. As I stated in my previous posting that I live in the vacintity of sevral air ports both commertial and military, as well as sevral military bases, and I would assume sevral more that I'm not aware of. So here's the story. We were outside, when my friend looked up over the treeline and saw a large low altitude low speed triangular object. It had a red light at each corner, and it made absolutely no sound. It seemed to drift, and sort of reminded me of the way one of those toy hovercrafts moves, but with more stability. It was about 100 or 200 feet above the treeline and moved at a rate slow enough that we could walk and keep up with it. No sound or exhaust what so ever. We followed it around the block for about thirty minutes after watching it for about 10 or 15 in our front yard before it moved off in a direction that we did not have street access to follow, and so we watched it as it dissapeared in the distance. Of all the sightings I have had, that was the first where the actual body of the craft was visible. It was very large, about 200 feet acrost, and moved in a slow lazy fascioun, sort of like the occupants had no worries about being seen. As I above stated about the glut of local airports large and small, there was no way in hell that what ever we saw was unnoticed by radar towers, and other people. Being the most up close and personal encounter of such a large and obvious craft in the sky, I am asking anyone reading on this board who is also from Fayetteville NC, or surrounding cities who may have seen a similar object in the summer of 95-98, I'm pretty sure it was within those years but don't remember exactly when. It was before I got my first computer in late 98, and before playstation took hold in the video gaming community so that should give you a basic esitmate when I saw it. I regret not remembering the exact times and dated when I have these sightings. I know it makes it hard for you guys to make a thourough documentation. As of this night when I have newly found this forum I am going to make better documentation of my sightings. I bought a digital camera for the reason of taking pictures of them. howerver it is a cheap 50$ camera and preforms so poorly in low light conditions I am not going to bother to use it to take pictures of ufo's, after all since it's digital there can come the accusation of altering them, and I know some about computer graphics so I could, and since the quality is so poor it could be anything. So to not give myself the reputation of a hoaxer looking for publicity I will not bother to send any pictures. However I could draw pictures, but that's really no better than my descriptions. I am very very interested in looking up sightings from my area of the US in hopes to find someone describing similar sightings. I know that If I see something, there is a good chance someone else did as well. Something is definately going on. Black book experiments, physical extraterrestrials, or demonic desception are all theories I have come acrost in my personal research, and truthfully there is no data that leans the case in one direction or the other. I have not only seen objects in the sky, but a being at my window. I was in fifth grade when that happened so that would make it around 94 or 95. I saw this triangular craft after the window encounter. The odd thing about that is that It was late in the evening before the sun went down and I had been up all night. I had the blinds pulled up, and a bunk bed that raised me perfectly level with the window. As I went to pull down the shades a thought hit me, and I thought something to the tune of. ""Why bother? Leave it up. It's not like you're going to actually see anything. and there's a large bush and tree in front of my window so on one is going to look in on me from the street."" So I was in bed and I had dozed off for a few hours. By the time I woke up it was dark. and I know I wasn't asleep because I lay there with my eyes open, view of the window blocked my my blankets debating on getting up or going back to sleep. When I finally decided to get up, I saw up and saw it. It was a very odd experience because I only cought a glimps of it for about a second before I threw my head back under my blankets and began praying to every God I could think of to not let something grab me. I had a vertigo almost tunnle vision, where my perriferal vision was blurred, and somewhat blocked, and there was an odd time distortion feeling. I can't exactly explain it but it seemed like time slowed down in the second I looked at this thing. I later found out from my brother that this which I was describing was known as ""the oz factor."" and is quite common. At the time he rea! d more UFO and paranormal books than I did. I wasn't much of a reader back in those days. What I saw was a pearly white almost luminous though it didn't appear to be glowing. I could not see the tree of bush behind it, only a inky black void, and it seemed like it and I were all that existed in my sences at the time. I didn't recieve any telepathic communication, no words in my head. but thinking back on it I didn't get a hostile feeling from it, only the fear of actually seeing an alien. It had the usual diamond shaped bulbous head, it had no nasil opening, no nose protrustion or mouth. In fact I got the impression that I was looking at some sort of mask because it was very smooth, and almost had a designed look to it. The eyes were a glassy black, but they were not slanted tear drop shaped like you commonly hear described. They were flat on the top and bottom, rounded on the inside edges and wrapped around the sides of the head like sunglasses, or more accurately a dragonfly's eyes. So I threw my head under my blankets, too scared to move a muscle or make a peep wondering which was worse it being there to take me or there to put me back, and I'm not sure how much time i lay there before I got the courage to take a look to find nothing was amiss. Needless to say I got the hell out of that room pronto, and stayed up all night clutching a butcher knife. I must say that it was that event that sparked a great deal of my curiosity. I had known about UFO's before and seen strange lights, but never an encounter so up close and personal with something that I could not explain away as a shooting star, or satelight, or unidentified form of uncommon airplane, not exactly one that is top secret but one uncommon enough to not be identified as an airplane. Now I have nightmares, and have had all my life, some of them of UFO themes, but I do not notice any missing time, or have any screen memories or abduction memories, so either I am not an abductee, or I don't remember the events. I would like the first of the two to be true. I know this is a rather lingthy post describing the two most undeniable encounters I have had with unknown beings. I have not seen any odd lights since at least 2000, and I have never before or since seen an actual alien being. I do have a 3d rendering of what I saw, which I don't even like to look at because of how well I reproduced what I remember seeing. It still scares me to this day. Someone please tell me where I can locate others who are sincere about their experiences where I can relate and recieve stories and compaire and contrast. Something is going on, and it's only a matter of time before we find out what it is.",2003-06-18T00:00:00,35.03683522123894,-78.92246247787611

I then ran back outside by then my brother had waken up and went outside(my dad was away on business). I then spotted the craft moving at the same speed and in the same direction. The rest of my family was able to pick it out of the starry sky. Near the end of the siting I could actually see a small, faint outline beetween the three points of lights. We followed it until it was 3/4 of the way across the sky it then started to vanish. This was one truly AMAZING siting.

PD)) Bright yellow object in southern sky moved around constantly for 35 minutes while maintaining its position above the earth. Observed what appeared to be a star at first, but it was bright yellow, which seemed odd. Object was approximately 60 degrees above the horizon, and in a southerly direction from my vantage point. I saw it move and assumed it must be an airplane or helicopter, but after ten minutes of observation, its location did not appear to have changed, although it seemed to be moving from side to side. In fact, it was bobbing all over the place, although it never moved more than approximately 4 to 5 times its own diameter. I observed it for at least twenty minutes, and it was moving almost the entire time, i.e., it would remain stationary for five or ten seconds at a time, and then resume motion. At first I thought I might be imagining it, or that some atmospheric condition was creating the illusion of motion, but it's a very clear night here, and cool, and I'm now convinced that the object was moving, although in general it appears to be stationary relative to the earth. It's now 5:11 am EST. I'm going outside to see if it's still there. It's now 5:15 am. It's still there, and in the same position. If it's a star, it seems that it should be in a different position by now, 36 minutes after I first observed it. Also, I noticed that while there are a few stars visible in the northern sky, there are no stars visible in the southern sky where this object is located. I can't tell if it's overcast to the south - too much glare from the lights around the apartment complex. But whatever it is, it's still there and it's still bouncing around. That's about all I can tell you. It may be of interest to you that I live very close to Selfridge Air National Guard Base and there was an air show at the base from Friday through Sunday. I've lived here for 25 years and there have been persistent rumors about UFO activity around the base.",2003-08-01T00:00:00,,

I checked to see if the sky was blacked out within the triangle ?  Meaning that it was a Solid Object.  But NO...I could see Stars between them...so each was and individual light.  I have seen Satellites many times...but they travel alone.  Sometimes I've seen 2 Satellites traveling in different directions at the same time.  But NEVER have I seen 3 Satellites travel in formation ?!!!  PERFECT formation I might add !  I followed them as they headed South towards Orien's Belt...then as they moved on they started to fade...and then I lost them.  The sighting lasted about 1 minute or more.  Were these Satellites ?  Do Satellites travel in Perfect Triangular Formation ?  Did anyone else see these lights?

However, if the object moved, as reported below, the object could not have been a star, of course.  PD)) Large Glowing Orange Ball & Meteor Shower First let me say that I would have bet my life on the fact that I would never be reporting a sighting or anything resembling a UFO. It's taken me 4 days to get enough courage to even begin to explain what all I saw in the early morning hours of Nov. 19, 2002, approx 13 miles Southeast of Stover, Mo. First let me say that on this date, it is also Deer hunting season in Mo. At approx 1:30 AM my neighbor & I set out for a neighboring field where we usually hunt. We had left early so we could have a good view of the Leonid Meteor Shower and not have to venture far afterwards for hunting. We parked my truck at the west end of the field facing West as we were trying to get the light of the full moon behind us as the ""showers"" were to be best viewed from the East. We got in the bed of the truck with heavy sleeping bags that would hopefully keep us warm as I wanted the best view possible and boy did I get it. The beginning of the unusual sightings were not that impressive but changed quickly so now I'll try & explain what I saw. At approx 3:00-3:30 we saw what we first thought to be a plane rise from the tree tops on the west side of the field,(It had a milkly like appearance & was kind of pear shaped with what looked like 2 legs at the bottom) but there was no sound. This was approx 150-200 yds away. We both looked at each other like what is that!! It hovered there for about 30 seconds and then slowly rose straight up & very slowly headed South until out of site. Then every once in awhile you could see faint white objects resembling kind of the same shape just going back & forth accross the sky at different speeds & with no set pattern. At approx 4:15 at the southeast end of the field at ground level I saw what looked like a porch light or headlights through the trees. This area is completely wooded with no homes or buildings nearby. In maybe a 5 min span it flickered on & off 4-5 times then this HUGE GLOWING ORANGE BALL rose right out of the trees & stayed right at the tree tops swaying just a little back & ! forth an d never any sound at all. I wish I could accurately tell you how big it was but all I can save was it was unbelievable. I looked back over my shoulder once at the moon and this ball appeared to be maybe 1/3 the size BUT the Moon was a long way off and this ball was only about 800 yds away. Anyway this stayed in same position for about 10 minutes then rose up slowly about 80-100 ft or so & then just changed to a BRIGHT WHITE still in a ball shape. During the next 30 min it rose maybe 30-40 feet & then gradually changed its shape into kind of a rounded triangle or pear shaped with a pulsating light (only visible at times)from what looked to be a small protruding area on the center bottom. At 3 different times when this light would come on & back off it would then make the easterly sky appear as if daylight was approaching but just lasting a few seconds. The figure gradually rose straight up with a Very slight drift to the Southeast. This was a very bright & clear night and at 7:15 AM you could still see the object high in the sky but appeared to be a ball shape again. Also at about the same time the ball turned from orange to white a jet appeared from the west flying fairly low & at slower than normal speed, and what I thought to be an irregular pattern of the normal blinking lights that planes have when flying. Then it appeared to be stationary for 2-3 seconds & then at a high rate of speed it shot straight up & then immediately veered right & headed down directly towards the ball & then flew right around the back of it. Then went back east with a jet stream behind it as if nothing was unusual but within 5 minutes there was 5 or 6 jets in the air but none went as close as the first one had. They all had jet streams behind them & just kept flying randomly overhead until the object was just barely visible. The following morning at about daybreak 2 neighbors went within a mile of there & said they just saw a solid looking white ball fairly high in the sky. UPDATE: 11/24/02  I finally got up enough nerve to go back to the same spot to see if I might be to see this again & maybe take a few pictures. At 4:35 I saw the orange ball again & it appeared to be low but at a much farther distance. It immediately started rising up & went white & within 30 minutes or so it was so far up it almost looked like a bright star but was much bolder & solid looking than a star. It almost looked like it changed shape & also appeared to get brighter at times, but it was to far away to be certain of this. I took 4 pictures with my old 35 mm but as far away as it was I doubt if it shows much as it was hard to even detect it thru the lens. I'm sure this all sounds very weird but I give you my word this is the Gods truth. I was absolutely scared to death when the jet headed towards the ball as I had no idea what was going to happen. I'm hoping someone else spotted the same objects that I did!!!",2002-12-23T00:00:00,38.4409,-92.9919

It was a long time ago.  Probably Fall 1995 or Spring 1996.  The date and time I have listed is just for the purpose of being able to write this.  My husband and I left New York City heading east on Long Island Expressway.  Time was about 8 O'clock at night.  The sky was hazy with a low thin cloud which was faintly illuminated by city lights hanging may be about 1000 feet or less above.  About 5 miles after leaving the city I noticed four lights that at first I assumed are exhibit lights beamed from the ground.  The lights were formed in a shape of rectangle, each at one corner.  They each were doing a nervous kind of dance like circling an imaginary axel rapidly and every so often they all join each other at the center and cross over and go to the corners again.  At the same time the entire formation kept moving from one place to another with no pattern.  At first when I saw the lights they were about 100 ft. diagonally to the left of our car.  Then they moved up above our car and start moving in the same direction with us.  For the first few miles that the lights were moving with us, either directly above us or a little to the left or to the right, or a few feet ahead or back, I still looked at them thinking they are exhibit lights.  As we kept putting distance between us and the point when I first noticed them, I started to wonder what kind of exhibit lights would move this far without changing shape or losing brightness.  Furthermore I could neither see any beams nor could I hear or see any object in the sky to be source of these strange lights.  I started looking at them more intensely now and I mentioned to my husband that we are being followed by some lights.  Of course he laughed at me and refused even to look at them (he was driving).  The highway was at times very slow and at time it opened up so we could move faster.  The lights kept up the speed with us.  25 miles later, they were still with us.  Now I was quite aware of something strange going on and I felt having kind of a connection to them that I cannot even explain.  Another 10 miles a car very much like our car passed us and then where the highway forked ahead of us (right fork leading to another highway going south) drove quickly to the right heading south and the lights started following that car.  I was really very disappointed and told my husband that they lost us (of course he made fun of me again).  The lights went southward for about 1/4 of a mile and looked like they realized they have made a mistake and stopped, then started looking around by coming back a little and then going south again a little and stopping and just moving around.  Finally they gave up and kept going south and then eastward on the parallel highway to the south of our highway.  I could see them from distance.  I finally lost sight of them and we went to exist 63 (which is 55 miles from New York City).  Then we! wend south about a mile and picked up my stepson and two of his friends (ages from 9 to 13) and started heading back toward the Expressway.  I told the kids about the lights and they had a good laugh about it and made fun of me.  When we reached the Expressway, I saw the lights again.  They were standing right above Exit 63, I firmly believe waiting for us.  Our destination was heading West to Exist 41 which is about 35 miles from Exit 63, then going up North to Oyster Bay, about 9 miles.  Sure enough as soon as we got on the highway and headed west, the light started moving with us again.  They kept with us all the way to Exit 41.  When, at Exit 41, we got off the highway on the service road, I asked my husband to stop the car.  I wanted to know if the lights would stop.  And they did stop.  Now everyone else, even the kids were amased and exited by this and we all started waiving and talking to the lights and they stayed right above us doing their dance.  After 15 minutes we had no choice but heading home, we couldn't stay there all night and shouting without getting arrested.  As soon as we started so did the light.  We headed north and so did they.  They came north for about 3 miles with us until they had to stop.  The sky ran out of cloud and became clear with stars shining.  The lights stood at the edge of the cloud.  I kept looking at them for a few miles.  I could see that they gave up and finally went a little south first and then west toward New York City.  When I came home I was extremely curious also afraid to tell anyone without being suspected of being crazy.  I finally gathered up my nerve and called channel 12.  I wanted to know if there were similar sightings.  I spoke to the person who claimed to be the night eitor.  He did not take me seriously and brushed me off by saying  there has been report of light exhibits in the area.    I immediately hang up and since then until now I haven't told anyone.  We don't even discuss it among ourselves.  But this never left my mind.  I think about those lights often.  I recently logged into this site and I noticed some of the reports were not that far away from what I saw.  This is why I am writing.  I don't remember the day or the time exactly but I vividly remember every moment of the time lights moved with us and every move they made.  I saw the same lights again once more (even though I don't think they were the exact same lights) about 2 years later in Greece.  I was traveling on the highway by the water in Attiki.  Around Anavisos, which is about 20 miles east of Athens, I saw similar lights.  They came across the water and passed over us and kept going northward until they disappeared behind the hills.  Again no ground beams or anything in the sky (such as helicopter) that might have been the source of the lights at all.  I am a logical person and I have been trying ever since to explain this to myself but I have not been able to come up with anything.  I don’t think anyone else can either.",2003-06-18T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

I looked into the Northern part of the sky and saw a small, white dot in the sky moving rather slowly no flashing of lights, no colored lights, no cascading of any kind. This was a couple miles away, there were no sounds. It was traveling from the North where I first saw it to the West, towards Johnstown, PA. It seemed to mostly stay at the same speed but at varoius times it did decelerate when its speed increased it was where it left off no faster. It also kept it's original level flightline moving from my right to left. I was looking at it through binoculars and was moving laterally with it. About half way through this it either stopped or was now moving directly away from me. In my opinion it stopped because it didn't become smaller and harder to see. There was intermitent clouds but all in all it was clear and cool with a full moon. After it stopped it started to move back to where it was coming from the North. The speed seemed a little more accelerated at this point. Again same level flightpath. I kept viewing it while continuously moving to my left to get a better view. I also had to do this because it was going behind some large trees in my neighbors yard. I then lost total site of it but at that moment two other lights appeard where it seemed to stop one headed west one north. I stayed with the westward one because it was easier to view. This did flash white and red and could have been a plane. Whether or not it was something this object ejected or a plane I do not know.

I have also i think had a visitation to my room where i woke up with a paralysed feeling unable to move and i have done for years since i was a small boy.

I have a small room and it i easy to tell f there is someone in it. I heard a noise so i got out of bed to turn on my lamp. I flicked the switch and nothing worked  then i tried the mains switch which was on, still no joy.

Before he went on to tell me his story of what he witnessed, he first wanted to make it clear by telling me that he is a well grounded fellow. On the odd occasion when with a group of friends someone might bring up the idea of UFO, or that they may have observed one. The witness told me he would walk away and talk to some else, not believing there are unusual flying crafts out there. In other words very skeptical about the whole issue.  The man now explains to me that he has been re-thinking the whole idea after what he saw, which was very strange indeed.  On July 7, 2003 at 10:30 p.m. the witness took his dog out for a walk last Monday evening. He reached the corner of the street he resides on, heading towards the park which is across the street. Running diagonally from the witness, just above the streetlight poles at approximately 40 to 50 feet high the witness described seeing a Smokey gray colored object traveling slow over top of one of the homes in the area. He went on to say he had a good look at it due to it traveling slowly. The fellow described it as being approximately 25 feet in length with the head of it being wider than the tail and traveling maybe 10 miles per hour. The fellow also mentioned that it was not a bird, because he had such a good view of it as the sighting lasted for approximately 5 to 7 seconds. The witness said if he could sense anything about the object was that it had a slight whirling sound coming from it. (HBCC UFO Note: When I heard about the sound in which I object was making, I then asked if his dog took any notice of it, he said no). He went on to say he couldn't be 100 per cent sure the sound was coming from it due to the sound being so faint, but he was pretty sure. This sighting, he said stopped him dead in his tracks. The fellow mentioned that normally on his street folks sit out late when it is really nice out, but this evening of the sighting he said it was oddly quiet. The witness said, what I saw ""I could not explain"".  I would like to thank the witness for reporting their sighting to HBCC UFO.

I am an amateur astronomer. My wife spotted an object she thought was a planet very close to the moon. I walked outside and she asked me to look at the planet next to the moon. It was early twilight. I looked and saw what appeared to be a star or planet just at the edge of the moon. It was apparently just at the edge of the moon on the dark side of a 3/4 full moon. I watched it for maybe 30 seconds and during this time it did not move at all in relation to the moon. I was going through my mind to try and figure what planet it might be, but none came to mind that would be in that part of the sky. All of a sudden the object started moving in a direction which from my perspective was toward 2 O'clock in relation to the moon. It moved much to slowly to be a satellite. It was not possible to tell if it moved in front of or behind the moon as it passed the top 1/5 of the moon. In 5 minutes it moved a little more than the width of a hand at arms length. The whole time the brightness of the object was about what the star Sirius would appear like at that time of day and it did not waver. My wife went in and got a pair of 12x50 binoculars about 2 minutes into this sighting, in the binoculars the object was no more visible than it was without them. Then as we were talking about it the object at some point disappeared, but no one actually saw it when it did finally disappeared. I did manage one digital photograph of the object with my Olympus 5 megapixel C-5050, I am sending it to you although it does not look like much. The photo shows both the object and the moon.  We can only figure it was one of two things. A balloon which very coincidentally did an apparent hover right at the point that it was resting on the very edge of the moon on the dark side and then proceeded to apparently move on and finally dissapear. The other is that it was a huge spacecraft near the moon which decided to leave while we were looking. It was certainly not a star, planet, or satellite, and it was not an airplane or jet or space shuttle. If this was a spacecraft near the moon you most certainly will have other reports of it, as it was difficult to miss.",2003-07-16T00:00:00,39.14072038404727,-77.20584416543575

I've lived here two years and have spent lots of time viewing the stars from my patio on the top floor of a four story apartment building.  My apartment is in the Jardin Oceanico neighborhood (front) of Barra, one block from the beach, facing the Pedra de Gavea mountain.  I do not know what I saw and venture no theories, however, when surfing the net this morning to see if others saw it, I came across the report of another similar sighting in Barra that occured appx a week ago and decided only then to go on record.  I have never seen or reported any weird occurrences in the past, nor do I have any strong opinion as to whether the aliens that must surely be out there in the vast universe, spend there time buzzing the earth trying to freak us out.  Last night around 12:45a.m. after a bath and reading (ate at home, drank no booze or imbibed any other mind-influincing substances), I was getting ready to go to bed when I noticed it was unusually bright outside. The moon was about half full and coming up on the right side of the mountain. It is winter here and the night was beautiful with a clear view of the mountain, so I went outside to enjoy.  I immediately noticed an area about the size of a helicopter with lots of white blinking lights (strobe-like with no real pattern)and some non-blinking red colors mixed in that seemed to be fairly close, right above the mountain.  There are a lot of helicopters flying here all the time (the police patrol use large search lights to scan the ground and condos), so I assumed that's what it was and looked toward the beach enjoying the view.  When I  looked back,  the lights seemed to be coming closer as they were getting larger. I was thinking it was just a helicopter flying erratically, although I heard no noise.  All of a sudden a bunch of , perhaps six or so of them.  It looked like some sort of fireworks display.  They floated down slowly leaving straight trails of white light. (just like fireworks do)  My husband was sleeping and my 16 year old daughter was IM'ing friends back home.  I ran to my daughter's room and finally got her off the computer long enough to come look, and when we got back outside, the leading edge of some of the rows were still visibly and very bright white as they went out of sight behind some condos in front of the mountain. (looked like maybe some small pieces of wreckage, very hot, white coming to earth and not burning out before hitting the ground) However, the flashing lights were still in the sky, in the same spot but not as bright.  There are fireworks here all the time and at any time of the night and my daughter was like 'big deal, more fireworks' and headed back to her computer.  I sat down and watched the flashing lights, and they seemed to get farther away and not as bright fairly quickly. Then they started to get bright again. That's when I finally realized it wasn't a helicopter and got excited.  Should I wake my husband? Should I not? When the lights got brighter and seemed to be right above the mountain where the other display occured, the flashing started to alternate between a very bright white strobe and lesser bright white strobe still with no identifiable pattern, I ran inside for my husband. I ran back outside screaming for him to hurry up.  During this time, the lights were very bright white and seemed close with some red and now green. (The red and green never seemed to be actual lights but more like the light that would be given off by red and green lights)  Appx. five or six separate bright, same sized, green with some white lights broke off in a sort of bow shape and maintaining that shape, started very slowly floating down to earth (except the original light which was whiteish green and not as bright, but in the same place). Unlike the first occurrence, the green lights started to fade sooner as they went down.  By the time my husband got outside, there were 2 or 3 green light trails floating down and the original in the same place.  The green light trails faded before hitting ground and the original, blinking more bright white again with a faint reddish seemed to get farther away but remained in the sky for about ten more minutes getting progressively fainter until it disappeared.  My husband was outside for an additional 10 - 15 minutes after he saw the 2 - 3 green lights falling and also observed the odd strobe-like flashing, the odd way it seemed to sit in the same place for long periods of time and the gradual disappearance (fading) into the sky.(at points, it looked like a large, medium, small red star) At times it seemed to be coming back and the stobe effect would be visible again and then it would fade. As it seemed to get further away and mostly invisible, my husband and I thought we saw something very dark and faint falling behind the mountain. (like a large piece or several tightly packed smaller pieces of debris) However, this could easily have been a shadow of something as there are lots of street light, cars, planes, helicopters (although I didn't see any flying during the event), etc.  I kept checking back every 15 minutes for about 3 hours to see if would reappear and it never did.  Never during this entire episode did I feel scared, threatened, nervous or as if I were being singled out in any way.  This was all happening for anyone to see.  I only felt excited and puzzled as to what it was.  I am still expecting to find some logical explanation on the internet.   ***While writing this, I use 'bright' and 'close', 'faint' and 'farther' away interchangably.",2003-07-23T00:00:00,,

On Saturday, July 19th, 2003, at approximately 14:15 EST, I witnessed an object high in the sky, going from northwest to the southeast in the skies over Ford City, PA. Ford City is approximately 40 miles northeast of Pittsburgh along the Allegheny River. At first, I thought it was nothing more than a plastic bag, or balloon caught in a stream of wind. However, as I kept looking I noticed the object was moving much too fast of a pace to be a balloon, or a plastic bag. Also, the object moved in a consistent, smooth, straight line. To the best of my knowledge, plastic bags and balloons wouldn't behave in such a manner.  I can't determine how high the object was, but I know that I had to strain my eyes to see it, suggesting that it was pretty high. Also, I wasn't able to determine its size. I saw no beams or lights being emitted from the object. The object was very light, whitish in color. I tried to make out the shape, but it seemed to shift in shape, from box-shaped, to triangular, hence I thought it may be a plastic bag.  At the time of the sighting, the weather is absolutely perfect. Crystal-clear, blue skies, with very few clouds and low humidity. There was no sound or contrail, so I know it wasn't any kind of jet or helicopter. Furthermore, the object covered about 130 degrees of sky in about 15 seconds.  I'd be very interested in knowing if anyone else in either Allegheny, Armstrong, Westmoreland, or Indiana counties observed this event as well.  I prefer not to be contacted by phone, but I wouldn't mind being contacted by e-mail, so please do so.",2003-07-23T00:00:00,40.7105,-79.4774

It ascended slowly and without sound, maintaining constant ascent and flight path towards the center of  Manhattan , changing shape and color several times  before it  disappeared behind the clouds. The object was a whitish/grey matte finish with a trace of red color. Perhaps due to the setting sun, its redness  seemed to intensify as it climbed higher. No light emissions. The object was relatively big,  half a thumbnail size at arm's full extension when it was first sighted. Estimated altitude range at 10,000 ft. - 35,000 ft. based on various commercial aircraft and helicopters (approx. 7) that crossed the sky during the event.  The cylinder maintained its amazing  upright posture throughout its flight.  We were not under the influence of any intoxicants or alcohol. Unfortunately, we were too mesmerized to grab a camera.

The cratf appeared to be traveling in a NW direction from the SW.  They were very high(could've been 100-200 miles).  We all noticed that they began to turn to the SW.  The turn was abrupt and they fomed another pattern similar to the Big Dipper.  They continued to extend  starting to form a single line and then one by one seemed to shoot straight up out of sight.

It was completely stationary and remained so for at least five minutes. This was not a cloud. Although it was small it was a clearly defined object. I don't think many people had even seen it- you had to look very carefully. The strange thing is that my husband has seen the exact same thing about 3 years ago in Seattle. He was looking out of his bedroom window when he noticed a white object high in the clear blue sky.  It hung motionless. He grabbed his  video camera and zoomed in. It appeared to be a white circular shaped object After a couple of minutes  it seemed to change into a series of 5 smaller discs, which rotated in a circular formation and moved ever so slowly , (still stopping and hanging in space once in awhile,) out of the range of the camera. (He still has this film but has never sent it in anywhere.) When I first watched it I was in total disbelief. I have never seen anything like it. My husband had kind of passed it off as just a weird unexplained singular event, but  yesterday when both of us witnessed the same thing his previous experience seemed to have more credibility. We're very curious about what we witnessed. Does this sound like some kind of satellite? Wouldn't it be moving across the sky steadily, and are satellites so visible during the day? ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) Dear Peter, All the information I can provide is that from the Richmond District of San Francisco (about a half mile north of Golden Gate Park) it was north/ northeast.  We were standing at about sea level and its elevation we cannot estimate, although it was extremely high in the sky, more than a mile at the very least. My husband actually says he saw it about 20 minutes earlier when he stepped outside the restaurant we were eating in. Then when we stepped out, he pointed it out to me. So it was there for at least half an hour, not merely five minutes. My father is an airline captain in Seattle as well (he flies for World Airways) and says he has never seen anything like what we described. Thanks for sending along your report! And my husband is now vowing to take our video camera along with us more often when we go out.   :-) Best Regards, ((witness name deleted)) ((END))",2003-03-11T00:00:00,37.76999211048627,-122.42539404565002

Beltway, March 8, 2003 Strange Sightings Within The Washington, D.C. Beltway, March 8, 2003   I would have reported this earlier, but when, on the night of the observations reported below, I phoned _______ of the Fund For UFO Research, he told me that I should not report it on UFO UpDates, when I mentioned the possibility. I didn't ask ((name deleted)) why he said that, but since it has been so long and I've seen no reports of this, I can't imagine how this late-reporting could create a serious 'reporting noise' problem (if that's what ((name deleted)) was concerned about), so here goes. My apology for reporting late.....  At 8:15 (20:15 hours) on Saturday evening, March 8, my wife and I were preparing to leave our home near Greenbelt, Maryland, when a strange wing-like (No aircraft body visible and we had ground light off overcast clouds that should have clearly revealed any body.) Thing - herein-after 'AAO', meaning anomalous aerial object - was seen to emerge into view travelling on a twenty-degrees-east of a true north course passing almost overhead, from having been eclipsed by our front porch roof. The 'Wing' spanned a _full_ two degrees (120 ARC minutes) as contrasted with the half-degree (about 30 arc minute) crescent moon, off to my left during the observation for immediate and good comparison of angular size.  The 'AAO' was perceived by binocular disparity (visual parallax due to eye separation) as being 600 to a maximum of 1,200 feet overhead, and at the time its actual maximum possible distance was constrained by a thin layer of clouds overhead. Officially, that cloud layer had been broken at 24,000 feet at 19:51, was OVERCAST at 23,000 feet at 20:51, scattered by 21:51 same altitude, and clear by 22:51. (Thanks to __________ for the cloud data.)  Most disturbing was the _total_ silence of the nearby object.  A bright, continuously white 'sphere'-looking thing was visible on the tip of each 'wing' (Color illustration available to anyone who requests it.). Each white 'sphere' had a very sharp edge quite different from the lights on ordinary aircraft, and of a much purer white color. A much smaller (than the white 'spheres') pure red light looked possibly more 'point-source' and was located in the 'middle' (vertex of the 'wing').  It was brightening and dimming, but at times it seemed more of a flicker, and at other times more of a pulse, if memory serves me.  The 'wing', per se, was quite strange. Although it was visible by the cloud back-lighting, it was rather vague because subtle light around it seemed to vibrate or flicker at maybe ten hertz! - all along and across the 'wing'.  There was _no_ sign of any aircraft type body! Since the sight was quite 'spooky', maybe one could call them 'disembodied wings'. :)  We live a few blocks north of the little College Park Airport which is presently closed down to non-government air traffic due to security concerns, but this 'AAO' seemed so very low that my 'gut' reaction was that it had taken off from there, despite the fact that the thing seemed to be on a very flat course (neither climbing nor descending). Subsequent inquiry to the airport revealed that there had been no take-off around the 20:15 time of the first observation, and the airport had closed at 22:30, fifteen minutes before the second identical observation to be described below.  Roughly fifty (50) minutes after the first observation, an airliner type aircraft came over, possibly having taken off from Andrews AFB just east of D.C. It was on a slightly more westward bearing and considerably higher up. We could see the aircraft's body, wings, and tail structure very clearly and hear it very distinctly. By contrast, the 'AAO' had NO BODY VISIBLE, but only that weird wing-like structure that remained vague, SEEMING TO SHIMMER or something - It's really hard to describe. That's why I have illustrated it in the way that I did in the image anyone may ask me to send.  Yet, the most striking thing of all was the absolute silence! There was a bizarre silence, 'stillness',and 'smoothness' that is hard to explain or even put into adequately descriptive words.  After the object had disappeared beyond our north-northeastern horizon (taking roughly 30 seconds time to go from near zenith across the northern horizon), I ran up to the third floor where my Extreme Low-Frequency (ELF) magnetometer is located and noted a low-level, continuous magnetic pulse in roughly the 2-hertz range, accompanied by a few very strong 'spike' type pulses, one of which may have 'pegged' the needle. These were not normal background magnetics.  Coming upon 22:45 hours (10:46 PM), I was again upstairs with the magnetometer checking for any anomalous activity, when similar magnetic phenomena began to again be seen by the action of the needle display and heard on the analog, frequency modulated audio output (just as before). Watching and listening to that, I SUDDENLY heard a roar (seemingly directly overhead) that vaguely resembled a loud jet but was distinctly different, somehow. Then after a maybe 4 to 5 second duration, that roar SUDDENLY subsided - taking about 0.5 second to go from loud to nothing.  Because of the odd magnetic activity and the surprising sound, at cessation of the sound I rushed downstairs and onto the front porch, from which I was surprised to see an exactly identical 'AAO' (as compared to the 20:15 observation) on _exactly_ the _same_ course!  As with the earlier 'AAO', I watched the object from almost directly overhead as it moved in spookily total silence to across the exact spot on the north-northeastern horizon into which the first object had headed and disappeared.  During the first observation, the sky above the thing was overcast, but in the second sighting it was totally clear, with all stars and planets visible. Still, I could see no 'body' on the object, but only the 'wing'. This time, too, the 'wing' seemed to shimmer in a light-distorting way that made it much less clear than had the very clear wings, body, and tail section of the jet aircraft when it was watched at about 22:05 for comparison to the 20:15 'AAO'.  In both observations of the identical 'AAO', when overhead the angular distance from white globe of light to white globe of light ('wingtip'-to-'wingtip') was about 120 minutes or arc (2 degrees), and I had a ready comparison because the crescent moon (about 28 to 30 arc minutes) was still in the north-west (although nearer its horizon) during that second and identical observation.  Clouds above an aircraft seem to amplify aircraft sounds to a ground observer, but although it was overcast during the 20:15 observation, even then not a sound of any kind could be heard! I found that really a bit spooky because both things (or two events with the same single thing) were clearly under power, moving steadily and unwaveringly along precisely the same course in both observations. It was as if both had traveled upon the very same invisible track in the sky!  Let me be clear in saying that I suspect this twice-seen object of being some type of stealthy black-project aircraft (manned or unmanned) that is somehow propelled silently, but wonder at the wisdom of operating such a vehicle over this highly populated area within the Washington, D.C. Beltway. Oddly, _everything_ seemed so still and quiet during the two passages of the object(s) that I am reminded of reports of a similar phenomenon (""the OZ factor"") reported by certain observers of 'UFOs' at close range, but would be cautious in saying it was the UFO-related ""OZ"" phenomenon because I must consider the possibility that I had 'perceptually isolated' myself in listening for a non-existent sound from each 'AAO' to the exclusion of not noticing other ambient sounds.  Angular velocity of both 'AAO?'s is roughly averaged at three degrees per second, if the observation time in each case was 30 seconds. If 45 seconds, then it might have been two degrees per second.  If there are any questions about the observations, do not hesitate to ask.

When I read the Terrace Standard Newspaper April 2, 2003, on an article called: Was there a mass UFO sighting?, I said to myself that is what I saw one night in Terrace.  It was middle of March 2003 between 7:30 PM and 8:00 PM, I was out in my backyard in the 4700 Block Tuck Ave.  I was looking up in the sky around Eby Street and 4800 Block Tuck Ave.  I saw this bright  light glowing object moving around in  a fast downward movement.  This object was falling down fast and moving around.  The object was falling down between the backyards of either the 4800 Block Tuck Ave. or 4800 Block McConnell Ave.  I am not kidding it was falling down fast.  I thought it was a shooting star or a meteor.  I knew it couldn't have been.  I was waiting to hear an explosion when it fell.  I didn't hear anything and I didn't see it again.  When I read the article about a UFO sighting in the Terrace Standard Paper, I knew I saw something that night.  I am not kidding it was moving downward very fast and it was down low and it was glowing.  Did I see a UFO?  I hope this helps your research.  Let me know if I saw a UFO or not. Thanks.

When it caught his attention he watched the light heading in a northwesterly direction, from his location towards the south end of Williston Lake. His thoughts were that whatever it was, was a meteor as he said he sees a number of them while working in so many darkened hours. What the witness found strange about the sighting was before the light disappeared it changed direction slightly. After this change in it's flight path, he said it was gone. Just vanished. The sighting lasted approx: no more than 3 to 4 seconds. At arms length he said the light may have been the size of a pea. No sound was heard coming from the light, but this would be no surprise anyway due to him being in the cab of his truck, and they can be rather noisy. He wondered if I had any other reports of this type on the day.

Tonight on Friday, March 7, 2003 at approx: 8:30 p.m. I received a telephone call from two local Houston, B.C. residents who wanted to report something very strange they had saw on March 3, 2003 at approx: 7:55 a.m. The two witnesses were at the same location here in town when they made the call to me here at HBCC UFO Research. The reason why the witnesses decided to tell their story was due to the newspaper articles which ran on the UFO Survey, and myself in out local newspaper this past Wednesday. They also told me they both spent sometime trying to make up their minds if they should actually call me over what they saw. The first thing one of the fellows said to me was, ""my buddy and I saw something very weird the other day, and are still questioning ourselves over what we saw"". He went on to say there was himself and his friend in his truck travelling along highway #16 just east from Houston, B.C. Since it is getting lighter earlier these days, the fellows witnesses this object in the daylight. Just before they got to Perow, there is a large farmers field which runs for a long way, and also runs along side the highway with a buffer of trees between the field and the highway. His friend was the passenger in the truck and first noticed a large object paralleling them along the highway. The driver looked at the speed they were travelling and said he was doing approx: 50 kilometers an hour. The distance between the witnesses and the object would have been approx: 300 to 400 feet. So they both had a very close up look at it. (keep in mind there were the trees in between the truck and object which did hinder the view at times). Also the field drops down somewhat below the highway, so the forestry workers did not get a good look at the bottom of this craft. They both described the object as looking like an ""Air Stream Trailer"", and the size was close to the a Greyhound Bus. It was metallic in color, and no other features could be seen on it. No lights, windows, nothing !! The object stayed straight across from their truck as they drove along, as I mentioned above. It paced their veicle !! The passenger had rolled down the window to see if he was able to hear any sound coming from this object, but none was heard, it was silent. After approx: 3/4 quarters of a kilometer the craft turned slowly away from the highway, wobbled slightly, sped up, wobbled once again and then shot off out of sight very quickly. HBCC UFO Note: Since the object was so low, and on the other side of the standing trees, I asked if they had observed any moment in the trees. Such as any disturbance which would have moved the tress in anyway. None was noticed. Something else I should add. When the witnesses mentioned that is wobbled, one of the fellows said it was like looking through a heat wave, which gave it a look as if it was slightly wobbling. Also both of the man made comments to one another, saying it was so strange and not a normal aircraft as it had no wings on it's body. He also mentioned due to the type of work he is involved with he had made many trips on different aircraft, and what he and his friend saw was ""no"" aircraft they know of.  I am also going out tomorrow to grab some pictures of the area where the sighting took place. I hope to have some drawings and more information after I sit down and chat with the two witnesses over the weekend. There is more to this story to come.

My wife (the other witness) on the other hand is a staunch, hardcore disbeliever in anything of the sort.  This event has shaken her belief system. My wife and I were lying in bed when she noticed strange red lights outside our bedroom. There were 12-15 red lights.  She describes them as being in a straight line - I saw them as slightly staggered.  The lights moved across our field of vision (south to north) at what seemed like a very slow pace.  The lights seems to be fixed relative to one another - although I thought I might have noticed them moving up and down slightly (could have been my eyes playing tricks on me).  The lights were VERY low on the horizon - so low that they were hidden from view when they moved behind the house across the street.  There was no sound accompanying the lights.  It took ~ 2 minutes for the lights to disappear from view.  They seemed to move at a more or less constant speed throughout the event. After a few seconds of ""what the hell is that"" conversation - I ran to get my video camera and went on the front porch to see if I could capture anything on film.  I pointed the camera at the lights and filmed the last 15 seconds - but unfortunatly I can see anything on the film when I view it. I called the local new stations to see if they knew anything.  The woman in the newsroom at WNYT informed me that she had had other reports of strange lights near the Albany airport (~5 miles south of where I saw them).  Called back again in the morning and was told that they had made a few calls (meterologists, police, airport etc.) but could not provide an explanation. The only explanation I can think of for this event is that we saw navigation lights from a formation of planes way off on the horizon.  Some problems that I see w/ this explanation: -  That's just not what it looked like.  My wife and I discussed and dismissed this possibility as we were viewing the event. -  Why didn't the folks at WNYT validate this explanation when they investigated? -  There was no sound.",2003-03-21T00:00:00,42.8571,-73.7993

I had just finished my piano lesson and I was about to cycle back to the university. My piano teacher commented on how clear the sky was and started talking about the constellations. He asked which one was the Plough (Ursa Major), and I replied that I couldn't see it but that was the Orion and another constellation was the Pleiades. He did see where I was pointing but as I was doing so, an object, very high up in the atmosphere, (I could tell this because it was not luminous but had light dimly reflected off it, but it was 20:00 so it was dark in Colchester) moved at great speed across the sky. I exclaimed, ""Shooting star!"" but as the object reached the end of its travel, it swerved in a S shaped path, still moving at the same speed.The object appeared to be falling but that was a trick of perspective and in fact the object was travelling across the sky and into the distance. I have seen shooting stars on many occasions and I have also seen satelites in orbit as they pass overhead at dusk. This was moving extremely quickly and I know that in order for it alter its course it must be acted upon by a force. I am not saying it was aliens or anything but it was certainly something that was very strange and that I cannot attribute to aircraft, satelites or shooting stars. I was very excited and I was disappointed that my piano teacher did not see it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was a cloud-ness night and this witness was walking from the north end of his property towards his home and was looking at the night sky, viewing the northeastern part of the sky he noticed a strange, small, out of place light. As the witness watched the light, it began to grow in size, and grew in brightness by the second. Within 5 to 6 seconds the light went from being the approx: size and brightness of a star to approx: double the size of the moon.

But looking to the left I saw that the light that attracted me was setting sun relecting off what appeared to be a large cylindrical craft with no visible wings or tail, and leaving no contrail or sound.  It was very high and I couldn't see windows or markings, and it moved north to south.  Not knowing the scale of the craft, I can't say how high it was, but it seemed to move faster than the jet liner.  I called out to my friend and he described exactly what I was seeing.  He remarked that it looked like another cylinder shaped that he and I together had spotted first near Rogers,  AR,  about 8-9 years ago and then later that same day over Eureka Springs, moving south to north.   We watched the recent sighting for about five minutes and talked about it briefly, then returned to the project at hand.  About an hour later I felt a strong urge to look up and again saw a craft, this time a disc, moving silently along the same north south path as the cylinder and at about the same speed.  My friend confirmed my sighting and we watched it for about 5 minutes.  Because I felt that this pair of sightings was important, especially with a witness, I filed an e-mail report soon after to the coordinator and producer of the annual Ozark UFO Confernce held each year in Eureka Springs. I had to leave briefly and when I returned at around sunset, my friend said that he had just spotted another disc moving along the same path as the previous one, but there were no other witnesses.

Thinking some bullies chased her, I went outside on our corner lot to take a look and then I saw it too, coming over the field near our house.  It was a huge black cigar-shaped ship the length of a football field and it slowly, very slowly hovered just above the tree tops.  It came right over the other houses and then it stopped right over our house.  I had two other sisters who saw it.  My mother came out too and saw it.  I ran to maybe four other homes and got them to come out and see this.  I was 13 at the time and very excited to know these things really did exist.

It was Oct, could be Oct. '77 or '79.  This is 1 of several sightings that I have had and the last to be what I consider extra-terrestrial.  I just got done bowling from my Tuesday bowling league. I was going to a bar right after that to have a few beer with a friend of mine and discuss the upcoming Lions game.  Actually both of us were were more interested in the gal working behind the bar.  Anyways, I left the bowling ally and proceeded north to my destination.  Nice evening.  Sun still up.  Beautiful fall day.I went about a 1/4 mile and all  of a sudden my FM radio started making a hissing noise that I never heard on the radio before.  I pushed the buttons set to different frequencys and got the same hiss.  I took the tuner button and manually turnd the radio throughout the whole FM band and all I got was the same noise.  Then I tried the same thing on the AM band to no avail.  I thought my radio was broke being I got the same noise on both bands all the way through both bands.  I got to the bar I was headed for and parked facing south.  One more time I tried to go through the Am band and all of a sudden the Am band started fading in.  Just as this happemed I noticed something in my peripheral a few hundred yards moving south.  It was below 500 ft altitude and I heard no sound as it passed by me.  I couldn't see it as it passed by me in the parking lot because it was almost directly overhead.  It hit me that this craft was putting out some kind of electromagnetic interference.  Next thing that hit my mind was to identify the craft so I got out of the car.  The craft was gaining altitude then leveled off at no more than 1,000 ft.  I got a very good look, no wings, no rotor, no gondola.  Just a disk shaped object, big red light on top of the dome, all kind of flashing lights on the edge.  Looked like something out of a Spielberg movie.  This was no plane, helicopter, ballon or even marsh gas.  I could clearly see the edge of the disk did not come to a point but was about 4 1/4 feet thick at the edge.  I would like to point out at this time I am a vetran of naval aviation and familiar with identifying air craft.  I worked on fligt lines on naval air stations, air force bases, and the air craft carrier John F. Kennedy pre flighting air craft, launching, recovering, and maintaining aircraft. I worked as an aviation fire control bombing technition in a photo recon squadron.  I was also in an electronic warfare squadron where I also worked in radio communication, radio navigation and electronic warfare systems.  I believe I knew what I saw and what was happening. By the way, that is the only time the radio in that car didn't work.  Next thing I knew my friend was hollering from behind me, ""Did you see those lights?""  I told him I could still see them.  The object was heading south about 1/2 mile away at that time.  Then by chance another friend and his wife happened to drive up and park. First friend said he saw the craft enter the atmosphere from many miles up, more miles higher than any plane could ever fly.  He said it came down below treetop level.  That is where I first saw it, rising from a field where I used to play little league baseball.  That is about the time I saw it as it was gaining altitude and going south. Second friend and his wife happened to be coming home from visiting the wife's mother and thought they were watching a planecrash.  I pointed the object out to them. Their jaws dropped wide open.  Many people saw this.  Next to show were State Police.  They saw people milling around, stopped  and we had a short conversation something like this: Cops-  ""What is everybody looking at?""  Me- ""A ufo, sir"". Cops- laughing and making coments about little green men. Me- ""Do you want to see the ufo?""  Cops- ""Yes!""  Me- ""Then turn your heads and look out the windshield.""  End of conversation because when they turned their heads to look, they saw, then their jaws dropped wide open.  Then suddenly for a split second they looked at each other.  Next thing they did was simultainiously roll their squad car windows shut and proceed down the road approaching close to 100 mph.I never saw the objct do more than 20 mph. I'm starting to think I whised that I was with them because by the time they got a half mile down the road they got a nice close look, but then all of a sudden they slamed on the brakes and ducked into a restaurant for coffee and doughnuts. So my friends and I had to chase it down ourselves.  We kept up with it for almost 20 minutes until we lost sight of it.   I talk to very few people abouy ufos ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was carrying my toddler daughter (15 months old) out to my car when I noticed what I thought was a small airplane preparing to land at a nearby airfield. I put my daughter in her car seat and started my 1963 Dodge Dart and the non-factory installed car radio came on. When the radio started, I heard three electronic beeping sounds (like a microwave oven beep) and the KRTH-FM music was heard. I drove home, heading south, and parked the car at the curb. As I was getting out of the car, I looked up and saw an object over the house. I shut the car door, and stood in front of the car door, then leaned against it. I saw a dark, non-reflective saucer shaped object, over the roof peak. The object and a red, green and white light along the bottom. The lights did not strobe or twinkle. They were solid in color. Trained as a reporter, I made a mental checklist and started making observations of what the craft looked like and what it did. I noticed the dark metallic color, the lights and the lack of sound. Then I thought I myself, if you are a UFO do something to prove it. At this point, the UFO shot straight up in the air and hovered over the house. It did this three times moving up and down over the house. Also, the mostly full or full moon was to the left of the craft (south of it) and should have backlit the UFO. It did not. The only sound I could hear was faint fanlike sound. I had to strain my ears to hear that. By this time, I started looking for a neighbor's house to go stay at, but no one was home. I live in housing tract and usually someone is home. I finally got scared, after the third time the craft shot up in the air, and grabbed my daughter to make a run for the house. At the front door I fumbled with my keys but finally managed to get inside the house. I then ran and turned on the television for comfort and heard the final minutes of the Jeopardy game show which would have bee! n around 7:50 p.m. I used this to estimate the time of the UFO sighting. Once inside the house I did go to the back sliding glass door but was afraid to look outside.  I was able to give three points of where I saw the UFO and the distance was estimated between 85 to 100 feet. I'm nearsighted so for me to make out the craft, etc. meant that it was close.  The weather was cool, clear with no wind.  The following information was reported to MUFON and they have most of my UFO sightings in the 1980s.  After the incident I suffered from chronic neck and back pain. I still suffer from the pain, although it has abated with time. I did see a doctor about the neck pain approximately one week after the incident.  Before this experience, I was a skeptic of UFOs, but always said I would believe in them, if I ever saw one.

It cought my attension because it was much brighter than any star, especially with the glare of the street lights making most lesser stars not visible. My brother and I watched it for about 3 minutes when It began to blink. In all this time it made no noise and remained stationary. It would blink steadily for about thirty seconds before it stopped and returned to steady light.

It was a very clear night, with lots of stars.  I forget if the date was Jan. 2nd or 3rd of 2000, but it was between 10:30p.m.-11:30p.m. and my children were asleep in the back seat in there car seats.  I was driving, and my wife was passenger in the front seat.  We were near the Nevada border( within 25 miles either way), when my wife and I noticed 3 bright, white lights in a row, one behind the other.  They were about 200 yards in front of us, and about 15 yards to the right side of the highway,(south) at a hight of approximately three telephone poles.  They appeared to be hovering, or moving very slowly toward us.  As we aproached within 50 yards, the lights began to ratate, slowly, as if on a side of a plate that was perpindicular and spinning downward.  My wife and I nearly lost our breath as it came right at us.  My wife thought it was actually going to crash into us, but as the spiraling lights appeared to almost hit the ground in the ditch next to hwy.(aprox. 10 yards from car at a 1:00 angle), the lights abruptly went out.  I thought for sure the thing should have crashed and that was why the lights went out, but there was no crash sound.  My wife then told me that right as the lights went out it abruptly made 90 degree turn toward the south and disapeared at a rediculous amount of speed.  Since I was driving, all I saw were the lights(about the size of tires, spaced aprox. 10 yards apart).  My wife however was able to see the dark shodow of a craft, stating it was wing shaped, moderately flat, with the three lights positioned on the side, and bars hanging from the front(possible landing gear).  The craft made so sound at any time, and for being so close to our car when abruptly changing direction there was no turbulance from any propulsion system.  I am curious if we have any technology in propulsion systems that would allow the sudden direction of! change, with abrupt changes to extreme speeds, without making a sound.

I saw a strange blued light coming from outside and I went to the dinning room to see what was making that light (the view from the room is a river that ends on the sea, at the other side of the house). I saw an enormous object over the river (about 15 meters large) that had the shape of a bowl turned upside down. It was dark silver and emited that blue light. The object was making a kind of humming noise. It stand over there about 25-30 minutes just as it was paralyzed and then it started moving not very fast to the sea. It was very close to the houses, so I could see it clearly.  I never told this to anyone till last week I was talking with some friends and two of them I don't knew before started telling that on August 2001 they were at a beach party in Aveiro and they saw exactly the same object coming from the river and passed over them till the sea where suddendly disappeared! As I told before they saw the same light but they didn't hear the humming noise.

The area (if he is describing it correctly) is smack dab in the middle of military property between Alamogordo and Carizozo. I travel in the relative area quite a bit, and there have been many strange, unexplanable sitings including silent, laser-like light shows in the middle of nowhere, light orbs, and extreme brightness in the middle of the night lasting anywhere from 1 or 2 minutes to an hour or two. People who live in the area complain of unexplainable noise and light disturbances as well as earthquake-like ground vibrations.  One siting I can remember quite clearly was about a year and a half ago, I was driving my (now ex) brother-in-law back from Ruidoso to Albuquerque (I lived in ABQ at the time), and we witnessed a WILD laser like show over the horizon in the exact area the caller described. We watched this unexplainable light show for approx. 45 minutes, eventually passing its location and watching it in the mirrors of the car until arriving in Carizozo, in which we could no longer see the area (it was too far behind us). The lights appeared to be only white and very sporatic, but coming from the ground and very bright, lighting up the whole sky around us and extending very far up into and through the clouds. We estimated the distance of the source to be approximately 15-20 acres from the side of the highway.  We (the people of Lincoln County) believe there is a military base under ground, but I am not sure, as there is strict security along the gates, and no one can explore what is really out there without military clearance. There are signs along the fences that read ""no trespassing, military personnel only"". The local accepted theory is that the military is participating in technological experiments with air craft and laser weapon technology. Some local military personnel I have spoken to have suggested that this theory is real, but they will not say much more than ""you're close"" or ""you've got the right idea"". I hope this helps!",2003-06-18T00:00:00,,

I looked very long and short like a rectangle but could have been any shape as I was viewing it from the side.  Lansing has an airport here and I see small and large commercial planes but this had no features like they do, just rectangular with a sort of structure to it, like a triangular framework like steel beams or something. It looked like it was on a downward angle but going away from the airport and it traveled very flat and quickly for its size.  The 747's that I see seem to float along and this was moving probably 4 or 5 times faster than that.  It appeared closer to the ground than commercial aircraft too.  I was driving my car and couldnt get much more than that, I didnt want to cause an accident.  It disappeared behind the treeline and the GM plant there.  Perhaps I could go there and take a picture and then illustrate where it was in the sky and how long it was. I guess thats about it for what I can say about it.

We were just about to get on Vietnam Vets Parkway. I had noticed a couple of aircraft in the sky. Both of them were leaving a contrail as they went through the sky that very quickly disappeared behind them. It was generally clear; the only clouds I noticed were at the horizon where the sun was setting. Just as I was about to approach Vietnam Vet's, I slowed down for a traffic light. I happened to glance up, and noticed a metallic object quickly going by. It was at my 11 o'clock position, traveling from NE to SW. Just as I saw it, the sun glinted off of it, and then it simply vanished. Since I was at a stop at the light, I had time to really look for it, but it was nowhere to be seen. There were absolutely no clouds up there that it could have gone behind. I remember thinking as I first saw it that it was strange that it was not leaving a contrail, as the other planes were. I could no! t judge the altitude, but it looked like it was considerably lower than the planes were. It looked bigger than the planes I had seen, so I'm assuming it was lower.  It did look spherical, but of course, right as I noticed it the light reflected off of it, so I could not say for sure that it was. I know I didn't notice any wings. After it disappeared, I tried to make sense of what I saw, and thought that just maybe I had seen a plane. Then I happened to see a real plane as it was making approach to the Nashville airport. I could see the wings and everything, even though it was many miles away, and the object I had seen was almost directly overhead. I realized that 1)if that had been a plane that I had seen that was just too low to leave a contrail, I would have seen the wings, and 2)the reflection flash happened on the opposite side of the craft from the setting sun.",2002-12-23T00:00:00,36.3913,-86.4547

Dripping, a tail, and variable at times. I was driving East on US 30 as dark fell.  US 30 runs directly east & west for 40 miles between Tama and Cedar Rapids, Iowa at this location.  I saw a brighter than usual light in the distance a few degrees south of due east through my windshield as I was eastbound. The light grew brighter until it appeared like a brilliant Venus would in the morning sky.  It even had a liquid appearance at times just like Venus at its most intense.  After about 5 minutes I noticed that it had not moved relative to the horizon.  This eliminated a plane coming in from a great distance to the Cedar Rapids airport which was almost directly to my S.E. from my positon.  Suddenly the light doubled in intensity and appeared for a time to have a forked tail pointing downward and it seemed to throw off a particle or two.  At one point I thought I saw a faint line coming down from it.  It stayed in the same place for over ten minutes.  It briefly faded down to a bright ball of light but then flared again to a brilliant white shimmering light more than three times the size of Venus.  About twenty miles away the red blinking lights of 1000 foot towers around Cedar Rapids, Iowa were now visible.  This object was twice as high up as their tops.  I estimate that it was 15 miles Southeast of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  Highway 30 turns SE as it approaches the outskirts of Cedar Rapids and at this point the light disappeared or went out.  It reminded me somewhat of the Rendlesham, England sightings as it appeared to be fluid in its shimmering.  It was above the point in the atmosphere at which rising stars shimmer and are magnified by passing through the atmosphere.  As I drove straight east for over twenty minutes this light did not change its location at all.  A moving plane on a flight path would have shown some change relative to my own movement.  The variation in intensitiy of the light also argues against a hovering helicopter.  It may have been farther away also and much higher up but it had to be at least  2000 feet up compared to the 1000 foot plus communication towers in the distance.  It had an appearance similar to the ""Star of Bethlehem"" pictures we have seen at some point in our lives.  I have just checked star charts and verified that Venus is now a morning star.  I am a long time amateur as! tronomer and  can verify that this was not Jupiter or any star.",2002-12-23T00:00:00,42.0075,-92.1925

He then summoned the rest of us out to take a look. Directly overhead, at an extremely high altitude, were what appeared to be just 5 objects moving in a SSW direction. After focussing a little more on the area of the objects, more faint objects appeared and as it turns out, there were no less than 15, and perhaps as many as 25 objects in a cluster moving in a SSW direction. There was no activity on the flightline at the airport, sicne it is mainly used as an overhaul facility for military and commercial aircraft, so if those objects were planes, we should have been able to ehar them, but there was no sound. Nor was tehre any contrail. Looking at other portions of the sky were planes had recently flown by, there were contrails. These objects left no trace of contrails. Less than a minute into this event, 3 objets on teh west flank of the cluster shifted and moved to the east side of the clutster while the other objects went in a straight line to the SSW. It is difficult to describe the shape of the objects, because they were at an extremely high altitude, well beyond jetliner altitude. My best guess was that they either an oval or circular in shape, and definately did not have tails like a jet would have, but they were at too high an altitude to be aircraft anyway. I am also a weather enthusiast, and 2 hours after the event I decided to check upper level winds (38,000 ft and above)and they were moving at a general easterly direction at the time. So, this rules out balloons and the like. The 3 or 4 objects that swapped from the west flank to the east flank appeared to have some kind of intelligence behind it. They were distinct manouvers. I am submitting this report in hopes that others who saw this event will come foreward and report it to this database also, because I realize that the thought of seeing this many objects at the same time is rather rare and incredible.",2003-03-04T00:00:00,34.83721312741313,-82.33834929214929

The weather was sunny to partly cloudy.  I stopped the engine to the car and could hear what I thought were fighter aircraft maneuvering overhead and possibly practicing ""dog fighting"".  We hear that on occasion in our area.  Then I heard something different.  What I heard was a distinct and momentary whooshing noise.  The tone of the sound was in such a low frequency range that I ""felt it"" as well as heard it.  Indeed, I thought that maybe one of the aircraft was in a flat-spin and was plummeting toward the ground.  I remember thinking, I wouldn’t be surprised if the aircraft wasn’t going to crash.  Indeed, I was anticipating an explosion.  I paused for an instant after getting out of the car and wondered if it was headed for the ground how any one could get out of the way.  The lower frequency sound stopped.  I began walking toward the main entrance of the Credit Union but could still hear jet engines.  So I stopped to look up.  Most of the time when you hear jets maneuvering in the day you can’t see them but I looked up because of odd initial sound I had heard.  What I saw first was a disk-like object suspended just between a high cumulus cloud structure but above the mountain ridge.  I estimate the altitude of the object to have been at about 600 feet.  The object was at least ¾’s of a mile away (SSW) from where I was standing.  The profile of the object’s shape reminded me of an aluminum garbage can lid.  It was a dull aluminum color rather than bright and shiny.  Momentarily the aircraft, I believe it was an F-14 with its wings extended, appeared out of the bottom of cloud cover in a relatively tight nose-down turn.  Within a second after F-14 came out of the cloud cover the disk-like object vacillated or vibrated from side-to-side for an instant and then flipped on its side.  There was a brief flash of light that came from the disk when it flipped to its side (like the sun’s reflection bouncing off of glass).  As the F-14 straightened up from its nose-down attitude, I had a brief instant’s view of the aircraft’s profile and a clear view of under-belly of the disk (it appeared as a circle).  The disk suddenly disappeared and appeared in another location (about 15 to 20 degrees to the left of where it was – but at the same relative altitude) but the disk had shrunk at least half in size.  The re-sized object looked darker and more cylindrical.   I didn’t actually see the disk travel to its new location although I was looking right at it.  The entire change in location and size occurred in a time frame that was less than the blink of an eye.  The F-14 leveled out and vectored toward the disk.  The object, as if in response, simply shrunk further in size and vanished.  I saw motion whatsoever.  The object neither moved up, down, right or left.  The object simply disappeared as if a rheostat was “turned down” on the image.  Shortly thereafter I heard the sound of the engines of the aircraft that had been throttled up in pursuit.  I also heard the throttle down – as there was nothing left to pursue.  I don’t know what the disk-like object was.  However, I’m 100% certain it wasn’t operating under the same rules of gravity under which we operate.  (I heard the aircraft for more than 20 seconds but only physically observed them for 10 seconds or less)  I went into the Credit Union, stunned.  I told the lady behind the counter what I had seen.  One of the ladies next to her said, interrupted and said, “What did you see?”  I told her.  She said, “I heard it over the speakers”.  I will NEVER look at the sky again in the same way.  Everything that I knew about physics and aviation went right out of the window with what I observed today.  I’m now forced to reassess all that I knew to be real.",2003-07-16T00:00:00,35.3619,-83.2078

Me and six other acquaintances met at a friend's house to shoot fireworks, as this friend had missed the 4th of July. We were behind this friend's house (on the outskirts of town) in a large open field with a mostly clear night (no clouds visible until 11:00pm or so). Around 9:00pm EST (when it began to get dark) we began firing off things with bright and beautiful explosions, such as artillery shells. At approximately 9:30pm we stopped shooting fireworks for a few moments when we noticed a bright red-orange light moving at about a jet's pace across the skyline. We thought it looked sort of odd, but shrugged it off and went back to shooting fireworks.  After a few more minutes, say 9:40pm, we looked back up and noticed that the craft was moving back in the opposite direction. We decided to watch it for a few moments to try and determine what the strange light was. After staring up at the sky for a while, we noticed the craft suddenly slant itself (to where it was oriented diagonally instead of horizontally, or I assume so -- it was difficult to make out anything but the actual light itself, which seemed to cover the majority of the craft, if not all of it). After this change in orientation, it suddenly turned around and headed back towards its first direction without actually turning around or losing speed. It was just going one direction fairly quickly and suddenly decided to go the other way. About this time we also noticed that there was no smoke or contrails behind the craft, as well as no noise. The sky at this time was still perfectly clear.  After the craft went back and forth (between North and East) 2-3 times, we lost interest again and went back to shooting fireworks. We continued to see the craft while shooting fireworks, and eventually my friend's little brother came up to look at the red-orange light as well, dismissing it as an airplane. How many of our aircrafts are composed of just one giant red-orange light, though?  By 10:30pm we all had made the realization that the UFO was not just moving back and forth on one side, but was actually circling our field. It was always within 1.0miles away, but never came much closer than approximately 0.5 miles. The light object would not just go in a complete circle around our field, though. Mostly I saw it move from (1) N to E to N and then under a high treeline continuing N-to-NW, (2) NW to W to NW and back under the treeline, (3) and W to SE and back.  Maybe around 10:50pm (at which point we were still shooting fireworks), we noticed the craft was staying in one position to our South, perhaps 0.75 miles away. We stopped shooting fireworks yet again so we could see what the light was doing. When we stopped shooting fireworks, the craft appeared to begin moving straight toward us rather slowly (the light was growing larger, and no trees were below it to determine its exact distance). Perhaps after reaching 0.5 miles from our spot, it stopped for a brief moment and then began heading West again.  By the time the strange light was back to our West, I noticed an aircraft (most likely a passenger plane), SW of us which was moving West. It did not appear to be pursuing the light or to be near the UFO's actual path (the plane was much further away from us than the light). One of the witnesses to the event began shooting bottle rockets in the direction of the light around this time, which seemed to make the light linger in that one area a little longer (West of us, close to the start of the NW side of the treeline). We yelled at the guy to stop firing bottle rockets at the UFO, which he did. After he stopped, the light continued toward the treeline.  The light went back under the N/NW treeline. It appeared again above the treeline, at which point a second ship came up from below the treeline to ""meet"" with it. The two ships moved somewhat close together (perhaps 10-15 yards from each other) and remained there one or two minutes (moving around some, but staying in that one area), and then both of them moved their seperate ways and quickly went under the cover of the treeline again. A moment later one of the UFO's came back out from the trees and moved W to SW and back perhaps two times, and then went behind the treeline again. This was the last sign of the ship that we saw, and was around 11:05pm or 11:10pm. Oddly enough, it went away only a few moments after we ran out of fireworks. Heh, perhaps it was watching the show...  By 11:15pm we were cleaning up the little mess we had made in the field (firework debris and containers). Around 11:20pm we began heading from the field to our friend's house (where all of our cars were parked), and had left his house by 11:45pm.  One thing I forgot to mention was that there were several times during the UFO's flight that it would seem to orient itself diagonally and continue on its apparently set course with no noticeable change in speed. This, and its ability to suddenly go in opposite directions without turning around or changing speed, made me believe that the craft was nothing made by man. The UFO appeared to just be composed of that one giant red-orange light, which seemed somewhat solid. However, the light did seem to slowly pulsate a lot of the time. I'd like to say again that there was absolutely no noise, smoke, etc. to accompany the light. There were no wings or propellors, and I could only make out some sort of round-ish shape (perhaps an ellipse, maybe disc-like). We attempted to record the light with a camcorder, but the girl who recorded it said she hadn't looked at the tape (as of July 13, 2003), and I doubt that it picked the object up anyway (camcorders aren't the greatest). If it did, however, show up I will submit the video and some stills from the video to try and give a better image of the object.  I would roughly estimate that the length of the ship is around thirty feet.  I did look for some similar sightings on Google after I came home, and found some ships that look like what we witnessed... http://www.iwasabducted.com/UFOPictures/ufo9.jpg http://www.iwasabducted.com/raulgarza/anniversary041499b.htm http://www.abduct.com/contact/_contpix/c21.jpg   Also, NUFORC: If you would like to contact me, you can email me at the address I submitted.

Let me begin this by saying that I am filing this because I ALMOST DIDN'T, and wondered how often THAT happens. It occurred 1 week ago, and at the time, my companion and I were so freaked out that we just drove around and talked about it, making phone calls to anyone we could think of to see if anyone else had seen it. As I was on vacation in Brazil, it was very difficult as an American citizen to figure out who the hell to call in the first place. My friend, a Brazilian, had no idea either. We searched the web the next day but found nothing. I vowed to return to the States and make sure that anyone else looking to see if someone else saw this particular 'whatever' could at least have a chance of finding me/this account.  I would like to further predicate this report by making the all too common declarations of ""I'm not crazy, and this isn't b-s"". I am a licensed attorney in Florida. My friend is a genius and was admitted to both MIT and Harvard. In short, we are sober, sane, intelligent people not given to mistaking blimps, planes, helicopters, weather balloons, the aurora borealis or gases from deep within the bowels of the earth for what we saw for about 6 or 7 minutes last Wednesday, the 9th of July, 2003 at approximately 11:30 p.m. I hope that someone contacts me to get a better account, clue me in to other reports of this incident,  or to give me a lie detector to find out that we saw something, and I seriously doubt that it was 'one of ours'.  Unfortunately, it is not as spectacular as being a description with photos or a definate shape. We actually started racing back to the hotel to get the digital camera when we lost it, ore rather it lost us.  All I know is what follows: My frind and I had just dropped off his brother at a restaurant in the City of Barra (do Tejuco) about 10 minutes south of Copa Cobana in Rio de Janeiro. We were driving north towards Copa and were about 4 miles south of the tunnel that takes you under a mountain separateing Barra and the Ipanema, Le Blon, and Copa area. It was somewhat overcast, I beleive, at least it was hazy, you could see a pinkish orange haze in the sky reflecting the electric lights of the area below. I was in the passenger seet, and was looking at my friend in mid sentence when I saw whatever it was in the sky behind his head. I'm pretty sure my exact words were ""what is that thing, dude?"" to which he responded ""the mount---"" as he turned to look, assuming I was looking at one of the numerous mountains in the area. He never finished the word mountian, instead switching immediately to a decidedly excited ""what the f is THAT???"". We immediatley pulled over to the side of the road, in front of a guard gate with a private security guard who started toward us to investigate us as we were hopping out of the car. We immediatley started pointing at the 'thing' and he joined us in trying to figure out what we were looking at. More accurately, I was making sure of what I wasn't looking at, that I was indeed seeing something worth reporting here.  Hanging in the sky to our west, in plane sight, was a huge cluster of lights. I apologize for the banality of the description, but as much as we strained to focus on it, we couldn't see any dark shape upon which these lights would be affixed. It therefore made it very difficult to determine how far away it was, or how big it was. My best guess was that it was about 1/4 to 1/2 mile away, probably about 500 feet in the air. It seemed to be totally silent, but the traffic noise or the direction of the wind could have masked sound.  I can't even say that it was 1 of 100 things, although it seemed to be one object or cluster moving together. It was covered in red and greenish blue lights that pulsed and flickered. Some would get really bright. while others would disappear completely only to seem to grow bright out of complete darkness in almost but not exactly the same place as before. This was a lot of the reason why we couldn't figure out what we were looking at or if there was more that one. I'd say that there was 40 to 50 of these red lights and blue-green lights in a kind of sideways L shape. The at times seemed totally disjointed, and at other times they seemed to pair up. All around this cluster were another 30 or 40 pure white flashing strobe-like lights. They weren't flashing in any kind of pattern, it looked more like machine gun muzzle flashes in the dark, only pure white and 500 feet in the air. It was moving slowly north and we watched it dumbfounded for about 5 minutes, when we stupidly figured we could make it the 3 miles back to my friends condo and grab his digital camera. I wish I had sat where I was and watched it more carefully, but it didn't seem to be in any hurry to leave, or very concerned about being seen. You could see other people along the sidewalk looking at it and pointing to.  We hopped in the car and started racing back to get the camera, all the while watching this cluster in the sky. My friend, driving, was watching too, which had me a little distracted because he is a lunatic behind the wheel when he's watching the road and not racing to get a camera to capture evidence of something we know was not supposed to be there. We weere in the car for about 45 seconds and nearing the U-turn to go back when the lights started popping off. Some would flicker and fade, then come back, then go altogether. The red and green/blues seemed to come together and then go. Less and less of the white flashes were visible. We were coming into a more ligthed area, so I thought for a second that that was the problem. However, as we got into a little bit of a darker area (between us and the cluster) we could see that there were definatley less lights, and withing another 10 seconds we were down to one final white light that was no longer flashing, but pulsed out one final time and then there was notheing but the orange-pink haze and the outling of a nearby mountain.  SO,,, am I crazy, is there another explanation, because we are not making this up, and I've seen enough of our own manmade stuff to know that this wasn't.

Hello,  I am a 45 year old semi-retired computer guru of sorts. I do believe that we are not alone in this universe. To many events in the world's history as well as sightings around the world point to this fact.  My Envent: (Don't know if it is UFO)  Place: In Southeastern Oklahoma Approxiately 30 Miles north of the Texas border and 20 miles west of Durant Oklahoma, United States of America, I observed the following events.  Actual Event Description: On a whim I went outside my house and looked to the eastern sky. A bright light ""Not Bright White - more like cream in color"" was stationary in the ski. It was 10 - 20 times the size of a bright star. Compared with the width of my index finger held 1 foot from my face, the light was approximately 1/8"" wide.  It was not moving from what I could tell as I continued to watch this light for some 15 minutes. The intensitive of the light stayed constant. My best unqaulified guess of altitude of this light was 3,000 - 5,000 feet based on aircraft flying at an altitude of 15,000 feet in the area.  During the observation of this stationary light in the ski, I said to myself, if you are an alien ship you are asked to land on my farm land, your are welcomed. I did not chuckle as I was serious.  Approximately 1 hour later and just after falling asleep in my bed, I was awakened by a quick jerk of my head to the right and some type of pressure was pushing down on my head with just enough force to cause me some panic and then the pressure rolled accrossed the right side of my head toward the top of my skull. It felt like a long loaf of bread was being dragged accross my head but with pressure against my head. This occurred over a very short period of time. What I estimate to be some 2 - 3 seconds and it felt real as if someone or something else was in the room with me. But, I was alone in my room. Shaking and chilled all over, I went back outside and there were clouds throughout the ski and I could not locate the light I had seen an hour earlier.  When this event occurred I did not have any unusual stressers in my life. I do not drink or take any drugs of any kind. Nothing. I do work at night as I sleep during the hot days of oklahoma.  I will look at the ski ever night from now to see if the light re-appears and will forward any other events of this type.  This is the first time I have ever seen a stationary light in the sky as such and never any spirit or ghostly occurances in my house. Although, this house was moved to this farm about 7 months ago.  Let me know if anyone else has ever reported any similar event.  Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) Madill, OK",2003-07-16T00:00:00,34.0784,-96.7598

Dear Sir.   I tried to transfer my video of the event from my camra, but Ill have to find another way to do it.  Thr first plane,(possibly an F-16), came from the South.  Passing over head as it turned East, towards Seattle or Whidby Island.  I began filming this because he was making a pink trail behind him in the sun-set. I was standing where I could still see to the south from our yard.  I vodeo-taped the second air craft, heading from the South to the North, crossing the Straights into Canada. As I watched through my view finder.  I saw something fly towards this, (possibly a militare plane, or a passenger), from the East to the West.  Just before this round object hit the belly of this jet.  The lights on both wings and the tail flashed on together.  The round object went under the facing wing.  And out the back.  What looks like spray can be seen on the tape.  But the round object can again be seen leaving the tail of the air craft and continuing West. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) Dear Director, My brother and I called you on the 21st to report something hitting a jet above our home here in Port Angeles.  I then wrote again to say that we were trying to get a freeze-frame from this video to show you.  Well they are in, but I can only send two your way right now. Last night we had called the Coast Guard again about what was seen over our heads.  They told us it had to be reported to the Sheriffs Office.  After the cop saw the tape, he wanted to bring a friend of his who knows about ballistic missiles...because that is the most logical explanation, but they did not return. My brother is now convinced that someone shot a rocket at a plane, which makes sense in a way.  However, if it was a rocket!! I on the other hand still think it is an un-identified- flying object.  If you want to write back we will be here.  Thank you!

He mentioned that the light took approx: 5 minutes, traveling to the northeast from where he first caught sight of it in the southwestern part of the sky.  It finally just disappeared. The witness also said the light was very high up, but mentioned it was twice as bright than any satellite. Still another light, not as bright was noted coming from the exact position the flash was observed, but this second light was traveling to the north. No sudden moments were noticed. No sounds was heard, mainly due to the lights being so far away.

I was not viewing the scene through the camera. I was simply watching the clouds roll with my eyes and pressing the shutter on the camera which was on the tripod at my side.  I saw nothing odd or unusual.  After shooting eight or ten pictures, I took the camera upstairs to the computer and downloaded the pictures for editing or deleting. To my amazement, there were several photos depicting a bright light beginning at the top of one of the photos and falling through a pine tree quite rapidly through several of the photos. It was not in the shape of a saucer or any other shape, but it was quite clearly a light which was moving through a three second sequence of photographs. Then it split into two lights.  I was not frightened by that sequence until I viewed the next photograph. It depicted a smokey trail that wove around not only the tree but also snaked around a light pole and through the atmosphere. I had seen that phenomenon before on television shows on cable channels which reviewed videos and photographs taken by others who had witnessed the same sorts of events.  I reviewed the sequence of photographs for over two hours and concluded I was not a nutcase.  I am an attorney and quite sane. It continues to astound me that I captured this occurence in less than one minute, but I have the evidence. I have a sequence of eight photographs!

We were driving From Longview, WA to Sandpoint, ID on a snowboard trip and I was the passenger in the car.  I noticed a blurry blue/white object holding a position at high noon (high in the eastern sky).  I assume it had moved into that position rapidly, as I was startled into staring skyward suddenly.  I moved my head up and down and side to side rapidly to make sure that I was not seeing a reflection on the inside of the car's windshield.

It was about one-half the size of the moon.  It was behind a whispy cloud, and an electric blue light was visibly pulsating, much like the model atom I have seen with two electrons rapidly rotating around the nucleus.  The object appeared to be creating its own black cloud to shield the light I was seeing. I was deeply awed and scared at this point. The object spastically moved five degrees to the south, then northeast, then up to create a tight triangle type movement.  It then shaked spastically once again and flew away rapidly directly (west) over our heads.  I have never seen anything move like that.  I assume it should be impossible. I felt a keen sense that this object was observing me as I observed it. The moment I panicked and my heart jumped into my throat, was the same moment the object spastically moved and flew away. In order for that object, which moved away rapidly later, to hold its position it is safe to assume it was observing our car.  It was the only thing visibly moving at 3:50 am on a country highway.

He told me he was so shocked at what he was seeing, plus the size of it. The fellow said one could have placed or spread three jumbo jets into the object easily. The object was witnessed for approx: 3 to 4 seconds in total.  The gentleman's parting words to me was that it freaked him right out !!

I received a call from a woman who reported that her and two other witnesses who were on Ferry Island at the Ferry Island campground when they saw the weirdest thing happening in the sky above them, or over Ferry Island. She told me that they watched a number of funny colored lights (blue/red/yellow/white) traveling in their direction from the north. What made this a strange looking sight was that the lights seemed to pulsate, and only the white lights on the object grew very bright in intensity, and the other colored lights stayed at the same brightness. As the object drew closer to their location it seemed as if the lights, in a ring, surrounded a dark solid object which was in the center. From the glow off the lights they noted the dark object in the center was completely round in shape, with this ring of colored lights running around it. The object moved very quickly across the sky heading south. The approx length of the sighting lasted about 10 seconds before they lost sight of it due to the trees. She said it traveled in a straight line and up rather high in the sky, but low enough to catch a good look at it. No sound was heard coming from it and no tail was observed.  HBCC UFO Note: Last year in 2002 I had a similar sighting report come in from two Arrow truck drivers who were carrying concentrate ore from the mine here in Houston, B.C. Two trucks had pulled over to the side of the highway for 10 minutes at Meziadin Junction to watch an object which sounds like the same thing here in the report above.

The craft was noiseless and flying pretty slow, maybe at about 30-60 miles/hour. If someone hadn't pointed it out, I probably would not have noticed it.

On Dec 30, 1995, while driving on Interstate 90 from Livingston to Bozeman, MT at about 09:30 in the morning, I observed a brilliant green fireball flying at slightly above treetop height at a distance of 300-400 yds.  The fireball had a diameter of about 10 yds with trailing flames some 60-80 yds long.  It then flew directly over the highway at Bozeman Pass (the pass has an elevation of 5780 ft) by not more than 1000 ft.  It then rose in the sky at a low constant angle to disappear in the distance in not more than 10 seconds.  The fireball covered a distance of 1-1/2 miles, measured with vehicle odometer, in an estimated 2-3 seconds, suggesting a speed in the range of 1800-2700 mph.  It was silent.  The speed of sound is about 750 mph.  The fireball should have produced a loud sonic boom.  One possible explanation for the oft-reported silence of UFO's might be connected to the incredible accelerations and decelerations of which they appear to be capable.  Some witnesses have claimed UFO's make no-radius 90 degree and even 180 degree turns at speeds estimated in the 1000's of  mph without decelerating at all.   The g-forces involved must measure at least in the 100's.  One possible way to protect the crews from these maneuvers is an anti-gravity system, perhaps in the shape of a torus in the rim.  If such a system existed, it might be omnidirectional, that is, it might have the same intensity outside the craft as within.  Hypothetically it could be so powerful that it could repel air around the craft.  In otherwords UFO's may fly in a self-made vacuum.  If this were true the craft would not contact the atmosphere and could not produce a sonic boom.  Other advantages to such a system would be the absence of heating by air friction when flying in the atmosphere at high speed, and the repulsion of smaller objects out of the path of the craft when flying in deep space.  If a torus did exist in the rim of a UFO, then a possible structure exists for a propulsion system.  (I am not suggesting that an anti-gravity system and a propulsion system are the same, only that they may be in close proximity and possibly share the same structure.)  Cyclotrons require a torus.  One account of the vimana or flying machines of the gods in ancient Indian tradition that I read stated that the machines had mercury in them.  So we are talking about a cyclotron which spins up a mercury plasma to a relativistic velocity.  Thrust occurs when mass is lost at velocity from a vehicle.  We are all familiar with rockets ejecting hot gases to produce thrust.  There is nothing in this definition of thrust which requires the loss of matter.  All that is needed is the loss of mass.  When plasma at a relativistic velocity decelerates it loses mass at velocity.  It may be mathematically derived mass based on relativity but it's still mass.  If this deceleration occurred in a vehicle such as a UFO it ought to produce thrust.  Suppose a UFO is headed north.  If the torus in the rim had a shunt come off of it pointed south, then plasma might be directed into the shunt, where it could be decelerated and produce relativistic thrust.  Perhaps then the shunt loops back into the area of the cyclotron where the plasma in the shunt could be accelerated to the operational velocity of the plasma in the torus, at which point the shunt rejoins the torus and dumps its contents into it.  In this way the plasma could be used over and over for propulsion. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Please see other report from San Diego for December 29, 1995.

I was in the Marine Corps for four years and just got out recently.  I was stationed in North Carolina.  I had grown up in Massachusetts.  So regardless to say I made a lot of trips up and down the east coast. The ""sighting"" took place on rt 95 in virginina.  When driving to North Carolina we had to take rt 95 all the way through.  On that road there are hundreds of exits we pass. My cousin and myself were driving through in December of 2000.  We were driving late at night.  We were maybe 4 to 5 hours from our destination.  The three lane highway had turned to two lanes.  We were still a while away from North Carolina.  Let's just say 20 to 25 exits away. We passed a Virginia state trooper.  He proceeded to pull us over and give us a citation for speeding.  We accepted the ticket and continued on. Immediatly following the stop, while we were a little shaken we witnessed lights that seemed to be car headlights heading the worng way on the highway heading right towards us.  Before I had a chance to even react it was gone.  There were no other cars on the highway with us.  Dissmissing it as an optical illusion we checked the exit number.  At that point it was when we realized that we were twenty exit ahead than we just were a minute ago.  Checking the speeding ticket wich had the mile marker and exit on it we realized that over three hours had passed since the citation was written.  Being in the military I am a stickler for details and I had throughly chcecked the information on the citation after I have had recieved it and it was correct with my watch and car stero clock. We made it to the base fine, but we were very late and disoriented.  I do not know if that is information that you collect.  I assure you it is not false.  I just wanted to get it off of my chest.  Do what you will with this E-Mail. The only thing that really stood out with the incident and the what caused us to think we were not crazy was the citation.  When we called to get information on the ticket, we were informed that the citation was never written and that no such officer exhisted. If you do not think this is a hoax and are interested, you can contact me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))",2003-06-10T00:00:00,,

"Head lights on a collison course with a hill which suddenly ""jumped"" back, appeared diamond shaped and zig zagged across the sky","Northland, (remote countryside, East Coast)",,1995-06-10T02:00:00,changing,6 hours,"Occurred : 6/10/1995 02:00  (Entered as : ??/10/95 0200) Reported: 6/6/2003 1:36:40 AM 01:36 Posted: 6/10/2003 Location: Northland, (remote countryside, East Coast),  Shape: Changing Duration:6 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29076.html,"Head lights on a collison course with a hill which suddenly ""jumped"" back, appeared diamond shaped and zig zagged across the sky We were returning to our bach (beachside holiday home) in a remote farming/coastal area in Northland, New Zealand from a party at the nearest town.  I was as straight as a die as I had badly sprained my ankle the night before and didn't want to ""party hard""  and make it worse (there was a good band and usually I love to dance) so had drank only two cans of premixed bourbon and cola over a period of about 7 hours prior to driving a car load of people back to my place who had been indulging. All up there were two car loads of us.  Our bach is situated on top of a hill which has a 360 degree view all around but the front of the place has huge windows which look directly out to the Pacific (directly east).  There is approximately 400 metres of land between us and the beach and it is totally flat - the top of our hill is probably about 5 or 6 storeys high...  Being a farming/rural community, the coast around here is reasonably unpopulated and there was only one house between us and the beach, an old homestead which my husband grew up in - about 100 m away from the hill between us and the beach.  There were no roads although a ""farm track"" lead to the beach.  October in New Zealand is still pretty cold, although officially spring, and we were all huddled together on the deck waiting for my partner to open the door when we all noticed two headlights coming straight towards us from the direction of the beach/sea.  We quickly realised that it wasn't a car as we were at eye level with these headlights and they were somewhat bigger.  The weird thing was that there was no noise and they had ""snuck up"" on us to quite a close distance without us realising.  Our initial reaction was that it was a plane or helicopter (do they have headlights?) and they were on a collison course with the hill (and us!) as they appeared to be getting closer and closer.  We were all talking about it when my husband finally got the door open and we all spilled inside.  I remember saying, quick turn on some lights so they can see it is a hill and a house and don't hit us.  We turned on the lights and everyone arranged themselves around the kitchen breakfast bar which looked over the sea.  I had gone straight to the window with one of the other girls and was amazed to see that the ""headlights"" were almost within striking distance but then in a ""blink"" of my eyes they had suddenly jumped back to sit out somewhere over the sea.  At this point they were bearly distinguishable as ""headlights"" and then suddenly seemed to be more of a diamond shape.  I verified with my friend that I wasn't seeing things and we tried to engage the others to reaffirm what we had all seen.  It was funny because they all sat down and opened drinks and seemed to forget about the headlights that had been coming straight at us minutes before.  We tried to get their attention and point out that the head lights had suddenly gone from about to hit us to sitting way back and they all went yeah yeah you guys are out of it!  Anyway, knowing that I was absolutely NOT out of it (may be a bit tired) I decided to go outside to have a better look as it was hard to know whether I was seeing things properly looking through the window and sheilding my eyes from the light inside.  It was pitch black outside except for a few dim stars and this bright white light which every now and then seemed to glow red and move about suddenly.  I felt a wee bit scared and got my girlfriend to come outside too.  We seemed to be the only ones interested or who remembered what had just happened...  Once we got outside I was almost certain that the shape was a diamond although it had moved even further back, still at eye level though.  All of a sudden it zig zagged from side to side and seemed to come closer, then settled directly in front of us but further away.  I really thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and said to my friend... did you see that? She said yep and not wanting to lead her, I said, what did you see? and she descibed the zig zap movement too.  This thing must have been moving fast as it went from the left to right of our field of vision and back again several times in a matter of seconds.  At this point we got the binoculars and resting my arms on the fence to ensure I didn't wobble, I tried to see something.  It was too far away and only confirmed that it was vaguely diamond shaped, it was really bright and occasionally seemed to flash red but far enough back now that even through binoculars was hard to distinguish.  I gave up.  We started to run through all the things it could possibly be and logic said it wasn't any of them, ie. not a satellite as they orbit the earth on a horizontal plane, not a star as we had never seen one there before and they tended to pass overhead as night waned to day (incidentially I have looked and looked and never seen anything remotely like that light at any time of year, ever again), etc...  We were determined to keep an eye on it and at one point started to feel that maybe it was keeping an eye on us!  Every now and again we would go back in and tell the others it was still there but they told us we were seeing things.  It zig zagged several times after that and occasionally appeared to come closer (and we got ready to run inside) but always it settled just beyond our field of truly distinguishable vision.  We decided to keep an eye on it until it went away and finally it sat at a point which we realised was the horizon as the sun came up, and there it stayed until about 8.00 am.  As the sky lit up it maintained its brightness while the stars dimmed and faded out completely by about 7.00 am.  We watched the family in the house below arise and soon summised that even if farmers/early risers did look to the sky, unless they knew where to look, they probably would have missed this object or dismissed it as a star.  By this time we had ""landmarks"" to measure the object against, being several little islands near the horizon.  As the sun rose we were able to confirm that it was sitting just above and to the right of the one on the right.  We were tired by now and nothing ""exciting"" had happened for quite some time so we would go inside and come out every half hour or so to check...  Around 8.00 am we realised that having sat stationery for most of the night, the object was now moving up, back and to the left at a considerable speed.  We could still see it because we knew where to look but, although bright, it was becoming much smaller as it moved away.  By about 10.00 am we could still see it getting smaller and further away and finally giving up, noted that it had moved a lot from its original position... instead of just above and to the right of the right island, it was now considerably to the left of the left island (bearing in mind the islands are situated straight ahead and directly to the east) and instead of near the horizon, was high in the sky, and a mere pinprick of bright light, having at first been of a size considerably larger and brigher than the largest and brightest star.  Over the years, we have talked of this experience to numerous people and not all have scoffed.  I didn't know who to report it to so didn't.  A few people even related their UFO stories to me.  One guy was on his way from shopping with his wife after work, when coming out of the city, noticed a many storied, brightly lit object hovering over the sea.  They pulled over and looked at it, as did the car behind them, before it disappeared.  He is disappointed that they then drove off without verifying it with the driver of the other car.  Another was an airline pilot who looked at me in horror when I asked him if he believed in UFO's.  I proceeded to tell my story anyway, at which point he relaxed, and realising that I wasn't going to cite him mad or cause him to lose his job, he told of a time near New Caledonia, an island in the Pacific, when his commercial flight and an American plane were both circling to land and reported an unidentified object sitting between them.  It didn't show on the radar on land or their planes, but the cockpit crews of both planes had visually identified it and started discussing it sitting between them, at that point it suddenly accelerated straight up in the air from a motionless position, at extremely high speed, and disappeared.  Another friend who does air traffic control told me that something once crossed his radar and went off the screen in a matter of seconds - many in the control tower witnessed it and none can explain it as the speed at which it was flying was so much greater than anything known at that time.

I could see the formation of the ground but not the color of the dirt. I also noticed three other glowing areas about twelve by twelve inch squares spaced in a zig zag formation about three feet apart. They also had the same glowing effect.

What was that cigar shaped object ?,Phoenix,AZ,2003-05-27T22:10:00,cigar,10 minutes,"Occurred : 5/27/2003 22:10  (Entered as : 05/27/03 22:10) Reported: 6/14/2003 11:07:25 PM 23:07 Posted: 6/18/2003 Location: Phoenix, AZ Shape: Cigar Duration:10 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29206.html,"What was that cigar shaped object ? It was a very clear night at about 10:10 p.m. and I was hungry.  I decided to go to an Circle K store which was nearby where we lived.  Without disclosing exactly where I live,  all I can say is that I live nearby Mountain, on the south side.  When I went outside to my car something attracked my attention that I thought it was an helicopter hovering low.  We get many helicopter rescues due to people climbing this Mtn. and they either get stuck or fall and injure themselves.  I looked up at this cigar shaped just hovering there, the lights of the object had attracted my attention and it was hardly moving at all.  There were pinpoint lights alongside of it enough to show that it was a cigar shaped.  I watched it for at least ten minutes if not more, trying to make sense of it, and to make out the exact location of where it was hovering over.  It was hovering North of the Mtn., seemed to be at an height of at least 800 to a thousand feet.  I'm not good at distances but it was close enough for me to rule out that  it was not a plane, helicopter, hot-air balloons and a blimp.  We get blimps flyover during certain times of the year depending on the events.  We have airliners flying over and the airport is about 2 1/2 miles south of where I saw this object.  As I watched this object I observed some of the pinpoint bright lights sometimes flickering.  At the ends of the cigar shaped object there were slightly larger red lights.  It never moved, made noise, it just hung in there the whole time I watched it.  The lights around where I was did not interfere my sight since my house lights were off and the street lights are a distance away.  Then suddenly at about at least during the ten minutes I was watching it .. it just took off upright toward the sky so fast and but it seemed like it just disappeared as it zoomed off.  I went to the Circle K and there was a man standing at the corner of the store, staring at the same area where I saw this object.  I ignored him and went inside the Circle K store! After I bought some items and came outside, he was still waiting at the corner still looking up at the sky and my car was parked next to him.  He was very quiet and seemed a bit shook up.  As I was starting to get into the car the man asked me if I had seen anything strange.  I asked him why do you ask me?  He said he's familiar with me since I come to the store often, and assumed I lived nearby.  I asked what does that have to do with my living nearby.  He said 'you had to have seen it, you just gotta have to seen that thing, it was just there and then it took off'.  I told him, whether if I had seen it or not, no body would believe it anyway.  I admitted I did see it but I didn't go into details, I just got into my car and went home.  All that night, I laid outside in my lounger, watching the sky, wondering if it'd come back which it didn't.  I know what I saw was real but I can't explain it since of all the airliners, blimps and hot air balloons I've never seen anything like it except, last week I was watching a TV show and it was about UFO's.  I was shocked to see the portion of the show where the daughter (in Colorado) goes outside to play and she saw this cigar shaped thing in the sky, called for her father, and he had video taped it.  The object I saw was so similiar to that object seen in Colorado, except it was closer.  This is the absolute truth to what I saw and it's real unless this is some secret government flying object of some sort.",2003-06-18T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

The 15 year old witness had not quite gone to sleep yet as he lay looking out at the stars through the mesh of the tent at his friends yard. Two shooting stars had been spotted already when an object about the size of the moon came into view at a rapid rate of speed.  The witness writes...""I saw what looked to be a football shaped object with a neon-purple shield fly across the sky. In the center of the craft there were 5 or 6 lights that looked like they weren't set up in any order. From the distance that I was, it looked like the lights probably had a diameter of 6-10 feet.""  The first contact was made by the mother through the OUFOR hotline the following night. Investigator Bill Coones was contacted and visited with the witness and his mother at their home picking up a few more details. Bill noted that the craft had a black body surrounded by a purple glow. The light was not reflected light in the witness estimation but glowing on its own. There were lights randomly spaced within the surrounding purple glow. The object went right overhead. It did not turn or change direction. There was no sound. Bills compass said the initial view was to the north and it went in a straight line and behind the trees to the south. The object was first sighted approximately 35 degrees (as by his angle finder) above level. It crossed directly overhead and was last seen at about 30 degrees to the south before the trees hid the view which was shown to him by the witness on the street.  Investigator Coones had some conversation about the UFO phenomenon with the witness and his mother and got the impression that the field was almost brand new to them as they were amazed at some matter of fact things he told them about things in this field of study.

It was in the middle of the night, early Sunday morning.  I am not sure what the exact time was because I currently do not have a clock in my bedroom on hand... I felt it must've been some time between 1-3 A.M.  I had my window open all night since the weather was warm earlier that day.  For some strange reason, I woke up out of a sound sleep and seconds later I heard what sounded like a small airplane buzzing in the distance and it was getting closer.  After a moment the sound grew louder and louder and I recognized that it was the sound of helicopters, maybe two or three.  These helicopters then began to fly EXTREMELY low over and through the tree tops of our quiet wooded neighborhood.  I knew that by this time, all of the neighbors were probably awaken by this event.  The helicopters, for ten minutes circled low, several times as if looking for something.  They were low, but circled a wide perimeter of the forest and I could not see them.  It was the last couple of minutes, one of the helicopters finally circled in closer.  I saw a black helicopter with a very bright searchlight and with bright blue and red lights underneath.  I did not see the other two, but I know there was more than one.  I'm not sure if they were King County Police or military!?  After ten minutes, they flew away in the southwest direction.  It was right after they left, I heard a strange low hum outside in the area that lasted for a few minutes and faded.  In the morning, I asked my family, who also had their windows open, if they woke up and heard this terribly loud event and they said, ""No,"" and that they were all fast asleep.  Something was strange about this.  These helicopters were frantically chasing and looking for something in these woods. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It had just become dark out, and we all watched 4 circular completely silent objects about 40 feet or more in diameter (along with all the others on the beach at the time -people were basically just quietly standing and gawking at these objects) and only about 100 feet offshore. They flew in rigid formation, straight up to an altitude of several hundred feet and then dipped to about 50 feet and would go straight up again. They kept this up almost as if they were doing yo yo tricks which no known aircraft I knew of could possibly do. Again they were completely silent. My friends mother suggested we leave the beach because she thought they could be UFOs and we could be in danger despite the wonder of it all. We did leave. My friend's mother said she saw the glowing objects the following night as well but I wasn't on the beach with her at that time. My eyes were excellent and though I was only about 11 at the time, I strained to get some detail because they were so close, but all I could make out was that the bottom of the craft emitted a white light, like the surface was emitting the light but it was a diffuse light and not directed like a beam. They light was not brilliant, but about as bright as a white screen on a modern day CRT. We discussed afterward what was unusual, which was that they were totally silent (we were only a 100 feet away from these aerial acrobats) and that they glowed, and that they were able to stay in such rigid formation while maneuvering vertically, like a yo yo, even when they would hover, start and stop abruptly, drop and rise again and hover, almost as if they were part of the same object. But we all agreed they appeared to be separate objects. We also felt it was unusual because this sighting was not far from the Naval base down the beach (which my friend and I once walked to from this location). There were no j! et intercepts and there was nothing in the paper the next day either. It must have been witnessed by at least more than 50 people. I know these were not moons or satelites etc. I owned a telescope at the time and would easily be able to identify such objects. They also did not have qualities I would associate with mirages. The edges of the objects were crisp and did not wobble. You could see the normal effects of size change with distance as well as they came close and moved away (perspective indicated these objects were probably within 100 feet of the beach). The experience itself is clear enough in my memory, but I would have to really do some digging to determine the date. It was either 1962 or 1963 and it was definitely either July or August. Those are the times I visited my friend in Va.. This report is factual and true in terms of what happened and what I saw. I am not speculating as to what the objects were, but did try to indicate what I knew they clearly were not as I thought this could help in terms of accuracy. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

"We thought our foster daughter was kidding us, until we saw the metallic saucer shaped object humming loudly over the Michigan farmland",Mancelona,MI,1978-06-15T21:00:00,disk,10 minutes,"Occurred : 6/15/1978 21:00  (Entered as : 06/15/78 21:00) Reported: 6/1/2003 8:15:07 AM 08:15 Posted: 6/3/2003 Location: Mancelona, MI Shape: Disk Duration:10 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29019.html,"We thought our foster daughter was kidding us, until we saw the metallic saucer shaped object humming loudly over the Michigan farmland We lived in a farmhouse on the edge of a rural town of about 1,000 people.  Our backyard was actually 80 acres of grass field, former farmland left unfarmed for mamy years.  There was an old two-track road which extended from our driveway out into the ""back 80""... past the barn and out into the grass field.  It was a warm early-summer evening, the skies were clear, and we were inside watching TV.  Our foster-daughter burst into the back door.  ""Come Look!  Quick!  There is SOMETHING in the SKY out in the back field!""  We kind of laughed at her, thinking she was being melodromatic, or attempting an attention-getting move or perhaps even hoaxing us... but when she repeated what she had said, the second time more insistant than the first... well, we saw something in her eyes that said there might be something wrong... if you are a parent, you know the feeling!  (It seems that she and her boyfriend were unknown to us at the time, ""parking"" on the two-track dirt road which ran through the grass field behind our house.  The radio went out on their car as soon as they saw the object... then they both made it back to the house to let us know about the UFO...thats when she ran in the door!).  So we went out the backdoor and into the yard, listening to our foster-daughter babble about, ""it went down this way and then up twice as far this way, like a pattern...""  when I looked up and saw the object, hovering, over the field behind our house.  I estimate it was no farther than 250 yards away from me, hovering about 200 to 300 feet in the air.  It was metallic and disk-shaped...and all along the rim it exhibited colors changing from red-orange-white-blue (there were four of us there in all, 2 people also saw a greenish tint).  But, what made me stand there slack-jawed was the SOUND the darn thing was making... it was a loud-vibrating-humming low pitched tone... and it vibrated into and through everything!  I was standing adjacent to an old out-building in the backyard, and the siding on the building was actually rattling/humming from the noise!  I reached out my hand and touched the building and it literally was vibrating!  (I have since estimated the ""humming/vibrating"" to have been very near 39 to 40 Hertz).  And, as unbelievable as this sounds, and it makes me realize why there aren't more good-quality pictures/videos taken of UFOs... I had a brand new Nikon F camera in my house and didn't even THINK of going in and getting it.  The four of us stood there, slack-jawed... me, my wife, my foster-daughter, and her boyfriend... and none of us said a word for 10 minutes.  We just stared, transfixed at this ""thing"" in the backyard that just sat there humming.  It finally, about 10 minutes later very slowly (maybe 20 MPH?) drifted off to the southeast, toward a very sparsely populated rural area of our county.  I lost sight of it in the street lights when it went across the sky.  We all went inside and recounted to each other what we saw, felt, and heard.  And I really think that is when we all just shut up about it and none of us has said a word to anyone (except very good friends) until now.  The time has come for an explanation from someone... from our government, or whoever the powers-that-be are in this country.  What the hell did we see in the sky behind my house?  I have had several college-level astronomy courses.  I know the difference between an anomaly and an ordinary occurence.  I did not see ""Venus, Swamp Gas, or a Weather Balloon"".  I used to be a UFO skeptic... and I have purposefully left the term ""extraterrestrial"" out of the account as I saw no evidence of ""life"" or ""intelligent maneuvering of the object"". BUT, I can say with 100% assuredness that there was something ""unexplained"" in the skies over Mancelona, Michigan in the summer of 1978. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was on the way to an overnight camp in the wilderness with my backpacking class in a car that included my instructor and a roommate. We had left Bradford and were driving along a road that was parallel to the state park we were planning to camp in, and I noticed that there were two small jets (military?) flying at about 5000 ft overhead (leaving small jet trails), and there was a small circular metallic object following closely behind the second jet. I told my car mates there was a UFO and they laughed, but my roommate then checked it out by looking up out the window and confirmed what I saw, and my instructor pulled over to see it. We got out and the object stopped following the jet and hovered above us at about a mile up (not moving for about 5 or 10 seconds) and then within about 1 or 2 seconds slid back to the tail of the second jet. It was far away but we agreed it looked metallic and seemed to be nearly circular but with many edges like a polygon with many (20? or 30?) sides (I seem to remember it reflected sunlight helping me to discern it had edges and was metallic). It left no jet trail and did appear to be able to hover and then accelerate quickly to a speed that was many times that of the jets it was following. They were headed I believe North into the state park which I remember was about 200 square miles of wilderness. That was the last we saw of them. I do remember after returning from the overnight hike, we read in the news that there had been many UFO sightings in NY north of the park at about the same time we saw ours.

I was simply incredulous! It was such a beautiful and graceful display! They were too perfect and perhaps coordinated to seem anything but choreographed. I did not hear a thing. It never occurred to me to stop. I just kept on driving and eventually they were ""just gone."" To this day, no one has taken me seriously. I know what I saw though.

The North American Aerospace Defense Command scrambled the jets soon after unverified reports were received around 4 p.m. Wednesday that the contrail, seen near the Turks and Caicos Islands, was headed northwest toward the United States, said Lt. Cmdr. Curtis Jenkins, a spokesman for the Colorado Springs-based group.  A contrail is a white trail of condensed water vapor that sometimes forms in the wake of an aircraft.  The jets were scrambled from more than one base and more than one location, he said, though he did not know how many jets or from how many locations.  Commercial airline pilots later reported the contrail over Florida and then over Indiana, after which no more sightings were reported, he said.  The jets attempted to intercept and identify the source of the contrail, but no visual or confirmed radar contact was made, he added.  ""I don't know that anybody was predisposed to think it might be some thing or the other,"" he said. ""We don't even know that it was a thing. It was just simply reports of contrails. We don't even know that it was the same one. We had reports from different places and NORAD did its job and tried to find out.""  NORAD is coordinating with the Federal Aviation Administration and is continuing to investigate the reports, he added.  ((END CNN STORY))",2002-12-23T00:00:00,,

I first caught sight of the planet Jupiter, rather bright and imposing, shining away in the eastern sky. Several winter constellations were also visible overhead and in the south, shining through a thin layer of haze and broken clouds. It was a rather chilly evening so I decided to leave my telescope indoors and just do some 'eyeball astronomy'. After a couple minutes I suddenly noticed an object midway up in the east (about 50 degrees altitude) moving south. Its appearance was that of broadly V-shaped gossamer contrail, three full moon diameters wide, without any lights or form of illumination. I expected the object to begin to disperse and dissipate as I watched, due to its thin and wispy appearance. It did not! The object continued to move south steadily. I lost sight of it after twenty seconds or so when the object moved behind a bank of clouds in the south. It made no sound the entire time that I had it in view. Being an amateur astronomer for the past twenty years has given me the opportunity to experience a good amount of sky phenomena. I have never seen anything in the night sky that I didn't have an explanation for - until now! I would be very interested in any and all plausible explanations of the object I spotted. My only explanation - birds flying south for the winter - was quickly discarded when I witnessed the object move behind the clouds.",2002-12-23T00:00:00,41.4817,-81.8024

I suddenly saw one of the stars start to move. I thought this was interesting because we had a bad ass metior shower about a week before this happened and I just couldnt understand how it would still be going on after. Then I noticed something odd. The star never disappeared, like you would expect it to in a metior shower. It traveled across the sky at a fairly quick pace. I thought well, it must be a sattellite. But then it started to move all over in the sky, and in quick and rapid motions, it would make sharp turns. obviosly this was not a sattellite. As I continued to look at it, the light ( it must have been as artifial one, made to disguise it like a star) would get very big, and then fade away. A short while later (5 seconds at the most) it would appear in another section of the sky, darting from place to place to place, so easily that I could definetly tell that this was something straight out of a videogame or something. And it would always fade out, then reappear. i called my mom out, but she said that she couldnt see it. I guess I couldnt blame her, as the sky was full of stars that night. this continued for about an hour, as I sat and watched this machine continue to do this same thing, until i finally called my friend who lives in the woods on the outskirts of town to get his ass out side and look at the sky, but he didnt see it either.

I don't drink or smoke and I don't do drugs...I am in my early 40's and have a daughter so we often go to my grandfather's cottage in the summer.  I've been going there with my family since I was 4 years old. This ocurred at our cottage 45 min from Ottawa at Innisville on the Mississippi River.  I sometimes sleep outside in the tent because I like the outdoors and the sound of the water puts me to sleep...this particular night the people next door were playing loud Elvis music and I liked it, so I listened until approx 1:30am.  Just as the music stopped, I lay awake for a few minutes (I had a sharp throbing pain in my arm that wouldn't go away) and then I heard a low whispy sound outside my tent.(almost like a hot air balloon but the pitch was lower and more consistent)  The reflection of light that shone on my tent was moving very slowly.  Usually when cars go by, the shadows and reflections from headlights move very fast.  I thought it was strange, so I got up and looked out the tent mesh window (I kept it open because the moon was full that night and all the stars were very bright) (saw the Northern lights earlier) When I looked out the window I couldn't believe what I was seeing...this was a massive ship (very tall, wide and tubular) completely covered by bright white lights (8 ft away from me) It was a beautiful display of white light  (looked like large light bulbs all over it) it started moving very slowly over the water passing my tent, so of course I ran to the other side of my tent to see where it was going.  It kept going until it was half way to the neighbours cottage (30 ft.)and stopped and just hovered over the water for some time...I just watched (this is something so unbelievable to see and I didn't know what to do) This was massive and it also had additional tube lighting in which white light circled (travelled) around the ship.  My reaction was to get closer to it, so I unzipped my tent and ran outside towards it.(I don't know how other people would react but I was so excited and I wanted to make contact) Then, suddenly, with a low sound, it completely disappeared leaving a sharp white light from where I stood and left a trail of light all the way to the stars (it looked like a star in the sky at that point) This trail of white light stayed for a few seconds before the whole thing disappeared) I kept watching this star because I was totally amazed...a few seconds later I saw that star zip across the sky in a sharp straight green line to another  star.  I will never forget that night.  I used to laugh when I saw pictures etc. of flying objects and aliens.  Now, I am convinced that there definately is life beyond our planet.(and a little nervous about the alien part)  I could hardly sleep and was a little nervous to tell everyone in the morning because I thought they'd think I was nuts!  While I was telling my sister in the cottage, my mother said that she was glad someone else saw it. She saw what looked like a ship with windows just outside her window around the same time that morning.  She said she was lying down and couldn't sleep (the music was keeping her up) and out of nowhere she saw what at fi! rst look ed like shooting stars but then she realized that they were shooting in all directions and there were many of them.  Then she was staring at lights and windows of what she describes as a ship or building.  Anyway, for the next few days we were both in shock.  I'm sure she'll never forget this either.  I was a little worried about my mom because she's 78 and was really shaken up about it. She didn't want to go back to the cottage to sleep. It's strange because for the last few nights prior to this incident, my neighbour had been hearing strange sounds like a hot air balloon but never looked out of her window.  She, and her partner also heard a baby crying at 3:00am that woke them and when they looked out the window, she saw nothing.  I always walk in the water as it has very shallow rapids and I noticed this summer that some of the very heavy rock had been moved (it didn't move when we had a flood several years ago and I wondered how it had moved) This was a particular spot that I used to sit in and I thought it was strange.  Maybe related, maybe not, but it was close to the spot where the ship had been hovering. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))",2003-03-04T00:00:00,45.3813825,-75.70850071428572

I turned to look at it properly and it had a rotating sphere on the underside of the craft, the reason that I know this sphere was rotating was because there were smaller spherical lights on the underside of the sphere (and on the underside not on the side or on the lip!) and these lights were moving round what seemed fairly slowly.  the rest of the underside disk appeared to be dark with no real discerning colours. the top of the craft was a golden orange colour and more of a block shape, with no protrusions or other lights there were no sounds eminating from the craft, and I only saw the craft for 2 - 3 seconds. it basically hovered there and with no noise at all moved away with extreme pace, it also left a brief golden orange light trail.

I ran outside as it flew right over; my best guess is that it was about a mile up.  The sun was in my eyes but I caught sight of the object again as it continued on, apparently heading directly east.  The ground level winds were variably, but mostly coming from the N/NE.  I watched the clouds, which were primarily over the mountains to the west, and, noted that they were drifting primarily in a southerly direction (and probably easterly as well).

This evening was my preverbial paydirt for my diligent efforts in looking to to the sky above. I was looking in a North Westerly direction close to were the Sun was getting ready to set and saw the object. The object must have been fairly good size one because I could see it very clearly. But, I also know that this object was some distance away from me. The object was Elliptical or Oval shaped with a whitish silvery appearance. I really could see a very defined white-silver oval shaped object. The object appeared to be stationary for a few moments and then all of a sudden it shot straight up and to the left then it stopped for a brief second or two and then shot down to the right at a very high rate of speed and again it stopped.The object then flew off very fast toward the horizon. I lost track of it and assumed that it accelerated so fast that it just vanished. I still can't believe that I really saw this object but I truly did! It shook me up a little, kind of felt tingly feeling all over after seeing it. I am a Manager at a Logistics Center here in Spring Hill and I am of sound mind. I definately know what I saw and it wasn't an airplane, hot air balloon, swamp gas, chem-trails or anything else. I however, do not know if this was possibly a military craft because I did see 2 blackhawk helicopters and a Stealth Fighter flying around not to long after seeing this object.It may be worthy to note that they were flying in the direction of where I saw the object. My only regret after seeing this object was that I didn't have my camera with me.

We were sitting at a table facing an east window. I was sitting in a south direction.  The window was quite large and I was enjoying looking out the window in a southeast direction towards the lake.  Between 6 and 6:30 pm, I noticed in the distance, in this same southeast direction, over the lake a hot-air-balloon-type object or a blimp-shaped object.  Sometimes, it even looked eye-shaped or oval-shaped.  It didn't look a plane.  It caught my attention because it seemed to stay stationary for a number of minutes.  I asked my wife what she thought and she agreed that it didn't look like an airplane.  I was keeping an eye on it during our dinner conversation.  I noticed that it moved slowly eastward and out of view due to a southeast building a couple of times, then back into view.  Again it appeared to stay fairly stationary for a few more minutes.  Eventually, it moved westward out of my view.  I sent an email to the Toronto Island Airport this evening to find out if maybe there had been a slow-moving object over the lake towards the Etobicoke area of Toronto around this time, but I haven't received a reply.  It was dark black to silver colour against the clouds on the horizon.  It didn't appear to be a cloud because it was staying somewhat stationary.  The wind was gusty at the time. I could see the upper tree branches moving around Dundas Street West along with the clouds (they appeared to be moving south).  I'm not sure what it was, but it made the dinner conversation more interesting.",2003-07-16T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

Note: about four minutes later we were on an adjacent road and viewed a jet, clearly visible against the moon, heading southwest, the opposite of the craft. the jet picked up speed and we have agreed that it had to have been going at least mock 1, because of the jetstream and the length of time it took to clear our view(at least a four mile radious, we stopped by a field) we contiued to watch the sky for a moment and about 1 to 2 minutes later two more jets were visibly seen goin! g northeast toward the craft. they too were flying exeptionally fast. one came from the southwest, the other from the west. getting closer to each other, then they left our line of sight.",2003-07-16T00:00:00,42.5689,-84.8361

I told my mother what I was seeing and got off the phone to pay attention. I saw a very bright light in the sky, that was alternating white to gold, with a bit of red and then mostly white light, that I thought was a planet, and I looked again and saw it was an aircraft of some sort.  The location was directly above Paine Field, the Boeing plant in Everett Washington.  There was a LOT of aircraft activity in the sky, some very fast moving jets were flying around.  It was easy for me to tell after a few moments, that this object was hovering and it was not a regular plane or coptor. All of a sudden, out of the blue, another one appeared.  This one was in a direct line to the right and made a perfect angle.  They both sat there glowing for about 3-5 mins. I called the local television station and told them what I was seeing.  As I continued to look, the top object, the larger brighter one moved in a dirct line up then moved to the right, the lights dimmed and I was able to see a shape.  As best as I can describe it, it was like a cylinder, and it had a metallic look like nothing I have ever seen before.  Then it completely disappeared.  It kind of like, dimmed, and then it was absolutely gone!  Then the other one did the same thing, and I turned my back for an instant, looked back and there was absolutely no sign of it.  I called Paine Field to try to get someone on the phone, but there was only an answering machine and I told them what I saw, but no one has called me back.

I was startled to see, out my window, what looked at first to be a large passenger jet passing low over the apartment building. (I live in the middle of Washington, D.C., and this is restricted airspace. Passenger jets never fly over this building.) I raced to the window and pulled out the screen in order to get a better view. I saw what looked like a giant boomerang, with several flashing lights around its edge, flying low, slow, and silently toward the west. When it reached the Potomac River, it turned south and continued until it was out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested some type of graphic from the witness.

I left the report on your Web site in the hope that it might find some support. I'm not much good at drawing and it would be difficult for me to accurately portray, from memory, the ships lights. However, I meant what I wrote about it looking like a giant boomerang: The wing tips and nose were all fairly rounded, not pointed, and the craft was relatively flat. (For an example of the type of boomerang I mean, see the ""Turning Point Ash Natural Elbow Doublers"" at this Web site: http://www.flight-toys.com/boomerang/hardwood.htm .)  There were lights in various places on the wings--some lights blinking, some lights rotating, others doing neither. Other than that, I don't think I can add much more to my report.

They did not move any  farther or closer during the four minutes that we saw them. They stayed in the same posistion in the western sky moving around in these semi-controlled patterns, and the night was clear as a bell (no clouds reflecting anything).They were 2-4 times brighter than the brightest star.

It certainly backs up my descrioption of the event, although the color off the fireball is absent. I am also aware that Vandenburg airforce base is in the direction we were looking, about 90 miles west/northwest of our location, and I have seen rockets launched from there numerous times.

They appeared to be slightly changing in color, but basically seemed much redder overall compared to the moon and few stars in the sky at the same time. At first I believed the lights to be either airplanes or helicopters, but their motion and behavior were not like any other manmade aircraft I ever observed. they seemed to move sloly y around each other, get closer two different times, then separate.  By far the weirdest part observed was at one point, a very small secondary light appeared to leave the lower craft, and move several degrees  down, then dissappear, as if it were a controlled satellited No movements were jerky or fast, just very slow and controlled Finally the lights compeleted faded out from view.

PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP FROM WITNESS)) Dear Sirs: Thanks for personnally replying to my report.  I am most interested in the number of people seeing and reporting this event, as I cannot understand how it could not have been seen by hundreds of people if not more. At the time of the initial spotting of the object, I was located on the street outside my apartment in Burbank.   The time was approx 5 min. before 11:00 P.M. but the objects could have been there much earlier. From the best of my ability to estimate, the objects appeared to be about 30 to 40 degrees in the sky, somewhat below where the moon was in the sky at the time, and in approx the same direction, to the south-west of my position. Incidentally, Pacoima happens to be somewhat to the north and west of my position, so if the other sighting was at the same time, it could not have been the same objects I was observing.  Actually, from my main viewing position on my third floor apartment balconey, my view to the north and west is obscured by my building. I have not yet been able to find anyone else who saw the objects at that time, or have not seen any reports in any media.  Do you know if any media reports were made? Thank you very much for doing the work you do.  There must be an explaination to these events. ((name deleted)) ((END))",2003-03-11T00:00:00,34.151642662632376,-118.31696066565809

After I had shot maybe the first 2-3 rounds the lights went out on the triangle and it just disappeared. I shot 7 rounds more. They were all aimed at where the triangle was or had been. I shot for maybe 10 seconds. Then I took off at about 60 mph for home. When I arrived home I looked up ""UFO"" via the Google search engine. I had a girlfriend who thought she was abducted by aliens while driving alone in rural Nebraska in the late 50's when she was about 21. She was always afraid of driving alone in the country. I carry the Ranch Rifle because there are now coyotes near my farm and I raise chickens. I shot at the triangle becasuse I did not want to become an alien ""science project."" At Noon on March 12th I returned to the place where I fired at the triangle and found 10 empty cartriges. No evidence I had hit anything. Just trees and fields. Nearest home is about 2/3 mile away. No electrical problems with my truck since. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) Following up...I drove to the spot where I shot at the triangle during daylight and there was no indication that I had hit it. The spent .223 cartridges were scattered on both shoulders of the road. No homes in the area, just fields and woods. I carry a Ruger Ranch Rifle because there are now coyotes in the area and I have chickens on my small farm. I was about 4 miles from my home when I saw the triangle at 10 PM. A former girlfriend thought she was abducted by a UFO and she was scared to death of being alone in the country.

I watched for about 5 minutes and the light did not move, so i went and woke up my daughter and told her to come and look at it. I also got the telescope out onto the back porch and got it in my sites. It appeared to be a perfectly round sphere. orange/yellow in color. it did not appear to pulsate. I was facing east and as the sum came up i was not able to see it any longer but i think it was still there. This morning i got up and thinking it was probably a star would be in the same place. nothing. when sighting the sphere though the telescope I used the crosshairs on the little quick align scope and put the crosshairs right on the sphere an hour later they were still right on the sphere. which shows there was no movement of the object. i have a small telescope and it does not bring the stars very close but when looking at this object it filled the view finder.

Highmoor Dam is situated at Longditude 29°34'and South Latitude 29­°25'. While watching two eagles soaring overhead my wife noticed a silver object shining in the sky directly overhead. She pointed it out to me and asked what I thought it was. At first I thought it was sunlight reflecting off a geostationery satelite, although I had never seen this type of phenomena before. The altitude of the shining disc was estimated to be that of a satelite which is normaly seen in the night sky. We both viewed the stationery object for a few minutes before sighting it through a pair of binoculars. There was very little to add to the above explanation except that what I considered to be reflected light was seen to be closer due to the magnification. After about 15 minutes with absolutly no movement of the object I decided to capture it on video. I fitted a telephoto lens to the camera but battled to sight the object through the viewfinder. I had been out camping in the area for two weeks taking footage of the trip. It was at this moment when I needed the camera that the battery went flat, hence no video. It would not have been of much use anyway as all it would have shown was a dab of silver light against a blue background. We both continued to rick our necks looking directly above us at this object. Having seen all these spy movies on TV I then thought it was big brother looking in, so I pulled a couple of zap signs at it. My wife went into the tent for a few moments and when she came back out, asked if I could still see it. I was using the binoculars and could see it clearly. The next instant it started moving in a westerly direction picking up speed as it went. My wife asked me where to look. I did not take my eyes off the accelerating light, but said just follow the binoculars. The object moved through a 90° arc in approximatly 15 seconds where I lost sight of it behind some bushes at the back of our tent. I estimated its speed to be at least ten times faster than the satelites I have seen in the night sky. I d! on't kno w if we have anything on our planet than can hover at great altitude for the 30 minutes that I observed it and then accelerate to a guesstamate speed of some 270 000 km/p/h. I have always thought there might be ET's out there and if you cannot give some form of sane explanation to this one then I am convinced I saw a UFO.",2003-03-21T00:00:00,,

All the colored lights flashed on simultaneously and in three quick pulses that repeated after a beat.  The object steadily moved southwest from northeast at about 150 to 200 miles an hour.  It had passed near the moon, which was then in mid-eclipse, and I tracked it with the binoculars for about four seconds.  Then I watched it move along without the glasses.

As it passed, the colored lights flashing on it were powerful enough to be diffused by the moisture saturated air and also dimly reflected off the pavement and houses.  It was low because it moved in a straight line away from me and disappeared behind roof tops and trees in the west.  It had one small, steady, white light showing on its receding form.

This is the forth time I've seen these lights around my house.  Its been interesting.  Well, my friend and I were coming home from kokomo, driving west on 26.  I was looking out the window while listening to The Beatles when I saw those familiar orange lights.  There were four of them.  I told darren to pull off the side of the road so he could see.  Well we waited about 5-6 minutes and decided we weren't going to see it [just military jets in the sky, as usual].  We got back in the car and headed home.  I called my house and told my sis to go watch at the end of our road with her bf and she said alright.  It took us about 4 minutes to get to my road, 700 east, where we met my sis and her bf.  We asked them if we saw anything and they replied nope.  We told them that we were going to eat and then we'd be right back.  So we started down my road.. about 1-2 minutes later [we were driving quite slow, still looking]  I saw this big orange light to the right of me.  It was MUCH closer than any of the ones I've ever seen.  I had Darren stop and we jumped out. This light was just sitting there, military was circling the area.  My sister saw it too and drove down to where we were.  Just around then we see these little tiny orange lights break apart for the the bigger one.  A ton of these lights spilt off.. then they all faded away.  I asked if everyone had saw this, and pretty much the same thing coming out of all their mouths was, ""Wow.""  We were all kinda stunned.. it was like watching a movie.  We looked for another minute before deciding we better eat so we can come back out.  We were home eating and you could just hear all the jets in the area.  It was apparent they were either chasing the object or it was one of theirs [though I do not see how it could've been a manned object].  We got back out at 9:30 and it was pretty quiet.  As we were driving around the country roads we passed two slowly moving vehicles [possibly other people who saw the same thing?].  Nothing was seen for the rest of ! the night.

Keep in mind it's an account written by the biggest paranormal/UFO skeptic going but my partner of 7 years and I DEFINATELY witnessed something unusual on a recent unwind trip in Mexico this past week.  We are both two very sane, sober professional Minnesota guys in our thirties and were hardly in search of anything more exciting than some R and R by the pool when we landed in Cancun this past Monday.  After quickly being shuttled to our resort just south of Cancun we settled in our room and indulged in the food accomadations but skipped the complimentary Tacates because after a 4 hour trip all we wanted was to shower and inspect the fantastic playground and beach.  We were already relaxed and by this time it was dark.  Neither of us were tired though, flying from Minneapolis we had the luxury of being in the same time zone and I can assure you NOTHING clouded our vision that night.  We sat togther on two empty lounge chairs on the beach no more than a few feet from the grounds of the resort and discussed our options for our all inclusive packaged week.  We had never been to Cancun and it was exciting.  Above us was a spectacular sky, there were a few clouds and it was a little windy but altogther quite clear.  My partner had pointed out a few constellations I had never seen before having never been that far south in my life and no later than a few seconds after he started talking about the sky then TWO BRIGHT WHITE STARS from opposite sides of the beach MOVED toward each other.  SHOOTING STAR/S????????????!!!!We were intantly stunned and silent as they slowly moved toward each other, they then sort of stopped and ""kissed"", moved slowly apart then across the sky again, sometimes in perfect unison and at other times at different speeds and zig zag patterns.  I can say that neither of them circled in any way or ever appeared to come close to the ground.  They moved in straight lines, stopped an! d then changed pace and pattern over and over.  We were actually laughing in amazement, scouring the dark beach for other witnesses to this event but the only sound was the faint chatter of the full restaurants in the backround. It was a real ""What the hell is happening"" moment and the more excited and vocal we got in our astonishement the more faster and elaborate the patterns got, almost as if these things knew there was an audience!  It lasted no more than a few minutes, they just lost their brigtness and faded abruptly.  We couldn't take our eyes from the sky but they didn't return that night and we didn't check again on any other night although we talked about it often as we enjoyed the rest of our vacation just freaked that it had occured.  Nothing like that had happened to either of us before in our lives.  It changes you a bit.  We didn't feel threatened by these things, and nobody in the world could ever discount that moment for us although I'm very open for an explanation for this because from our hotel patio during the day I COULD see large, noisy commercial flights taking off in that vacinity from the local airport.  These were not planes and I have seen amusement park/Vegas style light effects in the sky before and I know that these things definately could not be produced in that way.  In fact it was much more than just seeing these thing that we experienced that night, we both had an overwhelming sense of being ""performed"" to as if something was communicating and although it wasn't clear what that was it wasn't beligerent in any way and maybe enhanced our trip altogether.  I was ready to ditch this memory this wind down weekend back home until I searched ""Cancun"" and ""UFO' on the internet out of curiosity and again found my self astounded by a few eerily and almost IDENTICAL experiences to ours in the very same area involving ""dancing stars"".  For this reason I add our account for whatever it may be worth, remaining as true and accurate to it as I can possibly be.",2003-06-10T00:00:00,,

The witness who is a radiology technician, was driving north on hwy. 6 and looked off to the west and saw 2 objects hovering above a field. She states that the objects were between 30 and 45 degrees above the horizon from her viewpoint. The witness stated she slowed down and rolled her window down to see the objects clearer.  Her description is that the objects were disk shaped, and had extremely bright white and red lights that flashed in sequence around the craft(s). Witness states no stars or other aircraft were seen, (This area is within the ATC area for Altus AFB) Altus AFB tower reported no air traffic in the area at that time. The objects were seen for approximately 3 minutes before vanishing, as the witness watched. Weather at the time of the sighting was reported to be good.

A witness was trying to get a hold of me, to inform me that if I jumped into my vehicle and headed west out of town (Houston) I would have been able to witness the object they were all watching. The witness telephoned me again this morning at 8:15 a.m. and filed her report. I also talked with others who also witnessed this object. I am just about to do the weekly radio spot with  CJFW FM, plus I did a an interview a while ago with CFBV FM for their news. I will be requesting if other folks had observed this object that they contact me. Also the witness mentioned they would have never called me that early in the morning if they weren't sure of what they were seeing, and being so strange. Plus as I said above, if I would have hurried out the door I would have seen it for myself, so the witnesses said. A few minutes drive west of Houston, five witnesses watched a huge object move silently and low over the tree line. Just before 1:30 a.m. the witness woke up as she heard her youngest child get up.  As the Mom made her way through their home, she walked by one of the windows and saw a very bright light/object.  As she stared at it, she noticed that it was moving very slowly and was of an enormous size.   She told me she screamed for her husband to get out of bed, which he did. Because of all the commotion the parents were making, their other two children got up to see what was going on.  One of the youngster said, ""what is that big flashlight doing in the sky""?   The folks who were watching the object said, there had to have been others who saw it, due to it's size, brightness and rate of speed. Also they noted they could hear freight liners traveling on the highway at the time of their sighting. The witnesses described the object as being boomerang in shape with a massive white/yellow glow around it. There were large bright light white lights in the center of the object. They heard not a sound from it, also the dogs took no notice of it. The sighting lasted approx: 3 minutes and disappeared behind the treeline and towards the southwest. After the event was over, the Mom had a problem in getting back to sleep as what she saw frightened her very much.

We were facing south-southwest and above in the sky I saw two sphere-shaped objects, slightly star-like, not as bright, but a hazy light grey color.  They were very round yet there was not a glow but a slight haze around them. They were moving at maybe a 45 degree angle from the ground from west to east in a southeast direction.  In other words, they appeared to be descending.  They were parallel to one another and moving faster than a plane, very smoothly, totally silent, down towards the tree line.  They were fairly large, larger than an average star, maybe about a quarter of the size of a full moon high in the sky. My husband thinks they were smaller, more star sized. In relation to an aircraft normally seen around this area, they were fairly low.  Their flight pattern was very unusual.  They were very close to one other, as I said, parallel, then at one point the object to the right crossed over to the left of the other's path. They continued to head south in a parallel formation till we could no longer see them as there were trees and buildings blocking the view. We ran into the house and my husband checked the time, it was 4:14AM. Neither of us have even seen anything like this.  We were up late but totally sober. We frequently look at the sky.  We watch shuttle launches and shooting stars.  I even saw a flaming meteor a few months ago streak from east to west in the same sky.  These objects were totally unlike anything we have ever experienced.  I looked on the Internet at UFO pictures and the closest thing to them are the so-called ""Phoenix lights"", or the round shapes that someone photographed during the recent lunar eclipse, which, by the way, we also watched.

No other reports of this alleged incident.  We do not know if this is a serious report, or not.  PD)) 4 foot being produces ""orb"" of bright light and disappears. My wife arrived home from work late one evening in a state of panic and terror. She was pounding on the front door so shaken, she was unable to get her key into the lock. It was very disturbing for me to see my wife going through the fear she was experiencing. I assumed she had been assaulted or raped. As I was getting ready to call the police, she was able to calm down somewhat and she told me to put the phone down, that it would not do any good anyway. Confused and shaken I asked why.  She explained that as she was pulling into our apartment complex, she was slowing down to select a parking spot (in low level light) when she noticed what appeared to be a small child playing around a large steel waste dumpster in the corner of the parking lot. The steel dumpster was located underneath a large stand of trees about 15 feet from her location.  She got out of her car and walked over to the rear passenger door (facing the dumpster)to get her brief case and saw movement out of her periphery that further caught her attention.  Her next concern was if this child was too young to be playing out in the dark late at night. She began to slowly walk towards the dumpster to ask where the childs parents are at.  As she approached the dumpster she could make out the contrasting shape of a head peeking out from one corner as she calmly spoke. She approached to within 6-8 feet when she heard a loud banging noise and this ""child"" suddenly had an ability to high jump 5 feet. It was then standing on top of the dumpster's steel lid staring down at her.  At this point she described feeling a pressure in her head, nausea and dizziness (this may have been a physical reaction to fear.) She told me she strained to identify if it was a neighborhood child who was staring at her for about 20-30 seconds, a kind of ""stand-off"".  Just as she realized this was not a child, the ""being"" produced a glowing-white orb of light about the size of a volleyball in its hands and held on to it at about chest height. The light cast off from the glowing orb illuminated its head for several seconds and she described a large almond shaped head with big black eyes staring intently at her movements. She told me that she just stood there in stunned silence trying to understand what was happening and that everything seemed to be happening in slow motion. The ""being"" seemed to tighten its grasp on the glowing orb of light and it jumped feet first into the dumpster and disappeared without making any noise. Right after that is when she began to break-down emotionally and run into the apartment.  Between the time she entered our apartment and calming her down and debriefing her was about an 1-hour. With much reluctance (I'll admit I was really creeped out to do this). I went back out to the exact spot she described with my metal softball bat and D-Cell Mag-Lite. I had to know what it was that terrified my wife.  I examined that whole area, even to the point of looking inside the dumpster and I did not see or notice anything.  Over the past several years we have seen many electric-white blue streaks of light in the area around this parking lot, during late evenings without any cloudcover and have had frequent but brief power outages. My wife and I conclude that these may be related to what she experienced. This is going out on a limb here, but my wife thinks that the orb of light was some kind of device that gave this ""being"" an ability to disappear, conceal or transport itself.  At this point, we choose not to be contacted. Based on the emotional trauma she went through, I prefer that she moves on and put all of this behind her.",2003-06-18T00:00:00,39.79513762886598,-89.66251786941581

We were sitting outside late in the evening when we noticed an apparently low flying yellowish orange light (circle) traveling from a south to north direction. The object might have been within a mile or ess of our position, but it was  difficult to judge the distance or size of the object itself. There was no sound, vapor trail, or navigational lights. We did observe a short time after the object came into view, a jet travelling at a higher altitude and with navigational strobes on in an east to west direction. Midway through it's path, the light changed. It becamea very bright white light. The source of this seem to begin in the center and then radiate outwardly to encompass most of the sphere. I did see just a small amount of yellowish orange,but the white was more overpowering. It was a bright sharp white light. One might compare it to a car's bright lights. During this time, the object continued at it's usual speed and altitude until it vanished over a hill. In the past few years, I've seen similar objects going over at low altitudes and from different locales in the region (see reports filed on : 8/3/99 and 3/8/01 in data base}.  There have been a couple other sightings of these in this region since then, but I did not file reports at the time. It was too low to be a satellite, but I did check the Iridium satellite schedule.

Also, the sky was partly cloudy that night with high clouds and a near full moon.The object was travelling below the cloud banks. Thanks!",2003-06-18T00:00:00,38.1142,-82.6032

It looked like a boomerang and was black and was moving at about 10 miles an hour. There were no jets, windows or lights. The wing was about 40 feet across, but the height (floor to ceiling) was only 4 feet. It seemed to flex a little at one point as if it were of a flexible material. It looked like and was moving horizontally like an aircraft though (not baloonlike). I told my wife to run in and get the video camera. It began to rise vertically quite rapidly at that point. By the time my wife got the camera (abot one minute) it was at about 3000 feet. I began filming the wing. A commercial jet flew past, and it kept rising vertically until it disappeared straight up. The video ran out of batteries before it disappeared completely out of sight. I have seen stealth fighters, as some have suggested this might have been but it was not like any of the ones I have ever seen or read about. The object seemed to turn one wing slightly at one point so it did not appear to be a completely rigid object. Are there man made objects that can behave like this? We have no idea what it might have been. I have not seen the video in many years but if I had to it might be possible to locate it in some closet but this is not a guarantee. The video doesn't show much detail unfortunately anyway because the sky is bright behind it and the bommerang object is fairly small in the image because it had risen to such an altitude by the time I had the camera running.",2003-06-03T00:00:00,40.7128,-73.2962

Joined after brief time by another- from thin air! Then both moved away and vanished! My daughter and I were on our way to visit my parents in Centerpoint, TX from San Antonio. We had just left Comfort, (a small hill-country town) when the lady in the car ahead of us applied her brakes quite suddenly and swerved off the road, looking up in the air. Thinking something was wrong, I slowed and stopped and my natural urge was to look up as well. About that time my daughter (who was 3 at the time, almost 4) said, ""Look Daddy, an airplane!"".  Looking at the object that hovered there in the clear sky (there were no clouds), I saw immediately that it wasn't an airplane. What I/we saw was a cylindrical (spelling?) object that looked like it was made from a highly reflective silver metal. It was a cylinder 'standing slightly on end' almost like a silvery beer can about to start to tip over. It just stayed there, not moving. I could see the sunlight reflecting off of it.  I looked at the lady ahead of me and she looked back at about the same time. She pointed in the air and made a 'questioning' guesture by shrugging her shoulders and pointing up. I shrugged back. Neither of us got out of our vehicles. Looking back at the object, it was still there. I felt remarkably calm though I knew it was some kind of object that couldn't be easily identified. I felt kind of 'dreamlike' or in a slightly drugged state. I turned on the radio to see if there were any more anywhere else (don't know; thought it might be a wave of them or something... I know it sounds wierd but it was one of my first reactions- probably too much Independence Day movie or something). The radio worked fine.  I looked back at the object just as my daughter said ""Look Daddy, a falling star!"" and pointed. There was a sudden shower of 'sparks' above and to the left of the object (from my vantage point) and suddenly there was ANOTHER object, an exact copy of the original in the area where the sparks appeared. This object was 'cantered' at the same angle. The were identical in every aspect that I could determine.  Then suddenly they both quickly receded to nothing but pinpoints, as if they moved directly away from us at extremely high speeds or as if they suddenly shrunk to nothing. There were no trails, no sparks, nothing... They both receded at exactly the same rate. I started my truck quickly and sped up the road 'after' them; the road roughly paralleled the path they took. I barely glanced at the woman on the way by but she looked remarkably calm as well; not really shaken.  As I drove after them (in the same direction I would be heading to go to my parent's), I turned the events over in my mind. It finally started to 'sink in' what I had seen. I look all over the sky as I drove but I never saw them again.  Driving the few miles left to my parents house, I said my ""hello's"" and then grabbed my dad's binoculars from his gun cabinet. I looked at the sky until the sun went down but saw nothing else...  I am not saying it was aliens but it was definetly something...  RT -Age 36 ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My Mom asked me if I could have an idea on what it could be, but I couldn't answer, as I was realizing that this light we had just seen seemed to be getting closer and to move in a strange way, like no other planes or helicopters do -- and I know what I'm talking about, as I used to live next to an airport.

However, that is only a guess.  PD)) I have on film an unexplained large,odd shaped ,colorful object in the night sky. First let me tell you , We are not nuts, We are very sane normal everyday people. With better things to do with our time than to watch things in the sky. Especialy 4:00 in the morning. I actualy feel stupid tell you about this. At First We thought it was a plane coming at us . That what we were seing was the headlights. I was up getting a drink of water. And my kitchin sink window faces the back yard Where my garage is. Up over the garage in the sky was this really huge light. Larger than any star I've ever saw. I called my husband to see. Even he couldn't figure out what it was. We both tried very hard to analize rationaly what we were looking at. ""North Star? "" ruled that out ,it was getting closer and seamed to be moving. "" Headlights of a plane ? "" ruled that out, usualy after a few moments the plane would turn and you could identify it plus it would have a blinking light on it , which it did not, and it never revealed itself to be one. It was a VERY clear night. Other stars were out. This was 10 x's or so larger than other stars. I told my husband we better film this. I acutarly had to sit in my kitchen sink in order to steady my hand and take the film. I tried real hard to zoom in on it , to get a better look at what it was. We still tried to believe it was just a really bright star. We even had to rule out a commit, because there should have been a tail. Every time I tried to zoom in on it , it would dissapear from my lense. And I couldn't figure out why that was. So instead of just zooming right in { I Have a very powerful zoom in movie camera} I would tap on the zoom . I got in pretty close. This is when my husband and I were really confused. It was changing colors. It would be a bright neon green on the outside and red on the inside. It kept pulsing { getting bigger than smaller] in and out. We just figured that was the automatic focus. This would occur if the object in the lense was moving. So it would automaticly re-focus. I did not have a tripod to steady it. So we just thought this would! be that my hand was shaky. It was completly round. When it pulsed bigger. This is when you would see the red center. Than when it pulsed back it would turn to its bright white. Eventualy it started going behind a tree. I then moved into my bedroom window where I could see if I could get a better view. This was better, Also because I could set the  camera down on the window sill and it would stay in focus and we could see if it was my shaky hands moving or the object. WELL. this was incredible. I got a better view and was able to zoom in VERY GOOD. This object kept going out of my view frame. Telling me that IT was moving and not me. And it had change shape. Stars don't do this. It changed to the shape of a , ""Get this"" a CHristmas Bulb. Sounds strange but I do Have it on film. It had two  white rings around the center, that were very close to it and each other. It Appeared to have a smaller ring in the center and off the small ring went four bars like an x. The top had gotten flat. It was purple in a perfectly shaped window at the top part that was square. The rest was round underneith. Also I forgot to mention. When we were in the kitchen window it got flat on top, then it changed to flat on the left side of it. In my video after viewing it on my tv. You could see the gararge too. Which gives you an idea of how large it looked to us. I kept filming hoping IF it was a UFO. That I wanted to get it on film taking off. But My battery ran dead on my camera, And I had to get up early to put my turkey in the oven. So I just gave up and went to sleep. If anyone thinks this is just a bright star. Please let me know. We are really puzzled. We want to know what it was. Usualy if a planet is going to be really close and really bright they let you know on the news so you can watch it. Well I havent heard of anything. I WANNA KNOW WHAT IT WAS.",2002-12-23T00:00:00,42.1168,-71.8648

PD)) 4 Meteor shaped objects slowing going across early morning sky While on my am route I was driving in town going south and noticed out my side window large glowing ""streaks"" in the sky. I stopped and observed through my window for a few seconds and then got out and looked. I was in town and there of course are homes and trees to deal with.  But in a clearing between some trees and houses I was able to see these objects.  They were rather low...not high in the sky...a bit above tree top level. There were four ""streaks"" -- one was the ""leading"" streak and very large...the other three were following the first and were a bit behind it. They were glowing a white/yellow hue, a silverish hue and a light blue hue. At first looking at them I thought-- Wow these are some huge meteors!  But when I kept observing them they were much too slow! They traversed about the speed that you would observe an airliner off in the distance.  They were going across the sky from a northern direction heading Southeast AND they were pretty much going straight across with a slight downward direction...like a very slow descent perhaps. They were going more in the direction of north to southeast but more south than anything else. I held my arm out fully extended and then used my thumb and index finger to measure the size of what the larger one was...it was the size of the space between my thumb and index finger fully extended...about 5 inches! The front part, of the leading object, which seemed to be about a two inches or so of more ""solid"" looking while the last 2 or 3 inches seemed to be more ""tail"". The last three seemed to be about half the size of the leading one. They appeared to be reflecting somewhat from the soon coming sunrise. I watched as long as I was able to see them...I lost track of them behind the foothills. There was not any blast of light -- like I would have expected to see if there was a hit on land. I did wonder for a bit if maybe they were missles as I have no idea what they may look like going across the sky.  I had even thought for a moment -- well this is it folks! I think I have dismissed the missle theory though...they were just moving too slow for that I think. I had looked around to see if anyone was up and about but I seemed to be the only one around to see this. I would love to know if anyone else had seen this though...I am truly perplexed!

The limited view from my windshield was short, but a huge fireball the size of a plane with a long tail of flames and smoke lit up the night sky.  I crossed the interstate at exit 370 and turned off my lights but could see nothing...  once in town I told friends of the siting and several of us went back out to the crash site and drove through large pastures looking for the site of impact. Curiously we were the only people out there.  I called the county sheriff's office and was told that other people had reported seeing a meteor or were concerned of a possible plane crash... but the object I saw was traveling far too fast to just be a falling plane.  Surprisingly there has been nothing in the local news of this event and the only other witness I know of is my 14 year old daughter who I'd left at her mother's when I went into town, she said she saw the very same thing on her way out to feed her horses.

My fiancee and I were driving north on highway 94 north of Rogers, and south of St. Cloud, when I looked to the west (my left) and noticed something gliding over a nearby field. My fiancee was driving, and I was a passenger in the backseat with her elderly grandmother in the front. I told her to take a look, but since she was driving, she only caught a short glimpse of the object. Her grandmother was unfortunately unable to turn and look at it. My fiancee told me she had seen it, and asked if I could tell what it was, to which I replied, ""not sure, but it doesn't look like any kind of plane I've ever seen."" As she continued to drive, the object was hovering slightly above the field at about 20 feet or so, then began to ""sprint"" in the same direction as our car was traveling (north). It quickly caught up to our speed (about 75 mph.), and then rose up to about 200 feet or so and stalled, then dropped to about 20 feet again, turned 180 degrees and took off in the opposite direction (south). Once more it stopped, hovered for 2-3 seconds, then turned once more and took off at a fast pace. Finally, we were to far down the highway to see anymore. I am not an aviator or engineer of any kind, but from my distance (about 200-250 yards away), it appeared to be approximately 20-25 feet from ""wingtip"" to ""wingtip"", and was about 4-5 feet wide in the middle. It was all black with no visible lights, and was in the shape of an air-foil or kinda folded wing; like an upside down, elongated U. It appeared to have no external propeller or engine, and no ""cockpit"" or apparent area for a passenger. I saw no people anywhere nearby in the field to make me think it was some sort of radio-controlled airplane; if it was, it was the largest radio controlled object I have ever seen! It was broad daylight at about 10:30 am with partly cloudy skies, and a slight wind from the west. I have included a map showing the approximate area we were, the direction we were traveling, the direstion(s) the object was traveling, and an illustration of what I saw.

This object is a strange gold light it comes alone some times, and other times with another gold object just like it. On New years 3 object appeard and formed a upside down pyramid. The first time I have seen it was on december 7,2002.When the object comes it throws down balls of gold lights from it, and i also have tapes of not only orange balls falling from it but objects comming from the sides of the object that look like stars. it apears almost everynight, throws balls of light then disapears, my parents, and sister have seen this object. We have over 30 tapes of this object including very close tapes. it is about sky level then gets real high and vanishes. From seeing this object everyday, and taping it I have noticed that it appears to look like a cross on the bottom and on the top a parashute looking device that moves around it like a pendulm. It can travil very fast at times, and very slow at times, it can hover,and make a sudden reverse backwords without making any noise.It goes very high up, and very low down when it wants. The last sighting of this obgect was on January 18, 2002 at 6:20 pm which I manged to tape. It apeard again right after that sighting but this time when I reached for my camera it disapeard.

PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM PRESUMED SAME WITNESS)) Dear Peter Davenport,        Burbank, Ca has been a hot spot of ufo activity for over a month now. Their is these gold lights that appear almost everynight, they appear somethimes one light, and other time 2 or 3 lights. The most I have seen were 3 lights, they appear sometimes and fly by, and other times hover. They throw down what appears to be smaller gold lights, and I even managed to capture stars comming out from the sides of each not once but multiple times, and these stars stay long after the ufo has gone. This may sound like a joke but I have captured these ufos on tape over 30 times, and seen them over 40 times. I have also filled out a report along with others on your site. The tapes that I have, I belive are very good. some close ones. I have been watching the Los Angeles news channels and even our public accsess channels and they dont mension them, anyways I have the tapes of these objects I would not like to send them in the mail, I would rather either visit you, or you visit me, you might even get to see them yourself. It seems like the area that I live in in burbank is where they appear the most. Thank you for your time i will be waithing for your response.

There was a fair amount of cloud cover in the sky, but pretty bright due to the city lights. As we neared the object we were able to look up at it and see it in silhouette against the clouds.  The object was a perfect triangle.  My companion pulled off to the side of the road and we got out to the car to look at it.  Several other motorists also stopped to see it. The object had white and yellow lighting -- initially these lights were blinking and running along the back side of the triangle only.  After watching the object for approximately 20 more seconds it began to move slowly southward toward San Francisco, and as it did, all three sides of the craft lit up.  These lights were blinking and then moving in a sort of pattern around the edge of the craft. Approximately 5 seconds after it started moving, the craft disappeared (in an area where it still should have been completely visible and free of the clouds).

I was a child (9 yrs. old)  I was playing with about 25 kids and 10 or so adults watchin over us on a late summer evening.  Suddenly one of the kids yells out: Wow, look at that.  As I turned to look at him, he was pointing towards the western night sky.  As I looked in the direction he was pointing, I saw what I initially thought was a full moon that was partially obscured by the corner of a house.  Maybe an odd site at night but nothing that unusual.  I turned back to look at the kid as everyone was moving in unison at this point. The kid re-asserted his position to ""look at that ball""!  I and the group of assembled kids and adults,(mostly mothers) turned to look at this ""full moon"" again. Only as we were looking directly at this object, it slowly moved behind the house and out of sight. Now everyone takes off for the house, looking behind it and over the adjacent hillside. Seeing nothing, everyone stood around processing what was it that we'd just seen.  Summarily, some of the kids began throwing rocks over the hillside, presumably protecting the neighborhood from aliens.  After about two minutes of this discussion,  this object (a white sphere about 5-7 ft. in diameter) zipped from the hillside, right in front of all of us, moving up at about a 45 degree angle, making no noise at all, not even air displacement,  from south to north, then back north to south, south to north again, and finally north to south and off into the night leaving a trail much like a meteor would only this thing was moving up and was obviously under some form of intelligent control. The trail dissipated much like a meteor's trail would leaving the 35 or so people standing there in stunned silence momentarily. This sighting remains one of the more powerful and steady memories from my childhood and several of the people who witnessed this have over the years spoken about it as though it was a recent sighting.  I have since seen footage ( N.A.S.A) of objects that were seen while one of its craft was orbiting the moon I do believe during the Apollo program that look and moved exactly like what I saw that evening.

It was triangular in shape and had what appeared to be a spotlight on the front. It seemed to be made in a gridwork fashion and had smaller lights on the corners. What caught my attention was the fact that it seemed to hover and then move at a slow rate of speed. I got out of my car and watched the object for about 5 minutes. The front light seemed to be ""searching"" the ground for something. There was only a slight humming noise coming from the object. I went inside to get my parents to come look at the object because I had never seen anything like it. My father was in bed, but my mother came outside with me and we watched it for another 10 minutes. It continued moving in a slow fashion just over the tree line and turned 90 degrees and went out of sight. I do not know what I saw and this is the first report I have made of the object.

There were no vehicles on the street. The sound was coming toward me rapidly, and then I realized it was above the surface. I was under large trees, so I went to the middle of the street where I could see straight up. A disc of dull metallic color came into view. It was travelling right up the street at approximately 100 MPH. There was a 1000 foot overcast and it was about 200 feet below that. I estimated it to be 40 feet in diameter. I could see no propellor, control surfaces or landing gear. As it was passing overhead, the noise got so loud that I put my hands over my ears, but it did not help at all!

Me and my mum were chatting and she decided to show me a room in her house she had recently decorated, while upstairs we looked out of the rear window overlooking the Moorfoot Hills looking towards Gorebridge when we noticed what I thought was a firework fairly high in the not so distant sky.  We both looked at it, and I soon realised that the ""firework""; was more like a flare, as the extremely bright pink glow did not fade at all; as it stayed stationary in the sky approx 1 mile away. Slowly, but still glowing bright pink, the object floated slowly to the ground and passed behind the dark horizon of our line of sight(there are fields and a valley, all of which were in complete darkness at that time of the evening).  I sat and spoke to my mum for a few minutes about it and then what appeared to be a very bright blue flashing light - like the type on a police car - roughly in the same direction. I must point out that to me the blue light did not seem all that unusual, it did really just seem like a blue ""earthly light"" flashing brighty in the distance.  But the previous Pink light was far from that, we originally thought it may have been a helicopter but we realised that it was completely silent.

I received a call from a Terrace, B.C. resident who reported something strange to me. Now after listening to what the witness had was reporting, I started thinking back to 2002 when I received a similar report from Terrace, B.C.  Two witnesses, just about a 1/2 of a kilometer west of Terrace watched and extremely large object fly very low over the Skeena River. They said it was overcast that night when they saw this ""thing"". What they reported seeing was a huge dark colored object in the shape of a cross. The witness I chatted with said the body of the object was certainly longer than, say the wing span. It moved very slowly, no sound what so ever coming from it and on the bottom of the object it looked as if there were panels of colored lights on these panels. These panels number some 6 in total. The witness also mentioned that they could not see how high, or  the thickness would have been to the body of this object. Just to dark, and with the colored lights being so bright on the bottom of it, it obscured the view to some degree. This sighting lasted approx: 8 to 9 seconds before they lost sight of it due to the tree line blocking their view. (HBCC UFO Note: I asked if he could give me an approx: size of this craft, he thought about it for a bit and said it might have been the size of a 737 jet airliner. I also asked if any of these colored lights on the object were flashing, he said no.  I don't know what to make of this one, but after going back reading a report from 2002 I received, it sounds like it may be close to what was reported to me last year. I haven't been able to talk to the second witness as of yet. I hope to, but no luck so far.  Thank you to the witness for their report.

There was a spectacular lightning show going on inside the clouds.  We watched for a few moments when I noticed a small black dot that seemed to hover just outside of the storm.  There were no visible lights coming from the craft.  I expected to see flashers if it was a plane or helicopter but there was nothing.  Just a black dot and it was far away, too far to tell what shape it was.  The black dot was slowly moving north to south with the dark grey cloud as a backdrop.  The black dot did not seem to be going away or coming toward us for it stayed constant.  Venus was very bright and just to the right of the clouds in the clear sky and served as a good refernce point for the objects direction of flight.  The object moved north to south until it appeared directly below venus then the object slowly changed direction and went straight up toward venus and then changed direction again moving from south to north in a perfect line with venus and hovering above the clouds, like it was observing the storm.  The object moved very slowly, so slow you really had to concentrate on the spot in the sky as it moved.  We watched for 15-20 minutes as the black dot moved from the backdrop of the cloud to the backdrop of the sunny sky.  If it was a plane it would have disappeared out of sight or flown over our heads, and I couldn't imagine a helicopter being much different except for its hovering ability.  this object did not get smaller or larger, but it was definately a long way away.

As I looked there were two flashes of bright light--amber in color-- I then replied ""Holy crap!!"" then it was gone. Just two flashes of amber light at a very high altitude. The thing that makes this strange--to me and my father anyway--is that we live within 1 mile of an airport, and commonly see planes fly right over our house, and have grown used to it, but these happened one at a time. The only way I can explain is to draw a diagram: o o                          (FIRST ^ LIGHT) (SECOND ^ LIGHT) All within a couple of seconds. Nothing on this airport can go that fast or has that color of light. Like I said almost amber. Plus my dad can fly and work on planes. In fact just a couple of hours before I had saw a plane that had just taken off from the airport, and I happened to mention to my dad that it had two tails with a bar connecting them and he went into a speech about what this plane was (P-38) and how it was used in W.W.II. I called my best friend Nathan and he said that he thought that it was ball lightning, I don't agree. I have never believed in UFO's. Nor do I plan to.

I raced to the window to get a closer look and it stopped. I sat back down to continue watching the tv, again out of the corner of my eye the same strobing light released an orange sphere of light which resembled the so called ""flare"" of the massive ufo sighting that occured in Phoenix's past, which disappeared behind the initial blue strobing light i was seeing after about 5 seconds, Followed by more white streaking spark-like in the sky, about a 1000 foot tail id imagine. After doing various maneuvers, ""S"" shapes, and dive's,  which were highlighted by the white spark streak, the ufo which i was seeing dropped several ""midair-bombs"" which resembled a high altitude fireworks mortar explosion, the colors of the sparks comming off the explosions, 2 different colors, one was solid purple, and one was solid green.

The dome shaped light looked to be in the general direction of a cell phone tower which is located on Lewis road just south of Vienna road.

However, the dome shaped light seemed to be something I can only describe as ""the typical UFO photo or video"", so I told my girlfriend to slow down. As we moved into a tree line which partially blocked our view I realized the intensity of the light because of the way it broke through the trees. As the tree line thickened it became difficult to see the light. The tree line got very thick and we could no longer see the light ,I told my girlfriend to speed up.

A yellow vertical flash appeared in the SW sky at approximately 11:40 PM; and since this was the harbinger last year to the same highly atypical event, I fixed my view on this part of the sky.  At exactly 11:45 PM, two objects appeared in this dark space of sky about eight fingers wide at arms length from each other--one slightly higher than the other from my vantage point.  These two reprised the same 'communication' as the last occurrence in that the lower flared twice and dimmed, then the other flared once and dimmed.  This activity went on for about five minutes, then desisted.  Inasmuch as I have harbored an affinity for skywatching, I am quite familiar with the wild twinkling of stars like Sirius, but this was not a persistent twinkle; it seemed like an attentive statement/question and sensible response.  After the 'flared conveyance', the two objects remained in a comparitvely dimmed state for another minute after which they disappeared.  Does the earth move fast enough to obscure the view of two lighted objects if they are six finger widths rotated horizontally at arms length from the horizon?  Also, let me add parenthetically that the horizon in this part of the sky is uncontaminated with ambient light.  Approximately fifteen minutes later, I saw the same incident in the WNW sky--same object position relative to the horizon and each other, with the same type of 'flared conveyance'.  After about one minute they too disappeared.  I went out the following night to investigate if what I had seen were stars; but owing to the sky's overcast melingering, I went out last night when the sky conferred clarity upon me.  That same space was bereft of anything visible, to me at least. This dark space where the two objects had been two nights prior plyed my vacuous mind with questions for which, obviously, I possessed viciously inadequate answers.  More, even if the two objects were indeed stars whose presence was precluded by some atmospheric variant the last night, why do these illumined objects only appear <i>subsequent</i> to the initiating flash? I am not concluding causation, just an observed corrrelation.",2003-05-27T00:00:00,33.63271552511416,-112.37252283105023

This light however was not moving in a straight line and seemed to slow down and speed up randomly. It would pulsate from very bright to almost invisible. The duration of the brightness was much longer than the gradual fade.  It appeared circular in shape, but had no visible edges. It proceeded south in a straight line, occasionally breaking course to either side. The movement did not seem natural.  It was also quite close, compared to satellites I have seen in the night sky. No sound was emitted. The whole thing was actually quite surreal, especially since it had covered so much distance in 10-15 seconds. Shortly after it had broke from its straight course south for the 5th or 6th time, it just seemed to vanish.  I'm not sure what I saw. I do watch the sky constantly, for beauty and curiosity.

Out of the corner of my eye, I observed what appeared to be an object in the sky that was simultaneously flashing a red and white light. It also appeared to flash yellow as well. I immediately checked to make sure that this was not a reflection off of the glass from an inside source.  I moved closer to the window and affirmed that is was indeed an object in the sky. It remained completely stationary, but it continued to flash a red, white, and yellow light on and off at the same time. The object was about 45 degrees above the horizon.

I thought maybe it was a blimp that possibly had been flying over the nearby arena, but I called both the Oakland Airport and the Coliseum/Arena today on Monday - and both people I spoke with stated that there were no blimps in the area at that time that they are aware of. The time was definitely 7:53 PM PDT, as I looked at my dashboard car clock and noted the time on purpose. It was just about sunset, and there were some scattered ""marine layer"" clouds in the area, but these were much higher than the object that I observed. I saw no other traditonal aircraft in the vicinity. I would estimate the object was at an altitude of several hundred to a thousand feet when I saw it and then it descended fairly quickly out of sight toward to the ground at a seemingly sharper angle than a plane would have. Anyone else driving north at that time on 880 would have been able to possibly see it also, so there may be more witnesses out there as traffic on the freeway was fairly busy. This object apparently landed or went down very close to the ground, and it was much too large to have been one of those advertising mini blimp balloons on a string.

Because there was a bright blue sky with the sun almost directly overhead, I was lying on my back with my arms stretched out in front of me to block out the sun.  In this way, I could see all the insects and drifting cotton from the cottonwood trees darting around at different levels.  I watched them for awhile, thinking about how ""rods"" are photographed using a similar sun-block technique, and wondering how the closer, faster insects would appear on film, and if they were at times mistaken for UFOs/rods.  Above all of this activity, I noted very high in the sky a solid, steadily-moving object flying over from the SW to the NE, directly over me as I was lying in the same direction with my head to the NE.  The object would have been next to impossible to see in the bright sky without looking at it directly. It was a smallish, dark-grey or black flattened diamond, appearing to be about as high as a jet might fly at cruising altitude, its speed perhaps a bit faster and its size a bit larger than a jet would appear at the earlier-stated altitude.    What I found odd was the shape, of course, but also that the length of the flattened diamond was perpendicular to its path!  Also, while periodically there were other planes in the sky, it was completely quiet and peaceful in the park, with no aircraft sounds audible, when this object flew over. The object never changed shape, nor speed, nor colour.  I had to strain my eyes to watch it while it gradually faded as I looked further back, my eyes watching for as long as possible.  I was afraid if I tried to sit up and watch it as it continued off to the NE I would lose sight of it.  I regretted that I didn't have my binoculars, which I generally carry with me, so that I could have examined the craft more closely.

I am filing this report to see if anyone else in my area may have spotted something or had a similar experience.  My wife and I went to bed around 11:15.

I related as much to my wife and she suggested that there might be a storm in the distance. Possible I suppose, but this rolling thunder noise was sustained. I found it unusal but possible due to the atmospheric conditions.  I was not timing the noise but I could not sleep because of the humidity. About 10 minutes elapsed with the sound still constantly in the background, at times becoming almost mechanical in nature, sort of like a muscle car. The volume also seemed to raise and lower. The last time I looked at my watch was around 23:35. Then I fell asleep.  Somehow I ended up on the couch down stairs. I woke to my son crying. He is 29 months old. He sleeps with us (we have a king-size bed) and he had apparently fallen out of bed. I ran upstairs my wife held him until he calmed down. I looked at my watch and saw that it was 2:05 AM. I could hear what I think were Tractor Trailers in the distance. I laid there, unable to sleep for about an hour. I ended up going back on the couch. It was strange that the air was really still, hot and thick in the bedroom (yes, there were 2 windows open upstairs.) I even stuck my hand up against the screen, and it just felt so hot. But downstairs, the air was thick and cold. It was also slightly breezy at times. I laid there for about an hour and could not sleep. As I did enter a state that would best be described as a Twighlight type state (somewhat aware but VERY relaxed)I was startled by a noise - I'm getting goose bumps at this point - that sounded almost electronic, and, for lack of a better adjective, evil. It almost seemed like one of those voice changing kids toys, or a distorted Nextel phone. I could not determine what was being said. It sounded linguistic and not just noise. I was completly awake at this point, laying, waiting. I heard it again and bolted up and looked out of our picture window that over looks a flat field that is about 100 yards. I heard it again as I made my way to the picture window which is about 5 feet behind the couch. I distinctly heard this 'voice' 2 times, and it was distinctly different both times.  I went upstairs and asked my wife if she had heard it. I was kind of dazed and didn't realize that I was waking her up. She sort of freaked out. At this point, I am completly awake, so I head back downstairs to investigate. I look around out of the window. I enter the kitchen and notice that our dog is completly asleep, I make some threatining comments out of the window trying to call this person or thing out. Nothing. Silence. I listen and notice that there appears to be some russtling in the woods that border the field.  Well, needless to say, I didn't fall back asleep.",2003-06-18T00:00:00,,

(See Photo) We were up all night skygazing. At exactly 6:06 AM we observed a hovering craft directly to the south, approximately 4-5 miles from our backyard. We thought it was a helicopter, as it displayed numerous red, green, white, and blue lights and was seemingly just hovering.  Suddenly the object ascended rapidly and radically, then moved very rapidly to the west then to the east, probably about 100 yards each direction.  It then departed toward the east at a very high rate of speed.  I was able to capture the object on a Polaroid 640 Digital camera.  We do not know if others witnessed this sighting, but we would sure like to know.  When I downloaded the images onto my computer, I was surprised to find the object was there more than once.  It was very exciting, and the sightings continue to this day  (June 01, 2003), only it is always different craft, sometimes multiple objects, and almost always, these craft seem to be aware of our presence.  Three of us have become regular nightly stargazers, using two telescopes, two digital cameras, binoculars, and one video camera, which we have recorded some very amazing video.

We were in Banos, Ecuador for two nights. On the second night, my room mate (a management consultant) was on the balcony of our hotel whilst I was filling in my journal. It was night time. She banged on the window and called me out, as she couldn't believe what she could see. I went out and was amazed. There were two small balls in the sky. They were reddish/yellow - they kind of looked like balls of lava or something. They could grow and alter their brightness, but remained a sort of red colour all the time. One of them was to the left of me - it seemed to be heading towards the constellation of Orion. The second one was zipping around the sky, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, but I have never seen anything move like it before. She said that one of the balls actually came down into the valley and then went back up into the sky (but did not actually land).  There is a mountain across the valley, and from behind it was a flash like sheet lightening. Then another ball rose slowly upwards. It did the same as the second ball, following the exact manouvoures that I watched the second one do. By now, the second ball had moved to the left slightly.  A few minutes later, a fourth ball rose, again, preceded by a flash from the mountain. This did the same as the two balls behind it. The third ball had also moved over to the left. The three glowing balls made a triangle and stayed still in the sky.  At this point I was pretty freaked out so I ran back into my room and across the hall to get some more of our tour group. Two of them came back with me (one works in a laboratory, and the other is a psychologist), and the four of us watched the lights. By now, the first light could not be seen, and balls 2 and 3 were heading over towards Orion. Ball 4 waited in the sky. There was another flash from behind the mountain and then a fifth ball rose upwards. It was bigger than the other ones, and instead of doing any manouvours, it went straight across the valley and appeared to go behind the mountain behind our hotel. The fourth ball then went off into the sky, and could be seen very faintly.  I watched the whole thing for half an hour. We then had to go off for a group meal at a local restaurant. When we came out, the sky had clouded over so I could not see if they were there or not.  I didn't take a photo as there was a streetlight below us and it would have flooded the picture with light. I wish I had a camcorder though!!  Even now I don't know what it is we saw. There is no way it could have been a hot air balloon or aeroplanes, nor helicopters.

Moving south to north I went outside after the evening news and was enjoying the cool breeze, while looking up at the Big Dipper I noticed what I thought was a plane, since Love Field and DFW Airport are north of Waxahachie. It only took a second to realize this thing was MOVING FAST. To get a better look I shielded my eyes and looked ahead of it a bit. I don't wear glasses so there was no reflection. The object was moving from south to north and I noticed a faint blue crescent or what may have been lights around the leading edge and sides with a faint yellowish circle in what would appear to be the middle. From the few seconds that I saw this I can only estimate that it was traveling at approximately 1200 to 1500 miles per hour. Estimated altitude is rough to even estimate but I would guess it was around 10,000 to 15,000 feet. It crossed roughly 30% of the sky in about 3 to 4 seconds. What I waited for after it went out of sight was the noise of it's engines. There was none. It was absolutely silent, and there wasn't any other aircraft in the area at the time that it went overhead. I know it sounds a little nuts, it sure does to me, but I grew up around the airline industry. My father was a dispatcher for Braniff for decades and I practically cut my teeth with him when he took with him when he went out to different stations. The thing is is that I can't get it out of my head. I can't identify it. I called the Dallas Fort Worth Airport Information line and they referred me to you. The control tower at DFW Airport, or Love Field also had to have seen this on radar. That's why I called them.  Please contact me",2003-06-18T00:00:00,32.38413941605839,-96.86031751824817

I am a successful, professional meteorite hunter as a part time occupation, carpet installer the other part.My friend is a lifetime carpenter in high demand, because his fine work and integrity. Neither one of us has ever seen a UFO before, we arn't UFO nuts or anything like that, in fact we have always been very skeptical of all that 'nonsense'. While up in northern Michigan, doing some trout fishing, we had a strange occurance that we can't figure out. We were sitting around a small campfire looking up at the stars, looking for satellites when we spotted three lights in a triangle pattern that looked as high as the stars. They were not colored, nor were they blinking, they looked like stars. At first the movement across the sky was barely perceptible, you had to watch them close, then it was apparent they were indeed moving, from west or southwest to east or north east, not exact on that, I would have to go back with a compass to know for sure. We were thinking you know, that satellites don't fly in formation do they? They seemed to be going too slow, it took a full 5 minutes for them to traverse the piece of sky we were looking at, which was limited due to surrounding trees. If you held your hand out at arms length and measured the distance between the three objects with your fingers, it was  about an inch between each of the three lights making a triangle. That would translate into a great distance relatively speaking. There were definately 3, I could see between them as they passed stars. Just before they got to the trees and left our sight, a real satellite shot from the north and crossed their path and proved beyond a doubt that the three objects were way out in space, because the satelite was between us and them, and infact was rediculously close to us in comparison to the  UFO's. The satellite whizzed past, and the UFO's were still there, just cruising, until they were gone. That's my story, strange but true. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the U. S. Navy ""NOSS"" satellites, which appear in a triplet,  would be the first possibility that would have to be ruled out.  PD))",2003-06-03T00:00:00,45.5452,-84.355

I was at the balcony of a penthouse, with almost complete view of Copacabana sky, talking by phone with my girlfriend, who was at home. As we spoke, I was gazing at the sky, looking to nowhere, when my attention was caught by something I thought was a reddish planet (Mercury, I thought) or star, at aprox. 35 deg. high.  It was a crystal clear night, no refraction due to polution nor clouds. About ten seconds later the star's color turned to a bright white, and I turned my full focus to it. A friend of mine was a few meters away from me and I urged him to look up and watch the scene. Few seconds later, the star began to blink at a constant rate (2 or 3 blinks per second). Immediatly another light source -- localized at a some -120 deg. angle relative to the first one and close to it (from my viewpoint, a finger width at full arm length) -- began blinking at the same rate, but kind of alternating the phases.  Seconds later tiny glitters, almost invisible, appeared in the space between them. When +- 40 seconds had elapsed from the ""whitening"" of the first star, the second one suddenly disappeared, and less than 5 seconds later the first one glowed a little bit brighter and vanished. Almost all the time the two stars stood still. The two light sources were definitely no baloons nor low atmosphere gears -- we were sure they were located way far at space. If they didn't blink they would look like ordinary and common stars, just a bit brighter than the others.  BTW, as I was talking to my girlfriend I told her to go to the window (she lives some 15 blocks far from where I was, and also facing Copacabana beach) and try to see what I was seeing; she confirmed, having seen about the second half of the 45 seconds show, as we talked.",2003-06-03T00:00:00,,

We saw it take two rounds, each after a gap of 4 to 5 minutes and then disappear, we have never seen anything like it ever in our lives, it was too high-tech, not least bit like the modern day spy aircrafts used by the US and other developed countries, next it made no sound, it had no lights, it seem to follow a pattern, flew with ease, it was very huge and least bit like the latest aircrafts shown in the Discovery and Natural Geography channels.

At about 9:50 pm as I was watching television, I saw a bright light out of the corner of my eye, in the window that faces ENE.  I live in Glen Ellen, in the Sonoma Valley of California, and that would put the light in the direction of Oakville (over the mountains in Napa Valley). What I thought odd about the light was that it was particularly bright, a combination of blue and red lights that bled one into the other.  It was fairly low on the horizon, about at 20 degrees, which would put it along the ridge line of the mountains east of here (The Mayacamas).  There are no airports or private airfields around here, so it's unusual to see lights like this. I opened the window to see if there was any sound, and it was dead quiet.  I live in the country so it can get pretty still at night around here and sound travels well.  I should add at this point that it was pitch black with no cloud cover at all and the stars were very prominent in the sky tonight. The movement of the lights was unusual in that they glided on a path from NE to SSW, and the movement was slower than a plane would make.  I got my binoculars and went outside to investigate.  I couldn't make out any form other than the lights appeared to outline a wing-shape, sort of like the flying wing, but not as elongated.  I'm not clear on this because the shape was vague and I could only make it out for a few seconds - the brightness of the red and blue lights bled one into the other and made it hard to tell what they were attached to, even with the binoculars. Then it did something strange - it just stopped.  For about two minutes it didn't move at all.  At this point, it was in the direction of the town of Sonoma, to the SE of my location.  It was much higher in elevation now than when I first saw it.  There was no reference point to compare it to, but I'm sure it was at around 10,000 feet at the very least by now (whereas it looked to be at around 3-4000 feet when I first noticed it). After not moving for a few minutes, it began heading southward, deviating slightly from its previous SW motion, and the lights began getting very small as if the object was gaining altitude.  Finally I lost track of it as it kept going south and getting dimmer.  Again, it was very quiet outside and I didn't hear any engine noises that would make me think it was a plane. It's probably nothing like I said, but still, there was something very strange about the movement of the lights.  When it stopped like it did, I found it to be very odd, not natural at all.  It wasn't circling or hovering, which would cause the lights the move back and forth somewhat.  This thing just flat out stopped moving. Anyway, for what it's worth, that's what I saw.",2002-12-23T00:00:00,38.3813,-122.5197

PD)) bright object that seemed to be affected by the gusty winds ? looking to the south, and slightly to the left and down from orions belt i noticed a bricght light. At first I thought it was a planet because it was a different intensity than the stars. But when it moved it caught my attention and I called my wife and son over.  My wife said it was a plane, but I worked around airplanes and airports for almost 20 years and I knew it was not an aircraft. There was no regular beacon and as we watched an aircraft did fly over and you could see the difference.  It was quite windy at the time with gusts of at least 40 kph and I thought it might be a helicopter because it seemed to be affected by the wind but there was no noise and it had to be at least 5 miles away, and for the size of the light, it had to be bigger than any helicopter I have ever seen.  On closer inspection, we could see it was sometimes triangular, then looked like a straight line and other times a dot.  About 15 min after I first noticed it there was a streak across the sky.  Wheter it was related to this or just a meteor i can't say.  As for colour, (I am colourblind) I deffinatly seen it as red, but overall the light in the sky was a blueish. (Kind of hard to explain.)I think it must have been rotating at times because I could see the tip of the triangle pointing to the left(east) then at other times right or down, and i thing someitmes when it turned is when it appeared to be a straight line.  I did phone the city police to ask if anyone else had reported it but noone had.  My son and I drove in our car to a place about 3 km outside of the city to get away from the light pollution and try and get a better view, but it didn't make too much of a difference, it was still hazy.  On the way out of town itI had the light on my forward left, and it was in line with the street lights and the next time I glanced up it was to my right and my son said it had shot over.  Then it shot back to where it was origionaly.  We watched it outside the city for about 20 min but the only thing that really was different wa! s that i t ""flashed"" about three times over a 15 min period.  I didn't see this but my son was saying at times that balls of light were leaving and returning from it.I called a couple of people because I wanted them to see it and not think I was making it up, but one neveranswered the phone and the second was in a location where her house was behind a highway offramp that blocked her view to the south.  I also tried to call the Saskatoon airport but only got a recording.  Since nothing extraordinary was happening and my wife thought I was nuts, I stopped watching at about 0345 and went to be.  When I arose at 0800 there was too much cloud cover to see if anything was still in the sky.",2002-12-23T00:00:00,52.1078373650108,-106.66923239740821

I was sitting with my dogs when i saw movement in the sky i also felt there was another presance somewhere,I looked up. I saw coming from the east of the sky object moving slowly heading towards the southern part of the sky then going west.Firstly I thought them to be stars or satellights but then stars dont move left right up or down or change shape from big to small ,neither do satellights change colour or flicker.They were moving slowly about eight of them. When they reached the west direction in the sky they became totally still.Im not sure if they were in our skys or i saw them from space near earth i dont know how far unless they were very high up in the sky They were travelling in the formation of the star sign orion when they stoped some of the objects began expanding in shape and colour brightness and started zigzaging in there position in the sky Except for four which remained still and decreased in terms of size to a small stars.These four were in the formation of the belt of orion. Thats the three . The one object in the middle of the belt started to expand and emited a very bright light and then pulsated.After that they all broke up there formation of orion and seperated into different directions then dissapeared Id like to know what does their behaviour mean, and what is the significance of orion and why they made that formation giving special awarness to the belt if orion.I would like to know what star is in the middle of orions belt and the little one next to the belt.Is there a meaning to that part of the galaxy where orion is situated.Please inform me about these questions i have asked and also as to what is happening in the skys.I would appreciate it also if any one has seen the same thing or somthing simlir please email me at ((e-address deleted))",2003-03-04T00:00:00,,

My wife woke me at 4:30 AM on January 14, 2003 and asked me what the noise was. I got up and checked the entire house including the basement and didn't find anything inside. My wife suggested I open the window and we found that the noise was coming from outside. I looked at my neighbors' houses and to my surprise because of the volume of the noise, their lights were off. I couldn't see anything (I never thought of looking up because quite frankly I never believed in such things) and went back to bed and told my wife that it must be someone's house alarm. I quickly ruled that out because the noise wasn't a loud screaming noise but a steady humming noise that did go up and down slightly. When I was going through the house the noise was just as loud in the basement as it was on the second floor, leading me to think it was vibrating through the house. I also had a very strange feeling as if I was being watched but I didn't have a clue why. Finally, at about 5:15 AM when we lay in bed listening, it suddenly got quieter and then forceful and seemed to drift away. We never thought it was a UFO (and we still aren't sure) until after we asked a few neighbors and found that they didn't hear anything. I kick myself for not looking up because right now I can't think of any place else it could have come from.

The project was called ""Project Sanguine,"" as I recall.  That may explain the source of the hum reported by the witness, but that is a wild guess.

My husband has seen similar objects before in this same area.  This was my first sighting, and it was the most remarkable, awe inspiring thing I have ever seen and hope to see it again. The objects were very bright lights that seemed to be round and of numerous beautiful colors: pink, blue, yellow, white, purple, green.  They were not all lit at the same time.  One would go off and one or more others would come on.  After the light went off at each sight, we could see small, dim white lights flowting around that area.  Then there would be a break of 5 to 10 minutes and the round, colored objects would appear again in a different spot in the sky.  The most dramatic display was a line of six in a row.  They would take turns going on and off and the most lit at one time was three.  We could see the shadow of those that were off when the others would light.  This went on for maybe 10-20 seconds before they all disappeared.  All would be dark and then it would start over with one or two lighting at one time in a different area. We viewed them from about 19:00-20:00 hours.  Then there was a half hour before we saw two more.  That was the last we saw of them. They seemed to dart around, moving very fast from one location to another. Shortly after we saw the first two or three we also noticed 5 airplanes seeming to be following them.  We saw other planes but they didn't seem to be interested in these objects.  The five planes however seemed to try and stay with or near the objects.

I was walking from the woods back to my friend's house. The street I was on was very dark, almost pitch black, my friend's house up the street was dimly lit. I noticed lights above his house but thought it was a plane, and thought nothing of it. Soon I came to realize that it could not be a plane, it was flying too slowly and too low to the ground for that. The object had lights on it, I did not count them but I am pretty sure that there were 2 red lights and 4 white lights. The object was about 250 ((corrected by witness)) feet from me, and 75-80 feet ((corrected by witness)) in the air. It's shape was the combination of a disk and a diamond, it could have just looked that way from the angle I was at. I thought of going to get my friend to get another witness but thought that if I did that when I came back with him it would be gone. I was unusually calm for such an encounter. My mouth was open and I was watching and studying the craft in awe. After I dismissed the idea of the object to be a plane I considered it could be a blimp, but it couldn't have been, it was much too small and oddly shaped. Also, it did not have one sheet of metal over the entire object, it had rectangular silver plates on it. The object flew by me and over the trees across the street from my friends house, I could still see it and it was still fairly close. One thing I noticed what how the craft would go fairly slow, then come to a stop, and hovered there for a while. This was the eeriest thing about the object, on account of how unnatural this looked from any other type of flying machine. Later on I would consider it to be a helicopter, but it did not have a tail or blades, nor did it make loud noises. It did make a noise however, a quiet stealthy humming, as if an engine were in it. After the craft passed over the first set of trees it came to a house across the street from my friends house. It hovered over the house, and suddenly a white light came out of the bottom, the bottom was like a hatch, the light wasn't like a beam, more like an airplane light. I became frightened for a moment, thinking that the UFO had spotted me just then, but then the light disappeared and the hatch closed. The craft continued on from the house, it was starting to get far away, soon it stopped behind a tree and kept moving. When I lost sight of it, I started to run to the other side of the street so I could see it going over the trees from the right, but I was at my friends house so I decided to go in and get him real quick. I told him to follow me and that I had seen a UFO and he had to be quick, so him and his girlfriend ran outside after me, they both looked very reluctant to really look for the UFO, like they didn't believe me. I wanted to show I wasn't lieing about the whole thing by acting completely serious, so they could see I wasn't really kidding around. We ran down the trail by the house the object had hovered and set it's light from the hatch out over to see if it was still behind the trees. It was gone, so I went back inside with my friends. No one really believed me and I really regret on not having a second witness with me. My background description is that I'm ((personal data deleted)) intelligent, and very interested in music. ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS)) I wrote my report a little less than a day ago, it was posted 7/16/2003 and the location is Rolla, MO. I was very, very tired at the time I wrote it, and when I read it the next day, I noticed how many mistakes I had written in the Full Description part of my report. These mistakes don't make my story look very credible at all and I would appreciate it very much if you fixed some parts of my report. Here is what needs to be fixed: '250 feet away' not '10-15 feet from me' '70-85 feet high' not '20-25 feet in the air' 'hatch' not 'hatchet' (this mistake is made three times) 'an airplane light' not 'just a light' 'trees to the right' not 'trees from the right' I would also ask you take out the very last sentence about my age and personality and such, I didn't understand what was meant by 'A description of the backgrounds of the observer(s) is useful as well.""

I looked up into the blue and stared for about 3 sec. and there they were, 4 ufo's flying in formation/parallel, white and disk shaped. There were two in front and two in back . The two in back were a distance from each other. They came to a stop for a second or two and quickly returned to the formation. They were high in the blue sky. Higher than the chemtrail planes. They were not F-16's, Drones or any conventional aircraft I've ever seen. There was no sound or sonic booms. They were cruising from North to South at a slow pace. I grabbed my 8mm video camera to get a shot and lost the sight of them in the blue. I had a good visual for about 8 seconds and the feeling I got was that they had authority to obsurve.

There was myself, my girlfriend at the time and two other couples in our party.  It was a beautiful day, I was laying on the beach with my head on my girlfriends lap.  She was sitting up so her shadow was covering my face which allowed me to remove my sunglasses and marvel at the blue, cloudless sky without having to squint my eyes.  I noticed a line of smoke form, not unlike the exhaust of a jet plane but much lower as I could see the billows forming at the front and being left behind as the trail continued to grow.  It took me only one second to realize that there was no plane in front to cause this and as my stomach tightened to sit up, out of the front shot a black triangle spinning clockwise.  It spun two-thirds of the way around and stopped dead.  By the time I could say ""what the fu-"" , it took off in level flight across the sky and disapeared in the distance, not over the horizon, just into the distance.  It moved as fast as a thought.  No sound, no exhaust.  As I finished my sentance ""-ck is that?!!""  my girlfriend looked up and said all she saw was a wisp of smoke disapate.  I looked around to see if any one else was looking, but they were looking at me because of my outburst.  I was so shocked by what I KNOW I SAW, I had to get up and walk back to the campsite.  Aproximately two months later, my girlfriend handed me a newspaper article I believe was from the Edmonton Journal about variuos UFO sightings.  half way through the article was the sentance ""and still unexplained are reports of dark triangles seen flying over southern Alberta.""

It was one of those cold and clear fall nights with no moon or clouds in the sky.I said to my friend, ""What in the hell is that?-Do you see that?"". She was just as amazed as I was! I thought I was seeing things, but the objects were so defined, distinct and visibly clear. They were triangular shaped with a strange bluish color on each of its three perimeters, and dark in the interior area space.We did not hear any sound. They were seemingly at a very high altitude and moving in very random and rapid directions, with instantaneous change in directions. Almost like they were playing some sort of game or something? I have no idea what they were? I've told several people over the years and of course they think I'm nuts. That never bothered me because I would've thought the same of someone else, if I had never experienced what I saw. So I figured its our own little secret. I'm no UFO nut or anything, but every now and then I go check out some web-sites because of my curiosity. What I am seeing is more and more depictions of sightings that are very similar to what we saw that one evening.Which makes me feel better and somewhat in AWE!

They were formed in circles with lines coming out of the sides, and they were just, glowing. But they didn't glow normally, they were sort of, pulsating, like blood in our vains, purple colors. It was really wierd. The, this light sort of skimmed across the whole craft, like the sun reflecting of of metal, and when it left, the craft justtook off, slow at first, then fast. I just watched it until it wasn't visible anymore. The craft was, I'm guessing, ABOUT maybe thirty feet in diameter, with the designs on the sides, and it looked like it was made of a really shiny metal, and the pulsating purple was like a design or a date or something on it. Either way the whole experience couldn't have been something I made up because I'm not the kind of person who makes this stuff up out of my mind. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Sphere was a bright golden/yellow color, with the light source appearing to be from the object itself and not reflective light from the sun. The weather was stable, not humid, and fairly clear sky, save for one small cloud formation. The sphere was about the size of a ""b-b"" held at arms length. It traversed  across about 1/3 of the sky in about 5 seconds, then entered the one small cloud and never exited the cloud. The sky past the cloud was very blue and clear and unobstructed and a good visual of the sphere sould have occurred had it left the cloud formation.

The night was clear, dark and warm with a slight breeze and a lot of stars.  There was no moon.  Directly overhead of me (At a high altitude, or so it seemed.) was a bright white light, with a haze around it, about the size of a 50 cent piece held at arms length away.  At first I thought it was the moon because it was bright, shining down on us.  I told my brother to look up which he did and said ""What is that?""  Exactly when my brother looked up the light shrank to the size of a pea held at arms length away.  It seemed like it knew we had seen it.  What creeped me out the most was that I wondered how long it was above us shining down on us before I (we) noticed it.  The light sat still for about 5 seconds then moved South of us at a slow speed, and then blinked off.  I am familiar with aircraft and satellites and stars and planets and I'm 99.9% sure it wasn't any these objects.

I was alittle startled to see another object in the sky so when I took my eyes away to place them on the viewfinder of the camera I had difficultly relocating it. My friend was talking to me with his back to the object. I told him to look around and tell me if he sees what I was seeing. He said he did. We were looking west, towards the Pacific Ocean. I was about in the same vicinity as the one I had seen yesterday, but it looked very differant. It was a white cylindrical object in straight horizontal flight. I was traveling very slowly. We followed it for about 2 minutes until it went behind a dark cloud. I estimated the object to be about 5000 feet altitude and possibly 25-30 miles away. I estimate the distance because I can see Cucamonga Peak to the north, which is about 24 miles away. To the left I have a range of mountains which house some communication towers and I found that the peak they are situated on are about 5600 feet in altitude. When I reviewed my videotape,I didn't see the object which my friend and I were seeing. I did have the audio with descriptions of the sighting being heard. I was disappointed not having captured the object. However I reviewed the tape just recently and I was surprised to notice the object was captured for a brief moment. I see a bright object flash and then quickly dart upward and stop. This was the craft I had seen before it initiated a straight horizontal flight pattern.

We looked away and then back minutes later and it was still there, but it started to arc toward the south then stopped and continued its erratic movement. We continued to watch until it started to arc again and met another similar light which traveled straight in the opposite direction.(probably a satellite)   We watched it straight above for about a 20 min, looked away for about 5 min, watched again for 10 min before it started its 1 min arc to about 10:00 in the sky, where it stayed for 10 min and we looked away again for 5 min then back for 2 min until it moved to intercept the other northerly arcing light. We left after they were straight above us, it got way to weird. Just to point out the important parts again. It was star like and was constantly moving in a sharp erratic pattern around and past fixed stars and in and out of light range indicating depth in space. We watched it for an hour or more.

I was scared and walked down the hallway into my family room.  The drone craft moved silently toward the spot where I was just standing.  I began to observe the motion of this craft.  It was spinning silently counterclockwise.  I said to myself, it looks like an old-fashioned top.  It had a long grayish, granite looking cylinder at the bottom with notches at the end.  The color of the drone craft was a burnt brown color, almost like an amber color.  There were gold tones with light glowing from inside.  Each rib on the top had a formation of what appeared to be hexagon or honeycomb shape.  The very top had a grayish or charcoal surface.  Since I was in the family room, I panicked and realized I was trapped.  The funny thing was I walked back into the hallway and got down low to go under this drone craft and it moved out of the way. The drone craft appeared to be looking inside my house.  Looking in the living room, the bathroom and then into the family room.  I went to look for a camera, but when I came back.  It was gone.

On the last day of camping season at Burlingame State Park in Rhode Island (back in 1990), an adult relative and I witnessed the close pass of a small, seemingly living object, which was clearly illuminated by the headlights of my vehicle, shortly before 9PM. I remember the time as we were concerned about getting to the office to obtain a campsite pass and the office was to close at 9:30PM. This was a quiet evening with good conditions, clear weather and skies. The expansive 500-site State campground was sparsely populated on that last night of the season, with maybe a dozen campsites taken in the entire park and forest.  The object approached from the ten o'clock position, sweeping down to the right through the upper reach of my headlight beams, proceeding over the road immediately in front of and above our vehicle, then rising abruptly on our right side to a verticle climb up between the heavy branches of broadleaf forest which lined either side of approach road. My observation of the object lasted only 2-4 seconds. My relative in the passenger seat saw more of both approach and egress, totalling for her possibly 8 seconds.  A description:  the object could be said to have had a rounded-chevron shape, maybe 18 inches across side-to-side. My own impression was that it had the general shape and the grace, of a manta. We both had an extremely clear and close view of the object and agreed that it did not appear to be mechanical in any sense, but rather living material or possibly a living form itself. For what it's worth, both of us felt we were in the presence of a highly aware and seemingly social object.   We agreed that there was no possibility that the small thing was any known sort of flying animal. It  did, however, have some attributes of deep-sea animals, including, along with its shape and graceful movement, a circular area near the rear centerline which radiated a distinct and clearly visible internal glow. There was clear structure evident internally in this central area (a subtle pattern of radiating lines) and its glow extended out to give pale illumination to the entire internal structure of the object. Again, the thing was very close to us under good conditions. My passenger reported to me that the object had moved directly upward rapidly after making its pass. She also noticed that there was a recurve to the rounded wingtips. I had not noticed this from my vantage point.  For those interested, I'll mention that my background has been mainly as an electronics engineering tech. Hobbies have included optics, amateur astronomy  and amateur radio. I have no explanation for what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

I was out walking on a secluded beach between Mukilteo and Edmonds, Washington State. Late in the evening as I some times do. On this night I was admiring the full moon which was almost straight up a little south and a little east.  There was a few fluffy small clouds out and as I was looking at the moon one formed a tunnel around the moon.  I was thinking that this was really cool looking and watched this for a while as there was little wind and the formation stayed that way for a while. After a while I started to look around at the stars in the sky, looking for the familiar formations like ""The Big Dipper"", ""Orion"", ""Cassiopeia"", and such. I caught a glimpse of what at first I thought was a satellite. I then noticed that there was more than one point of light. I was looking to the north and just slightly to the west. What I witnessed was astounding as there was at least a couple of hundred points of light moving  across the sky in a row a bout 30 or so wide and 75 to 80 long. When I say long I mean they were moving from the west to the east and lined up north/south. As they moved I noticed that as a row move forward the ones in front would stop then the next row would pass the front row and become the row in front. Then after it moved about 10 widths of their selves(the points of light)they would stop and the next row would follow in the same fashion. Then when a row that had stopped was behind all the rest it would start moving again until it was in the front of the procession. Then it would stop again. This gave the whole cloud of objects the look of a sparkling translucent tube rolling through the heavens. When I say that the sphere were lined up, I want to be clear here, that they were not organized straight lines. It was more like a heard of animals like cows moving a cross a field of grass. the ones in front stop to eat and the rest move pasted and as they get to the front they stop to eat the fresh grass. Then as the heard moves along the ones that were in front that stop to eat are passed the start moving to keep up with the heard. Anyway the hill finally blocked the view after about 4 or five minutes. It was cool but I thought no one would believe me, or care about little light, and they where not even fly saucers. But I recently viewed ""The Secret NASA Tapes"",""The Smoking Gun Evidence."" and thought hey that’s what I saw only years before.

I was in awe.  I didn't hear any noise from the object.  It was black and as it moved in front of me I could tell it was triangular.  It was non-reflective or otherwise I would have seen lights from Loveland reflecting off it's belly.  It was much blacker than the night sky.  Stars would disappear as the object moved under them.  I can only guess at the size, there were no lights but since it was blacker than the sky I could tell it was triangular.  I would guess that from the rear tips of the craft that it may have been 125' across the back end.  From the nose to the rear tips mabye 100'.  I'm not sure.

At exactly high noon on 08/01/96 my son, who was 17 at the time, came running downstairs wanting to know if I wanted to see a UFO.  I said, ""sure, Matt"", as I had never seen one before.  By the time I got into our front yard, I saw Matt pointing up in the sky due south of Sandy, Utah, a suburb located south of Salt Lake City.  Matt's eyes were bugging out, and his arm pointed up at a bright blue light.  The weather was perfectly clear without a cloud in the sky, so this extremely bright, blue light was against a blue backround, but it was so bright it was easily observable.  It was the size of a pea if you held it out at arms length, and it appeared to be extremely high, although there were no reference points so it was hard to tell.  It was hovering, completely still.  All of a sudden, it started to come down at an astonishing speed, coming down in 45 degree angles, coming down in the shape of a Christmas tree.  Try to imagine the light coming down in the shape of ZZZZ stacked vertically.  It seemed to go from what could have been an altitude of 100,000 feet to approximately ground level in under five seconds, something no plane I have ever seen could do.  After being just above the ground for several seconds, it jetted back up to an extremely high altitude at a straight 45 degree angle, and just hovered.  At that time, I was standing in our front yard pointing up with my eyes bugging out.  The blue light hovered still for about two minutes.  I was so shocked, finally I told Matt to go in and get a pair of binocs.  However, before he could come back out, the blue light started to travel south, at a leisurely pace, due south over what may have been the town of Lehi, north of Provo, Utah.  Later that evening, my son and I went to a movie, and a child three rows in front of us pointed up at the ceiling, then made motions with his ! finger, imitating EXACTLY the flight pattern of this thing to his father.

We went to sleep <we all slept on a pallet in my room> and I woke up around 12am because there was a bright light in my room, but I guess I fell back to sleep because I don't remember getting up to investigate....the next thing I remember is waking up and everything was pitch black...so naturally I went to sit up to figure out why...but there was this pressure on my chest keeping me from sitting up. When I put my hand out in front of me to see what it was....it scared me to death...The covers had been wrapped tightly around me including my head and I was completely UNDER my bed. I started screaming and crying of course and everyone woke up and my mom and my friends had to get me out...  explain that.  You couldn't get under my bed just by rolling underneathe it.

They followed you here!""  <we were convinced that the previous incident was in some way connected with extraterrestrials.>  I got up and went into the kitchen <the live in a rural part of the county>  and I saw lights flashing beyond the treeline.  It wasn't lights like the ones that blink on an airplane or helicopter.  They were much bigger and there were many of them.  I can't say exactly how many, more than one, less than 10.  They kept pulsing red and white. and at some points they seemed to come closer like they knew we were watching.  I know what I saw was not an airplane.  I couldn't make out the shape because the light was so bright, but if I had to guess I would say sphere based on the shape of the light.  They hovered and moved around the treeline for about 5 minutes and then flew up and dissappeared.  Both of the girl's begged me to go home. Both of them are very honest people and were very confused about the incident.  I don't think any of us still understand...I haven't seen anything since then nor have I had any weird things happen, I just wondered if maybe anything was reported about this as well?

I was staring at the sky for satelites with my Girlfriend and her brother, lying in the grass. It is common to see non-geostationary satelites in the sky at night when the sun reflects on their panels and they move rather quickly in the sky as little dots. We saw some 10 satelites that night but one of them is to remain in our memories. We don't know how or why nor whether it was an optical illusion, but all of a sudden, looking at one of these satelites, it changed direction from a 90 degrees angle and drew a square and several other polygones before changing direction for a last time and moving towards the horizon to dissapear in the light of the nearby city.  We never told anyone about this strange satelite until a few days ago when I heard a similar story from a friend of mine living in Vendee (France) and who is a professional astronomer. I thought he would have an answer to that phenomenon, since he is the kind of guy who can point randomly to a star and name it and since he knows a lot about astrophysics and space exploration, but he couldn't say what it was exactly. We are quiet sure it wasn't a plane since it was moving to quickly into the sky and was too high to be one. The only possible explanation we have found is that some satelites we never heard of can very quickly modify their trajectory through the sky. If this is not the case, then it is still an Unidentified Flying Object to us and, without being a strong believer of extra terrestrial phenomenon, I have some doubt whether this object in the sky was human made.

The object dove into the cloud range at a very high rate of speed. Much faster that anything she has seen in the sky before. We got out of the car and looked at the range of clouds for several more minutes, but nothing else happend. She also said that the object flew in an arc as it entered the cloud range and left no trail.",2003-04-22T00:00:00,,

It was reddish orange in color, and I want to say it was dim in appearance. It had almost a ""natural"" color to it, Like that of fire. In other words it didnt appear to be luminated by artificial light. Its would slow down and change directions like nothing I know of, except a helicopter but helicopters  are loud and there was no sound coming from this thing. I pulled over and it was gone. so we drove around looking for it because we thought a building or a tree could have blocked our view, when we see it appear again almost like it appeared out of knowhere. We got out of the car and observed the object and was heading in our direction, maybe about a mile north from us. I began calling family and friends but knowone could see it. I concluded from this that the object was much closer than we thought. And coiuldnt have been much bigger than an average jet. The object began dropping some sort of luminated debris over the city. The debris looked as if it was on fire or luminated as well but it appeared to go out before it hit the ground. But it was rythmically dropping debrit for the duration of at least a minute, every two seconds. This excited me! What was it dropping???? It was actually pretty scary too!! It went passed where we were and finally faded out into the sky like a campfire would go out. This object looked almost ""organic"".

We were driving down the road just talking about the night when all of a sudden V swerved off the road into a parking lot, he was all excited and his voice sounded a bit spooked. He told us to look up into the sky, the was a bright orange circular object flying in the left hand side of the sky. it was the color of fire. this thing wasn't flying like any plane or hellicopter i have ever seen, it was almost hovering, then it would move a bit, kind of like a real slow leaf. We reversed out of the parking lot, we wanted to get away from the buildings so that we could get a better look at this thing. as we were backing up it faded then dissapeared. We drove down the road next to the parking lot hoping to see something more. We drove all the way to the end of the  dead end road and turned around all of us staring at the sky. there were buildings on both sides of us but still we had a better view of the sky than just a few minutes before. So we drove slowley back  taword the main Street when all of a sudden  i see the ufo again, i could see it in between the  buildings as we were driving. So V the driver stops and backs up fast, We all see this thing again, he puts the car in park and we all jump out. The thing looked to me that it re-appeared a little more to the left of the sky, i was thinking that no plane could fly that far so quik then just stop and hover. Then the object slowley started flying towards the right hand side of the sky, all of us were trippen out. My friend V pulled out his phone and began calling a few friends. He was talking Loud and fast telling them ""Oh My God, Dude go outside and look at the sky, we are looking at a ufo right now"" I tryed to get ahold of anyone at my Parents house but nobody was Picking up there phones. So i  then called My girl Friend who lives  Four hours away from me, i told her what i was seeing, she could hear My friends in the background freaking out. All of a sudden i noticed something falling from the ufo, i said to my friends "" oh my god! look, its dropping something"",  It started dropping  big bright orange flame looking things from the bottom of it. It looked to me almost like Sparks from a camp fire but real big. it would drop 4 to 6 of these spark looking things at a time then stop for a second and then continue on dropping things, The Sparks were almost the same size as the ufo. I thought to myself ""would if its appart of the war going on right now?"" i started freaking myself out in my head. The Ufo kept flying and dropping things from it, all the way untill it got to the right hand side of the sky. it then began to fade or dissapear, almost like it flew away so fast it just kinda faded, then a few short second past and it re- appeard, this time it wasnt as bright i dont think, i saw it out of the corner of my left eye, while my eyes were focused about two inches to the right, while i saw that by the corner of my eyes i was focused on another light that appeared, that new light looked just like a star just brighter, it dropped one white shimmering star looking thing, it shot toward the ground and then faded. It looked like one shiney strand of christmas tree tinsel. that was the last we saw. We continued to the party, the party took place in the back yard of some guy i have never met. the were all drinking and standing around a home made pit fire. The color of the fire was the same color of the ufo  we had seen just a few minutes before. We told our story to people and they just laughed and said stuff like ""yea, right on"" and "" yea right"" but when they heard the story from one of us and then went to the other to hear the story.. i think they started to believ cause our storys were the same. thats what happend last night. sorry for all the bad spelling.",2003-04-22T00:00:00,37.97817449664429,-122.0058100671141

The time I recorded reflects that change. I recently purchased new binoculars (20X60) and that day had found a tripod adapter for them. A few minutes prior, I had finished focusing the binoculars on one of the brightest stars. I took a break for a few minutes to let my eyes adjust after having been looking at the brightness. After that, I had spent a while enjoying the magnification power of the binoculars, realizing how much of the night sky I'd been missing before. I would find an area of the sky to view, lock the tripod and binoculars into place, view for a while, then move to a different spot, and do the same thing. Once while doing this, after locking into place, I looked through the binoculars and saw that three ""stars"" were moving horizontally, simultaneously, across the viewing field. After they moved out of view I looked without the binoculars and realized they were quite visible with the naked eyes. To get a closer look, I unlocked the binoculars so that they remained on the tripod, but I was able to pan across the sky while looking through them. I realized then, that I could actually see a dark silhouette of a triangular craft. I watched it moving for about three minutes until the silhouette began to be difficult to discern, then the movement stopped. It was then that I noticed the outline of a HUGE circle. Like the triangle, the darker, black image was visible (only through the binoculars) against the background of an already pretty dark night sky. Without binoculars, the perimeter of the object was indicated by a circular (nonmoving) formation of lights, with one very bright light in the center and an average star-like intensity light down and left of the center light. Also visible without binoculars, was a circle of lights inside the larger circle. The front light of the triangle seemed to be a part of that circle, while the two rear lights of the triangle made up two of the ten lights of the perimeter of the circle. It was as if the tri! angle had moved into the pie shape, filling in one of the wedges. As I stood there, trying to make sense of it all, clouds moved in, obscuring all the stars. As I type this I feel like readers will find it laughable, but I swear I'm not crazy! I am levelheaded, don't drink, am a great Mother, graduated magna cum laude from college, am successfully self-employed, and am not a kook! ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the report.

We were between towns out in the country in the middle of nowhere when I noticed a light to my left in the middle of a field about 200 yards away and about 100 feet off the ground. I asked what is that over there and driver replied it's probably a radio tower. I looked back stareing thinking that that didnt sound right when all of a sudden it lit up very bright sort of silvery/white. I told driver and we immediatly pulled over and got out of the car. We were heading east and this object was coming from the north going south. It was traveling about 2-3 mph or as fast as you would normally walk. So were watching this approach straight at us still about 100 feet from the ground. As it was just about on us they <3 witnesses besides myself> were freaking out saying it wasnt a plane, a ballon, or anything they had ever seen they were getting scared. I was in awe I had a grin on my face from ear to ear I was loving every moment. It was about 100 feet in length and shaped like a pool/billiard rack <smooth edged triangle>. It had 2 headlights in the front which were very bright beams like floodlamps yet the beams seemed to discipate and didnt project very far for as bright as they were. By now <3-4 min. later> it was directly over head. It was so close I could have thrown a rock up and hit it. It was silent no sound <except 3 witnesses freaking>I dont even remember hearing crickets which I thought was odd but maybe thats me. It was bright, glowing, and appeared like brushed illuminated alluminum it gave off its own light. It had 3 radical blinking lights on the back corners. Red, green, and blue radically flashing strobes with no pattern sort of hypnotic. It was so close I could see lines or seams on it's underbelly where it seemed to be put together. As it passed over about 50 yards lt went behind a treetop and stopped and turned off again. You could see this dark silloette sitting there parked waiting. I said ""all right! Let's go check it out!"" But they were scared ((badly)) and driving as well. They said ""let's get the hell out of here!"" and we left. I wanted to check it out for all there was. This might sound weird but when we were flying back home <100 mph scared driver> all they could say is ""is it following us"". When we did get back home before we had said anything they asked us what took so long. It had apparently been several hours later which seemed only minutes. I was urinating dark green along with fowl gas for the next dayz. I don't care what you all think but thats the truth and thats the way it all happened.

We had lived there maybe a month or so. I wanted to finish high school at Tyee Senior High instead of changing schools so my stepdad who worked at Mc Donald Crane in Kent would drive me to a friend's house during the week who lived on 188th and Pacific Hwy South (Sea-Tac International Airport across the street and Boeing Field is nearby too) and we'd walk to school. It was nearing the end of the school year and was a  bright, sunny morning with no clouds in the sky around 6:30am. It was so bright that I could easily see in the truck and was doing my homework that I hadn't done the previous evening. There is a large clearing on the left coming down Hwy 410 out of Bonney Lake heading down into Sumner (near the Winery), which overlooks the Sumner valley, and some of Puyallup (Tacoma can be seen off in the distance). I'm engrossed in my homework and suddenly my stepdad (who doesn't believe in many things, especially UFO's) very calmly turns his head towards my direction and says, ""(my name), Look at that UFO"". He turns his head forward again to look out the windshield and never looked back at the UFO or me and neither of us said another word all the way to my friend's apartment. I raised my head and looked at him. Outside his driver side window (within the frame of it)was a UFO - the classic shaped kind that looked like two silverish grey plates inverted on top of each other. There was a dome on the top that looked like cloudy thick/heavy plastic. Underneath the dome where it met with the top portion of the saucer were big round bright white lights that were like strobes. They were blinking white or seemed to be rotating around it. I heard a whirring type noise but was unsure if it was the sound the extremely long antenna was making in the wind or if it was coming from the craft. I think my jaw dropped and I was completely awed! Didn't think to look around and see if anyone was looking because I couldn't take my eyes off of it. It stayed visually within his driver side window all the way down near the River Grove apartments..it sped up out of the window frame and was directly above the apartments when it suddenly got a little fuzzy looking and completely vanished-quic! kly! I w as so amazed, happy but confused too by my stepdad's reaction. Couldn't wait to get to school and tell everybody what I seen but I think only 2 people half-way believed me. I didn't know where to report the sighting but KISW had a number to call. Was interested if anyone else had seen it but procrastinated too long and never did it. That incident put me on a quest that I am still journeying - I felt ""special"" and extremely happy that I got to see it. The experience and everything I have learned on my journey has enlightend my spirituality. Throughout my life I've had many strange occurences happen, not only lights in the sky, a very impressive encounter in Olalla, along but other types of paranormal activities as well. It took me nearly 15 years before I ever mentioned the incident again to my stepdad due to the weird reaction of his that morning and becuase he is so opinionated and closed minded about things I've experienced or believe in - thought he would explain it away and ruin my thrill. But when I did finally ask him many years later what we saw that morning, he laughed and said, ""(my name, I don't know what that was)! His statement surprised me but reassured me that we had seen something very extraordinary - HOWEVER, whenever I bring it up to people in front of him, his standard answer then and now is that the craft was a jet and I'm crazy!

I stepped outside in the backyard to smoke a cigarette and sat on a garden chair just off the patio.  It was a clear sky; I could easily count the stars.  The residential neighborhood was just West of the flight patterns of the DFW airport.  The sky was frequently dotted with planes of all types approaching to land, or nose-up to gain altitude away from the busy airport.  The sun had not completely set; objects high in the sky were catching the sun's last rays and were very bright with the illumination.  I was looking NNW.  Suddenly from the South a bright round disc silently moved across the sky.  Having seen many jets fly in a similar direction, I was quickly aware of how much faster this object was moving...my conclusion was this was not a jet.  Because of the sunlight it appeared to be slightly yellow, but mostly white.  I did not write the exact date down anywhere because I knew no one would believe me, later.  1984 is the year, for sure.  I remember it was not yet a typical hot Texas summer...late Spring.  I am very surprised to see no record or report from anyone about this sighting.  With so many people in that region of Texas someone else had to have seen it.  Because of the similarity to the flight paths to/from DFW and the many passenger jets I had watched while in Flower Mound, this was a very large craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I climbed out of the camper, out of the truck, and into the parking lot. I looked up for some reason or another, and I saw three pinkish-red lights. They would zigzag around, and then stop in triangle shape, and then zigzag around again. Then they suddenly disappeared, and I ran into the truckstop and told my parents what happened.

After viewing the motion it appeared to be about 1000-2000 ft above treetop level and approximately due south 1/4 mile from my position. I then thought that it was the landing lights of a small airplane.  It was very dark at the time and there is a small airport about 7 miles to the east of my home.  As I turned right onto another road headed north I looked back through the right side of the car about (about 10 seconds from when I first saw it), and even though it had gone approximately 1 mile or so headed due east, the light had not gotten an dimmer. I then realized these were not landing lights, it did not change color or intensity, and otherwise the lights would have dimmed as they passed in the direction it was going. As best I could tell, I saw no red or green lights required for an aircraft, and that it was neither a small plane nor a helicopter. After reading the Characteristic of Object section below, non really fit. It was a steady glowing yellow/orange color that was very bright.",2003-03-21T00:00:00,43.7123,-84.4223

I was just returning from the beach with my Golden Retriever when I noticed what looked like two bright landing lights coming at me.  I am a pilot and was wondering why they were flying so low.  They were about 1 mile away at an altitude of 200-300' AGL (just above tree level) traveling in a Northwesterly direction.  I watched for about 20 seconds when I noticed that there was actually three bright lights and that they were on the bottom corners of a black triangle (about 100-150' to each side).  I was standing in the middle of a park (large open space), with the craft heading straight for me.  At that moment, I decided that I would not want to become an abductie statistic and said out loud ""I'm not ready for this!"", so I quickly made my way to the closest trees for some cover (a 10 second dash).  I looked back and it was gone.  The craft should have been there.  It was as close as 200-300 yards and traveling at about 20 MPH with no sound.  This happened about 5 miles south of Paine Field - my home airport, with-in their Class D airspace.  Upon returning home, I opened your web site to see if there were any other sightings like mine.  To my amazement, I found on your home page exactly what I saw.  It was the incident on January 24, 2003 near Kingston, Ontario, Canada only she had more guts than I did.  I have contacted Paine Field Airport Management and they are researching their radar tapes and talking to the tower personnel for that time period.  I will keep you advised. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) Follow-up on triangle sighting. Follow up:  I failed to mention on my original report that the object did not have any normal aircraft lighting ie: red beacon, white anti-collision strobes, nor red or green running lights, only three bright white lights on the bottom of the craft near each of the three corners.  I have further heard back from the people at Paine Field Airport in regards to their findings on the radar tapes.  No radar returns for that given area (5-DME on the 180 radial from their VOR) during atleast a one hour time frame.  In fact, they thought it very strange that there were NO radar returns for anything south of the airport including the standard southerly or westerly approach patterns for the main runway 34L/16R.

What it shows is the Moon, in which they were filming in the first place. But then something else showed up on the film after they brought the cam, and tape back inside to view. They sat down to watch what they took and noticed an orange colored light around the Moon. As it was cloudy out, which can be seen clearly in the video clip, this light seems to bounce around on the film. I have sat and watched it for a while, and I am thinking that the ""light"" may be from some other light source, ""earthly"". But  I am no expert at breaking down a clip from a tape. Why I am thinking this light may be of an earthly origin, is due to the movment of the cam at the time, and the light moving with the cam, or the Moon which was being filmed at the time.

I have been doing so for a long time now. - Yesterday, traveling from Toledo Ohio to DTW (Detroit Metro Airport) the weather was foggy.  I was driving cautiously, taking my time to arrive safely.  I was going from street lamp to street lamp just trying to stay awake.  Fog to light, fog to light.  All of a sudden the fog seemed visible, it was still there I just could see clearly.  I was in the center lane of a three lane road.  I looked for the source of the light, it was a shock to me, going from dark and fog to what seemed to be afternoon sun and fog.  On my right, hovering was a bright light.  I saw one light in the center and several in a circle around the center light.  It was so weird, I began thinking what did I see, what is that.  Then I was out of sight of it.  I saw tail lights in the fog braking ahead of me before I came to that area.  I did not brake, but I began driving faster.  I am not a believer of these things.  I have read and been told that these objects are sighted before and during wars and near nuclear power plants.  Both are true when and where I was at that time.  I was also thinking that street lamp was out of place, not the same time driving from one light to another.  I am an Electrical Engineer (Controls Engineer, PLC's), so thinking logically comes naturally to me.  I had my cruise control ""on"".  I do so in fog because I know that when a person drives in fog they want to continouslly accel.  I prefer to drive safe.  Anyways, I saw something that did not belong there.  I am submitting this because I hope any other persons driving that day, on I-75, that saw the same thing I did also submit something.  I need closure.  I have sketched what I saw, it should not be there.  I have not returned home yet, but I have asked my father to drive that stretch and he did not see anything resembling what I described.

While piloting a B-25 out of Andrews AFB, I was Northbound over Bowie at 8000 feet. It was a dark, clear night. Looking almost straight down at the city lights, I saw a circular object on or near the ground, unmoving. It seemed to be internally illuminated with segments of red, yellow and green light which were spinning slowly clockwise. I estimated its size as about forty feet. As I watched, it suddenly turned bright white and simultaneously shot off to the North at a speed of around 600 knots. In a few seconds it was miles ahead of my aircraft and climbing through my altitude. I pointed it out to my copilot and we watched as it arced out over the sea and disappeared in the distance at a great height. The total time of the sighting was maybe twelve seconds. I continued North to Baltimore and made a left-hand circle around the city, then headed back to the South. As the city lights were falling behind, my copilot slapped my arm and said, ""Did you see that?"" I hadn't seen anything. He said a white light had dived past our right wing very closely at high speed. We looked around but saw nothing. A few minutes later the radio came alive with chatter about a plane crash near Bowie. We heard no more that night. The next morning I went back to the base to file a report, as we were required to in those days. No one ever contacted me about the report. Then I read an item in that day's Washington Post about a false report of a crash. I quote it here: FAKE REPORT STIRS AIR CRASH HUNT A false report of a plane down near Bowie, Md. led more than 500 police, fire and military authorites on a two-hour search last night. Minutes after the report, 28 state police cruisers, an additional 11 Park Police units and dozens of fire and rescue squads from eight counties joined in the search. The report originated with a caretaker at the Womens' Reformatory at Jessup. State Police said that military units on night maneuvers had probably shot off flares, leading to the report, state police said. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be precise, given that it may be from an U. S. military flight log book.   We have met the individual who submitted this report, and we deem him to be an exceptionally credible witness.  He is a former fighter (F-86) and bomber (B-25) pilot, and a former military officer, who was assigned to the Pentagon.

We will post it  sometime in the near future. I would like to point out that just because the object appeared to be  traveling between the stars you cite, I don't think we can conclude that it was actually outside the Earth's atmosphere.  I readily admit that it would be unusual for an object in the atmosphere, or in proximity of our planet to coincide exactly with those stars, but I find it difficult to believe that the object was actually traveling between the stars you cite, and that it was also visible. Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center! Cordially,  Peter Davenport ((END CORRESPONDENCE)) ((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS)) Peter, I fully understand your reasoning, at the time that I saw this light there had been 1,2 or 3, I think man made objects put into space I had seen these.This was not like that, the light was as bright as a star and as I said no bigger than the point of a pin. With age and knowing the distance of these stars from earth even I find it hard to believe.However I know what I saw, in the finish I was laying on my back watching this display.

I was 8 years old at the time and used to go out at around 6:00 am to play by myself, then return to my house in time for breakfast.  This was sometime in July or August 1961. It was during the summer vacation.  It was about 6:30 when I chanced to look up. I saw a large bright silver, cylinder or oval shaped craft I immediately took for a jet or passenger plane.  I thought it might be from the Skead (Falconbridge Airforce base). I was used to seeing planes from there, but only during the Air Show. The base is just south of Falconbridge, the  nickel mining town I lived in.  The craft made no noise but it was on west to east and certainly a crash trajectory. I dropped everything and went to see where it crashed. It was headed into a horseshoe shaped hole in the ground about three hundred meters long and 200 meters wide. The east side of the pothole (this is what we called it) rose to about 25-30 meters high and the walls declined to about ground level with the rest of the town, the west end being level.  There was nothing there so I went to the east side up on top of the hill and looked to the east into the mines and saw nothing also.  I then went home totally perplexed and very hungry.  When I arrived home, my mother asked me where I had been all day and I tried to tell her that I wanted to have breakfast but she said that I had missed breakfast and lunch but made me a sandwich.  I suffered no trauma what so ever but I am completely baffled about the situation.  For one, I had heard nothing or knew anything about UFO’s.  I also have a bullet shaped mark on my left shin. When I was about 14 or 15 years old, I showed it to my doctor and he said that it had to be made by a deep puncture. I remember nothing about any puncture, nor do my siblings and parents know about something like that. The doctor said it was large enough to have had to have stitches. I remember no such event.  There are many other mysteries to this event that have occurred at later dates.  But just the sighting and the lost time are enough.  Please e-mail me or call as this has been inside of me for a long time and I have told no one other than my brother about this. Should I pursue this?  What do I do next?  Who do I talk to? As I said before, this hasn’t traumatized me but I am very curious and confused about this.  Please let me know.",,46.5667,-80.8167
Couldn't believe how large it was and made no noise...,Great Lakes,IL,,disk,8 min,"Occurred : 7/15/1963 18:00  (Entered as : Jul- 63 Evening) Reported: 5/12/2003 8:48:19 PM 20:48 Posted: 5/13/2003 Location: Great Lakes, IL Shape: Disk Duration:8 min",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28764.html,"Couldn't believe how large it was and made no noise... My father was stationed in the Great Lakes Naval Training area in 1963 and we were living in the Navy housing at the time. Our house had a chain link fence in the back yard and a road that ran along the fence with woods on the other side of the road. At the time of my sighting I was playing kick ball in the back yard with my brother and sisters. It was in the evening time probably around 6:00 and there was still plenty of light out, since it stays light later in the summer. I was 12 years old at the time and my younger sister, by 3 years, was the first to point to the sky and say, ""What's that?"". When we all looked up to the sky, where she was pointing, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was a disk shaped flying saucer of a tremendous size. It seemed much larger than any airplane, but didn't make any noise at all. If I was to put my arms straight out in front of me, pointing my fingers straight out also, that is how much of the horizon this saucer was taking up in the sky. It was very slowly coming down for a landing. We stared in total awe at what we were seeing. My mother at this time was talking to the lady next door standing between the two houses. I ran to get her to come and witness this with us but she wouldn't come so I went back to watch it coming down with my brother and sisters. It was saucer shaped and it had an underside that seemed to have three colored spinning layers. The colors were like orange, blue and green or something like that. Each layer was spinning in the opposite direction from the layer next to it. It looked like each layer was spinning at the same speed though. Above the spinning layers was the main body of the craft that wasn't spinning. This area was much bigger than the three smaller spinning layers below. The size of this thing was amazing and it was coming straight down keeping perfectly level as it slowly came toward the earth. I listened very hard for any sound and couldn't hear anything. What amazed me was how large it was and that it didn't seem to be concerned about people seeing it. Yes, it was still light out and it was coming down for a landing very close to the Great Lakes Naval Training Facility. I was sure that other people must have witnessed what we were witnessing. It came down close enough from where I was that I could have gone over the fence and crossed the street to go through the woods and see where it landed. I was afraid to though. For some reason I had this feeling like I might not be coming back if I was to go over to look more closely at it. Looking back now I wish I had though. I also wish I had grabbed my mothers arm and insisted t! hat she come with me to see what we were seeing. All of these years she has acted like it was my young imagination. I'll never forget what I saw though. I have a theory about the spinning colored lower sections of the saucer. It looked like three gyros spinning in opposite directions on a single axis. It would be neat to be able to do an experiment with three gyros set up like that and see if it effects gravity in any way. Just a thought. I must say that this was the neatest thing that I ever witnessed in my life and I feel very lucky to have been able to see it. If anyone has any questions about what I saw, I will do my best to try to answer them for you. I would also love to hear from anyone else who was living in the Great Lakes area at that time and witnessed the same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the witness have the other witnesses to the event submit reports, as well.

In one of Whitley Strieber's books, Transformation, that there was a possible connection mentioned between the Gaelic languages and the Visitors.  I suspect that maybe I was ""visited"" at a very young age in Greensburg.  There was one other incident, maybe around 1970 or 1971, where I thought I saw a purplish silhouette of a man (or something) standing outside my second story window. He (or it) would have been standing on our sun parlor roof. Anyway, it scared the shit out of me.

This account is true and describes what a I, along with a friend, witnessed today in the skies over Lenexa, Kansas.  Around 12:35 in the afternoon today, 06/09/03, after unloading some very heavy 6x6 posts, I had reclined on my back on the deck I was building to catch my breath.  I looked up into a nearly cloudless blue sky and just happened to see something streaking across the sky directly above us.  I watched it for a few moments, trying to identify it in my own mind, but had no luck making sense of it at all.  It seemed to be a small spot of silvery white, made no noise at all, and really had no discernable shape other than spherical.  It looked small, and moved incredibly fast, moving from horizon to horizon directly overhead in little more than about 10 seconds.  My first thought was it was my first daylight glimpse of a satellite, but it moved much too fast for that.  My brother and I grew up watching and counting orbiting satellites at night in the skies over Wyoming, so I'm very familiar with how they move, but had never seen one in daylight.  I discounted the idea, realizing it didn't seem to be high enough to be in orbit.  As the object neared the far horizon, on a Southwesterly to Northeasterly course, I suddenly sat bolt upright, the realization hitting me that I couldn't identify what I had been watching, and said to my friend, ""What the hell is that?!""  He didn't see it and I immediately tried to point it out to him but as I did it faded from visibility into the distant sky.  I described it to him, still looking skyward, saying, ""God, I wish you had seen that..."", when suddenly there was another, coming from roughly the same direction, on the same general heading as the first, Northeast.  I quickly pointed this one out to my friend, and he immediately spotted it and began tracking it across the sky.  Now I consider myself a serious aviation enthusiast, and I know military aircraft better than most people, even other enthusiasts.  I served in the Air Force as a flight line mechanic, and my buddy who was with me served in the Navy where he specialized in guided missiles, so it's my opinion we both understand basic propulsion systems, the dynamics of flight, and the capabilities - AND the limitations of manned flight.  Neither of us could explain what we were seeing, we thought through all the possibilities we could think of, everything from high flying experimental aircraft, to cotton seeds floating on the breeze to meteors entering the earth's upper atmosphere and burning up.  There were inherent flaws with each of these possibilites though... the objects didn't ""float"" on any breeze, they were on a laser straight course and moving at a very high rate of speed, they didn't seem to be burning or breaking up as any other meteor does, they didn't emit any sound whatsoever, left no vapor trails or contrails... almost as if they didn't disturb the air at all.  And any aircraft moving as fast as these were would most certainly have broken the sound barrier and delivered the telltale thunderous 'clap'.  As we stood staring in utter disbelief at the sky, the object quickly disappeared beyond the horizon to our Northeast.  We frantically searched the sky for any other activity, and to our surprise after a minute or two there came another object, again moving from the same general direction.  That made three so far, and again we both watched in amazement.  They all headed the same direction, yet each was on it's own trajectory.  Some looked slightly larger than others, giving the indication of a difference in altitude, though that's tough to speculate on, not knowing the size of the objects.  By this time I tried to call my wife (exacly 12:44pm according to my cell phone log)but only got her voicemail.  I then dialed my brother in Idaho and excitedly told him what we were witnessing, as we spoke.  They kept coming, a few minutes apart, until we counted six altogether.  At one point, I watched one of the objects (which seemed either larger or lower in altitude) moving at a slower pace than the rest.  As it neared the far horizon, roughly 70% of the way across the viewable sky, it seemed to suddenly accelerate.  We called the homeowner out after seeing the 6th object, hoping for a 3rd set of eyes to confirm what we were seeing, but by the time he got outside it was gone from view, and with that, our encounter was over.  We watched the skies intermittently for the next hour or so, but saw nothing more.  While the activity was ongoing, we considered taking digital pictures, but realized it would be pointless because the camera couldn't possibly capture such small points in the sky with any clarity.  Plus we just didn't think we'd keep seeing more of them so we just stood transfixed, trying to debunk what we were starting to suspect.  This was my first sighting of anything I could consider as even possibly having been of a non-terrestrial nature.  I was excited, yet still questioned whether I had just seen what I had just seen, if that makes sense.  Like everyone else, I had seen the movies, heard the stories, seen the picures and read eye-witness accounts of similar encounters.  I had always suspected something or someone else was out there, but I'd never seen anything firsthand.  Now suddenly here I am confronted with my own personal evidence - and understand I can't completely convince anyone else of what we saw - but now I have firsthand knowledge of something that supposedly doesn't exist.  I've seen something I can't explain, and it's been a very profound experience, mentally, spiritually and emotionally.  I'm a husband and father of two beautiful baby girls, I have a happy life, and I've got nothing to prove to anyone.  I hope nothing more than to share with others what I experienced myself today, because I would hope others would not be afraid to do the same, only then can we hope for enlightenment about who we are as a people, and how ""they"" fit into our existence.

PD)) Communication with Lights in Wisconsin I'm not going to write my whole life story here but I can assure you that I am a credible witness.  I can further assure you that I am of a sound mind, have never been in trouble with the law, and do not have the imagination to cook up a story like this. I rarely drink alcohol and was not drinking at this time. The only skeptism that there could be about me is that I do have an interest in extra terrestrials ,as I have had many dreams of them recently. THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE DREAMS.  I have not told this experience to anyone and I do not seek any attention or money. I have lived in this small Farm house, surrounded by open fields, for seven years and have lived within a half-mile of this farm my entire life.  I am extremely familiar with this location and what the sky looks like at night. Two days ago, sometime after  11:pm. I went to the bedroom to prepare for bed. all the lights in the home were turned off.  As soon as i entered the room I instantly noticed a VERY BRIGHT pure white ball in the eastern sky outside the window.  i went directly to the window and watched as it seemed to ""bounce"" and move slightly. I looked up at the stars and looked back at it but it seemed much too bright and much too close to the ground to be a star. I kept watching it and every time I started to think of some sort of an explanation, it would immediately do something that would rule that explanation out.  For instance, I would think it was a star and it would begin to move a little bit more. I would think maybe it's a plane, and it would bounce directly up, then drop down. I thought maybe an erratic helicopter pilot but then it  dropped down from side to side like paper in the wind. after evrything it did, it would always go back to it's original position. Grasping for a more broad explanation I thought maybe someone was up in a silo on some nearby  farm with a flashlight  or something. it changed color.  maybe there was some possible reflection from something or some kind of atmospheric phenonmnon. It was really hard to tell how far away it was. I thought to myself  ""i've been waiting to see a ufo, but you're gonna have to do better than that!"" Before I finished my thought, A GIANT YELLOW BALL appeared INSTANTLY out the window, it was to the right of the first object. It was MUCH CLOSER. It had rays of yellow light emitting from it. the rays waved like fire but were exactly the same tone and color as the object. Sharp lines and triangles. This was the real deal. this was actually happening. I felt excited and amazed as the object glowed and the rays made beautiful patterns in the sky. I am certain that it was putting on a show for me.  I am certain that it knew i was looking at it and I felt them looking at me. I could hardly look away as it was very beautiful and very mesmorizing. I looked briefly at th! e first object which was in exactly the same spot as before, only now the ground underneath it was illuminated like daytime. there was no streaks of light or rays comming down. just the light in the sky and the lit up circle in the field, nothing between them. There were some sounds from the back door of the house but I was unable to pay attention. looking at the second object and realizing that it was looking / communicating with me, I began to get frightened. It started to move like  "" S "" and when it came around the second turn it came directly at me very very fast. My heart was pounding. I thought ""st  st st st st stop!"" and before i finished my thought it stopped. i started to tell it that i was scared.  the rays of the object retracted. i said i'm sorry but im not ready for this yet. it turned blue. i may have had another thought, im not sure what but then the object turned deep red for a moment then back to yellow and slowly moved outside the view of the window. i ran to the other window where it should have been but could not see anything.  Looking out the first window I saw the first object was still there. I ran out of the room to peer out other windows but found nothing. I ran back to my bedroom to the first object but it was gone. I looked at the clock but i just can't remember what time it ended, nor do I recall exactly what time it bagan. I feel like it happened somtime after 11pm. I will say that the object was friendly and pleasant. it was very beautiful and i felt somehow like i had just turned away an old friend. They seemed so kind and they made me feel so special that i really feel guilty after asking it to leave.  Another strange thought is that I kept expecting them to return last night. Even though they didn't. i really feel like they know who i am,  and will return for another visit. I hope to be more brave next time. I miss them.",2003-06-18T00:00:00,,

I went out side and looked up at the night sky that was fairly clear but some high thin clouds were blocking parts of the view, however the major features were visable...Big Dipper ect.. At first I didnt see anything so I went back inside, then a minute later I heard one of the guys say loudly ""there's one""! I ran outside and saw a light move quickly from N to S running parallel with the Big Dippers' handle. After about 20 seconds it disappeared, in that time span it had moved nearly the lenght of the visable sky from N to S. About that same time I spotted another light moving S to N at about the same speed in the eastern sky about 30 degrees east of the first light, this light disappeared behind some high clouds and I lost track of it, less then a minute later I saw another light move very quickly from W to E but also lost it in high clouds. What I thought first was a meteor shower was certainly not that ! Neither was it commercial aircraft because there was atleast 4 in that time period flying E to W to land at either St Paul Holman field or MSP and they very easy to see and follow because River Falls is in a landing corridor for both airports, although the jets all usually  fairly high up yet when they pass overhead. I can get three others to confirm this and probably much more because they have been watching this for several nights now! To me it seemed like these lights were on ""patrol"" for something being there were many more than the three I clearly saw, dozens have been seen by two of our residents, I plan on watching atleast 2 more hours tonight and then again tomorrow!

Since my childhood I've read just about every kind of UFO book made since the early 70's.  Yet, I've never seen a UFO until today and I'm excited.  We have a back deck here and I sit on it to watch satellites and aircraft going across the sky at dusk for 2-3 hours from time to time.  It's my quiet time to reflect on my life, the economy, ect...  Tonight I noticed several satellites, I guess about 7, and 3 or 4 commercial aircraft flying across the sky.  Commercial aircraft are pretty bright and have beacon lights.  Sometimes you can see the glow from the windows down one side of a big jet cruising at 35,000 feet pretty easy.  You can also hear the jet engine noise pretty easy from out here in the country.  Satellites are different!  They don't glow as bright as aircraft get,, yet they can move across the sky nearly as fast as aircraft can.  A satellite moves much faster than an airplane yet at their altitude out in space, it gives the appearance of the relative speed of an airplane.  In 20+ years of randomly watching satellites and aircraft, I will testify that they will appear and dis-appear into the distance usually within 2-3 minutes.  Satellites will disappear quicker than aircraft as they rely on the setting sunlight to be seen!  But, once a satellite crosses the sunset line in space, over your location, it disappears as satellites don't generate their own light like commerical aircraft do. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have observed what are thought to be the U. S. Navy ""NOSS"" satellites, three of which fly in formation.  NUFORC has received many such reports.  PD))  Sitting in my chair, at precisely 10:20 PM, 5-28-2003, I noticed directly overhead three very dimly glowing lights amongst the stars.  These lights were dimmer than the reflection of the last satellite I was which was only 5 minutes earlier.  I would approximate 1/2 the light value of any satellite I've seen.  And Satellites are dimmer than aircraft.  These lights were moving VERY, VERY slow also!  They were moving from due west to east.  These lights direction and speed caused some concern within me as I have never seen anything move that slowly and further from west to east!  Most satellites move in polar orbits around here or they are moving south west to north east or south east to north west...  Never east west!  NEVER!  I've been a ham for 20 years and have communicated thru some of our OSCAR satellites in the past!  Have even seen them travel across the sky, south to north, upon occassion!  So direction and speed were very interesting!  Very SLOW!  Very DIM!  And moving west to east.  At first, I thougth I was fortunate enought to see one of these moving triangles they have been talking about!  Like the triangle spotted over Phoenix!  But you could see stars thru this triangle!  So it wasn't solid.  It was three lights which were just moving together across the sky, going very slow, being very dim, and traveling from west to east!  So I felt that my space junk, or what ever it was would dis-appear, at the usual spot in the sky where the last satellite did as it would see earth's sunset and the glow would go away as these objects entered darkeness.  I waited and waited and waited.  They got to the place in the sky they should have dis-appeared and they did not.  I assumed that because of their dim lights they must really be very far out in space so I waited some more.  But the lights didn't go out in 15 minutes of watching them.  They dis-appeared into the eastern sky at around 25 degrees above the horizon!  SO!  So they must have been making their own light and this was an actual UFO I just saw, OR, I just witnessed 3 very large asteroids which nearly hit planet earth!  It could be either!  I'm not sure.  An Asteroid would be far enough out that it would be plausable that it would not be affected by the setting sun AND it would explain the very dim glow and slow movement across the sky.  The other thing about the siting I wanted to say was the pattern these 3 lights made which caused me to believe it was a triangle of some kind.  In the reports of phoenix, I believe witnesses said the nose of the triangle had a light and each tail peice both starboard and port side of the craft had a light.  It's merely my opinion but because of the pointyness formed by the three lights my mind had the impression this triangle was moving from west to east going sideways.  The nose was pointed ruffly North/North-East and the other distant tail lights, IF YOU WILL, were south of the nose.  I watched the distance of these lights and noticed that by the time they reached the horizon to the east before I lost them, it appeared the distance between all three lights had been reduced.  I'm thinking this must have been 3 asteroids because every account I ever read about a UFO leaves me with the impression that the witness saw bright lights or glowing colors!  COLORS!  There were no colors to these lights!  These lights had the same color of a dim star!  Just a faint white glow.  All three were about the same dim appearance, the imagined NOSE of my triangle being the brightest.  I would have probably missed all three had I been looking anywhere else.  They were going so slow that you have to star at them to see the movement!  Very, very slow.  15 minutes for a straight over head to eastern setting is an extremely long time for a Satellite!  It's UNHEARD OF!  Why if a satellite were really moving that slow it would re-enter the earths atmosphere!  I'll conclude to say that I don't do drugs and I don't drink either. My occupation is Programmer/Analyst and my hobbies are Ham Radio and Computers using the Linux Operating System.  Anyway, I'm pleased to have posted my very first UFO encounter here on this website and I hope that before my life is over I get the opportunity to see at least one more.  If anyone reading this report from the government has data about a near earth collision of 3 asteroids, I would like to hear about this.  I'm really thinking that's what I just saw and it frightens me a little either way.  What ever those three dim lights were, at that distance it would have to be HUGE to be natural.  On the other hand, perhaps I did see some kind of UFO, craft of some kind.  Thanks!",2003-06-03T00:00:00,36.2051,-94.7977

I was hesitant to report the occurrences i have been witnessing, but after multiple sightings over the course of two months,  i am certain that what i am seeing is not and are not common events that i am mistakenly misidentifying.  Before i report on tonight's sighting i will describe 2 other sightings that i witnessed last month that were similar to tonight's.    The first event occurred on April 7th 2003 at approximately 4:30 am (EST) I noticed an unusually bright, white glow coming from the area of the nuclear Site, as i watched for several minutes i saw what i can only describe as an extremely large disc shaped object rise quickly from the trees. This was perhaps less than a mile away from where i was at the time.  At this point it was only dimly lit but when it reached an altitude of what i guess would be about one thousand feet it became extremely bright white, almost silver in color, and hovered for a few seconds, then shot straight up into the sky.  I cannot even guess its' speed or altitude at that point.  It then traveled in an arc, heading almost due south until i lost sight of it.  I waited and watched for several minutes, and to my surprise i saw it again, but this time it traveled south to north.  Again, i am unable to estimate its altitude or speed, but it only took the object about 5 seconds to travel from horizon to horizon.  The second sighting i had was almost exactly the same in detail as the first, but it took place on April 23rd and at roughly the same time and place. Tonight i was out sky watching when this sighting took place.  It was 9:45 PM (EST) in the evening.  The object was circular in shape, and brightly illuminated in white to silver.  When i first saw it i thought it was just an extremely bright star.  It was just above the tree line.  It slowly started moving higher up and across the sky.  This time it was traveling from south to north.  I ran in and got my binoculars and by the time i got back outside the object was near the center of the sky.  It's travel was erratic to say the least.  It would start out with a zigzag motion then pause a second, then resume it's flight in a slight arc.  When i had the object in focus i could see that it was changing color and shape.  It would shift from silver white to orange then to blue and back to silver white.  What i was able to make out quite clearly was the fact that every time it shifted color it would also shift from a circular shape to an oval shape and then back.  It must have taken about 3 minutes to traverse the sky.  When it reached the tree line something appeared to separate from it and speed back across the sky in the opposite direction it had just traveled.  The object appeared to originate near the area of the nuclear Site. I have witnessed other sightings in the area, but these are the most significant. I can only speculate as to what they are. I am an engineer and am familiar with conventional aircraft, these are in no way conventional. Unfortunately the photographic equipment i have is rather limited.  I have attempted to get pictures of some of the objects using my digital but am unable to capture any useable images to date.  I have some short bits of footage on the camcorder but it too is not of a quality that would be of any use.",2003-06-03T00:00:00,33.4145,-81.6982

It did this about 8 times before we lost sight of it. We then saw about 15 other lights in the next 20 minutes and none of them moved as fast or faded out or flashed. Jets were also clearly visible and the object was definitely not like anything I have seen and I watch the skies like a hawk.",2003-06-03T00:00:00,40.55069822812846,-105.07729501661129

This light increased intensity and became exceptionally bright, I thought that it was an aircraft that had turned on its landing lights, but it was curious because it was way to fast and way to high to be a commercial airliner.  After observing this light it then split into three seperate lights and disappeared, I belive I saw a small dull reddish light in the same path.  I the noticed directly behind a dull red light moving behind the first light.  The red light was moving at an exceptionally high rate of speed and appeared to fade in and out.  None of these lights had any type of stobe effect nor could I ascertain any rotating beacons or other indications that it was a conventional aircraft.  Directly after that, there was an increase in very fast moving aircraft in the same general area, I suspect them to have been military aircraft.

She seemed quite awake and I assumed she was just getting into bed late for some reason. For some reason, something made a noise outside and my wife jumped. I asked her if she had checked all the doors before coming to bed and she had not, so I double-checked everything. When I was down in the basement (walk-out) I was checking the door to our backyard when I noticed the entire back yard was lit up. My mind ran through the various options and came up blank.  The light source (which I could not directly see from my location) was somewhere on the other side of the trees but must have been very close from how bright everything was - practically daylight, with shadows being cast from ABOVE the trees. I watched for about 15 seconds, then decided to get a better angle from upstairs, which overlooks the yard and our neighbors yard as well. By the time I went up 1 story (maybe 10 seconds to go up the stairs), the backyard was completely dark again.  I ran upstairs and asked my wife if she had seen the bright light. She said yes. We were both a bit puzzled by it, and a bit freaked out. She asked me to bring our oldest BACK to our bed (when does that ever happen?) and I opened the door next to ours with the little one. Somewhat jokingly, I told her I was going to use her computer to do a Yahoo search on ""Chanhassen UFOs"" - she said ""DO IT!"", so here I am… ((NUFORC Note:  We have attempted to correspond with this witness, but the e-address he provides is defective, despite the fact that he identifies himself as a software engineer.

It was dark and overcast, at about 5:45pm on Saturday, November 30, 2002. I was driving north on a busy stretch of Highway 99, 5-10 miles south of Yuba City, CA. Roughly 1-2 miles ahead of me, I saw a very large white/yellow light hovering at about 1,000-2,000 feet in the air, approximately 100 yards off the highway. As I approached (about 1/2 mile away), I could see three large, distinct lights in a row, and one small red/orange blinking light on the left (west). I assumed the blinking light was a landing light on a wing, so I briefly dismissed it as a plane or jet. But the object continued to hover (as far as I could tell, it never moved), and as I began to pass underneath it, I realized that the three large lights were arranged in an equilateral triangle formation. I couldn't make out an outline of the object, because the three white/yellow lights were too bright. Unfortunately, there was too much traffic to find a place to safely pull over and observe the object. But there were 3-4 cars in front of me and 5-6 behind me, so I have to assume that someone else saw what I saw. I know that Beale AFB is roughly nearby, so who knows what it was. I suppose it could have been a Harrier jet, but as near as I could tell, it wasn't making any noise. I've seen hundreds of military and civilian aircraft in my life, and I've honestly never seen anything hover like that before.

There appeared to be three lights at the ""tips"" of a dark triangular shaped ""craft?"" moving slowly north.  The crfaft was able to precisely, fluidly change direction towards NE and then towards the NW.  The craft was low, approximately 1,000'-2,000' in altitude.  It moved SILENTLY, and it seemed able to change directions within its own radius (turn on a dime) but it was not moving fast.  It reminds me of the fluid, silent turn/roll of a sailplane.  For a moment I thought that's what it was, but I have never seen any sailplanes around here and I have lived here for 44 years.

Typical movements included circular loops and some very rapid vertical motions followed by rapid change of direction to horizontal and then followed by a loop terminating in about the original position. one characteristic was the instantateous change of direction of flight. another feature was the very brightness of the object: it was brighter than any nearby star and it did not flicker at all. I determined the motion of this object by referencing two stationary objects and sighting along to see what the motion was. the most rapid motion was vertcally downwards which happened perhaps four or five times during the two hours of observation. it was a very crisp clear night though a bit of fog developed later. other than the rotation of the earth displaying ever unfolding vista through the night, the only other bright object with motion was an aircraft flying basically north to south. certified true and correct ((name deleted)) B.

Late one night last month (January) my teenage son called me to go outside. He was standing in our front yard staring at the night sky. I looked up to see an object being chased by an aircraft, a jet. The object being chased had what seemed to be a circular shape of very bright light or lights. The light appeared to be one mass from our distance and point of view. The shape of the whole craft could not be made out. We recognized the jet by the wings lights, one red, one green, and a center light. The lights on the jet were flashing in rapid procession. I commented that it looked like the air police. The jet was gaining in distance between it and the object, and just when it got close the object accelerated and began and incredible acsent as it was circling back toward the Charleston Air Force Base. We live only a few blocks from the AFB main gate. I went into my house to find a pair of binoculars. My son ran in to get the phone to call a friend that lives in the neighborhood. My son's friend saw the 'chase'. I recall the chill in the air and wishing I had something on my feet. The sky was not very cloudy, or atleast there was no cloud coverage to obstruct our view. The crafts were flying SE to NW. Looped around the Air Base and then continued WNW. My son has studied aircraft since the age of 3. His goal is to become a pilot, but what he saw was difficult to explain with all his knowledge of aircraft, old, new, and experimental. Because of my son's interest we have for years looked to the sky. He is somewhat expert in recognizing types of aircraft from sight and/or sound. He, nor I, have any knowledge of what American craft uses such lighting. The object was so large and bright that it was highly noticeable. We thought that something would have been broadcasted on the news. There was illness in the family which did not permit me to do an online search until now. I was very happy to see that atleast one other person in the area could confirm our sighting. One explaination was that the USAF was testing out a new aircraft, but that gave rise to why it was pursued by a jet with rapid flashing lights. I would have thought such a test would have been more discreet. I am suggesting to my son and his friend that they add their own discription and comments to this site.

The cloud ring was rotatintg so that the inside of the hollow, cirular shaped cloud ring was moving downwards and the outside of the cloud ring moving upwards, so I assumed while watching, that it must be very cold in the centre of that cloud ring.   The cloud ring was directly above one end of the cylindrical shaped cloud, and then some flashes of light appeared between these two clouds for one or two seconds and then a clear sphere shot out from  where the flash was.  The sphere curved upwards to the left and then disappeared or dissolved from sight. It retained its shape while it disappeaared, it did not shrink, but disapeared in a fraction of a second. The spehe was in view for about two seconds. I found it hard to believe what I was seeing.   After 20 or 30 seconds another flash of light and another sphere shot out and curved up to the right and disappeared like the first one. Then several more flashes of light and several more spheres shot out in similar fashion at 20 or 30 second time intervals. Each sphere went in a different direction. All the spheres came out at about mach 5, so that they covered a mile in about one or two seconds. All came out straight and then curved away.  This was all happening about three or four miles from me, about half a mile up.  The third sphere left a black contrail, a mile or two long. This contrail was very black in color, just like the very black cylindrical shaped cloud, and not like the white clouds elsewhere in the sky. These were the only black clouds in the sky that day. The smoke ring was white in color. The contrail left by the third sphere started where the spheres appeared from and exactly followed the path of the sphere. This contrail formed in one or two seconds but remained for some minutes, showing the exact path of the sphere. None of the other spheres produced contrails. About six spheres came out in total.    I did not report this untill after I read that other people had seen similar spheres.  The color of the spheres seemed clear or silver, it is hard to describe the exact color. They appeared to  be about 30 or 40 meters in diameter.  After the last sphere came out the smoke ring shaped cloud stopped turning and the cylindrical shaped cloud and the smoke ring cloud both disappeaered within two minutes, so the total time from appearence of the clouds to disappearence was about 7 minutes.  These were not saucers or elipses or triangles, but perfect spheres. When they disappered, the retained their shape and size, and did not disolve by getting smaller.",2003-03-04T00:00:00,,

I awoke to a load nosie, of a low flying F-xx model US Aircraft, in formation with another jet. It was so close to the ground, I noted it was in the typical gray livery.  This isn't unusal howeverm  because I leave near Minneapolis Internetional Airport, that has a military base, national gaurd, and Airforce.  I glanced at the Gerneral Electric Alarm Clock which is next to my bedroom window, the Time was exactly 2:54, as the min just changed.  My window is facing north, but I can see a large view, because its the second story, towards the St. Croix River Valley.  I live on a hillside, and it is very open.  It was a clear night, with moonlight which reflected off the ice and snow.  I glanced out my window to see the typical 777, or other Northwest Airlines Airliner enroute to the airport on a decent path to MSPIA.  however, a loud sound was rumbling in the vally, the Jets were out of sight at this time.  I saw a object in the distance about 1/2 a mile away from my house.  Visabiliy was very good, and I could see River Falls, Wi, 8 miles from my house, nice and bright.  I saw, what appeared to my at the time  (and dismissed as) a helicopter, hovering with very bright lights, I thought maybe an accident was on Hwy 29, and it was the MedEvac Helocopter, but this wasn't any helicopter I have seen before.  It was very hard to makeout, but it was just one very bright light, no green and red tail lights.  As I got out of bed, and looked closer (approch the window) i noted it was a triangular thing (best way to put it) As I watched this thing hover back and forth for about one min, the sound of turbine engines got very loud, enough to wake up my dogs.  The military aircraft reversed direction in a loop and headed towards the light.  They very very close the the ground, but gained altitude quickly. As they flew over my house, the object got brighter, then shoot like a metoriod accrose the screen leaving a trail like a con trail left by a jumbo jet, however this light left a trail that lasted about 30 seconds.  A! s the Mi litary Aircraft approched the trail, they broke formation, and went out of sight.  At first I thought,  it was military training, but after I thought about it more, it was very unual.  That day, I was talking about airplanes with my friend, who lives closer to River Falls, in the Area of the craft,he saw the formation, and the light, and talked to one of his friends at the hospital, and their  MedEvac helcopter stayed ground all night.  He also saw the trail, and a glow (aura) that stayed in the area for a good 30 seconds.",2003-03-04T00:00:00,44.7359,-92.7117

We were both looking at them and then I said ""look seagulls are circling above them"" realizing that they were not seagulls! My friend then said ""those aren't seagulls"" We were looking at about 8 brilliant white spheres doing circles and right angle turns at various hights up to about a mile high or so. They were obviously not birds, but the crows were circling under them which was really strange. We watched them in awe for about 45 seconds and then they were just gone in an instant! The crows were still there though. We stood there for a while hoping they would come back but they didn't after an hour had passed, while we talked about them. I didn't take any pictures because I didn't have a camera with me.",2003-03-11T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

There was a black comb-like shape with very bright halogen-type brightness between the black frame.  Above and below the elongated lights was a much smaller set of lights without the black frame.  At one point I gave a hand-signal to the craft when the lights faded and it immediately came on again.  I distinctly felt this craft was extraterrestrial and watching me. ((short deletion of personal information)) The sighting lasted about fifteen minutes. On Sunday I went mountain climbing and happened to see a jet's contrail high up in the sky and decided to take a photo of it.  When I got home and put the digital photo clip in my computer, the image of the contrail included an almost invisible roundish shape in the photo.  My digital camera takes flawless images and I've never had a camera flaw from any photo I've taken.  I've read that ET craft such as from the Pleidian craft (""And yet... they fly!"" by Guido Moosbrugger) have the ability to make themselves appear almost invisible, such as the image I have. I reported this initially to the FAA and they referred me to NIDS.  The contact their, Roger, told me the image I have is probably a 'camera flurry.' I am not convinced of that knowing my camera's extreme accuracy. I would be glad to e-mail you a copy of the image I took on Sunday, February 9th.\ ((NUFORC Note:  We will request copies of the alleged photos.

Houston, Quick & Telkwa  Date: April 24, 2003 Time: (starting at 10:55 p.m.) Local & Toll Free UFO Hotline Witnesses - 5  A little background on a sighting from July 29, 2002 first. The reason I brought up this shortened report again is, why so many sightings being seen around these areas. Military or government testing?, or a natural phenomena, or something else ! (Unknown). And there is certainly something taking place around here.  Last year over the Houston, Quick and Telkwa skies we had a rather large sighting which still has me baffled. As I and the Smithers Interior newspaper reported on the sighting after it happened, I soon found out that the story was growing by the day. The week after the sighting on July 29, 2002 if seems ""dozens, upon dozens"" of northern resident here in Houston, Telkwa and Smithers were witnessing military vehicles which were traveling highway #16 and on the back roads throughout the areas. Also I found it more than strange to find out a large amount of fixed winged aircraft and helicopters were flying so very low all around these communities, and keeping their flights at a very low level. Even I witnessed large transport aircraft flying back and forth from the north to the south.  After a night out for dinner at a close friends home, I arrived home to find two messages on my answer machine informing me that there was a great deal of aircraft activity taking place some 80 kilometers out the Morice River Road. (in the middle of no where). I was to meet up with one of the fellows who contacted me. So at 3:00 a.m. I took a trip in his logging truck so he could show me what he was talking about. Sure enough, just after 4:00 a.m. and still dark out, unknown lights were seen flying freely and low across the sky. In the opposite direction an aircraft was flying towards a light. After the two passed each other the ""aircraft"" made it's turn to follow the strange light.  A full week, and longer, two different logging contracting crews who were working in two separate areas. (or cut blocks) had observed numerous aircraft flying low up the Morice Valley, and low over the mountain peaks. (just so you know this would be dangerous to say the least due to the rugged terrain, but there they were looking for something, so witnesses said. Or at least in their opinion, that's what they all thought was going on.  Reports on the above sighting can be found at my website under British Columbia Sighting Reports.  Houston, B.C. (just west of)   Now on April 24, 2003, starting at 10:55 p.m. two witnesses here in Houston, B.C. caught sight of a really interesting and strange light/object. At approx: 2 kilometers west of the town of Houston, just past the railway and highway #16 bridges these two folks saw in front of them a small glowing sphere shaped object almost sitting on highway #16 at the top of the hill they were about to head up. (HBCC UFO Note): To give you an better of where the witnesses were sitting when they spotted it. After traveling through Houston heading west, it is pretty flat ground with the Bulkley River winding along side the highway. At about 2 kms you would come to a blue bridge which crosses the Bulkley River, as one leaves the other end of the bridge you then start climbing a short, but steep hill heading in the direction of Quick, Telkwa and Smithers, B.C. The witness had just crossed the bridge when they caught sight of this light.)  As they headed up the hill, or approx; half ways up, the light disappeared from their line of sight. Once they arrived at the crest of the hill, again they noted the light moving north (away from them), and flying almost straight, following highway 16 at a low altitude. They told me that it was not much more than 80 to 100 feet off the road. The witnesses were at the time traveling at a speed of approx: 80 to 90 k's per hour and the object was slowly pulling a head of them. They lost sight of it once again just before the Irrigation Lake turn off. (or close). The only reason the object disappeared from their vision was due to the tree line. (Plus curves and hills in their view). It was the last time they saw the object. The total time that they observed the event was approx: 20 to 30 seconds. The description that was given of the object, was that it appeared to be completely round, glowing, or for maybe a better word - pulsating. It was about the size of a small digital satellite dish from the distance they had to view it. The object made no sudden movements, such as to the right or left, it stayed on a straight flight path. They also said because of the distance they were from the light, they said there was no sound heard coming from it. Also at one point the object seemed to light up the center roadway markings. (solid white reflective center lines).  Thank you to the Houston residents for their welcomed report.  Quick, B.C. (Woodmere Road just off Highway #16)  Date: April 24, 2003 Time: approx: 11:20 p.m.  On April 24, 2003 a farmer and his son out tending their cattle on a dairy farm at Quick, British Columbia. Both also witnessed the same object, or it seems to be. The son was hauling out manure from the barn with their tractor when he gave out a yell for his Dad to come out and look. When the Dad came out his son was pointing toward the western edge of their farm, and sitting at a dead stop just over top a group of evergreen and poplar trees, was a bright ball of white/yellowish light. They said no sound could be heard from it. HBCC UFO asked for an approx: size to this object. The reply was that is may have been close to the size of a full pick-up truck. Or as close as the witnesses could estimate. The object/light was closer to the Quick residents than the people driving just outside of Houston, B.C. which would have given them a closer view of the object, and this is why it looked larger. (in my estimation)  The sighting lasted for approx: 10 to 15 seconds, before it started moving north towards the Telkwa/Smithers area. Both of these Quick residents lost sight of the light/object after it rose up slightly to get over a small hill in the distance. They said what ever it was seemed to take it's time and flew in a straight line to the west, but at a very low level before having to gain a little in altitude to make it over top a hill. ( I asked if any of the farm animals reacted to this event, both said no).  Telkwa, B.C. (Object observed over Tyhee Lake)  Date: April 24, 2003 Time: approx: 11:45 p.m.  A fellow who resides in the Telkwa area was on his way home, he left highway #16 and drove along the Telkwa High Road. Just has he was adjacent with Tyhee Lake Provincial Park he observed a ball of light flying ""erratically"" low over the lake. The witness said the light/object was moving quite quickly and reminded him if it was out of control when it first caught his attention. He stopped his vehicle to watch, and wondered what he was looking at. It was low enough that it did cast it's light onto the lake below it. The man said he heard no sound, but I was told he did remain in his vehicle as the ""thing"" flew up the lake, moving from side to side, up and down, until it reached almost half way up the lake, then it veered off to the northeast towards the Babine Lake Provincial Park (or towards  Granisle area) at a high rate of speed. (and clearing the mountain on the other side of the lake). He said is was so weird and all happened so fast, approx: 10 to 15 seconds at his guess. His estimation of the size of it was close to the size of a small car. The object was bright, and a off white in color. The witness said if it wasn't for his wife telling him to call me, he would not have known who to contact, or if he would as it was so strange and he thought, who would believe me anyway ??  HBCC UFO Note: When I did my weekly radio UFO update show this past Thursday I asked area residents to call or write if anyone else had seen this event. Also I keep getting asked, why are there so many reports of unknown sightings coming from the pacific northwest here in British Columbia. Of course my reply is, I really do not know !!! I know with all the media attention I do get here, UFOs are a topic of discussion in the Saw Mill lunch rooms, area businesses and private homes. So when something is seen flying through the skies in northwest British Columbia, there is a good chance I will receive a call or email. But I do know, just in Houston, B.C. where I live, there have been a great number of UFO sightings gone unreported as I hear about one darn near once a week through a second hand party. I do not report on any of these as I have not talked with the witnesses who actually seen the unusual sight.  One more item I should also mention while I am here. I reported to you folks, and so did the media a while back on a major sighting which took place at Terrace, British Columbia, over Lake Elselake. Triangles had been seen flying low over, or around the lake. Finally I had a bit of a break through on this case and hope to have a full report on this soon. To be honest, I thought this may have been a hoax, but it is looking as if something really did take place over that area. What, well that is another question.  PS - If any more information on the above Houston/Quick/Telkwa sightings come in, I will certainly post all new information on this case. Plus I will be adding maps and photos to this case when I upload the reports to my website. (There are no photos of the object in question, but rather area photos of the places the object was seen).

Details - provide all the minor/major details  I was looking out the window of my 5th floor room in the Ashland Plaza hotel at a developing lightning storm to the right. My room faced the river. I am not sure of the orientation but that would be easy enough to determine  from a map of the area.  I noticed an object about the size of a small car floating in the air over the river – I’m not sure of the altitude, but it was a little less than twice as high as the bridge, at least from my perspective. It was moving to the left, in the direction of the wind, as I could tell from the flag in front of the courthouse across the street.  Although the wind was stiff, the object moved slowly in a controlled and deliberate manner, without the vagrant, flapping, unstable motion of, say, a plastic bag. Apparently, it made no sound. However, this hotel has windows that can't be opened, so that may not be verifiable.  It was black and roughly triangular in shape. It was either changing shape in motion or rolling somehow.  I thought it was a kite or a paraglider someone was flying off the back of a boat, as it was following the course of the river. That theory was shattered when it continued over the bridge. Shortly afterwards, it deviated away from the river, and me, and dwindled away to an invisible speck in the distance.  I’m not claiming this was an aircraft or anything else, BTW. It was an UFO at least as far as I’m concerned, if only for the simple fact that I could’nt identify it. Perhaps there were other witnesses or an explanation of some kind. If so, I’d like to know.",2003-05-09T00:00:00,38.45819417475728,-82.6811854368932

I made a call to someone in Snohomish County. The phone rang about 5 times when a voice came on and said ""there is no mourning for a world that is weeping"". The phone was still ringing. Then the canned operator voice came in and said ""there is no answer, for 75 cents we will try your call, etc"". And the phone continued to ring. I thought, ""maybe this person incorporated rings on to his answering machine and put used the phone company message in it"". I hung up and called the number again  and but there was no answer. I called my son and told him and also my brother who was here at the time about the bizarre incident. The voice was clear and professional sounding. It actually made me a bit edgy to think someone had tapped into my phone line. I went right to bed and within 5 minutes, my dog who was in the living room, started to bark at something. I got back up went into the living room while he was barking at something toward Puget Sound. I live across the street from the beach. I waited for about 10 minutes watching but could see no one. He would not leave the window. I called the people in Snohomish again on Friday and they told me what their answering machine message said and it was nothing like the above. I will await my phone bill to see what shows up as this was a long distance call. I am the MUFON State Director for Western Washington and tend to try to find logic in all our cases.

None have been submitted, to the best of our knowledge.  No location in Illinois is indicated by the witness.  We question whether this is a serious report, but include it here, nevertheless, hoping other potential witnesses might submit reports.  PD)) I need and explanation? I am actually writing this on behalf of my sister.  I almost feel somewhat stupid repeating this story.  I was surfing the web trying to research what my sister and her friends described they saw to me.  That is how I came across this website.  O.k. well a couple of nights ago, my sister's friend had a bonfire party out at her house out in the country.  There were approximately 15-20 kids there.  They set up the bonfire in between the house and an adjacent field.  The party winded down at around 2:45 in the morning.  My sister who is 17, her friend E who is 17 also, and E's older sister A, who is 19, started to clean up.  They drove their mom's van down to the fire, and loaded some chairs into it and brought it up to the shed.  They unloaded those, and shortly before getting into the van, my sister looked up toward the house and saw a figure standing  a little off the drive-way by the house.  She motioned to E to look at it.  E asked my sister if that was Justin? a kid that had been at the party?  They knew they were the only three left, so they got creeped out and hopped into the van.  Once in the van, they looked back up towards the house, and the figure was gone.  My sister described it as appearing to look like maybe it was a man, and it had lighter colored, or white clothing on.  Once the van was started, they all convinced eachother, that the figure or person, was probably E's dad just checking up on them.  They then headed back down towards the fire to resume cleaning.  By this time it is approximatley 3:20 a.m.  They headed up over the drive-way and into the grass, and down the hill towards the fire, which was still burning.  E had her brights on and my sister was somewhat looking at the floor, when she heard A say, What the Hell is that?  My sister looked up and saw what she describes as ""frozen things.""  Figures or creatures or something in two seperate rows.  She says maybe fifteen in each row, and 30 in all.  She said they were approximately three feet to four feet tall.  And! she said they were about fifteen feet away from them, directly in front of the car.  She describes them as having a Christmas light head, and that the heads were connected to the body but she couldn't see how.  She says their arms were up, but she couldn't see hands.  She says they were stick like.  Stick people she says, dark grey or brown in color.  They didn't move.  Not at all she says.  She says they were just frozen in these two seperate rows.  (Crazy, this is what I would lable this freekin story) My sister immediatley began to cry, and then both girls screamed for E to get the car moving.  She peeled out and they headed to town.  Now what they did next doesn't really matter.  I kind of wish they would have come got me, but instead they drove around trying to think of things that the ""things"" could have been.  Deer, Trees, Goats, Sheep, Bushes, but they knew that those weren't it.  The girls drove around for a little over two hours until they finally got enough courage to go back.  Mostly because the sun started to come out.  They went back to the spot where they saw them, and there was nothing there.  My sister came home that morning and told us the story.  Now, I honestly don't believe in this ((deleted)).  I don't believe in ghosts, I don't believe in aliens, or hell, or anything that can't be proven.  So, I am looking for some logical answers.  She is telling the truth.  She hasn't been able to sleep, or eat, and when she told us what happened she could barley finsh the story because she was fighting back tears.  To say that she was shaken up is an understatement.  I am fucking pissed that this has happened to her, because she has finals over the next three weeks, and she can't sleep let alone concentrate.  Does this make any sense, what I am saying.  Like I said, I am looking for logical answers.  I am not leaving my name, or her name, or any ones name.  Because I don't want her labled as that ""crazy girl."" It seems like the only people that ever see these things are the crazy redneck familys that ! live in a trailor park, and are ((deleted)) uneducated and just plain retarded.  So I guess that is why I don't want her name to be in this.  I don't know how to end this novel that I have written, but I guess I would like your oppinion on what we have here.  Please get back to me.  Have I described something that has been seen before?  Has there been other reports of anything like this in Illinois?  Please let me know.  For the record I am not crazy, nor is she.  Thank You",2003-05-09T00:00:00,,

My brother and I had just seen X-men 2 at the cinema. We were driving on a highway and there was a policecar with lights coming from the sidelane. Therefore I changed lanes and had to look in my rearview mirror. But on the rightside, looking past the mirror, through my windowshield I saw two red lights(in a horizontal line), crossing the highway from the east to the southwest. I did not think much of it at first but a second later there was a third light, which was going on and of in a white/green flash. That is when I realized the craft had a triangler shape. I shouted to my brother that there was a UFO. We got all excited and we could not believe our eyes. We thought we were kidding ourselves as we had just seen X-men 2. The craft hoovered over the highway from the east to the west. The red lights were not flashing therefore we knew it was not a helicopter. It hung over and open field for a while (a minute or so) and than sped off. I got off the highway and started following it. My brother rang my dad on the cellphone and my dad said that the camera was still in the booth of the car. I stopped the car and got the camera out. By the time my brother was recording it, it was already far away. On the recording, which is 20 seconds, you can only see one red light as a dot in the night sky.  We knew it had to be a UFO because of the shape of it. It was a bit like a helicopter but it could not have been, because it was flying at such a height that a helicopter would have looked bigger, and there was no sound coming from the aircraft. It is amazing that not more people saw the object, because there were more cars (I think three more) that could have seen the thing. Amazing!",2003-05-09T00:00:00,,

I was sitting on my back porch looking out over the pasture behind my home. The time was around 3:30 am. The pasture has several horses on it but i could not see them at the time because i think they were up at the other end. After i had been out there for about 10 minutes i began to hear the horses at the other end. It sounded like they were kicking the sheet metal and squealing loudly. I stood up to see if i could look down to the end of the pasture to see what was causing the horses trouble. I could also hear dogs barking in the distance, it sounded like hundreds of them. Just as i was straining to see the horse shelter at the other end, horse and dogs quieted and became silent, no movement, sounds, or anything. It was more quiet than before all the commotion. I started to get a scared burning feeling in my chest and felt the hairs on the back of my neck tingle. after maybe a few seconds of the erie quiet i heard a whirring sound,it was real low and deep, and not loud. I stepped off the porch and i saw a light flash on the ground in the middle of the pasture. i looked up and about a hundred feet off the ground was a black craft hovering and shooting flashes of light at the ground from a pod on the right end of the craft. The craft had a multicolored mist or hot looking gas on the bottom of it. on the left side of the craft was what looked to be a rectangular red window. I thought it was a window because i thought i saw movement inside of it. After i saw movement i began to feel sick. The craft looked about 50 feet long with a dull blue light on the top. after about five minutes passed the whirring sound faded and the craft hovered silent for about 2 seconds and then zipped straight up with no sound. with in one second it went so high and fast looked like a star then it curved north and the light went out. I did not even notice that the power was off in the neighborhood until i saw it come back on after the craft was gone. I work in the security field and have no intrest in making anything out of this.

This is the third time I have seen these objects. I live in Palm Springs near the airport. Last summer while out for an afternoon walk, I glanced at the sky and saw a group of at least 50 silver spheres slowly moving across the valley from the southeast toward the northwest. At first I thought they were birds but they were spread out in strings and groupings. Some would break away and then circle back. I watched until I could no longer see them and decided they must be mylar balloons that had broken loose and were floating on the air current. Two weeks ago at work near College of the Desert, I looked up and saw the same objects - maybe 20 or 30 traveling in the same direction as before. I watched as they slowly moved across the sky and observed that some seemed to be tethered together in a line which would make a circle and then open up again. They were all in a group but very stretched out. Today while getting my mail, I looked up and saw them again. At first only one, then briefly a very small group clustered together. This group turned in unison, flashed in the sun, and disappeared. Birds, I thought. Just then a commercial jet which had just taken off proceeded from west to east. A single small, very silver orb paced the plane at exactly the same speed at what seemed to be 100 yards distance from the right wing. Definitely not a bird. I watched as it paced the plane for approximately one minute. The plane headed northeast and the sphere then went east and I lost it. I looked again before entering my house and spotted it due east about 30 degrees above the horizon. It was still and looked like a bright star. I watched it for another minute and then went inside.
