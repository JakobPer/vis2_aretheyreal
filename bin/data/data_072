On Friday, September 9th, at approx 8:00 pm, my seven year old son and I were driving back to Portland,Oregon from Vancouver,Wa. When we were coming off I5 on to the 405 he said ""Dad what are those?"". I looked over downtown and there were seven objects, fairly large.  There was another off in the distance, much larger over the hill. I told him they were probably planes or helicopters. He then said ""look there is another down by the river"".  I looked down towards the St Johns bridge and there was one down there as well.  They all had a light in the middle and a blue and white light rotating around the circumference. I say circumference because we drove right under one on the 405 and it was approx 500 to 1000 feet up.  It was round, and large.  Other people were looking because I looked at the car next to us and they were looking up also. My son said ""Dad we need to call Rxxx Lxxxxxxx and Gxxxxx Nxxxx."" LOL Any way, we came home and told my wife and then I started to look on YouTube to see if anyone saw what we did, there was one video a few hours later.  I continued to look on YouTube every few days.  Just the other day I found a new video on YouTube and I think it is what we saw. The video is apparently older, but it is taken from he St Johns bridge and looks very similar to what we saw. The video was taken during the day, we saw ours right at dusk. But they are similar. Any how, just thought you might be interested.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

She began calling me to come see something in the sky that she had no idea as to what it could be. The sky was crystal clear with a full compliment of stars. At approximately 21:15 hrs. I stepped onto the terrace,of which we had a 180 degree unobstructed view of the sky and a eastern,western and southern view of the Atlantic Ocean. I observed a cylindrical or disk shaped object with a bright yellow to orange color radiating above and below the full length of the object. It appeared to be travelling at a speed greater than a passenger jet,from west to east. I raised my I-4 cell phone to get a picture of the object,but I was afraid of losing sight of the object and refraind from doing so. The object disappeared into the eastern sky.. As my wife and I continued watching the skies,we never thought we would ever see such a sight again. To our amazement,at approximately 21:30 hrs. the same or another identical object appeared from the northwest sky, continuing south and then turning towards the east. It appeared to be travelling at the same rate of speed. We observed it until it disappeared into the eastern sky. My wife received a phone call and exited the terrace and answered the call in the bedroom. I remained on the terrace in awe of what we had just witnessed. I continued to watch the sky and at approximately 21:50 hrs. for the third time I observed another or same object travelling from the northern sky heading south and turning towards the east. When it was almost directly in front of where I was standing on the terrace observing this object in the distance,the object made a sudden stop or right turn to the south. It then proceeded to travel upward into the sky in a steep climb, at a tremendous rate of speed.

We had no electricity through out the county what so ever.  My wife and kids were on the lap tops. I was just sitting there with them but we had the radio on to see when we can here the electricity would come back on. At 10:00 pm I decided to go outside to see if any of the surrounding housing areas lights had come out. It was very hot as well. I walked in the middle of the culdisak and looked down the street into the valley. As I was looking I glanced up into the sky. I seen an object that was really bright.  I mean real bright! It was green, white, and red bright lights all around it. It's shape was kind of a boomerang or something like that.  The only thing though again it was real bright. As I kept looking at it it was not moving. After about 20 seconds of still looking at it I sai! d to myself that is a UFO. I then seen it move from one area where I will call point A to another point where I will call point B It would go back and forth for around 3 different times to point A and B. It would stop at each location. I say it was around 15,000 ft in the sky. I base that on because an airplane is around 30,000 ft.  The movement to both points were not very fast it seemed like it was cruising. After 3 min or so I was still amazed.  I then ran to my neighbors house accross the street and banged on his door to see if he can comeout and witness what I was looking at. His house was the only one with generator on. But he did not answer.  The object was stil there just going back and forth. I then called a friend named Melinda to run outside of her house so she can see it. I called Melinda because she lived close by. But no Answer. I then called a friend of mine named Jarvis. He lives in South San Diego. He answered and I told him to run outside his house to see if ! he can see the object. He could not see it. I guess he was too! far sou th. After I got off the cell with him I then ran back into my house and yelled to my wife and kids to run outside.They ran outside and I told them to look into the sky. They all looked up and said what is that. I told them this is crazy but this is a UFO an Unidentified flying object! They looked at it and just kept looking at it. I was so excited of seeing it I do not remember how it left. I was tripping out! I will never forget how it looked. Bright green, white, and red lights all over. It was the size of maybe a 727. I also remember it took a dip into the valley and shot back up. Well after my kids and wife looked at it I then went to my front yard and called a few friends to tell them what I saw. They just were listening and asking me questions. After I got off the phone with them I then went back into the house and yelled not to loud but ""I wish I would have recordeed that"".

It was not a commercial jet or plane because those lights blink and this one did not. It seemed to enter the cloud and thus become blocked from our view.

After seeing orb-like orange lights along the coast and then in the Carolina Forest area, I experienced what appeared to be two extremely bright white lights (I've described them as looking like the headlights on a car) hovering silently just above a two-story house, over the driveway.

It was an especially windy morning and the sun was just rising. About the camera: The camera self-adjusts to color from night to day.  The camera is a Sony PTZ but I couldn’t zoom in any farther as the camera is in a fixed location; I can only zoom to the center of that view.  The camera is facing east.  I can only save whole minutes of video to the Lorex HD/system.  Sorry for the long wait before it actually starts. The UFO’s seem to be coming in straight towards the camera, which is facing east, and also recede in the same direction from whence it/they came.  From the video it seems that first there is one UFO and then another just pops into view at 06:01:52. There may be more than 2 objects.  It’s really difficult to tell as the wind keeps blowing the tree branches which partly obscure the view towards the end.  I don’t believe these objects to be planets. So, basically UFO appears from the east and then another UFO slowly comes into the view just to the left of the first one.  Then the first one is not really visible when a UFO suddenly pops into view again just to the left of the second one.  Then possibly the first and second one merges.  It's hard to tell if one is just behind the other or if it has merged with it instead or left altogether.  All then seem to come a bit closer before finally receding in the same direction that it/they came from. There is an airport, Ontario International (ONT), in nearby Ontario but the flight airways are more to the right/south coming in over Riverside.  Also, airplanes don't stay in one place as these objects did.  While helicopters can hover in place these objects do not fit the shape and made no sound.  At any rate I didn't notice any red or green lights that aircraft are required to have. I'm above average intelligence and not prone to making things up.  The video is 128mb avi file format.",2012-01-12T00:00:00,34.0608,-117.3936

"Incredibly bright, pulsating red and white lights in tandem",Lamartine,WI,2011-12-16T18:13:00,flash,6 Minutes,"Occurred : 12/16/2011 18:13  (Entered as : 12/16/2011 18:13) Reported: 12/26/2011 12:32:43 PM 12:32 Posted: 1/12/2012 Location: Lamartine, WI Shape: Flash Duration:6 Minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86101.html,"Incredibly bright, pulsating red and white lights in tandem I've submitted this same thing to MUFON on the night it happened but was on this site today and saw others in the approximate area who saw strange things in the sky this night so I thought I'd put it on here too: My and my daughter's sighting is approximately 13 minutes after the one seen in Berlin, WI, and about 28 minutes after the one in Coloma, WI. From my calculations, this would mean the craft was headed in a southeasterly direction and then headed northeast after our sighting. The only thing I would like to change from my original MUFON report of several days ago is that my daughter insists she saw beams of light shooting down from the craft(s), when she says in my report that ""they're taking pictures."" I was so stunned by the brightness of the flashes that I may have missed this. Driving north-northwest to Fond du Lac, WI, from Waupun, on US 151, roughly halfway between the two cities, closer to Lamartine. It was dark at 6:13 pm when I noticed to my left this incredibly bright, pulsating red light, followed a moment later by an equally bright white light. It was so stunning, I said to my daughter, sitting beside me, ""What the heck is that?"" I would estimate these lights to be a few miles away, probably 30 degrees off the horizon. My daughter said, ""Maybe it's a plane,"" and we kept driving. These did not appear to be standard aircraft lighting, with a steady blinking or steady white or red lights, anti-collision type lights. I couldn't stop looking at them! The light would blink fast red, then fast white off to the red's left (my right), and then there would be a moment of blackness from the night. From what I know about aircraft, there are supposed to be steady ""on"" lights, which there was nothing of. No green light on the wingtip, for instance, and this object wasn't near enough an airport to be landing with those lights: If another pilot had seen them, he/she would have been blinded, I'm sure of it. My initial thought was these lights were coming towards us, heading southeast, but as I watched them flashing, I thought maybe it's standing still. It didn't look like any lights I'd seen on aircraft before. ""That's no plane,"" I said. The red lights would pulsate very fast...then a second later, the white, almost like they were communicating with each other. What was even more amazing was the size of this. At the distance I think we were seeing these lights, the distance between the red and white lights was very wide, wider than an aircraft wing would have been at that distance (about 3-4 miles, estimated). The red light appeared to be a little above the white, as if it were on top of the craft, and the white light off to the right of the craft, as on a wing (from my perspective). I'd estimate that they were a penny-width apart, when you hold your fingers out at arm's length. If it were two different aircraft, they were flying in perfect formation, but I got the feeling it w! as one craft and it was huge. As we tried to make sense of the lights in the sky, the object appeared to change course and was now headed back the way it came: Not moving/banking like an ordinary aircraft but rather just reversing course and the bright, pulsing lights moved farther away. I pulled over and we watched the lights for several moments on the side of the highway. I tried to get a picture of it but my cell phone didn't take a great photo of it. It was after my attempt to take a photo that the lights appeared to now move in a northeasterly direction, going just north of Fond du Lac, banking a little. We followed them until our vision was obscured by trees in Lamartine. The lights were approximately 3-5 miles away, I'm sure, but as bright as a camera flash. In fact, my daughter kept repeating, ""They're taking pictures! They're taking pictures!"" I don't know if they were or not, but that is the intensity of the lights, a camera flash, where it momentarily blinds the eye. I distinctly remember trying to see if the lights projected downward, like it was scanning the ground, but could see nothing like that. Even the red flashing light was intense. We had a clear, unobstructed view of these lights for several minutes before the trees obscured our view, bu! t we did see them for a time afterward, until they faded from view. Entire sighting lasted from 6:13 pm until 6:19 pm. (Central Standard Time). Estimated time watching these lights, about 6 minutes. The pulsating never varied, always the red for one second, then the white for a second, and these were exactly equal in time pulsing, then nothing, black. Then back again, and always the same very wide distance apart, a bit on an angle. At times we thought it was one craft, and other times we thought they could be two. It looked like the aircraft banked at one moment before we lost sight of it behind the trees. When we came to the other side of the stand of trees, the lights were very faint and far away. It seemed in no great hurry, and was headed in the direction of Oshkosh/Appleton, over Lake Winnebago. We were not scared or concerned, just amazed at these pulsating lights. My daughter and I haven't spoken of it since. If it was a very large aircraft, I would be happy to know it.  As it is, I'm not sure what we saw but it was definitely something unusual.  This is the third report I'm filing with MUFON in the past 2 1/2 years. We're seeing some interesting things in this area.",2012-01-12T00:00:00,,

On 11/16/2001 I went out to do an ATM transaction. But because of lost card number I ignored going bank.  In this time I looked sky like ever (I like astronomy and observing sky) and see and I saw a big object with orange light in sky. I have some information about sky. That was not like moon so other objects like stars, planets, handmade balloons, aircraft and so helicopter (I will describe that why).   First time I watch it I guess it’s a tower end light (light for prevent aircraft accident) but I know there good there was not any tower. So its altitude was very higher than any tower I could imagine.  Because I was not ready to visit a UFO more than minute I just checking that.  Then I decided to take a picture. I took one picture (setting mobile for photography takes time).  After one picture I decided to set my phone camera fo! r take video. I started my video camera and look at its screen and so I didn’t see anything. (Later when I was watching my video I saw object was in video for some seconds with changing its lights. then object disappeared.  I returned home and opened my pc, because of fogy sky I couldn’t see any space object like stars and others, so I had to use  a good astronomy software named TheSky 6 when is see that’s screen I afraid because, software was showing that in north east of me was not any planet or moon. Jupiter and Uranus was in west of me. So magnitude of Jupiter was about 1/10 of object that I observed. It was not airplane because of it was in fix position for minutes. It was not helicopter because of no sound in quit night. It was not moon because of position so its size was about 1/5 of moon and moon didn’t rise yet. It was not handmade balloon because no (fire flicker) I know balloons. So when I watch video I saw color changing before disappear (orange to white and vice! versa. My higher option is a UFO.

This location is one bay east of the KY State Park Marina on the east side bank before you enter the bay.  The shore line faces south.

Out of the corner of my eye I noticed and object moving at a fairly fast pace at about 11AM to me at approximately a 60 degree angle above me.  It was shaped like a football – round in shape and brown in color.  No lights or other distinguishing marks.  It was moving in a South to North path.  I observed the object for about 30 seconds from the 11 PM position to about the 2PM position where it disappeared beyond the tree line.  I first though it was a bird just hovering with its wings tucked in but it was too round and the bird would need to have extended its wings to fly or hover.  Most birds do not move in such a straight line and tend to circle.  I thought maybe a balloon or something similar but it was moving in the wrong direction for the wind and was moving way too fast for the wind that was there.  I know sometimes that wind shear is higher at higher elevations but the clouds were also not moving in ! the wind that is there.  The object was below the cloud cover and close enough to see it was not a recognizable airplane or similar.  There was no noise from it.

At about mile marker 64 on I-95 South, an extremely bright burst of white lights appeared then disappeared within a second.  It appeared to be relatively close and positioned about 2 o'clock from my direction.  The light burst was extremely bright and actually burned into my eye's like looking at the Sun then closing your eye's and you can still see it.  Anyhow, it was a circle of small lights that instantly shot super bright laser type lights to the center forming a small center light burst then black.  I thought maybe it was a military flare, but there was zero heat up, zero cool down and no residual smoke.  Just instant on then off burst of light. It looked like the Star Wars type hyperspace special effects, except much shorter (instant).  About 5 minutes later, it appeared again at about 3 o'clock (position) then one last time just slightly behind me.  There is a miltita! ry proving ground about 20-30 south where I saw this.

Me and my boyfriend were driving to dinner at about 8 at night when I looked out the passenger window and noticed three hovering lights in a loosely formed triangle in the sky. We were both very interested because not only did these objects hover, but they had lights that were like nothing I've seen on any sort of aircraft, evening landing lights for an airplane - which could have been possible being it's common to see commercial airplanes low with landing lights on. These lights were nothing like that. The first and largest (or perhaps closest to us) was hovering in place and we were able to see a definite shape that was cigar-like, but also slightly diamond shaped. It had lights blinking in a row, sort of like a carnival ride, which appeared to be going all the way around the object. The lights were a yellowish/whitish tint. It is hard to say how high the object was because we didn't know the size, but it seemed to be around the same level as commercial airplanes were flying at, and the city we were in is about 25 minutes from the airport, so that is a reference. The second was a little lower than the first and it was hard to see an actual shape - that one just appeared to be a light in the sky, also hovering. It's light(s) were the same yellow/white tint. The third was smaller, and hovered for maybe a few moments. It had more of a red light, and you could see a shape, which was also cigar-like. As we were driving, trees blocked our view for a few moments and when we could see them again, the third and smallest one had started to head north away from the others. We were both in awe of what we were seeing. The road we were on is a very busy road, so we were wondering if anyone else was seeing what we were. Then we discussed what it could be, but nothing came to us, as we'd never seen aircraft hover in the same spot before. We dismissed all the other possible explanations because this fit none of the descriptions. We watched the lights until we couldn't see them any more, since we were driving away from them. We would have liked to watch/video tape, but we had reservations for dinner, and we didn't want to be late. So we left the restaurant about an hour later, so around 9:30. We were driving on a freeway this time and again, we saw a hovering light, in about the same area we saw the triangular formation. We both assumed it was the largest one we'd seen earlier, because we saw the object itself, dark against the night sky, still cigar shaped, only it's lights were now just on top, a white one and a red one and they flashed, two to the white, one to the red. As we were driving, we started to pass the object, so it was just hovering, not moving at all, which is one of the strangest things I have ever seen. About 20 minutes later, we were on the first road that we originally saw the hovering crafts. From this angle, we couldn't see it - it had moved about 2 miles southwest (estimated) from where we originally saw it. Suddenly, and to both of our surprise, we saw intense flashes in the sky.  Conveniently enough, trees skewed our full view.  The light looked white when it lit up the sky, but the source, from the slightest glance I saw seemed a soft red or yellow-orange, like of a star that isn't quite as hot as say a white one. That whole half of the sky lit up, and it came roughly from the direction the craft had been seen when we were driving on the freeway. To us, it looked like a grand finale of fireworks, only we heard no noise (which considering how close we would have had to be for those to be explained as fireworks, one would think there would be noise), we didn't know of any fireworks that could have happened that evening being it would be a really random place to have fir! eworks. Also, we didn't see any other fireworks around. My boyfriend sped up to see if we could get around the trees before the flashes stopped, but they lasted only about 20 seconds. I cannot say what it is that we saw. Our logical explanations are just not able to make sense of the flashing lights we saw.  Both of us were very startled - so, we drove to this spot a few blocks away where you can get a really good view of the rest of the city and some of the next city over. We stopped and looked across the sky and once again we saw the craft, now moving slowly rather that hovering. It was moving at about the speed of a helicopter, but it was in no one acting like one. It was steady, parallel to the ground and you could see it's shape against the sky - sort of cigar-shaped. I'd say it was about 5 miles, at least, from us at that time. It moved north west and we watched until it disappeared over the horizon. Both of us were in awe and baffled at what we witnessed that night. We still have no logical explanation of what we saw.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,44.6307,-93.30340000000001

Second light continued on same direction then made a slight and constant change in direction to the NE by E, then stopped and held position for about 1 minute, then faded. Brief description of event:  I was walking inside my house past the sliding kitchen door.  I happened to look outside and notice two bright orange lights moving high in the sky.  I was very interested because: 1) they were bright orange lights 2) they were in a position in the sky not at all typical for aircraft in the area and they were traveling in a direction not at all typical for aircraft in Seattle airspace. These were traveling east, which is across the typical flight patterns for aircraft at all altitudes (which are almost all N-S patterns). I opened the screen door and went out onto the deck and I waited, listened and focused on the lights as they got closer. My first reaction was maybe low altitude satellites, then I thought maybe air planes at great distance (explaining why I couldn’t see any strobes yet) then I thought maybe military or helicopter because of the flight path and flight characteristics (the lights slightly changed course). Then when one light suddenly stopped and faded away my t! houghts changed instantly and all thoughts went to unexplained lights. The second light continued east and then stopped in the sky and appeared to remained stationary. I took two pictures with my blackberry (they are not very good) while I called continuously to my wife. The light remained stationary long enough for me to enter my house on three different occasions to call to my wife. It faded right as she came outside – she did not see any lights. That’s the event. I am very curious now about what I saw. Please keep my email address and name private and confidential. Thank you.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,47.477841722972975,-122.15758902027028

I am writing to report sightings of strange lights in the skies over a period of 3 weeks, beginning in early November. I first noticed a strange red light in the sky fairly low on the horizon at around midnight one evening and noticed that it was not stationary, but moved in circles, straight lines vertically and horizontally.  The object appears reddish in color predominately, but changes to blue periodically and back to red. I was curious, but did not act on this information until late Nov 18, or early morning Nov 19, when I finally reported it to the dispatcher at the county sheriff's office.  She told me she would send a deputy out to investigate, but I have not heard anything on it. On or about Nov 21, I told a neighbor of the incidents and she and I watched the object together for a half hour or more.  The next evening, my neighbor and I saw two of the objects, and later that evening (early morning Nov 22) I observed an object approximately 90 degrees to the west of the first object I observed. Now on Nov 23, at approximately 8pm central time, I observed the object once again and notified my neighbor to come and participate. What we discovered over a period of approximately 30 minutes of observation was at least eight objects of the same apparent design in different areas of the horizon. Some of the objects are faint and other are much brighter, but with them all a person can see what we deem a tail below the main object, and all the objects change color  occasionally to blue and back to red. Thus far, I have observed the objects in the North, at a medium altitude judging by eye, in the East, Southeast, West and North. There are at any one time as many as 8 objects in the sky at any given time. They are not planes, towers or balloons.  No balloon would be more or less stationary for three weeks running.  Much too high for towers and of course planes are not stationary either. At times the objects appear to make a loop or two in the sky and then become semi stationary again, only to do it again in a few minutes.  At other times the move a fair distance either vertically or horizontally and back to semi stationary. This is very curious and I would like to know what the objects are and who is responsible for them being in the night skies. I am not familiar with holograms, but as far as I know, this is not a rational explanation any more than a plane, tower or star. Any other reports of a similar nature?  Curious in Texas.

At approximately 11:10PM CDT, on Tuesday 11/1/11, I was working at a rural location in the Texas Hill Country, on a high hilltop near a location off of FM 1323 & Big Sandy Rd. near Round Mountain, TX.  approximately 6-7 miles West of Hwy. 281.  The sky was clear, around 60 degrees and a 10-15 mph wind. As I was leaving the location, I had placed some equipment in my truck and noticed a very large, bright white light to my South, towards Johnson City. It did not compare with Venus, Saturn, or any other planetary object.  It resembled aircraft landing lights, but 5-6 times larger, and about 30 degrees above the horizon, but appeared to be maybe only 1-2 miles from me.  It was the size of a dime at arms length.  It had the flickering illusion you see with aircraft on approach, but it wasn’t far enough away for that. From this location, there are absolutely no airports, hospitals, etc to allow for low aircraft, and I have never seen a light like this.  I watched it for about 15 seconds, and it didn’t appear to be moving.  I foolishly turned my back on it to lock a gate to the location I was leaving, and in that 5-6 seconds, when I turned back around it was simply gone.  I had a wide open view of sky, and no where for it to have gone.  It had either just “turned off”, went quickly up or down, or zoomed off while I wasn’t looking.  The sky was empty of any aircraft what so ever.  Only stars and a ¼ moon setting about 60 degrees to the right (West). While I do not consider this a major or impressive sighting, only a very strange light, what does bother me is how it left me feeling.  I am usually very much wanting to look for phenomenon such as this when out in the country away from the city lights.   I have seen my share of very unexplainable things in my years, but this event left me feeling very uneasy and wanting to get out of the area immediately.  This is very unusual behavior for me.  Anyway, I simply wanted to make report of it in case anyone else saw it and reported it too.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,30.4104,-98.2836

While getting back in the car I noticed a bright blue light in the sky and called my brothers attention to it.  We both saw it and noticed it was like nothing we had ever seen before both in Color, Composition, and flight characteristics.  We then decided to follow the craft while recording it on my cell-phone.   We followed the craft into a neighborhood near the end of the community when we briefly lost it behind some houses.  I then decided to try and drive around the back to catch the craft and when back on the main road (Lantana Trail) the craft came back into view.  It was here at the intersection of Lantana Trail and Justin Road 407 where we captured some of the best footage of the craft wild maneuvers.

As that group of 3-4 lights approached, the formation widened, and out of the same spot on the horizon, three to four more lights appeared, stacked like the others (looking like a radio tower).  I pulled the car over, assuming these were formations of military helicopters.  There were two other witnesses in the car. I stepped out of the car as the first group passed over head.  I was surprised that the speed was faster than helicopters would be traveling, more the speed of jet aircraft.  I am a private pilot, so have a good sense of speed and altitude.  The first group appeared to be at a higher altitude as they passed overhead than I presumed, when I originally got out of the car.  I would guess at 8,000 to 12,000 ft above the ground. As the first formation passed over head, the reddish color was now more of an orange color.  There was no sound, which I found to be odd.  The second group passed over about 10 seconds later.  Same course and speed as the first.  Then I noticed a third group coming up from the horizon, same spot.  I then got back in the car, drove about a half block north, turned west on the next street and pulled over to see if more were coming.  There were, no longer however in a formation (as the first three groups were).  Now they were coming in line, about 5-7 second separation.  I lost count of how many were passing over head in single file.  I am guessing we saw an additional 8-12 objects pass over head.  All at the same speed, same separation, course and same altitude. I noticed that the color changed from the initial view just above the horizon being reddish, to more orange as they approached  over head.   As they passed by, looking back the ESE, they were still orange, but a much dimmer and well defined spec of light.  As the approached, the red was as bright as a radio tower light, as they got closer, and over head, as bright, but an orange color. The night sky was clear at the time, and visibility of the stars was excellent.  There were no other lights on these aircraft, no red/green navigation lights or strobe lights, which I thought was odd, as even if these were military aircraft, they would typically have standard aircraft lighting on while flying in domestic US airspace.",2012-01-12T00:00:00,43.67300000000001,-92.9592

I have never reported this before but always looked for pictures similar and never have found.  I along with my mother, who passed away 1998, saw an odd black shape,  during a bright mostly clear day about 5 pm 1976, at least our vision of the item was not obstructed by clouds etc.   We both saw the shape defined below at a lower altitude then raise directly overhead until object was out of site.  The item appeared black in color.  the center of the object was shaped similar to a cigar HOWEVER there were two intersecting black lines.  Best way to describe for shape description.  Draw a 2 inch cigar shape..  Then move in 1/2 inch from each side and center a 1 inch cigar shape crossing he center, or may I say perpendicular to the center line.  I use the 2 inch description because that is the size it appeared in the sky.  I estimate this item to have been about 2000 feet up (I base this altitude estimate on my current perception of my past memory from 1976 and my! skydiving experiences in the mid 90's when I was fairly good at estimating height of clouds).

I had been doing the sound for all the bands and was leaving the park after my evening’s work. I turned on to route 13 going south, from the facility. It was a bright moon lit night.  As I drove, I looked up to see the moon and was surprised to see3 orange lights that appeared to be large but from a great distance.  The three lights were in a perfect (upside down) triangle. At first I thought that something could have been reflecting off the clouds, but quickly realized there were no clouds. At that point I didn’t know if the lights were from one object or separate. I pulled over and stopped my vehicle. Looking up toward the South East sky I noticed that the lights were moving in perfect unison toward the west..very slowly.  It was then that I realized I was witnessing something very unusual.  As I looked at each light I noticed that they were each more or less cylindrical but coming almost to a blunt end point at each end, and the ends appeared to shimmer.  Each light was distinctly orange with a tinge of yellow through it.  Again I emphasize that these lights formed a perfect inverted triangle, and I would guess that at the distance they were away, they could have be 20 to 50 miles apart. As I watched, the lights, again in unison...stopped moving and were still for a good 30 seconds (my best guess).  Then one by one each light turned (separately) and as best as I could tell, faded very quickly from view which leads me to believe they were actually separate objects moving away from my sight at a great speed, as each of them was quite slow in their turn, but faded very quickly into nothing.  They didn’t just disappear, they faded very quickly... and again, one after the other but still maintaining the formation mentioned above. I didn’t realized how bright they had been until they were gone, because when they disappeared it was as though the sky reappeared into a bright moon lit and cloudless sky, from being in the background of these lights. I immediately told my wife and a visiting friend about it when I arrived home (about 5 miles away) and the next day, I mentioned it to my partner at the Blue Grass festival and he said he saw them too but put it off to weather balloons or “Chinese Lanterns”...but this is impossible as per my description above.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,,

At first, I (we) thought that it was someone shining some very large spotlights into the sky.  However, I soon realized that this could not be possible because 1) the source and angle would mean that the lights would have to emminate from our current seated position 2) there was no light trail like you would normally see from a large industrial spotlight used to promote a business 3) the more I looked the more it was apparent that the light source was coming from above the clouds and shining through them, not up to them.  Suddenly the two lights, which appeared to be about50 yards apart, began to move erratically.  They zigged and zagged, moved in circular and linear motions, and then one of the lights disappeared, only to reappear off in the distance, but remained about the same size.

I pulled off of Snydersville exit to get gas, and several people were observing the lights. At this time the light moved again.  I only observed the front one move, slightly to the south then quickly to the north, and then stop, and to my knowledge there are no (unclassified) aircraft that can do that, or make the maneuvers that it made.  What was the most unsettling and what took my attention the most is the lack of any sound coming from the craft. I was coming from Stroudsburg Pa when I first noticed these lights, and thought them to be airplanes or helicopters.  As I drove about 4 to 6 miles closer, I realized they were not. There were other craft in the sky, but I was able to correctly identify all of them as planes except for the 3 strange lights.",2012-01-12T00:00:00,,

I was just outside (west) of High Point, NC, during Christmas day/evening of 1982 at my Grandparents farm.  My parents and I arrived a day earlier than normal for the holidays due to a death in the family just before Christmas.  The funeral visitation was that evening but I elected to stay at the farm for various reasons. It was an unusually warm night for this time of the year and that area.  I decided to take a walk across a hill adjacent and above my Grandparents house and walk my uncle’s dog.  I took notice that there were a lot of  jetliners on approach to KGSO airport passing over the farm from South to North before banking right base to runway 5 at GSO after. Being an avid aircraft/aviation enthusiast, I pretty much was able to identify that there were 737-100/200, 727-100/200, and DC-9 jetliners passing over by the landing configuration of each type as well as there being enough residual light to actually see the bottom of each aircraft clearly.  The sequence of separation of the aircraft ranged approximately 3 to 5 minutes at the height of an arrival push of scheduled flights.  I paid only limited attention to the flights except when they were directly overhead. At one point, I was facing South seeing the airliners coming at me head on. It was at this point that I saw something extremely unusual occur.  I saw two jetliners approaching out of the South and one passed over with another behind it.  The next one appeared to be a DC-9 with its landing lights set far apart near it’s wing tips.  I took one glance and then lowered my head to pay attention to my uncle’s dog. I then looked back up to see why the jet had not passed over (it appeared closer due to the wider separation of the landing lights) and then realized something was off as the jetliner had not passed yet and it appeared to be moving either very slowly or it was larger than I fight thought (larger than a DC-9? GSO normally didn’t service DC-10’s or larger aircraft). I kept my eye on this jet puzzled why it was so slow to approach when suddenly the right landing light(to the left from my perspective) appeared to drop as if the jet was banking very steeply to the right going into a full roll to inverted flight. My first thought was that this jet was in serious trouble and I was about to witness a crash. But the right ""landing light"" accelerated completely around until it was below the left light and then suddenly accelerated up at a 45 degree angle and sped away until it disappeared (quickly faded away).  It was then I realized that the left ""landing light"" was stationary(not rolling or connected to the right light) and that the right side light had actually circled the left light before accelerating up and away(Westward).  I also then realized that the other light was still moving towards me.   I  ran quickly towards my uncle and aunt’s house about 120 yards away.  As I reached the house, the other light reached me and that light turned out to! be the nose strut light of a 727.  The aircraft appeared as if there was nothing wrong with it and it continued on towards GSO making no sudden changes in turn rate. direction, or altitude.  I did not see any other similar objects in the area that evening or any subsequent evenings after that. Characteristics of the object were that it was the same intensity and color as the lights of the jetliner. and it made no sound.  From my perspective, it appeared to be flying in formation to the right of the jet and appeared to have the same forward speed as the jet prior to the ""barrel roll"" and 45 degree climb to the West before disappearing.",2012-03-13T00:00:00,35.97490402930403,-80.01636923076924

I could not understand the way, the television was still on, the door didn't  slam to turn the light switch off.  I remain lying down watching the television.

My vision at the window was off 180 degrees.  On the top right I saw six lights very small  but very bright.  Five of them where in a circle the other one was inside the circle, but not  in middle, it was near the bottom on the left side.  I immidiately start to count, within  five second the outher five lights just went off.

Initially, I watched the objects for about 4-5 minutes.  Because the objects did not move and were very bright, relative to the stars in the sky, I took immediate notice.  I walked away from my observation point, my walk-in closet window, to determine if it was possible to observe event from another location.  To convince ""myself"" that something was really happening, I tried to observe the strange objects from other windows, my 1st level front porch, and from my 2nd level rear porch balcony. I was only able to observe the objects for a short period of time (5min.) from one alternate vantage point, my rear condo balcony.  Next, I returned to my! initial observation location, walk-in closet window, to notice that the two bright stars have moved lower in the sky, and to the horizon. The objects maintained the same relative displacement to each other.  I watched the objects for about 10min.  To my naked eye, the objects are small.  Also, I am not viewing the objects with binoculars or similar optic devices.  Next, I remained cog nascent of this event for about 30 minutes.

We had packed a picnic basket and planned to spend the afternoon at LBL and stay to watch the fireworks over the lake later that evening. It was a beautiful, sunny day with hardly a cloud in the sky. My husband was driving and I was in the front passenger seat.  As I leaned back in my seat I noticed some jet vapor trails in the sky, and I visually followed the one that looked the freshest (winds had not yet dispersed the vapor).  I remember thinking to myself, ""That's a strange-looking jet.""  Then I realized that what I had first seen was not a jet but a UFo that was flying alongside the much-smaller triangular-shaped military jet. The UFO was white in color and I could not make out any surface features.  It was what one would describe as cigar-shaped I suppose, but to me the shape was more like a Luden's cough drop.  It was about three times the length of the jet and twice the width of the jet at its widest point.  I told my husband, ""There's a UFO! Pull over!""  He didn't see it and I kept losing sight of it because of all the trees.  Before he could find a spot to pull over, I saw the UFO suddenly take off at about a 45 degree angle at an incredibly high rate of speed.  It got smaller and smaller and disapperaed from my sight in about two-three seconds. I don't know what altitude the UFO and jet were flying at but when I held my hand up to compare it to the size of the UFO, the UFo was about the length of the fingernail on my pinky finger and about half the width of that fingernail. (I keep my nails trimmed short.)   That was over 26 years ago and I have never forgotten it. At that time I didn't know how or where to report a UFO sighting and, in fact, had never believed in UFo's until I saw one for myself.  So, why report it now, after all these years? Well> I was just watching a program about UFO's on television and I decided to do an internet search to see if anyone else had reported seeing the same UFO on that date.  (That's how I found this website.) I didn't find any other reports like mine but I hope that by telling my story, someone else who saw it will come forth.  I know for sure that at least one other person saw the UFo - the jet pilot, and I'm sure he would have reported it to his superiors.",2012-03-13T00:00:00,,

Two objects, one sphere and one cube were travelling in the sky and remained equidistant from each other as they moved through the air. one was red and one was black but can't remember which was coloured red and which was black.  The objects appeared to have the same diameter as each other. The objects were silent as they moved.  There were no aeroplanes overhead or cars moving on the road at the time.  There were no other people out on the street - as once we had seen these objects we looked around to see if anyone else had spotted them. I was with my boyfriend then (my husband now), we were both dating at the same university college between January 1983 and May 1983 only, which is why we can give an approximate date to the event, despite it being a long time ago. As the two objects were silent we first thought it must be a remote control device, however they travelled much too far and would have been out of range of any control device.  We then wondered if they were weather balloons -but a cube and a sphere are unusual shapes and they were not travelling very high in the sky.  They were not as high as an aeroplane.  Despite the sky being our reference point for size we do not think they were as high as where a helicopter would fly either. It was a clear, dry pleasant Spring day. We had gone for a walk at Cofton Park and walked back to the street. We were facing the road and opposite the shops/houses with our back to the park.  Behind us to our left was a pub and the car park was behind us.  We noticed the objects diagonally to the right (in the air) as they entered our vision.  The two objects moved from our left to our right.  Their speed remained constant, they stayed the same distant apart from each other as they flew.  They appeared to be a way over the houses opposite, travel above them and moving flew over the wooded Lickey Hills until they went further and further into the distance (almost travelling directly away from us at this point) until they went naturally out of sight over the hills and trees.  They stayed the same height above the ground at all times and were not linked or attached to each other. We both stood still watching the whole time, it was at least a good few minutes so we got a good look at the sphere and cube.  They did not appear to have any lights or windows, they moved steadily and did not 'whizz' by so we observed them continually and talked to each other as we did so. After they had disappeared we waited awhile - still no one was around.  We returned back to our university college (where our accommodation was) and told our friends this story.  We have since searched it on the internet and often relayed the story or chatted about it with each other.  It was a simple story and we have always agreed the details...two steady flying objects, one sphere and one cube - one plain red and the other plain black!

I am certain there are others who have had similar experiences, but don’t know how to go about finding them.  At any rate, here goes:   Back in about 1987 or 1988, I was staying at a friend’s house.  I was doing some work on their farm, southeast of Pittsburgh, PA.  I was sleeping on the couch, when I had a ""dream"" that was not a dream.  Let me elaborate:  I was startled awake somehow, and had the instantaneous impulse to get up and run outside, onto the porch.  When I did, I saw an enormous black triangle hovering above, and slightly to the right (South) of the house.  There were no discernible lights, as I recall, but there seemed to be dome-like shapes along the bottom of the thing.  (craft? Ship?)  I don’t know how long I stared at it, but I became aware that it appeared to be sucking up trees from the ground and levitating them up into it somehow.  I started crying. Suddenly there was a blonde female there with me, about 5’ 4"" tall, straight blonde hair, like in the ""Swedish Bikini Team"" commercials, dressed in either black or dark blue close fitting flight suit type uniform.  I don’t recall any kind of emblems or markings on the uniform.  { I will note here that at that time I had not heard of the Billy Meier case.  I have only learned of it recently.}  I did not, far as I remember, actually see her descend from the vehicle, she was just kind of suddenly there on the porch with me.  I immediately felt reassurance, and an overwhelming sense of peace and calm.  She told me that everything would be alright, that they were going to put the trees back when they were done, that everything would be as it had been before, and that there would be no sign that anything had happened.  I looked into her eyes, (deep blue or maybe green, like a lake) and I instantly felt as though we had known each other for a very long time, maybe forever.  I knew her name then, though I don’t know it now.  She put her hand on my shoulder, and, ""Bam.""  I was waking up on the couch again, startled.   I got up and ran outside, fully expecting to see a black triangle, but there was nothing in the sky except stars.  I stood there dumbfounded, thinking it must’ve been a dream, but it was no dream.  I know it wasn’t. I don’t know if she wiped my memory, and maybe it didn’t fully erase, (?) or if maybe I was allowed to remember only certain parts of the experience, or if I was supposed to believe that it was “just a dream.""  I really wish that she would return again, the connection I felt was so profoundly deep. I will add that the area where the farm was is not far from a high-security government installation, the US Bureau Of Mines, which I don’t believe for a minute is actually a coal mine.  They have 12’, double-row, barbed wire fences surrounding the place, which were in place as long ago as the early 1980s, long before the heightened state of security in the post 9/11 era.  I had a friend who used to work there as a janitor.  A few of us decided to go and see him one day, there was a sliding gate which was open, and on a whim we just decided to drive in and see if we could find him.  Within about a minute, we were being closely followed by a dark blue Chevy Caprice Classic.  We kept on driving.  Then a white Chevy Caprice Classic pulled out in front of us, cutting us off.  Three men wearing black suits, black ties, and black sunglasses approached the car, and demanded identification.  One of them said, “State your business here.”  We told them we were looking for our friend.! He said, “This is a restricted area.  You have no business here.  Turn your vehicle around and leave immediately.”  Needless to say, we were scared shitless.  We were teenagers out for a ride on an otherwise uneventful day.  We turned around, with the blue car now in front of us, and the white car following us closely.  They followed us like that after we got back on the main road, for about a mile or so.  It was very weird.  Were they the infamous “men in black?” And, if so, why were they there?  Why would they need such a high level of security at a “coal mine” anyway?  I knew from then on that there was something not right about that place, it gave me the creeps, and I always tried to avoid it if possible. This incident took place earlier than the other one, approximately 1985 or so.  There have been other strange occurrences throughout my life, but these two stand out in my memory. My ex wife, some friends, and I were laying on a trampoline in a yard, stargazing.  We all remarked about this bright red dot, wondering if it was Mars, or what, when all of a sudden, it just shot off to the north northeast, zip!  We all said “Whoa, what the hell was that?!”  This was just after the time of the Hale-Bopp Comet. I have more, but I will wait for a reply on this first.  Namaste. My ethnicity is Native American/Celtic/Anglo-Saxon. My religion is Pagan, though I was raised Methodist. I am currently in my mid forties, at the time of the first incident listed, I was in my twenties, at the time of the second incident I was a teenager, at the time of the third incident I was around thirty. The memory of the first incident, though incomplete, is extremely vivid. I have strange, ""Post Apocalyptic"" dreams sometimes. I have a strong fear of ""Greys"", the pictures people draw give me the willies, yet I have no memory of ever seeing one up close. I don't know if I believe Billy Meier or not. I don't know if I really believe everything that Bill Cooper wrote in ""Pale Horse,"" but a lot of it makes sense.  I know the US government lies.  They cannot be trusted. I know that something is going to happen on 21, December of this year, 2012, I just don’t know exactly what. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

But all in a matter of seconds, I realized that the object had no blinking red or colored lights.  Just a white light about five times the size of a star.   But judging on the speed, it couldn't of been a plane, but about helicopter speed.  Yet, no blinking lights, and no sound.

I was east bound on 16 mile rd at about Utica rd. when I first noticed them. Saw the first one as it moved out from behind the tree line on the south side of 16 mile. As I continued east more of them appeared. Perhaps as many as 7 by now. They were in a ragged line and as I drove on the front 4 took on a diamond like formation. By now I had gone several miles and chose to pull off on the shoulder to get a better look. I was now directly underneath them. I got out of my car for a better look. There was no sound or change in speed or direction. The entire line, still moving south to north slowly ascended at about a 45 degrees angle and eventually disappeared from view. I was surprised that I seemed to be the only one who pulled over to look. There was moderate traffic at the time and the seeming lack of interest by the other drivers was perplexing. Maybe, I thought, I had imagined the whole thing. At the next stoplight, much to my relief, I noticed the driver of the car next to me looking up in the sky in the direction of where I had seen these odd lights. He appeared to have the 'what the .... did I just see' look on his face. I asked my wife, who was in a separate car not far behind me if she had seen anything and she confirmed what I had seen. Selfridge ANG base is located north and east of where these lights were heading and they probably passed right over it. I am going to call the base today and see what they have to say.

The next night a single object rose from the East and traveled North East going directly over head 9:10pm.  At 9:20 pm three objects appeared from the South and then a third followed behind those by a minute from the South.  These objects also passed almost directly over head but more West and at about 3/4 of the way to horizon they spilt up and one headed West one North and one East.  During this time they changed color from a red to yellow/orange and the shape of circle to diamond but also a notch square on part of dimond shape and seemed to pulsate.  They also! went from large to small.  They faded out as they gained distance from us.  These objects were video filmed in HD by two different cameras on the second night these objects at no time made any sound.

Canton, MI / 9-11-2011 - First two U.F.O.s seen @ between 9:30 - 9:40 p.m. My 12 year old son and I were walking our dog around our neighborhood and when we almost reached the end of a court, I happened to look up into the south sky and noticed a very brilliant star-like light approaching( heading North ).  It looked slightly smaller than a golf ball from where we were standing.  I told my son to look at it.  We were both stunned and we both started saying ""Wow... what is that ?""  ""Oh... my god !"" etc.  I said, ""That is definitely a U.F.O.!"" and my son agreed, as we had never seen such a large orange/amber moving star-like object like this, in our lives !  It was coming toward us and I grabbed my son's arm and started backing up because it was very different, so I thought it could be dangerous.  We both just stared at it as it seemed to hover in one spot for a while, and then it began to arc ( take a curved path ) toward the East.  As we watched, it began to slowly shrink / dim out.  It looked as though it was getting smaller and less bright until it was just a dot without any light at all... and then it vanished.  We did not lose sight of it, it just disappeared !  Then my son yelled out that there was another one.  I looked around and seen the exact same thing, in the exact same area that we seen the first one.  Again...  It was slightly smaller than a golf ball, extremely bright... brilliant.  It looked like a huge orange/amber moving star, just like the first one did, and it also seemed to stop and hover, but this one moved slightly slower than the first one, but it did everything else the same. ( no blinking lights, did not blink, just brilliant ( flickering ? ) bright orange / amber light... like a huge star ).  It started to arc toward the East, and then started shrinking / dimming... until it looked like a dot in the sky, without any light... and then it! was gone.  Vanished !!!  Just like the first one did.  We waited to see if another one would appear, but did not see anything, so we ran home with our dog and told my husband what we had seen.  He asked us to show him where we had seen it ( all the while making fun of us ), so we ( my husband, son, dog and I )went back outside, and my husband noticed a star-like   ( slightly larger than a large star ) moving object, up in the sky, moving from West to East.  When he pointed it out to me, I told him it was the same color, but much, much smaller( farther away ).  My husband is a major skeptic ( engineer ), but he did take a picture with his cell phone camera ( yet to see the pic ).  He also did make the remark that the color was unusual, and he did not believe it was an airplane or a helicopter.  He also said he had never seen anything like it.  I told him that what he was seeing was sooooo much smaller( farther away ), that it was not as shocking as the first two that my son! and I had witnessed.  We ended up losing sight of this ""far a! way"" one , so my husband did not see it shrink / dim out and disappear, but at least he did see the orange / amber color of it.  We then took him to the exact spot that the first two appeared at.  We did not see them again. This was a very strange sighting that my son and I will never forget !!!

I work the night shift and I was on one of my patrols through the building and was on the 3rd floor. I was looking out of one of the windows around 04:38am overlooking the parking lot (looking east) and I noticed something in the southeast that at first I thought was a really bright star (bright white light) but it was about 2-3 times brighter/bigger than the brightest star I usually see at night and it caught my attention because it was very out of place and because it was right around horizon level, just above the tree line. Then I realized it was too bright to be a star and I focused on it for a minute or two. Then I noticed that it began to very slowly move in a steady pace to the left. That’s when I knew it wasn’t a star and that it was actually right there hovering over the ground. I estimate that it was perhaps maybe only half a mile away and I’m not good at measuring height but if I had to guess: anywhere between 200-600 feet above the ground but it was lower than any aircraft would normally be at. As it moved it went behind the trees. I was waiting for it to clear that set of trees and thought I would see it appear again on the other end but it never reappeared. It seemed the area it was hovering over was a bit to the south of the 108th & Giles intersection.  There is a Kum & Go gas station right there. And the area is pretty vacant as far as buildings is concerned (a view businesses in the area) but there are lots of large open fields between my building and that intersection (so not too many street lights). I kept watching for another 10min. or so hoping to see it reappear but nothing. So since it didn’t reappear it left me to believe that it had landed. I had to get back to my desk and I walked away from the window at about 04:50am. It didn’t seem to behave the way a helicopter would. Why would a helicopter be perfectly stationary for about 1-2min. plus I don’t know how long it was there and stationary before I had noticed it and if it were a helicopter that landed you would think it would have picked up the people to be airlifted to a hospital if it was a medical helicopter? I believe police choppers don’t land either but use their search lights to point out the suspect to ground units. There were no search lights coming from this thing, it was just a bright shiny light that was stationary and then started to move and then seemed to vanish for good. I probably wouldn’t have been able to hear any sound if there were any because our building is quite soundproof. The sky was clear and I did see the stars and if I remember correctly the moon was out too. There could be a conventional explanation for it I suppose but I don’t know what it was. It would be nice to find out if there were any helicopters flying that night over the city of La Vista.  P.S. Since I didn't actualize see the white light land on the ground because the trees blocked my view i'm not checking the box for ""The Object landed"" but it is still a possibility that it did.

It was not randomly drifting around in wind currents, but moving rapidly in straight lines, stopping, and changing direction. The object moved North for several hundred yards while continuously ascending. After a minute or so, it turned and moved several hundred yards back South, still ascending, until it was almost overhead.

I was driving home from work on Sugarloaf Parkway between Lawrenceville Hwy. and Five Forks Trickum at approximately 10:10pm.  I saw a craft flying lower than normal (not as low as the tree line, but not as high as a small plane would fly).  It seemed to be flying slower than would be possible for a plane, so it caught my attention.  Then I noticed it had two flashing white lights and then two flashing red lights in sort of a cross or square pattern.  I figured it was a small plane because of the flashing lights, but the fact that it was so low to the ground and was moving so slowly kept my attention.  I kept my eye on it as much as possible as I drove down the road and it seemed as if it changed directions (like it made a sharp right turn), so I thought it was either a helicopter or a trick of the eye as I was driving. I lost sight of it, but then when I arrived at my home (less than five minutes later) I saw the object again directly over me (which was odd since it was now flying in the complete opposite direction of when I last saw it).  I was out of the car, standing still and it was moving very slowly overhead.  We are directly beneath the regular flight path of jets heading toward Atlanta airport, so I'm very familiar with jet traffic in the area (which are much higher in the sky, but I can still hear them powering down as they prepare to land at Hartsfield, about 40 miles south).  At the same time the object was flying over me going north, a regular jet was flying overhead south toward Atlanta and I could clearly hear it.  In less than a minute the jet was completely gone and I could not hear it anymore, however, the lower object was still slowly flying over me, and that's when I realized that the lower object was not making any noise (so it was clearly not a plane or a helicopter). ! It made its way over the tree line and was gone. I stayed out waiting to see if it would come back for another hour, but it didn't.  However, a small plane did fly overhead (because I am near a small local airport) and I could clearly hear that it was a plane and it gave me a good reference for what altitude the small planes in the area fly.  The object I saw was definitely much lower than that plane.  I want to say that it was a box shape, but I'm only basing that on the fact that the two white lights and two red lights were at four corners, but they almost appeared to be on one flat side rather than around an object.  The two white lights flashed together and the two red lights flashed together.  So, I can't really say what shape it was, maybe flat, maybe square, maybe diamond shaped.  It seemed more like it was meandering along quietly rather than hovering.  Almost like it was making a sweep of the area.  I tried to take a video of it with my phone, but I only got it for a second, so you can't really see anything.  I do! n't know what it was, but it was definitely unusual and I would be interested if anyone else has seen anything similar in the area.

There is an alley behind our house [which in on an exact east/west alignment] and I moved to place telephone wires between me and the light so I could gauge any movement. It was moving, but very slowly. I ran into the house to get binoculars and tell my husband about the light. The binoculars I grabbed SUCK! And I also wear glasses. But he came out with the larger 10xm binoculars and our little Panasonic camera and a monopod. By the time he came out the light had moved from where I initially spotted it in the west. [It would have  been slightly north west from my standing location.] It was moving in a due east direction when I realized it was moving and when I came out from alerting my hubby, it had moved a good hand-span eastward. My husband was taking a 'movie' as well as look! ing through the better binoculars and then the light took a southward turn for a half hand-span and turned southwest at that point. There were spotty clouds in the south and southwest and Jupiter was visible in a large break in those clouds and the yellow light appeared to be maybe going higher, because it seemed to be getting smaller but it was heading for that clearing and Jupiter. My husband said it was appearing smaller because it was entering the cloud cover. He also said it looked like the light was in a plus-sign configuration and that it was more orange than yellow and had panels on it. It was NOT blinking. He thought it might be an 'air-ship'. I said, ""what the heck is an air-ship?"" and he indicated like a blimp or dirigible, but it was so high and then the plus-sign configuration would sort of cancel that out. Eventually Jupiter was swallowed by the clouds and so was the light. We came back inside and looked up NASA and the local news and nothing was indicated as ! anyone else seeing this light [as of today at 7:30 p.m. there ! has stil l been no posts or news of anyone else seeing this that we can find!] The ""movie"" he took is sort of  like one of those hand-held movies...sort of jerky and blurry at times, but you can clearly see the plus-sign shape and that the lights or panels or whatever are not blinking like an airplane. during the seemingly endlessly slow movement of this whatever it was, there were other airplanes in the sky, both heard and seen. We are within several miles of a small airfield and live near a hospital trauma center with a Lifeflight copter that frequently flies overhead. This light was not like anything I've ever seen before and it was so SLOW.

They weren't point towards the front at all like a chevron, just one super wide strip of aircraft, more like parenthesis shaped. When they were nearly overhead they were easy to see, and as they passed they became more and more difficult to see due to the NYC haze. Basically, they flew between my location on 35th Street in Astoria and LaGuardia Airport. I listened for engine noise and thought I could hear jets, but I'm near LaGuardia so of course I hear jets all the time.  It would be more remarkable if I didn't hear the faint sound of jet engines. No other aircraft in the sky that I could see from my position, certainly none displaying their lights. I could not tell how high they were flying due to the fact that they were unrecognizable aircraft with no lights, but they were not at high altitude. If I had to guess, I would say they were just high enough to clear the Manhattan skyline if they wanted to. One of them moved straight across North to South, while the one next to it appeared to bank towards the Southeast for a moment before returning to it's position along side the accompanying craft. They were not moving fast or sporadically.  They were obviously being piloted. Very rarely I see military planes flying in twos along this route, but these were not airplanes of any design I've ever seen--even given my overall love for the sky. 15 minutes ago. I'd say it took about five to eight minutes for them to move across my piece of sky. I would have run in to get my camera and take a picture or video, but it was very dark and the objects would be gone before I had a chance to take the video.

The back of the car was covered by what seemed like round rear parking lights, 6-10 in number.   We both stopped as we had never seen such a huge car.  Not even in movies!   Slowly the car began to raize vertically.  As we were transfixed with fear and disbelief, this car rose up to the jackaranda tree tops that lined along the road at the hotel.  In no time it began to move away from us towards buildings on the far side.  The acceleration was phenomenal and was passing through the trees that lined on the T junction to this road as if the trees were  not there.

What I saw about 500 yards (guessing) away was a vertical chrome cylinder shaped craft of some kind with rounded ends just perfectly still and silent in the air.  Nothing human made can do this.  It was a clear sunny day I just turned my eyes back to where I was going and kept walking and ignored it but after about 5 seconds then it made me curios and I looked again and it was still there I stopped walking and watched it for about 15 minutes.  It never moved just hung in the sky motionless the entire time.  Then a truck came up the road and I was forced to move when I looked back up about 30 seconds later after the truck passed it was gone.  I absolutely could not find it in the sky and looked for about 5 minutes then walked home.  I then went on my deck of my house and looked for it for about a half an hour and could not find it.  I have always wondered what it was and never talked to anyone about it. People just call you crazy for this stuff.  But I know what I saw and it still is in my mind today.

I have driven this route at least a 100 times prior. It was dark being winter at approximately 7:30 in the evening but everything was visible due to the snow laden landscape reflecting the quarter moon's light. I was on the last switchback of Berthoud Pass on route 40 just prior to the Mary Jane Ski resort near Winter Park. I was the only vehicle on the road at the time, traveling about 45-50 mph as there was some snow on the road. All of a sudden coming from behind my vehicle on the left side I noticed a black stealth-like seamless craft approximately 50’ above the pines that lined the road. I slowed down to about 30 mph to observe it and it continued to travel along side parallel with me at the same speed maintaining the same height. I rolled down my window and the only sound was that of my jeep. There was absolutely no sound coming from the craft.  Its shape is! what I describe as a “stingray” flatter and somewhat triangular with two short (about 6’) wide protruding wings that had a soft green glowing light emitting underneath. In the back, the “tail” was raised somewhat with 3 circular glowing yellowish balls of light about 20”each in diameter making a triangular pattern with one on top and two underneath.  There were no “windows” visible. The craft was about 20’ long x 25’ wide.  No “wind” was created from it causing any of the tree tops to move at all…it was just silently moving along opposite of me.  After this, I can not recall what happened as it seemed to have virtually disappeared and my memory does not serve me as to where it went from that point on.  My memory has always been pretty good. I have to be honest and wonder why I do have that brief gap as to where the craft went after we had been ""watching"" each other for at least 5 minutes on the road.   All I know is this was NOT a helicopter, nor any manmade craft I had seen ! before.  When I first saw it I was nervously frightened thinking ""this is for real and I am the only one on the road!"", then I became intrigued. I am and have been a drug free person and was of a very sound mind that evening!  I have told my story to many but never “officially reported it to any viable sources. I have the vision of the craft in my head and have sketched it out several times. I am still very curious about what I experienced and reflect upon that evening which makes me feel fortunate that I was able to witness it. 4 months ago I was diagnosed with breast cancer that metastasized to my bones. I suppose I would like to find answers or just share experiences with others who have had ""closer encounters"" similar to mine.",2012-03-13T00:00:00,,

I  moved under the covers of my bed and became frozen unable to move. They took me out of my bed holding my wrists, were leading me down the hallway.  I screamed for my dad . Telegraphically they told me that he couldn't hear me, I believe everyone on my block was put to sleep. The saucer was round with a see through dome from the inside out. As they flew me to the mother ship, I remember vividly sitting down and afraid to let them think that I could see them.  I was scared and pretended not to see them.  There was one alien that wanted to communicate , maybe the navigator,  The two others were standing in back of him, watching and did not try to communicate ever.  We went to a larger ship.  I remembered the docking port. How we docked and getting on board.  The ship was larger inside that it appeared outside.  I had  physical tests with samples taken.  I remember the mesh floor and a small box next to the bulkhead, and the round top of the saucer fitting into the hole under the mother ship. I remember how big the ship was inside. They told  me when the tests began and over and over telepathically that it all would be over soon so just wait a little bit longer.. I think they populate other worlds with what they take, and  use you later on for reproducing a hybrid, from the two realistic dream/experiences, because I saw one recognizable abductee on TV., she was complaining about her experience of being used. I saw gray figures with no facial features separating and cloning DNA into multiple vials. They let me see the space view of the Gulf of Mexico at night, with the city lights from Orleans to Tampa.  They showed me a  ray gun that used static electricity.  The end of it had a shape similar to  a  filament that hangs electric wires from telephone poles.

ONE OF THE STARS WAS LOCATED ABOVE THE FALL RIVER AREA & THE OTHER IN NORTH TIVERTON ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE EXPRESSWAY OR IN RELATION TO THE BRAGA BRIDGE ON THE RIGHT.  ALL OF A SUDDEN, AS I WAS PASSING THROUGH SOMERSET, THE STAR SPURTED DIRECTLY OVER TO THE NORTHERN SECTION OF FALL RIVER WITH ACCELERATION FASTER THAN ANY JET IV'E EVER SEEN.  NEXT I THOUGHT MAYBE I AM HALLUCINATING. TO MYSELF, I INDICATED, IF THE OBJECT SHOOTS BACK ACROSS THE HIGHWAY AGAIN ITS GOT TO BE A UFO!  SURE ENOUGH TWO OR THREE SECONDS LATER IT WENT TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE.  I WAS ABSOLUTELY OVERWHELMED! THEN I NOTICED THE SPACECRAFT, GLOWING LIKE A STAR, CONTINUE IN A NORTH EAST DIRECTION OVER THE BRAGA BRIDGE.   I PREPARED TO EXIT 14S HEADING FOR TIVERTON ON ROUTE 24, LOOKED UP AND COULD SEE THE UFO ON MY LEFT HEADING FOR TIVERTON.  THEN I NOTICED IT CROSS OVER ROUTE 24 TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY ON MY RIGHT, IT SEEM TO HOVER THERE FOR A SHORT TIME. AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES I COULD SEE THE CRAFT ON MY LEFT JUST BEFORE EXITING ROUTE 24 AND ON TO ROUTE 138 MAIN ROAD. UPON ENTERING THE PARKING LOT AT THE COACHMAN I DECIDED TO PARK AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE ENTRACE DUE TO THE EXTREMELY INCLEMENT WEATHER. I PARKED ABOUT 25 FEET FROM THE ENTRANCE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE RESTAURANT. I OPENED THE DOOR, LOOKED AT MY WATCH WHICH INDICATED 6:20 P.M. STEPT OUT AND LOOKED UP-TO MY ASTONISHMENT THERE BEFORE MY EYES AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 150 FEET IN THE SKY WAS THIS MAGNIFICENT GLOWING WHITE OVAL SHAPED OBJECT BRIGHTER THAN A FLUORESCENT LIGHT, IT HOVERED WITHOUT MOVING OR MAKING A SOUND. I HAD THIS TREMENDOUS FEELING OF BEING AT PEACE WITH MYSELF FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON. A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER MY GUEST DROVE INTO THE PARKING LOT. I RAN TO HER DOOR, OPENED IT AND TOLD HER TO LOOK UP AND SHE SAID, WHAT A BRIGHT STAR! I SAID, THIS IS A UFO.   WE WATCHED FOR ANOTHER MINUTE BUT BECAUSE IT WAS SO COLD OUTSIDE WE RAN TO THE ENTRANCE. OUR TABLE WAS SITUATED IN THE BACK OF THE DINING ROOM FACING THE BAY WITH A DIRECT VIEW OF BRISTOL, LOOKING SOUTHWEST I COULD SEE THE LIGHTED MT.  HOPE BRIDGE.  WE LOOKED UP AND WE COULD SEE THE OBJECT, IT WAS IN CONSTANT OBSERVATION THROUGHOUT THE DINER MEAL.  AT APPROXIMATELY 7:45 P.M. THE CRAFT MOVED ABOUT 100 FEET, BOTH OF US WITNESSED THIS ACTIVITY AND AND OF COURSE I STATED, DO YOU BELIEVE IN UFO'S NOW? SHE ANSWERED RATHER ABRUPTLY, I ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS WAS POSSIBLE BUT FIRMLY BELIEVE NOW.   AT ABOUT 8:10 P.M. THE UFO MANEUVERED ITSELF STRAIGHT ACROSS TO BRISTOL, DISAPEARED, REAPPEARED AND STOPPED IN THE CENTER OF THE BAY FOR TEN MINUTES, THEN FINALLY LEFT OUR VIEW AT 8:20 P.M. IN THE DIRECTION OF BRISTOL. WE DEPARTED FROM THE COACHMAN AT 8:45 P.M., MY GUEST LEFT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND I PROCEEDED TO AN APPOINTMENT ON THE MAIN ROAD.  UFO EXPERIENCE (PHENOMENA) WEDNESDAY JANUARY 19, 1977  DECIDED WEDNESDAY NIGHT I WOULD ATTEMPT A REPEAT PERFORMANCE OF TUESDAY NIGHT BY DRIVING TO TIVERTON THEN TO MY SISTER'S HOME IN PORTSMOUTH. WITH CAMERA & BINOCULARS I LEFT MY PARENTS HOME FOR TIVERTON AT 6:40 P.M. WHILE DRIVING ON 195 EAST TO ROUTE 24 SOUTH AT APPROXIMATELY 7:00 P.M., THE UFO WAS NOW TRAVELLING ON MY LEFT AND TRAVERSING BACK & FORTH OVER THE HIGHWAY. I DID NOT EXIT THE COACHMAN ROUTE 138 BUT INSTEAD CONTINUED TO PORTSMOUTH AND LOST ALL ACTIVITY AT THIS POINT.  THURSDAY JANUARY 20, 1977  AT 8:15 A.M. WHILE WAITING FOR A BUS TO PROVIDENCE I FELT A SHARP PAIN ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY FOREHEAD. THIS CONDITION CONTINUED UNTIL LUNCHTIME AT 12:00 P.M. WHEN I FELT NAUSEATED AND DELAYED MY LUNCH FOR FORTY MINUTES UNTIL IT SUBSIDED. WENT TO LUNCH AT 12:40 FEELING A LITTLE DIZZY, THIS PERSISTED UNTIL 2:30 P.M. THAT DAY. I UNDERSTAND AFTER CLOSE CONTACT OR EXPOSURE THIS REACTION CAN OCCUR. FRIDAY JANUARY 21, 1977  IT WAS A VERY CLOUDY NIGHT AND AT 6:25 P.M. ON ROUTE 24 SOUTH TO PORTSMOUTH, I NOTICED IN NORTH TIVERTON, ON MY RIGHT ABOVE THE CLOUDS, THIS BRIGHT LIGHT MOVING ACROSS THE HIGHWAY TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND HOVERED THERE. I CONTINUED TO PORTSMOUTH. TUESDAY JANUARY 25, 1977   THIS WAS A CLEAR NIGHT AT 7:35 P.M. ON ROUTE 24 SOUTH TO MAIN ROAD TIVERTON FOR AN APPOINTMENT,   MY FATHER & I NOTICED AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 1500 FEET IN THE SKY,  A BRIGHT STAR (UFO) HOVERING FOR A FEW SECONDS THEN IT COMPLETELY VANISHED. THIS SUMMERIZES MY UFO EXPERIENCES FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS.  IN EVERY SIGHTING INDICATED WITHIN THIS REPORT I NEVER SAW THE METALLIC PORTION OF THE UFO, THE CRAFT WAS ALWAYD ENGULFED COMPLETELY WITH A WHITE GLOW I MUST SAY THAT IT HAS BEEN A FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE AND OF COURSE I LOOK FOWARD TO THE FUTURE WITH GREAT ANTICIPATION.

Summer of 1978.  My captain and I were commercial fishing for salmon off  California coast.   The wind came up real bad and  we ran the vessel to an anchorage  of near Pointe Reyes. California. North of San Francisco.  A small anchorage it was. As a deckhand, I  began to do my work icing the fish.     There was another vessel in the same  area.  It had not called to us, as we left our marine radio on. It was late afternoon.  But still light. before dusk.  It has been some time but I will try to tell as i remember.   As I was looking out of the fish hold, I noticed  a large bright Golden Light as it came over the Pointe of Land north of the anchorage.  The Light was round. It stopped above the Land. Then 4 more arrived.  One at a time, lining up and hovering.   A straight line.  They  were not way up in the sky, but say, like a Seattle space needle distance, (maybe almost a couple).  Somewhere during this I yelled to the Captain to come out of the vessel cabin.  They , my captain, stood near, as by then I was out of the fish hold and on deck.  The  Round Sun-like Lights  did  what looked like manuvers.     They   lined up, and did different formations, changing from one to another. They all did this in close distence to one another.  Such as  a cross, a long line,  maybe a sort of pyrimid. They did this for a while. It seemed to be all for us watching. This kind of dance in the low sky.  As time went on, one Round Sun-like Light came to our vessel. It hovered above directly.  As I looked up, all I could see was the same form we had seen from a distence. It did not hurt my eyes. I saw no craft. It hovered low, but the Glow from it did not surround the vessel. I looked for a long time up. Finally, I looked around, and noticed my Captain was gone! I ran yelling their name to the cabin of the vessel.  I found them below deck. On their bunk, with a book in their hands, looking down. I said ""What are you doing in here? They are still ou! tside! ""    My Captain notified me,  they could not deal with ! it, and they were not going back out.       I left them, and returned to the deck. The Light Ship as I will call it. Was still there.  I stood there more time, with it overhead.           Finally it lifted up in the sky, and returned to the other 4 that had been hovering in a straight line.        Once again,  different directional manuvers were done, then all took off together. Very fast in a northerly direction.                             When they left, a voice came over the radio, we had left on the whole time. We had not called anyone during this. the voice was a young crewman from the only other vessel nearby.  He said.  ""Did you see That!?""      I responded to his call,   but then my Captain came up, from the bunks below deck.        I do not remember right now the further talk, but it was brief.      I still had work to do to ice the fish.  It was now getting dusk, though not dark.  There were no clouds during this time.  My Captain did not want to speak of this  much.   The Coast Guard was called, and was asked of anything going on that day/afternoon. No. No flares. Nothing reported by them. We did not report to them our sighting.    The strange Lights  left, and next day so did we. Once in port. We drove out and questioned the locals in the area. Not much to say, but they had seen strange lights off and on they said.   I do not remember the other vessels name.  I do not feel I should say mine, at this time, nor my Captains name.   I can say this, one year later in Oregon, south of Bandon, I saw what I think were the same 5 Light Ships.  They appeared just before dusk just off the beach, as I was looking from the land out to sea.  I was praying for guidence, as i had some decisions to make. The  5  Round Sun-like objects, lined up in front of me over the ocean.  Then just flew off very fast. It seemed to just let me know they were there.   I ended up living for a time in that area. there is more,   more sightings. i have entered a few others.  ! The other sightings were different craft. Not just a Light.! I ente red of the sighting of the Phoenix Triangle craft.     I will end this now. if I can remember more, I will add it.  It has been some time.  I do not tell people. very few know of this.      thank, for letting me share this.  maybe, that young man from the other vessel will, or has told his side of what happened.  He did say, that he had not wakened his Captain, who had a bad heart, and was sleeping.  So he had been a crew like me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

The event occurred in either 1980 or 1981.  It has been so long ago I don't really remember.  I do know where I was living at that particular time so that is how I got the year.  I was also in the presence of a friend when the event occurred. It was sometime around the winter of 1980/81.  I was living in Belmont Shores California.  The evening was cold and very clear with an unusual amount of starts out.  A friend of mine and I decided to walk a couple of blocks down to the beach to look at the stars.  I'm not sure how long we were there when we saw the object. I first notice the lights in the South West.  The beach we were at faces South.  The object was actually 5 lights; I think.  They were in the formation of a gigantic ""V"".   My friend and I watched until we lost it in the bright lights of the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.   We did not observe any type of body associated with the lights.  As we were watching we were screaming out for others to see but no one was around.  It must have been 10-15 seconds we watched.  I distinctly remember saying it wasn't making any noise because we could see commercial airplanes high up and hear their engines.  The lights were moving much faster than the aircraft but no noise and it seemed it was just lights.   What was really weird at the time is that the lights did not shine.  I never knew how to explain it but now I think they might have been like a LED light similar to the red ones indicating an electrical device is on. The only reason I am writing now is because I have recently seen a couple of UFO shows where people have seen the same thing we did.  The only difference is that we could not make out any shape or object and could only see the 5 lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I surprisingly discovered that two other reports of a similar nature were posted for the same geographic region in roughly the same era. On Thursday, April 1, 1965, my father was returning home from a Naval Reserve meeting in Hazleton, PA, on Rt. 93 in Nesquehoning, PA.  While descending the grade of the hill coming into Nesquehoning, he noticed three (3) red lights in the sky that appeared to be hovering over the town itself.  At first he thought they were the warning lights for the nearby radio station tower, but then realized that the radio tower was much farther to the southwest and probably not even visible from his location. The lights then moved northwest toward Rt. 54. He returned home and didn’t say anything to anyone about the incident until the next morning when it was announced on the local radio station that several people in Shenandoah, PA, saw something similar. While researching this incident I found two other reports of three lights in a triangular formation over Shenandoah in the early-1960s.  The years were approximate on the other reports but the other information was identical: the evening of April 1.  The other report states that the lights were seen over Shenandoah around 8:00 PM but the lights then headed east, which would have easily put the same lights over Nesquehoning around 10:30.  The radio station report said that others in Shenandoah saw the lights around 10:45 PM, and Shenandoah could be made in 15 minutes by air from Nesquehoning. Are they the same but changed color? I’m not sure because I wasn’t there but I can only pass along what he has relayed to me.  He’s also a hardcore skeptic when it comes to UFOs.  As he said to me: ""I don’t believe in that UFO stuff, but I saw something that night and I don’t know what it was.""   For me, the similarities with the location, dates, and times (8:00 to 10:30 PM) make the reports too similar to not be the same incident.",,40.8794,-75.8118

It's extremely hard to describe what I saw but even though it happened so many years ago I will never forget it.  The best I can do is describe it in symbolic terms because it can't be explained otherwise.  Kind of like Ezekiel described his wheel inside a wheel, it was the best he could do, I'll have to try to do the same using symbols that are familiar to me but that I know are terribly insufficient to the task. That said, this was in the summer of 1971.  My friend and I had snuck out of our houses around 10pm after our parents had gone to bed.  Being teenagers we just liked to meet at night and go for walks and talk.  We were very young, innocent kids.  There were no alcohol or drugs in our lives, we were stone sober coming back home from our walk that night. It was about 11pm when we were walking down the sidewalk on Remington Street.  This is a very long, straight, wide residential street, two lanes on each side of the road.  About a quarter mile or so ahead was an intersection with a four way traffic light.  The night was absolutely still, there was nobody out and nobody's house lights were on.  Our town was sound asleep.  As we walked down the sidewalk my friend was chatting endlessly as was her way and I was looking at my shoes when she suddenly stopped and said, ""What is that?""  I looked up and I also stopped.  On the other side of the intersection a good long way away, probably a full five minute walk ahead, there was something hovering in the sky, pretty low, about the height of the tops of the street light poles.  It was absolutely silent.  This thing was moving very slowly forward, and every once in a while it would stop for a couple of seconds, as if it were looking, surveying, or something.  We stood there absolutely transfixed and didn't say a word to each other as we watched it slowly come toward the intersection. Across the intersection on the left side of the street there were half a dozen two story apartment buildings, and on the right side was the open field of our old middle school.  This thing that I'd say was about the size of a 20 to 30 foot boat was just slowly gliding down the middle of the street and then it turned a little and hovered over to the apartments.  It hovered over the roofs ever so slowly, going up a little and then down a little, as if it were checking them out.  At the second apartment building back from the intersection it was possible to get a better look at the thing. It's extremely hard to describe this and it will sound very strange but to be clear, I can't really grasp what I was seeing.  It was impossible.  It made no sense. But there it was anyway.  It didn't have any lights and it didn't look metallic.  The closest description I can find is that it looked kind of like wood.  Like a square ship made of wooden beams.  It was brown, and hollow on the inside without a top.  It had these great enormous arms on the sides that slowly swiveled around and they had lines on the ends, like ropes, but they weren't ropes. There were also shapes and objects inside the opening but I couldn't give a description, I was only aware that it wasn't hollow space inside there.  It was as if this thing was collecting things. While we were watching it, it did not seem to be aware of us at all, but then, all of a sudden that changed.  It's angle changed and it came away from the buildings and back into the street.  It began to speed up heading toward us and as it hovered over the intersection, because of the street lights, we were able to get a good clear look at it.  That's when both of us became absolutely terrified.  It was looking right at us.  It took on an aggressive feel, its back end rising up and the front end lowering, like it was strongly checking us out.  I mean to tell you we were scared.  We both felt in fear for our lives.  I have never been so afraid.  It's hard to talk about this the fear comes rushing right back. That thing began to head right for us and my friend said, ""We've got to get out of here"".  She took off running and I just followed her.  She was heading home.  What was so scary was that between us and that thing was one side street and we had to get to it before it did so we were running as fast as we could, right towards it, and I was terrified and literally praying we'd get to that street.  Somehow we both knew that if we turned that corner we'd be okay.  We didn't talk about this until afterward but we had to get to that street or something unthinkable would happen to us. We did get to that street and we ran around the corner nearly hysterical with terror when we ran smack into her father, who had come out looking for his daughter.  Even though he was very angry we were so happy to see him at that moment and we quickly told what had just happened.  He walked to the corner and looked down the street and saw nothing.  Nothing was there anymore.  He could see that we were not making things up, that we were truly scared and panicked, but he dismissed it and said it was probably just a weather balloon.  If I am sure of anything it is that that thing was no weather balloon. I know this is a very unusual description of a sighting but I am sharing it in the hope that maybe some other people have seen this thing or something like it, and they will know they're not alone and they're not crazy.  I am telling it like it was and have no reason to make up a story.  It doesn't matter if I am believed or not, I know what I saw.

She indulged us by going outside to see.  She is a religious person and wasn’t ready to accept this; however had no choice but to believe what she was seeing. We quickly went to the neighbor’s house to verify with them what we were seeing.  The neighbor swiftly said, ""I will not talk to any reporters about this.""

It is hovering and all the sudden splits into three parts and begins to change brilliant colors and maneuvers as if it was showing off its talent.

March 4th, 2012  Mr. Davenport, I live in Canada, province of Quebec, in the town of Mont Laurier. In early morning of April the 13th 2010 in a clear blue sky i saw a flying object, that i didnt recognized as being an aiplane. It didnt make any sound  and  it flew right above  the houses of my neighborhood  and since i never knew  what to think of it  i am writing to have your opinion. I would like to excuse the poor quality of this  38 seconds video since i had all the difficulty in the world to make a decent focus on this object in the distance.  I had  just recently purchased my camera , a power shot a 1000 from Canon at the time i videotaped this.  Not knowing videofilms cant be turned vertically.In the video the first 7 to 10 seconds many sounds you will be hearing are from trucks and cars traffic in the street aside from the crows. Through the years many times a week i have heard  helicopters fly over my house in that neighborhood ( i have moved since last year) and unless I am making a mistake (which i very well could be) i think i can recognized the sound of an helicopter. It is very loud. Recently, i heard on national radio that Quebec Province had no drones aloud to fly over populations.  It was said that only Ontario had those in activity for special crime search or ecological disasters research.  Since the borders are not far from where i live it  could very well be coming from the Province  next door. My question is , could it be a drone? Aside from an helicopter or anything else?

They looked like miniature suns, u could see inside it and realize there was no machinery whatsoever. It was all swirling fiery plasma, like a liquid lava lamp but being powered by a nuclear furnace.

At about 9:30 on a mid-October night in 2010 while walking my dog, I noticed lights in the southeast sky from our front yard.  I regularly observe the night skies and am familiar with the usual constellations at different times of the year, and follow the movements of planets as well.  I live outside of Burnsville, NC, in a very rural area with little light pollution, and the night sky was clear. What I saw were three sets of lights, each set arranged as three points of an equilateral triangle, and those arranged as a triangle.  The lights were not blinking, two, maybe three of them had a greenish color.  They were low on the horizon, I detected no solid shape associated with them.  Most unusual was the three sets of lights moved, slightly up and down, with respect to each other.  I tested this by positioning myself in a place in the yard where I could align the top of a hemlock tree (stationary in a breeze-less night) to a set of lights, which definitely moved with respect to the treetop.  I detected no sound, nor was able to perceive how far away they were. After watching this for one minute, maybe more, I rushed inside the house to get my wife and daughter to see it, and by the time they were alerted and out, the lights were gone, not visible anywhere else in the sky.  I regret not waiting to see how they disappeared. Having watched the night sky where I live for many years, seen the ISS several times, seen comets, a bolide, assorted aircraft, I’d never witnessed lights like these and the fact that they moved was compelling.

I guess it could be a satellite, though most of the info I have read indicates that it will look like a very slow moving star.  This isn't the case, this thing hovers in one spot and spins in a circle.  Imagine someone pointing a flashlight at you, and spinning slowly with it.  You see the light bright, then slowly fade, then nothing, then slowly see it, then bright again.  And repeat.  45 degree angle from horizon, east of Destin, FL.

On September 13, 2011, my twenty-five year old daughter came to visit me from the Bay Area to attend a wedding and the events prior to the wedding.  She arrived around 8:00pm.  Soon after her arrival my boyfriend went to bed, because he has to get up at 4:30 am for work. My daughter and I stayed up chatting away about the latest news.  I fixed her a dinner plate of fried chicken and real mash potatoes with gravy.  As the evening went on my daughter got real tried and wanted to sleep.  I on the other hand, I was wide-awake from the excitement of her visit and not ready to go to bed. On or about 11:30pm my daughter insisted I go to sleep and stop talking.  She had worked a full day at work and the train conductor gave her a bad time on the train about her bike.  Since I live in a one-bedroom apartment and my boyfriend was already asleep in the bedroom and my daughter was trying to sleep on the couch in the living room I went outside on my front patio to wine down a bit. The apartment complex where I live was real quite.  The night air was clean smelling and a bit crisp and refreshing.  I sat outside and my patio table with my little dog and cat. The moon was almost full if not full and there was a bright star near the moon.  Actually the moon and the star were the only two objects I saw in the sky.  I did not see any other stars and admired that night. As I sat at the patio table looking up I saw a bright round light come out from behind the moon and speed down fast toward the bright star in a matter of a few seconds (1 one thousand 2 one thousand and a half).  This bright round light stopped exactly halfway between the moon and the star.  It stayed there for about five minutes. When it shot out from behind the moon to its position it was fast.  I could not believe anything could move so fast.  And when it stayed between the moon and the star for about five minutes I thought whatever it is, is surely trying to look like a star.  I knew it was not a star; because, when I first looked up at the moon and star it was not there and secondly, I saw it move fast from behind the moon to its present position. As I sat there I watched it for about five minutes.  There was no way I was going to take my eyes off of it.  I was amazed.  I knew I was seeing an unexplained phenomenon, and it was amazing, and beyond understand. Still at the same time, I did understand what I was watching and knew there was nothing from earth that could move that fast.  And just as all these thought race threw my thoughts and my eyes fixed on the object it moved fast again toward earth. This time, like the first time it moved real fast toward the earth.  In about two to three seconds it was close to the earth and went behind my building in the sky and I lost it. I just sat there going W0W!  I surely saw something-something.  Who would believe me? Who could I tell?  I didn’t want to wake anyone up, so I went about the evening focusing on my dog and cat that were sitting outside with me.  A few minutes later I decided to look up at the moon and star again, because, despite what I just saw the moon and star were magnificent in themselves. Then from behind my apartment building the bight round light speeded across the sky in a liner fashion. WOW, I thought here we go again.  The bright light speeded across the sky as it had done before and stopped again. This time it was located under the moon closer to earth.  And again it remained there for sometime, about three minutes. And again I thought it was trying to appear like a star.  Just like the first time I knew it was not a star; because it was not there before and I saw it speed across the sky and stop at its present location. My thoughts raced again for the second time.  Again I thought that the bright light was doing a real good job as acting like a star but wasn’t.  Its position in the sky seemed as though it was lining itself up to appear as a triangle. Anyone who just looked up would think it position was natural in nature.  On or about this time, a neighbor exited his father’s apartment across the way real quite, since everyone was sleeping.  It was at this time while the bight light was in stationed at its second location in the sky, that I quietly asked him to look at the sky to see what I see.  He did and pointed.  When I looked back up the light was still there and zipped across the sky in a liner fashion into the night mist beyond my vision. About the time my I asked the neighbor to look up at the sky to see what I see—my daughter complained about me making noise when I promised to be quiet so she could fall asleep.  I felt bad for asking the neighbor to look up at the sky, because, I w! as doing my best to be quiet and to respect her and others who were sleeping. Once the bright light/object in the sky was gone it did not come back.  I waited for sometime and remained quiet while I did so. On or about 12:36am I went into my apartment and changed out of my PJ’s into street clothes and went for a bike ride.  I was more awake than ever and needed to somehow, someway get tired. I road my bike to the Chevron and bought a beer, came home, and sat outside for an hour wishing the bright light in the sky would return.  It never did and soon thereafter I went to bed. The following morning I slept in from being up so late.  When I turned on the local 11:00am news there was a story about a fireball seen the day before.  Since I caught the tell end of the news story I yelled out “I’m not crazy”. My daughter said to me that she heard me ask the neighbor to look up at the sky. When the noon news came on the watched the entire story about the “fireball” seen in Arizona at 7:45pm the day before.  This event is not what I saw!  There are many differences than similarities. First and foremost, the bright light I saw happened between midnight and 12:15/20am.  Second, there was absolutely no orange flame tail!  The bright light round object that I saw moved fast in the sky then stopped for sometime, then moved again, the moved again, then stopped, and then zipped out of sight.  Furthermore, the object I saw pretended to be a star when it stopped. The above account of September 14, 2011, happened without a doubt and I am happy to report it in the hopes that others saw the same. Moreover, about four days before I had a dream about aliens that I think is important to note here.  I have since I could remember always noted my dreams and have done my best to remember them, and talk about them when I wake up. About four day prior to the above event I had a dream about being at a huge library.  I love books. While at this library I had to go to another floor to find a book.  I went into an elevator to get to the other floor and ended up in floor to which I did not have access too.  When I exited the elevator I knew I should not be there and searched for another to get off the floor.  I found a man who was human, yet I knew he was an alien being.  I explained my situation to him and he picked up a rock.  With his eyes he wrote in the stone some crypt language how to get out of there.  It looked like:  ---?----- ------------------? ------------------  Because I didn’t understand his language, the alien/human look alike walked with me back to the elevator and placed the stone in the wall and the elevator took my back to the right floor of the library. What was so awesome about this dream was, when I woke up I remembered it all.   That is not always the case with all my dreams. I have a friend and we chat daily—on that day, like I do most days I told her my dream and went about our day as usual. After my sighting on September 14, 2011, I told my friend that the sighting and the dream are to close for comfort.  I’m not spooked, but am informed, something out there is trying to contact me.  I am fascinated but I don’t like it. In writing down my accounts I hope that there is some explanation now or in the future.  Unexplained knowledge today maybe helpful in the future. I am telling you about the dream of aliens—not to minimize the event on September 14, 2011, but to give you accurate account of recent events, which may or may not be related. 0 Moon      *     Bright Round Light Object      *         Star      _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________   0 Moon      *  Star     *  Bright Round Light Object",2011-10-10T00:00:00,38.12603333333333,-121.26165847953216

A bright light, about the size of a bright star moved quickly across the sky from west to east. I was driving east on Highway US 26. The object caught my eye when I noticed it through the front windshield. It looked like a satellite, only moving much, much faster, and brighter.  After moving almost towards the eastern horizon, the light stopped for a split second, then made a roughly 90 degree turn to the right, and sped off very fast to the south and disappeared from view on the southern horizon (or at least behind one of the many large rock features that are around the area). There was a full moon outside, and most of the visible stars in the sky were obscured by moonlight. The light was VERY bright, white in color with an almost slight green hue.  The sky at the time of the event was clear, although we did have some rain earlier in the evening. The entire event took about 10 seconds (seemed much longer). I am highly educated (Doctoral degree), and work in public service.  I was completely sober, and was wide awake and aware. As a side note, I felt right after the sighting a ""butterflies in the stomach feeling,"" and felt a feeling akin to the object knew that I observed it. I can't explain the feeling in words that properly describe the emotional experience.  Again, very, very strange. I have never experienced anything like this before, and frankly, I found fascinating, exciting and disturbing.  Especially once I had some time to digest what happened. I felt compelled to make a report.  Unfortunately, I didn't get a photo or video.  The experience simply happened to fast to get my phone out of my pocket...

I was standing outside looking at the night sky as I do almost every night. It is quiet and fairly light-free in this semi-rural area in Arizona.  Looking towards the West, I see very low on the horizon three amber/yellow lights in a triangle formation.  One was on top, and the other two were below.  The angle was extreme in that the triangle was wide, with the top light not being too far above the bottom two lights.  Their motion was mostly in unison, but some fluttering appeared, showing that they were not attached in any way it seemed.  The lights stayed exactly where they were, not lessening in brightness nor changing color.  After about 10 seconds they appeared to be getting larger, and I assumed this meant they were moving closer. There was a very very slight up + down movement to the lights which could be described as a slight jolting.  And as I was staring at this, they disappeared before my eyes!  Gone.  No afterglow, no sign of them at all.  I moved! all around the area to see if I could see them, but they were gone. I ran inside and texted a friend in NYC, saying ""I think I just saw a UFO"".  He texted back, ""Don't go into the light..."" as a joke.  I returned, ""There were three lights.  Which to go into?"".  The time of these texts and the texts themselves are retrievable. I don't have a TV, so found out the next morning at work that a ""meteor"" sighting was reported across the southwest.  With descriptions mostly saying a green fireball was seen, I knew this was not at all what I had seen. I'm a 43 yr old female with a Master's degree from an Ivy League school.  I have never claimed to have seen a UFO in my life, nor have I ever thought I have.  These lights seemed...purposeful.  They never 'fell' down, they never diverted from the triangle formation, and they remained at the same elevation (from my angle of view) and then just disappeared.  There was no waning of light, or a slow burnout of the colors, nor a downward motion - just Poof! gone.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,33.80705999999999,-111.93339777777778

I reported it quite some time ago when it was viewed outside my home.   This time it was off in the distance maybe 10 miles away. It was climbing at a shallow angle and moving to the northeast. This is similar to the path it took the first time I saw it.  The area it was over would be the Blue Mountain just north and west of Harrisburg.   The speed of the object was faster than regular aircraft and it was moving away from my location.   So this would place me behind and some what to the side of the object.,2011-12-12T00:00:00,40.307082581453635,-76.8305888471178

She noticed a bright pulsating light to the north-northeast.  I went outside and immediately noticed the object, which was about 40 to 45 degrees above the horizon and appeared to be hovering over downtown Frankfort, Kentucky.  Object was noticeably brighter than stars in the sky.  Weather was clear at the time, no clouds noticed in the area.  When I first saw it, there appeared to be two smaller red pulsating objects circling below it, then these disappeared.  The main  Object appeared to occasionally give off a flash of white light, kind of like a photography flash bulb.  Object was hovering at high altitude, much higher than the helicopter traffic we often see in this area.  It did not emit any noise.   Object moved up and down very rapidly but remained fixed over the same area around 7:15pm.  I am estimating it was 3-5 mi! les away, guessing in the area of the intersection of highways US-127 and US-421, this would be on the north side of Frankfort, KY.  We observed this until 7:30pm and went back inside.  I went back out at 8:00PM, the object was still in the sky in about the same position as before.  At 8:15pm, Object also appeared to fall suddenly dropping maybe 5 degrees on the horizon.   At this point, we saw 3 small but very bright red lights dropping down out of the main object one right after the other.  Two of these began heading due west at slow speed.  The third red light remained hovering below the main object, then at very high speed moved towards the other two red pulsating lights.  They then moved into a triangular formation and headed off due west at slow speed.  At this point, I went inside and got a set of binoculars, through the binoculars I could see that each of the red lights was actually 3 pulsating red lights in a V or chevron type shape.  Hard to tell size but definitely! in a V shape and flying in formation.  The red objects did no! t emit a ny sound.  At 8:20pm we noticed a similar object to the east had appeared also with the same pulsating green, red, yellow lights. Then about 8:25pm we saw the eastern object drop suddenly in altitude and stop. Suddenly the eastern rotating object dropped a single red flashing light...through the binoculars it also appeared to be 3 flashing lights in a V-shape, also headed due west at slow speed.  Same type of 3 sets of pulsating red lights in a V-shape as the previously observed ones.  Aropund 8:45pm, The westernmost object moved south at slow speed towards us, this would have put it over downtown Frankfort,KY or US-127. The eastern object I would guess would be in the Versailles Road/US-460 area maybe ??

Their moving lights and sound suggested they were close to Mayville at the normal altitude.

A star cannot move and the cloud cover was at first above the light then the light went into the cloud cover. You could see a ‘glow’ from the clouds.

There were nothing but cornfields around the house and the county road next to the house had streetlights leading into town.  He had gone into the barn to put a piece of equipment up after fixing the well pump.  It was 10 degrees and a windless night. After leaving the barn, he got back into the car, nodded his head forward, as if pointing and said, ""We get a lot of those out here.""   I said, ""A lot of what?""   He again nodded his head forward.  That’s when I looked out into the cornfield.   What I saw (or more pointedly ...didn’t see) will stay with me for the rest of my life. I finally saw the object to which he was referring.   My first thought was: ""Oh, so what?  It’s a tall tractor in the field.""   I then realized it was January.  I got out of the car and walked to the edge of the field with the hood of my coat over my head because it was such a cold, crisp night.  The county road lights shone bright white next to the field. What I was seeing  was a dull yellow light, as if a car battery was run down.  It was about 30 feet off of the ground and moving at approximately 10 miles an hour.  The shape of the light was almost ""eyeball"" shape, but a little more rounded on the left and right side.  It was moving directly toward me. My mind went into hyper-drive trying to figure out what this was.  Everything familiar was not matching,  tractor, airplane, etc. and then I realized something and took my coat hood off of my head.  The object I was watching made NO NOISE.  I was probably 25 yards away from this light when I took my hood down.  NO NOISE!  It got closer and came to the corner of the field and turned to its right to follow the edge of the field in front of me.  I believe I was only 10 yards away from it at that point.  I heard nothing. I saw the light on the front of the UFO until it got directly in front of me and it seemed the whole thing vanished.  I realized one thing at that point.  I NEVER SAW A SHAPE BEHIND THE LIGHT.  It was 30 feet away, and I didn’t see a shape!   After waiting a few minutes to see if anything else would happen, I got back in the car.  I asked my boyfriend what it was and he replied, ""I don’t know.""  We then left the property and broke up 6 months later. The next time I saw my former boyfriend was 9 years later.  We were at a restaurant with a mutual friend and my Dad.  I asked him (in front of one of one of our friends and my Dad, who was a State Trooper) to describe what we saw that night.  We both remembered the whole experience in detail and told my Dad and his friend.   My Dad then told me the stories of UFO sightings he had witnessed as a Navy pilot and State Trooper. From my own experience, I have come to believe that there is another intelligent life form out there.  They could have hurt me that night and didn’t.

At the time I was living across the street from the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, so the reflected light was always bright, precluding any interference such as night time shadows or darkness. As I came around the side of the house I had a clear view to the North and South, with an effective horizon laterally of approximately 15 miles - a high ridge of hill and forest to the southwest, west, and northwest blocked any distance viewing in those directions. I immediately saw a circular craft; distance from me was approximately 400 feet; altitude approximately 1,500 to 2,000 feet; circumference approximately 500 feet; height of sidewall approximately 200 feet.    Sidewall was at an angle from bottom of craft sloping outward towards the top at roughly 25 degrees.  Circumference of bottom of craft roughly 400 feet +, bottom was smooth without any features such as seams, markings or high relief. Craft was moving at a slow walking pace from North to South; it took approximately 30 minutes from the time I saw it to travel out of sight around the bulge of the hill and forest approximately 400 feet to my Southwest. Craft was not low enough to see the top of the craft over the sidewall.  It was a uniform Naval Haze Gray color overall without any features such as seams, markings or high relief on the sidewall. As I mentioned before, reflected light from the Shipyard highlighted the craft clearly without any shadows or interference.  Craft was silent and the dog appeared not to notice it.

In addition, there was also another anomaly that preceded the main object which I feel was associated with it, although I cannot precisely place the 2 together.  These two facets make this a significant, extraordinary UFO sighting.    Austin Tx 1986, Sunday afternoon between 4-5pm.  We had just returned from buying groceries to cook on my new outdoor grill.  So I was outside on my 2nd story apt deck at Sterling Village sitting down watching the fire and looking out due west at the beautiful bright blue sky, almost no clouds, just perfect central Texas sky.   Then to my left I see something dark in the sky at quite a distance in the SE direction that I assumed was a flock of birds.  I turned to look directly at the ""flock"" and observed peculiar spazzy ""wing"" movement, sort of like cartoon bats, not at all bird-like.  So the ""flock"" began to get bigger, not closer, and within a few seconds it became clear that it was not birds but, LARGE crooked zig-zagging dark LINES that were gradually spreading outward from a previously small central point, like a cracked windshield, only this was moving, vibrating.  I also could not quite determine just how far away these lines were since I had never seen anything like this before, but my guess would be several miles, at least 20 or so, about as far as the eye could see fairly clear.  I guess to describe it, it looked as if a sky-blue canvas was being ripped or torn at from the opposite side from me, with darkness behind it. As I recall at this time I could not really think as to what I was seeing; I mean my thoughts just stopped, like an overloaded PC ""freezing-up"".  Now I looked around and saw nothing else in the air but a few sparsely thin wispy clouds.  No birds, no planes, balloons, blimps, helicopters, nothing but still quiet blue sky.  As I looked back at the object(s?) only moments later, it was quite larger now, having at least tripled in size and branching out in long, spider-like appendages within a few seconds time.  It was also vibrating much faster and I was just dumbfounded staring awestruck.  I quite literally went blank for lack of any frame with which to reference what I was witnessing.  NOTE: You must understand that I DO realize this description sounds incredibly absurd,  I honestly do. I am only describing what this event looked like.  Please hear me out.  This is not a hoax.   At this point I was really at a loss for even thoughts as to what this was, and by now I was getting nervous so I again glanced toward the western horizon, bright orange sun lighting up everything and as I turned to look back at the dark lines, a grayish blur INSTANTLY appeared in front of me maybe 800 to 1000 feet to my left at the lowest cloud level.  I stopped to look at it for a moment and almost instantly it changed in appearance and became a defined object, that is to say the surface and edges came into focus and the grayish blur changed  into a solid 3 dimensional object.   The object was a grey blur for only about 2 seconds but the transition from fuzzy-blur to definite solid object happened instantly.  I then remembered the ""dark lines"" in the sky and immediately after this grey object appeared solid I quickly glanced back at the sky toward the south east where the ""dark lines"" had been only to find they were completely gone.  No visible trace remained of that first anom! alous sighting at all.  As large and branching as it had become within less than half a minutes time it disappeared within a few seconds.  But I now had this other thing to look at. At first it resembled a huge ballon-like blimp from a parade float or something being that it was smooth. No parades in town today. I thought it might have been hiding behind a cloud.  A quick scan of the skies revealed no clouds even close to being large enough to have been able to conceal the object.  Within a few seconds, maybe 10 or so, I observed it did not have wings, jets, propellors, windows, lights, markings, nothing I could identify it with.  It was a glossy smooth blueish-dark brown-gray color, similar to that of the submarines I've seen on TV.  It also did not make any movement at all; none at all, like a huge dark semi-flattened jellybean perched upon a ledge it just sat there totally silent and motionless, slightly tilted downward towards my general direction.  Finally about this time I suddenly felt anxious as I finally realized this was not like anything I have ever seen in the sky (or anywhere for that matter). I was still reeling from what I had been watching prior to this object and I was VERY uneasy now. Austin at that time had Bergstrom AFB and I had seen at another time huge military cargo carrier jets circle the city to land at the AFB.  This object could have held inside of it at least a couple of those big planes.  Cliche as it sounds, easily this object was at least as big as a football field.  Easily. At this moment I called to my wife who was inside cutting up the chicken to grill. She told me to wait she was busy and I anxiously yelled for her to come outside right now!  She ran out looking down at the grill (she later said she thought I had burned myself lighting the fire, by the way I was yelling) and I bolted up out of my chair, grabbed her by the shoulders and pointed her towards the object in the sky and ranted, ""Do you see that?! DO YOU!?! Huh!? Answer Me! What is it?"" She was not excited like me.  She was calm and speechless, literally at a loss for words. I kept asking her if she could see it, what was it? and she finally whispered ""I don't know"".  We then heard a man yelling at us from the parking lot by our apartment. ""Do You See It?!"", he asked me.  Yea I see it! Do you?!, I responded.. YEA! WHAT IS It?!  He yelled at me and I yelled back  I Don't know!!! (In hindsight I thought it silly that I asked if he saw it too when he obviously had since he asked me first)  Now this guy was behaving even more excited than I was, he was jumping around and waving his arms, really losing it.  I guess looking for other people but nobody was around close by.  We then heard some yelling in the adjacent shopping center parking lot where several people were pointing in the air towards the thing and jumping and yelling.  My wife and I just looked at it quietly.  I suggested we study it in detail. (I have a bit more to say with regards to a more detailed description of the incident, also regarding my phone call to Bergstrom AFB; they denied having any planes flying in the area). NOTE: It is the two specific moments regarding the objects arrival and departure that completely distinguish this thing from anything then or now that I can think to compare it to.  I cannot emphasize how quickly this thing simply zipped into view, then zipped away silently, instantly, no sound, no light.  As my wife describes it, ""Just POOF! Gone"".  Sorry but i really have to use another cliche: If you had blinked your eyes you would miss it.   A bustling city all around and had you not looked up in the sky you would not know it was there.  I saw so many cars pass by on N.Lamar blvd, totally oblivious to this huge thing hanging less than 1000 feet above them.  Approximate location was just north of 183/research, between N. Lamar & Burnet Rd. Would gladly discuss more detail in reference to this sighting since we had a perfect viewing in broad daylight. I am old enough to recall as a youngster ( when kids used to play outside ) and quite often military jets from the nearby AFB would fly low and break the sound barrier. We always looked around to find the jet.   At no time during this sighting did I hear any sound at all from either the craft which was WAY larger than any jet I've ever seen;  nor was there any sound from the anomalous object that appeared before it.  I have seen the Goodyear blimp from at least 3 times the distance further than this object and I could still hear it's engine. I've said more than you wanted to hear in this text I'm sure but as you might guess, this event forever changed my view on many things in this life.  Up until this 1986 sighting i had little interest in these things. I felt the Star Trek-Star Wars phenom had run its course.  Prior to this sighting and for 20 years afterwards I had virtually no interest in the ufo phenom.  My interest in UFOs has sprung up only in the last few years really after finding so much interest on the www.     Again, I am sharing this with you for the reasons I stated earlier. I am also hoping to meet anyone who may have seen this UFO. I counted at least 5 people other than my wife and I whom I personally observed watching the object.  I would be especially surprised to find anyone else who witness the ""lines in the sky"" anomaly as well.    My wife and I are both licensed healthcare professionals and we both have at least 15 more good years of service to mankind before retirement. I do not wish to discredit our reputations as they are in excellent standing in our respective specialty areas.  As I hope you can understand,  I do not wish to openly reveal our identities.   My wife especially is in disagreement about discussing this event as she currently holds supervisory positions in and out of the hospital setting.  She dislikes talking about this even with me bec ause ""no one is going to believe it and even if they did, nothing will become of it so just give up on it"".   So I am sharing this with you all without her involvement.  I hope you understand our position.  However, I do hope to get at least one response from you soon.   Thank You.   ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2011-08-07T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

I was 15 at the time of this sighting.  I was camping on a high elevation, on the top a rocky and treeless overlook, in a family tent with 4 other family members. They were all asleep. I was lying on my camp cot inside the tent.  My point of view was initially flat on my back, looking out of a very clear, new and clean net window.  Since I was on my back, what I saw at first was upside down. I saw lights at first, which ordinarily wouldn't have interested me, except that these were arranged in a small tight circle, and were spinning very fast, rising into the sky sharply with out sound, stopping and dropping suddenly.  I rolled over, sat up, and looked out of the window. There was no cloud coverage, no known or readily identifiable lights present other than the ones I a describing as unusual.   The best way I can give a familiar visual of what I saw is to compare each lighted object as shaped exactly like the cereal called ""Honeycomb Cereal"" but with lights where the holes are.  Each object would enter my line of sight from the lower left corner, from an area hidden by a ridge in the foreground.  Each one would ""shoot"" rapidly into the sky from the lower left area, diagonally across to the upper right, stop, spin rapidly for seconds, and fall faster than it ascended, and all in silence.   Each one was followed by another, in rapid succession, by other objects of the s! ame shape and lights, however some were smaller in diameter.  Each object was circular, but like the cereal, I could tell at the moment  that they would pause before dropping, that there were lights on the sides which spun around the object.   These lights were oval, not round.  The lights underneath, about three per object, were round.   All the lights were white, they did not blink.  The round lights were starionary and moved with the object-attached.  The oval lights were also attached, but did not seem to be stationary.   There were 14 seperate objects.  I remember very well, because I took care to count each one as it appeared from behind the ridge. I cannot explain why I could not wake my family.  I couldnt stop staring at the sky.   I also couldnt speak because I tried. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2011-08-07T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

I witnessed something tonight that I still have a hard time really accepting, but it is what I saw and it was really amazing, to be honest. There was (I have no checked to see if it is still there, it hadnt left when I had..) a rather bright object in the sky, that was pulsating / flashing various colors.  Blue, red, whites, greens, yellows. All colors, similiar to that of a twinkling star.  I initially felt it WAS a twinkling star. No movement, just oddly large and had VERY erratic color movement, it would dim out completely and come back at times. So I called my father down to see it, and as we watched, we saw  a jet off to the left of the object. Bear in mind this was at 9:00 pm tonight here in Bellingham WA, so we couldnt actually see the jet, just the red flashing wing light indicating its presence, and occassionally its green light. We noticed it was flying below but towards the object.. and as it was about to pass, it did a very dramatic curve up towards the object, and as it did it left a trail of very bright orange behind it, like that of possibly afterburner? Or even missile trail, although it trailed behind the craft so my guess is afterburner, and I mean this thing did a sideways U shape in the sky back towards the object. As it did the jet itself was rather bright, I am not sure why this is, perhaps just the light off it. The object reacted however, this was the first time it moved. It veered fairly quickly to its left, meanwhile the jet retracted and headed back towards us, which was parallel to the direction it was originally heading, which we found quite odd. It flew nearby and passed over, and the objec! t remained in the sky. We noticed other jets circling the area, but none of them appeared to engage, rather one of them turned towards us and again flew over head, the other I am not sure where it went, I lost it in the nights sky. I try to remain skeptical, but I know my aircraft, and I know what I saw.  No commercial airliner is going to pull that U in the sky like that in the first place, and the fact it did it to go directly at the object...?  That's just too much to over look.  I stayed for awhile longer, but w/ nothing going on besides the objects rather beautiful pulse, I went back inside, it was freezing out.  To most my story will be crazy, or they will come up w/ an explanation..  But nothing explains that jet doing what it did in regards to the 'star', and the ""star"" MOVING.  That was a RUSH to watch, I was in complete amazement.  My father was dumbfounded as well. Sorry, long story. But it's just something incredible to me.  I wish I could've seen more, or own a camera (I do have a cell phone, but its ancient, it cannot record video...) and wish more people would've seen it, it seems like people are sometimes oblivious to what goes on in the sky above them …",2012-01-12T00:00:00,48.74688634868421,-122.44462006578947

We were young, 11, 11 and 10 at the time.  It was a clear crisp night and we could see what seemed like millions of stars in the night sky, no clouds.  I looked northward of our community towards the other side of the bay.  Above the ice starting from around 200-300 feet in the air I saw a big blue fireball and told my friends to look.  It seemed to come from behind the west hill.    It travelled from west to east and didn't seem to make any noise, all the while descending.  It descended slowly, by the time it made it behind the east hill it looked to be about 50 feet in the air.  It travelled at about 20 kilometers an hour, very slow.   We watched it for about 15-30 seconds.  It then disappeared behind the east hillside.   I waited to hear a big bang so to speak but there was none.  Even with my child logic, I was expecting to hear it hit hard and maybe even shake the ground a little bit, but nothing happened.   After that we decided we better go home.

I was out taking pictures of the Hale-bopp comet in the evening around 8pm when the comet was in the 2 o clock position in the sky [1997]. I was parked at the runways half way point in the dirt parking area at our local airport in Meriden Conn. {Wallingford-Meriden Airport} because it is away from the city lights.  At the time I had won a camera {Cannon Sure Shot WP-1 35mm using 400 film} in some contest and I was still learning to use the different settings when something caught my eye around the full moon.  A object shaped like a large round glowing ball about 1/4 size of the moon and looked like it was just above and to the left of the moon and I saw a jet [ looked military] at the lower left side of the moon heading towards the object.  I took 4 pictures at different settings so I would have at least one good picture of what I was seeing.  By taking pictures on the different settings of the camera it shows the action with some detail on a couple of frames.  The sky was partly cloudy but it was clear towards the comet and 90degrees to the right the moon was in the clear also. The 1st picture is of the jet heading towards the object coming up from the left lower side of the moon and the object is at the upper left center of the moon.  Like if the jet was scouting the object.  The 2nd picture is of the jet coming around in a turn gaining on the object without any movement from the object.  The 3rd picture is of the jet level with the moon on the left side and looking like he was setting up a shot while closing in on the object and the object starting to go to the right just above the moon as to get away from the plane.  And the last picture was taken just after the jet fired something at the object and was starting it's turn into a dive and the object was by then in a ball of flames breaking into 2 parts on the lower right side of the picture far below the moon and almost out of frame on the right side.  One large part and a smaller piece all in a ball of flames,  You can tell by the pictures that the plane is a jet plane and the object is some type of U! FO.  I could not tell what it was, but it was not anything I have ever seen before. {Army Veteran 1979 - 85}  I did not see were the UFO went to nor the jet.  A car had past me at that time with the bright lights on.  I still have the camera that I took the pictures with, and the negitives.  No mention of this event was reported in the local papers or TV news stations.  Since then I have been checking the UFO sites for anyone who had seen this event to try to comfirm what I saw.  But nothing so far. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2011-08-07T00:00:00,41.53889934640523,-72.79349084967322

My coworker first spotted the UFO and called me outside to observe it with him.  Looking straight over head into a clear sky we observed a UFO in perfect geostationary position.  It looked round (disc-like) and metallic (aluminum).  There were features to the underside (concentric structure).  The sun shone brightly on one side of the UFO, the underside exhibited shadow. It was impossible, not actually know the diameter of the UFO to know its altidude, but it ""appeared"" to many thousands of feet in the air, somewhat below where the commercial aircraft fly.  We watched for several minutes as the UFO stayed perfectly stationary. At some point my coworker (ex-air force) pointed to an approaching jet from the South-East (Port Hueneme air force jet?) vectored directly at the UFO.  Simultaneously, another jet was approaching from the North (Vandenberg?) also vectored directly at the UFO.  While the jets were still many miles out, the UFO began to ascend straight up, as witnessed by a rapidly decreasing appearance in size, into the clear sky, to the point where we could no longer see it.  It went straight up, 5 seconds, and was gone.",2011-08-07T00:00:00,34.5021,-120.1287

I have never been so scared in my life. also seen an orb type light moving around the tree line which i only seen once.and it scared me half to death, i yelled to see possibly someone hunting in our woods, no answer but it did move way left and would slighty change to a redish color. i went inside i was so freaked. it diddnt make sense neither, if i would even slightly move to the side i couldnt see it, like it was way back in and i just seen a light through the trees or something, but when it moved it didnt change at all< didnt flash between trees like it wouldve if it were actually in the forest, it was like it was just out side of treeline, but even then while mving and staying totally constant i would move my head to the side or somethin and it would dissapear and then id go back to the exact spot! and id see it again it dont make any sense to me how thats possible. so. freaking. weird. and nobody lives in that direction for a very long distance no houses no nothing, theres a river way back there that would be hard to cross too. ive never seen a person out there niether. i keep taking pictures, but its on a blackberry from like 09 or somethin and camera sucks, all that shows is blackness. but they look like stars, move in rapid ways randomly that dosnt make sense to me why, and sometimes just remain constant. if you would like more info or if these pics would come in handy to you my email is anthonykeagle@yahoo.com lots of the latest youtube vids from all over the world are pretty similiar, but i have yet to see one with this amounts of them. the characteristics of them would vary slightly, some brighter some were dim, some appear to be spinning, and some flash.

I happen to look up at the moon and notice three orange lights flying low like helicopters heading west towards downtown Seattle.  I did not think too much of them because of the air traffic we have in my neighborhood and the fact that we see helicopters in the air at that altitude all the time.  My first thought was that those helicopters lights are really bright.   As they flew over my head they started “orbing” (best way to describe it)this vibrant Orange which startled me. Immediately I ran to grab my camera.  By the time I got back outside to capture the phenomenon they were already in the distance passing over downtown Seattle in a pyramid formation.   As I filmed them there were two other witnesses trying to get my attention on a fourth one, but, unfortunately I had headphones on and did not hear him until the last moment when it disappeared.  That is when the other three started doing the same thing only they kept reappearing.  It looked as if they were jumping in and out of dimensions, in the same location at first but then in different locations.  They commenced to return to the same area they had just disappeared from.  When they reappear they clearly displayed some sort of controlled Aerial Synchronicity.  There were three other people walking up the hill oblivious to what was going on above them.  It wasn’t until I pointed it out that they noticed. The airport is just down the way...I’ve been living here in this neighborhood long enough to know the air traffic where I live and I am conscious enough to know what is ours and what is  not.  To my knowledge, none of our air craft's disappear then reappears in different areas of the sky nor do they jump in and out of the atmosphere as if they have the ability to open star gates into inner space. In any case, I have the phenomenon on tape, if only I had my camera the whole time I would have capture them at a lower altitude doing their “orbing” thing…bottom line, man made air craft, do not jump in and out of the atmosphere and relocate in a different area in the sky in an instant.",2012-03-13T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

As this was going on I turned to look and right after that it turned into very large Orbs, which the best way I can explain what I witnessed, in the sky what looked like very large round orange colored orbs, pulsating lights like jelly fish glowing as they do under the deep ocean, and then suddenly rapidly pop away from each other like pop corn would, and disappear right before our eyes.... This all happened suddenly in front of our eyes while we were watching the beauty of the deep blue evening sky on our property. My wife ((name deleted)) was very excited of the lights, after taking the pictures with a FUGIFILM FINEPIX camera, but thought they did not turn out at first because there are blurry ones that were also taken.  Because of this the camera was put away until my daughter, ((name deleted)), opened it up much later to look for her pictures and found this clear picture between the blurry ones, and upon looking at all the other pictures we took that night, you can clearly see large round orbs just before they popped away. I notice in the trail the ufo left behind, this object descended from space and after the color red, the craft turned at 90 degree right angles, and aprox 180 degrees after the green color trail, and emits less color when traveling in curves or straighter lines.

The plane (an Airbus A-320) already was at its full altitude of around 30000 feet for around 30-45 minutes going from west to east. When looking out of the window my girlfriend and I saw a rather small triangular shaped object flying from west-south-west to east-north-east, following a straight path and not changing its altitude. I estimated the object's size to be about 2 or 3 times the size of a Cessna-type airplane, its shape looked like a flat triangle and its colour was pitch-black without any reflections of the sun. It is difficult to guess the exact altitude but the object was crossing the upper parts and tops of cumulus clouds which our airliner was flying above, therefore its altitude might have been somewhere between 20000 and 25000 feet. The object’s speed was definitely faster than our airplane’s since in the end it overtook us and we lost sight of it when it entered an east-north-east located cloud bank ahead of our flight direction. I estimated the object’s speed to be at least 150%-175% of our airplane’s and it besides this it made no ""phantastic movements"" like sharp curves or such. It just constantly flew into one direction quite quickly. When I saw the object in the first place I thought it was another airliner, but when I realized its all-black colour having no light reflections at all, I had a closer look at it and figured out that its shape was very uncommon (it had no characteristics of an airplane) and its size was way smaller than the smallest airplane I know of being capable of flying in such an altitude. Unfortunately my photo and video equipment was inside my check-in luggage, so I could only observe it my eyes. I estimate the duration of the whole event to be about 1 or 2 minutes, from appearance of the object to losing it out of sight.",2012-03-13T00:00:00,,

The final pair illuminated again then extinguished.  The event lasted no more than 2 to 3 minutes - but may have been ongoing before I noticed it.

I am an avid aviation enthusiast and noted no movent, no navigation lights an no beacons associated with the lights.  The lights did not appear to move - just illuminate then extinguish - followed by the next pair lighting up - almost as if they were in sync with one another - but thousands of yards - if not several miles apart (estimate). This was nothing short of a VERY strange event.  These were not flares, fireworks of other pyrotechnics - as they did not ascend or descend.  They maintained a constant altitude and azimuth. They simply illuminated and extinguished then repeated the sequence among themselves - at one point all 3 pairs were illuminated. Once they stopped - that was the end.

Now there are Helicopters flying all over the place? I was sitting in my hot tub with a friend and we thought we saw a shooting star but then it was still there and going so fast yet not fading at all, it continued towards the east here in Downtown Boise Idaho and then suddenly it fled off to the south so fast that we have never seen anything like it. Here is the kicker, there are helicopters flying all over the same pattern that the UFO had flown and have been going in circles all night now for 3 hours. I never EVER hear them this late over here near Hyde park. Something is clearly going on, the choppers seem to keep going in the SAME EXACT pattern as the AMBER LIGHT we saw. The light was LARGE, it seemed akin to the afterburner from a fighter jet, but NO SOUND and the speed was so fast that if it had been a jet of any kind it would have broken the sound barrier. I use to live next to ""top gun"" in San Diego CA, so I am quite familiar with the sounds and speed of the f-14 and other fighter jets. This was NOTHING like those at all. I am not one to write in to a UFO sight, and to be honest I would not be doing it had I not noticed these helicopters flying all over the place tonight. I have gone out 3 times now to see over 5 choppers flying around and again EXACTLY where we saw the UFO.

Having been there only at night at that point we figured there were mountains and some lights were on top of them, however when we woke the next morning, there were no mountains in sight.

I reported several weeks ago, and I followed it up with a phone call a few days later.  I was told what I had seen was not a UFO, but no other explanation was given. I have seen as many as ten of these objects in the skies on several occasions, and they are NOT stars, airplanes, satellites, Northern Lights, Southern Lights or anything I have encounted in my 65 years. As I mentioned, I have seen as many as ten of these objects in a matter of only a few minuts, as they do not normally move a lot.  They normally remain in a particular area of the sky and make circular movements, and travel both vertically and horizontally for short distances, and remind me of a kite flying in the wind. The objects always have a red light and a white light and at first glance one might think they were a star.  Upon closer examination and observance, you will discover they are definitely not stars. I live in east texas and I can travel ten miles to the nearest city to me and observe the objects all during the short excursion.  I have to be careful not to cause a traffic accident on the highway while observing the strange lights. I have, on occasion seen the red light turn briefly to blue and a short time later it returns to red again. Usually the red light sits atop the white light, but I have on occasion seen the opposite with the red on bottom and white on top. I once saw two of these objects which appeared to be reasonably close to the ground, one in the south and one in the west.  As I was watching the two, the one from the south began to move very quickly to intercept the one in the west.  As they drew near, they both went black for a few seconds and then the one from the south disappeared altogether. Are we so complacent and apathetic that we just do not want to get involved?  Or could it be that we are afraid of what people might think of us if we report this strange occurence?  Whatever the reason, I am perturbed about the whole thing. In my opinion this could be our military using equipment which is not widely known to the public, or this could be actual and very real UFO's from elsewhere in the vast universe in which we live.  I cannot believe another country has invaded our air space and our military  knowing nothing of it.  I also cannot believe the military would not be aware of strange objects in the skies for at least the past six weeks in my area of the country. What the hell is going on here?  Does anyone care?  Have there been too many sightings which turned out to be something natural and explainable that we now just assume this is a hoax or the rantings of an nut? I assure you that I am not a UFO freak, and the report in November to this organization was the first ever for me as I had never encountered anything to report until that time.  This is my second report, and I expect this to get as much attention as the first. I do not have a camera capable of capturing the images of these objects, but I am sure someone in my area would have that equipment.  Why not call someone who can investigate and take snaps or footage of the objects so we could learn what is going on?  I do not know any scientists or astromomers and I do not intend to go to the local high school and ask the science teacher to bear witness that what I am seeing is, indeed real. Don't take me seriously, but one day I will look back and say:  ""I told you so back in November of 2011.""  Are we so prideful and arrogant that we believe, in this day and age, that we are the only possible life form capable of intelligence and the ability to travel beyond our own planetary system?  If this is the case, then heaven help us when we learn the truth. I suppose this could possibly cause a panic if we learn that we are not alone in the universe, but to ignore the possiblity is unforgivable in my opinion.  Will someone please investigate these objects and expain to the rest of us what they are?  Please?",2012-01-12T00:00:00,31.777270833333333,-95.60223333333333

It was moving in a steady line, rising like an aircraft gaining altitude. The color of the light was not the standard aviation red, but an orange color, with a tinge of white, that flickered rather than strobed. It was not a color typically produced by electric lights or LED's. At first I thought it was Mars, but it was too bright and it was moving. About an inch behind it (from my perception) there was an intermittent white flash - a tiny light the size of a satellite, but following the orange light. As the orange light rose, it began to fade and eventually disappeared, as did the white light. I also caught a red light of the same size as the white light flash only once. This was a standard aviation/LED red and could have been an aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I observed two lights - a brilliant, sharp blue color comparable to blue christmas lights in the sky to the immediate Southwest of my position during the observation. Observation conditions as follows:  The local weather conditions: overcast with infrequent, occasional cloud breaks. Temperature: approximately mid forties degrees F.. Wind speed about 5mph - omnidirectional (changing directions occasionally from NW towards due W with occasional breeze from a Southwesterly direction)- perhaps MVR visibility (NOAA reference). EVENT SUMMARY: Event occurred from 18:57 hours to about 19:12 hours EST. I observed a brilliant, sharp blue light - ironically the exact color as an illuminated blue Christmas tree bulb / house bulb - drop rapidly from the sky and execute manuevers at low altitude that I can only describe as being like the irradic flight of an insect (a housefly perhaps). The object dipped in and out of the cloud deck several times - on several occassions perhaps even coming down to ground level -as it disappeared during those moments behind the distant tree line. The object was joined by a second identical object - and both objects dipped up and down in flight - occasionally going above the cloud deck to dip back down to extreme low altitude. The objects later returned to above the cloud deck - only occassionally to peak to a visible position just below the deck as they appeared to move more towards the southwest - and away from my range of vision. The objects were not fireworks - nor were they any form of conventional remotely controlled vehicle that I am aware of, as their speed of manueverability was outstanding, and unbelievable, almost surreal. The objects were distant - about approximately between 1/5th and 1/3rd miles away from my position on South Main Street. They were to the South West of my position. The objects appeared only to be brilliant, sharp lights - as I could not see a superstructure or siluetted outlined around them - I assume as a function of distance. The objects were strictly vibrant / electric blue, and no other color - with the exception that they appeared to become of a lighter tone from time to time, particularly as they positioned themselves at low altitudes. I would suggest that you please cross reference this sighting with other sightings from this general area - on this date - for validation, and that you should also make inquiries to local police departments and local airports concerning any possible phoned reports that may have been recieved - as I am positive that I could NOT have been the only observer.",2012-01-12T00:00:00,39.4445,-84.3678

Smoking a cigarette in back of my moms house with my girlfriend,  from a distance we spotted to the southeast five orangish looking orbs flying up into the sky over some trees as if they were taking off in the distance.  The orbs definently weren't any aircraft I've seen before, they moved as if they were floating in the sky without a care.  Moving left to right and then progressing up with ease definently told me these weren't  normal aircraft.  The colors were of an amberish orange, almost like an oranger darker sun but still very bright.  Shape wise I would say they were circular orbs, we almost thought they were stars at first but then we saw the movement.  Not only did me and my girlfriend see them but we got my mom, sister, and her friend to come out and look at them and they all were astonished. They just slowly progressed up to the sky not in any pattern, other than kinda of a ladder formation where one was higher than the other and so forth, where the last two at the lowest to earth passed by eachother as if they were going to combine but didn't and stayed relatively on the same plain line as they progressed up.  These orbs slowly dissapeared into the sky as they progressed higher slowly flickering in and out of light then completely gone, but what I find most interesting is four of the orbs dissapeared generally low while the fifth orb that was higher than the others from the start of taking off, continued to fly the highest and was the last to be seen.  Figuratively this all lasted about 15 to 20 minutes. This is the first time I've seen a ""UFO"" and I was quite intrigued. I've always been interested in extraterrestials and the unexplained since I was a kid but I never really had experience with the subjects, just kind of spectating on the side from what I would hear and see.  But once I saw those orbs I knew for sure there's way more I don't know about this world and it sparked an interest in me to see what else is out there and if this occurence was common or not.  What I found was that it wasn't something new, this occurence has happened all over the world for a few years now.  Ever since then I've been looking at youtube every other day for new sighting caught on tape, as well as theories of extraterrestials and the new coming age of enlightenment. I'm excited.

I lived out in the rural part of a small town called Orient, Ohio.  My family and I lived on 9 acres of land with paths running through the back yard. It’s been so long ago, I can’t remember the exact date and year.  I never mentioned the sighting to anyone because at the time I didn’t know who  I could possibly report the incident to, and my family never would have taken the incident seriously.  If I had to guess I’d say the sighting took place on the evening of October 30th, 2005. On a fall evening, I decided to take my dog out for a walk along one of the trails running through the back part of our property. It was a clear night with no cloud cover in sight.  Soon after I gazed up into the night sky, and saw something I could not explain.  The object was far off into the distance, maybe a mile or two away, but was high enough up into the sky that I could see it in the clear night. As I just stood there and looked at it, I soon discovered it was nothing like I have ever known to be an earthly flying object.  All I could see on the object were the lights.  The lights were in layers and rows…each row and layer a different color. If I had to try and remember correctly, I would say there were a total of 5 or 6 layers of lights.  Seemingly all stacked on top of each other.  I can’t remember the exact colors. I can honestly say that there was no way it was any type of airplane or helicopter.  The object stayed still in motion and did not move.  The object also emitted no sound.  This was unusual for me. I had always been a fan of aviation aircraft and this by far was different and nothing that I had ever recognized.  It was close enough to where I should have heard sound coming from the object but again I heard nothing. After gazing up at the craft for about two minutes or so I looked down at the dog.  After diverting my attention from the sky for about five seconds I looked up back into the sky and the object was gone and nowhere in sight.  I scanned the sky with my eyes but I had seen nothing. It seemed so strange to see an object with those style of lights and no sound emanating from it.  The lights were nothing like I had seen.  In my opinion, if something could move that fast out of sight and had made no sound, surely it was not of this Earth. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

These events were witnessed during the years of 2001-2002 and again in 2008-2009.  Under no circumstances were the individuals involved under the influence of any substance.  The following sightings were observed by multiple individuals without the influence of suggestion, or ""wishful thinking.""  Each of these incidents was exactly alike in nature. At the time of my first sighting I was in my mid to late teens.  It was sometime in the summer months at around 10:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight, as me and a friend of mine were awaiting his car ride home.  We had been waiting outside in the drive way under what was a perfectly clear night sky, for about forty-five minutes to an hour when something caught my eye. I have always been a bit of a “star gazer”, that is, I enjoy the beauty and awe of a well star-lit night.  So naturally, my eyes are often glancing to the stars, but this particular night I noticed what appeared to be a star in motion.  The object, from my point of view, appeared no different than the stars in the night sky: it twinkled exactly like a star and was the same size of a star from a ground-level perspective. Using my best judgments, the object seemed to be at a very high altitude- almost right outside of the earth’s atmosphere.  It was moving on a steady path at what would have been a high rate of speed in regards to how high it seemed to be traveling- much like how a plane seems to be moving slow when viewed from ground, but its actual speed is about 400 mph. I watched this strange object make its way across the sky with such curiosity and confusion in my mind regarding its identity.   During this point in my observation, I didn’t direct my friend’s attention to it because it was happening relatively fast and I was trying to process what exactly was going on.  It traveled this path for about 20 seconds from the time I noticed it until it did something that made my heart sink into my stomach. The object suddenly came to a complete and abrupt stop in mid-air, made a wide-angle turn at what looked like 4x its original speed, shot across the sky at an even higher rate of speed (without the characteristic “tail” associated with shooting stars) into the direction from which it came, and literally vanished into the night sky. In response to this, I naturally started screaming in disbelief at what I had just seen.  My friend laughed and attempted to offer suggestions as to what it could have been (a plane, satellite, comet, etc.) but I knew better.  In an attempt to explain what I had seen to my friend, I pointed to the sky and used my finger to describe the path the object had taken.  Within minutes I noticed the same object a second time, taking a similar path as the first sighting.  This time both me and my friend were observing the object repeat this similar course of travel, redirection and departure.  Needless to say, we were both baffled and I had gained another reason to watch the skies. Several years later on a similar summer night, I was standing outside in my father’s backyard beside a small bonfire talking with my brother and father.  Looking toward the stars, I noticed the same object making its course across the sky.  This time I made no hesitation to direct my company’s attention to the object.  Once again, the strange oddity followed the exact same course flight, redirection and departure.  All of us who were present saw the same events at the same time. I have no knowledge of any natural phenomenon that could occur as I have described.  There is no technology that I am aware of that could perform the way this object did.  I have no desire to create such stories for attention or for personal thrills.  I am in no way assuming that this/these object(s) are of any particular origin, be it human or “extra-terrestrial”- I simply do not have enough evidence or knowledge of the subjects to support either theory.

My wife and I started to walk the dogs and noticed a very bright light that was too high for a street light / building light, etc... - and too low for anything natural (stars / planets).  As we comtinued to walk, a neighbor was approahing us while also walking his dog.  I asked him what he thought of the light, he said"" interesting"" because it appeared to just stay in one place.  As we stopped and talked for a few minutes while the dogs did their thing, the light didn't move.  The neighbor eventually went his own way and my wife and I stayed until the dogs could finish.  After about another two or three minutes, we noticed the light eventually started to come in our direction. Now since we saw movement, we stopped focusing on the dogs and watched it closely.  Within about 30 seconds, it was noiselessly going right over our heads, and only about 1000-1500 ft off the ground.  No strobes, in fact no lights whatsoever.  AS it was overhead, we couldn't even see t! he original light that got our attention.  It was in the shape between a diamond, and a spade on a deck of cards, with the more pointed part being in the front of the aircraft.  My wife quickly tried to run home (which was about 7 houses down the block), to get our camera in hope of getting this before it was too late.

Area description:  Dirt road/access on east side.  Tree covered Mountain on east side of pond, obstructs view easterly sky. N to NE - swampy bog that becomes forest.  West, bog and mountains in distance, can see camp lights from western mountains on clear nights.  South West, bog, South - unoccupied camp, forest, the mountain tapers down on south side. Sounds:  insects, frogs, coyotes, moose, fish jumping, beavers;  what you would expect to hear in the deep country. What I saw that night. First of all I don't drink or use drugs when I fish, I am most always alone and like to fish at night.  I need to be safe if I am to have fun. I was fly fishing a semi-remote carry in canoe access pond on the border of Sebago and Naples line.  It was a warm, clear, windless night mostly quiet aside from fish, frogs and other animals, no cars in the distance or sounds aside from that of nature.  It was so clear and bright from moon/star light that I didn't need to wear my head lamp.  It was warm, still in the 70's.  The only human structures were a single very small camp (unoccupied for years) and a radio tower with a blinking strobe, roughly 1 mile away and very distant camp on western mountain top whose lights you saw now and again in the distance.  I don't know exact time, but it was between 10-12 pm.  The pond is small, shallow and remote. I was in the middle of paddling from one side of the pond, to the other going south west when a light appeared in the sky to the north.  It was about four times as luminous and larger than the north star.  It looked a ball of light.  It appeared to be very high in the sky, much higher than prop planes and military/jets that occasionally fly over, but I don't really know how high or large object was.  It made no sound.  The speed at which it moved seemed slow compared to shooting stars that I see frequently at this spot.  I thought that's what it was but it became obvious that the speed of the object was slowing down and wasn't a shooting star. It came to an immediate, abrupt and obvious stop mid point in the sky, nearly on top of my position. stayed in that spot 5 or 6 seconds and it disappeared.  The light was white/blue, it was a hot blue - it was strange I remember it was constantly bright but looked like electric fire of ""flashes"" of blue and white light, but not strobe like I guess the closest thing I can say is the light ""flowed""  I don't know if that makes sense, but that's what I saw. I stopped and sat there in the canoe for several minutes - kept fishing for a little while, but felt like I needed to get home.  My girlfriend didn't know what to say about it, she looked horrified, she was speechless.  As I told her I was overwhelmed with emotion.  I guess it didn't register at the moment that I saw something so bizarre that I couldn't explain it.  Since then I haven't told anyone else what I saw.  It makes me anxious to think about it, let alone tell people. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  We have amended the time, to reflect a sighting at night.

February 26, 2012:  Multiple UFO Sighting from Long Island   I am from Long Island NY. I have several sightings to report they are from different years and the reason I am reporting several at once is because I did not know there was a national UFO reporting center to submit claims too as I have always believed up until my first sighting that UFO’S were simply ""TOP SECRET MILITARY AIRCRAFT."" The first sighting I ever had changed my mind in the blink of an eye and I have the image of what I saw that night burned in my memory for ever.  Being experienced with airplanes and how much air traffic is over me on a daily basis I am well aware of what a regular plane or helicopter looks like and these sightings were without a doubt neither of them. Sighting #1- it was January 5th 2008 and I was traveling on the long island express way going west bound at about 65-70 mph. I was in the car with my older sister and 3 of my friends in the back seat of my car.  It was a pretty cloudy night and this is why I knew what I saw was not any type of aircraft I am familiar with or currently exist. I glanced out my window for a second and just so happened to glance up at the sky and I noticed what appeared to be a white ball of light below the clouds moving at a speed I thought was very strange. JFK and Laguardia airports are both in the area and if I had to guess an estimate I would say the lowest clouds that night were about 5-7 thousand feet.  I am experienced with air traffic and planes as I have 50 hours in a Cessna 152 and have been obsessed with the military since I was a kid. I am well aware that around major airports there is a limit on air speeds depending on the class of airspace you are in when flying by or over them.  The white ball of light I witness had to be between 3500-4500 feet in the air and was moving at a speed much faster than regulation speed allowed if I had to guess I would say it was moving at about 500-600 knots. For the probably 20-30 second I saw this object I noticed it had no strobe lights and did not seem to be flying in a traffic pattern consistent with the airport. I found all of this very strange and I would of never guess what was going to happen next as it seem to have opened a new world to me on what might really be going on.  As I was looking at the object moving at an incredible speed it seemed to pulsate once as it appeared the light got brighter for a split second and then it quickly dashed off into the clouds at a speed that did not seem possible and I did not see it again.  The 4 people I was with this night driving all saw the same thing I did and when it dashed off into the clouds as fast as it did the car went silent for about 15 minutes as we were in disbelief at what we just saw happen and till this day my friends talk about it very little as I think it scared or weirded them out to a level they didn’t think was possible. My second sighting was on july 26th 2011 this time located from my house in Suffolk county long island at about 1130 at night. I was outside in my court as I usually am during the summer with my step sister her bf and 2 of my friends.  My step sister noticed this bright light coming from the north to use a landmark it appeared to be coming in a direction from the long island sound and straight down as I live on the south end of long island so it would be heading toward the atlantic ocean.  When I first looked at the light I noticed it I could not really get an idea of how fast it was really moving as it appeared to slow down and then speed up just a bit at times.  As it was coming south I knew that sometimes the head lights on the bigger planes are so bright you can’t see the nav and strobe lights until they get directly over you or are moving away.  As it started getting closer I knew something was wrong as there was no noise of any type of jet or other type of airplane engine.  Also is it got directly over us there were no strobes or nav lights and the brightness of the light did not change it stayed consistently bright from every angle. As it got over us it also seemed to completely stop for about 5 or 6 second and then continued south and we followed it until it got over the tree line and we could no longer see it. I don’t know what I saw in either of these cases but they were certainly not aircraft from this country unless they have something I don’t know about. If that is the case though I don’t see why the government would be hiding this great technology and not using to their full advantage. I do know one thing for sure though something was indeed flying these objects and it had to of had great intelligence for the way they were moving. I hope one day someone can explain what me and my friends saw.",2012-03-13T00:00:00,40.7324,-73.3256

Myself and a friend of mine were on the balcony of his 2 two story complex in Searcy, AR, in conversation when he pointed to the sky and said, look bro there is a ufo.  I looked up and saw an object that looked to be on fire and an orange-reddish color hovering less than 200 feet in the air above us and moving south east at a steady clip no more than 30 miles an hour.  I looked at the object about 4 to 5 seconds as it moved past my field of vision, and I was as yet determine what it is I had saw.  We both ran out of his house and down the steps in which time it must have taken us about 8 seconds, by which time the craft or whatever it was I was seeing had begun to move at an ENORMOUS rate of speed.  It was not headed straight up into the heavens but had a trajectory similar to something which had a clear destination which made me believe it could have possibly been a satellite, but my friend says it came up out of a grove of trees and then started hovering, ! which I did not see but I trust him because we both saw the same thing for several seconds.  The rate of speed this object was traveling could be estimated by me a novice but somewhat educated man as 40,000 miles an hour.  It was going state to state in a matter of seconds, until it went over the horizon and left my field of vision.  If it was a satellite, it was the most sophisticated piece of technology I have yet seen.  It’s speed could be compared to when you see a Christmas movie with Santa Claus barreling across the sky on his way to deliver toys.  I being a skeptic eventually came to the conclusion that it was either a beautiful craft or a hologram in the air, and a hologram seemed unlikely.  Along with it definitely be of a pyrotechnical nature, it seemed to have some sort of diamond or rather a geographical shape similar to an 8-pointed object, something that looked highly sophisticated.",2012-03-13T00:00:00,35.23417,-91.708

Noticed a nice full moon, (I was viewing East of me) and saw “airplane” lights down to the left side of the moon,…took a double look to watch it fly in, but it didn’t move any closer.  There wasn’t any sound either so I thought it must be an unusually bright North Star night.  But it seemed too bright to be the North Star so I continued to look harder at it.    I wasn’t sure if I was seeing one or two lights at that point.  Although my camera isn’t the best, I figured I’d try to get a picture “just in case” it really was a UFO.  Tried to get it on my cell phone but I’m not sure if I captured it.  Then I got three pictures on my still camera.  Came in the house and uploaded only to see squiggle lights.  I had it on 10x zoom without a steady hand.  I ran and grabbed my tripod and took more pictures using the 2 second delay to avoid shake.  Assuming this camera wouldn’t have the ability to capture anything anyway, doubled with the fact that mosquitoes were feasting upon me, I couldn’t stay out there.  Instead I amused myself by uploading the pictures anyway.  Nothing but blur until the last two shots.  When I zoom in on the picture using the picture viewer zoom, I wasn’t really expecting to see anything different but there appears to be a difference..?  This time there is a red ring on the light. I’m wondering if someone else could use a better zoom to check it.  not that it would likely matter anyway, but I’m following through.  It is now 12:14 am and I’m going to go see if it is still there. Yes, it is still there so it must be the North Star and some optical illusion occurred on the picture?

Approximately 10:30 pm September 30th 2011, while relaxing under my carport admiring the night sky, I had focused on the typical passing airliner at high altitude with it's red and white lights moving slow in a westerly direction. Suddenly six oval shaped glowing amber lights in a very tight semi-delta formation appeared in my vision as if they had shot out of the clouds and just appeared moving fast in a southwesterly direction. My immediate thought was ""Cool, fighter jets!"" However there was absolutely no noise and no jets, just the glowing lights. If they were jets, they would have been flying low to be going that fast and making a lot of noise. A single fighter makes allot of noise flying over my area at even higher attitudes, also the airliner that I was first watching was at a much greater altitude and I could make out a faint sound from it. The formation of the lights first reminded me of the Phoenix lights, but much tighter however the last three of the lights were slightly out of a perfect delta formation, at least from my vantage point. That gave me the impression that I was seeing six individual objects or lights as oppose to a possible single object with six lights. They moved very fast towards Galveston Texas. I watched until they were out of sight. The duration of the event was maybe 10 to 15 seconds. Unless I was witness to a squadron of classified visually and audibly stealth fighters, I am not yet convinced that I was viewing jets with their afterburners on as others have suggested.",2012-03-13T00:00:00,29.93496216216216,-93.89237567567567

About half way thru out our trip we all noticed three very intense pulsating lights in a evenly spaced horizontal line about 45 degrees above the horizon to the right side of the road we were on.  There seem to be a fourth object more to the right of the other and farther away because its light was smaller and deep red. As we drove closer, I turned right down a side road to roll down the window and turn of the car to see if they made any sound.  The three lights were pulsating red, magenta, pink and sometimes white in the center.  They  seem to be less then a mile away at the closest time and made no sound and no smoke. The night sky was mostly clear with a few small patchy clouds.  As we watched the three lights were all moving in a left to right (west) direction and then rearranged themselves into a triangle shape (two on top and one on the bottom).  The forth was moving farther away and getting harder to see as it went behind a small cloud.  The three lights stayed in a triangle shape for about 45 seconds while moving to the west together.  Then one at a time each light went father away about 45 degrees up and to the south towards a small cloud that was lighter then the sky so I could see that there was no other structure connected to the light i.e. wings or balloon etc.  One at a time they apparently followed the path of the fourth light but the three went thru the cloud and I noticed as each one would then become just a dim red light as distance and the cloud thickness changed its intensity.  The cloud was beginning to dissipate as the last light went thru it.  I waited to see were they would come out from the other side, but they never did.  I could see all ar! ound top and bottom of this now very small cloud and saw none of the red lights emerge out from behind the cloud.  About 45 seconds later a small airplane was flying a vector from the south east to the north west and was at the same level of the small cloud.

One object was perfectly still in the southern part of the sky while the other object moved slowly and silently from east to west then stopped and went straight up into the sky until it disappeared.

The second night at about the same time approximately the same light appeared this time much farther out.  This was followed by the same ""flashing"" on and off pattern from the night before.

I was driving out of a town called Stourport and entering countryside with very little street lighting. Out of the right hand corner of my field of vision I noticed a circular illuminated object, consisting of a whitish-orange center with a deeper orange-red outer ring traveling right to left in front of my direction of travel. I would guess the object diameter to be approximately 20 feet and my distance to the object about 100 yards. The object was describing an arc, no more than about 60 feet off the ground and traveling at fast-jet speed, say 200 to 300 mph. When almost directly over the road on which I was traveling it did a total 90 degree turn in an instant, or on a sixpence as we say over here, so that it was now progressing in the same direction as myself. It disappeared over the trees and I was hoping to catch sight of it around the next bend but ! it was gone. This whole episode was over in seconds and my first reaction was ""Wow, I've never seen aircraft navigation lights like that before!"" Then the realisation of what I had seen started to sink in. A fast jet could not have made that maneuver, and it was too fast to be a helicopter. Also, whilst still thinking about it a few days later I realised that the object light had a strange quality about it, similar I would say to a speckle pattern effect that you get when shining a laser onto a surface. I'm a qualified accountant,(CPA equivalent), and I've been an aviation enthusiast all my life. My aircraft recognition skills are very good but needless to say I've never seen anything like this before.

Our house is located on the side of the Niagara Escarpment (near the top) where we have a due north view over the city of St. Catharines to Lake Ontario. Right around 9 pm it was getting dusk and I went to the north facing window in our bedroom to see if any fireworks were starting.  A soon as I pulled up the blind, right there - less than 100 metres away - was a glowing red ball.  I immediately thought it was a typical fireball fired from a roman candle.  Then I noticed it was hanging there; neither rising nor falling.  Within seconds a real red fireball fired from a roman candle shot into the air within 25 metres of my original ball and then fell back to earth.  Then a green fireball did the same thing.  This didn’t seem to perturb the original ball at all as it moved very slowly to the left (west) and at a slight incline (no more than 30°). It continued on this trajectory and pace and went behind a large tree.  At that point I went around the west side of our house and stood on my front stoop as the fireball slowly moved off. As I was standing there, pondering what it was, one of the neighbourhood kids hollered out, ""“Hey, look. A UFO!"", and it disappeared behind trees in the distance. The fireball was about the size of a subway token held at arm’s length (slightly smaller than a dime).  The best description I can come up with: It dazzled, because it was more than a glow. The colour varied between a solid red to a dazzling orange/yellow.  The ""fire"" was completely contained within the ball. No rays projected beyond the edges.  If I had to estimate, I’d guess it was about the size of a basketball.  It travelled very serenely and was not apparently disturbed by any wind gusts.  From my perspective,  it did not make any changes in course and travelled off at a walking pace, 3 or 4 km per hour maximum. There was no sound from the object.

Driving south on I-5 in Roseburg at 1205 at night I saw 5 very large round white lights in a long row floating in air about 300 feet up.  They were even with top of hill and extended out of river.  I could not understand what they were since it was silently hovering there.  Others were pulled over on side of highway looking at it.  As I got closer it started to float north above I-5.  As it passed over me I could not see the stars or clouds between the lights so I believe it was a long solid object with the 5 lights.  The lights did not illuminate the ground or send out a beam like a car light.   It continued to head north above the highway.  I am in law enforcement and my husband is an ex air force pilot.  We have observed planes of every description as a hobby and I know that this was nothing either of us have seen before.

That is all I have done...I may have messed with the color on one but I do not think I saved it.  Please notice in one of the zoomed shots with two distinct orbs...then I noticed that there is more going on in the shot.  A mother ship maybe or just my crappy camera.

There were three separate, distinct sitings in different areas of the visible expanse as well as numerous sitings of lights following airliners. I have only recently filed a report with The National UFO Reporting Center of a sighting which I had in 1994 in the exact same location.  I erroneously called the campground ""Mountain Springs"" in that recounting but actually it was MOUNTAIN PALM SPRINGS. Shortly after sunset, while still barely light, perhaps at 5:30 pm on this date, while facing east from the Mountain Palm Springs Campground in the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, San Diego County, I observed a series of lights abruptly appear at the crest of a nearby mountain called ""the Coyote Mountains"". I estimate that it is roughly seven air miles from the campground. The lights were clearly at the crest of the mountain as I could still plainly see its outline. The lights were arranged roughly the same as on an automobile ( Which I assumed that it was) two amber lights froward ( There was a smog haze that evening so I was not surprised that headlights might appear amber.) and two smaller amber lights in the rear of the ""vehicle"" instead of the legal red. I assumed that it was a dune buggy as that is a general area of their use or perhaps a military, ranger or Border Patrol truck.The ""vehicle"" made an emergency stop as if in fear that it would plunge over a cliff which i! t would have had it ben a car. It sat there momentarily and then slowly backed-down or ""lowered"" itself out of my sight but then briefly partly returned just to as quickly retreat. I did not see it again.. I thought little of it and reminded myself to check the map again tomorrow to try to determine its size. I did use my binoculars ( 10x52) at the time but the distance between the ""headlights"" could not be determined at night. The following day, using both my binoculars and the detailed map I realized that the ""headlamps"" had to have been many yards apart ( 100 plus yards?) and could therefore not have been a motor vehicle. Only a short time later, with the darkness near complete, I observed another set of lights rise up rather slowly over the next mountain farther away, called Superstition Mtn. It was perhaps ten plus air miles distant from me. This light lasted much longer, also made a very slow retraction behind that mountain only to return doing this maybe three times. Through the binoculars the light or object appeared to be a giant flower type of shape with the ""stem"" and backside of the ""blossom"" not lit but the petals were amber convex lights. Another way to describe it was as if the lights were part of a honeycomb in the center of the flower. Due to the distance away it must have been a huge object. The altitude of these two mountains are maybe 2500 feet and both completely surrounded by desert very near sea level. This object appeared to face north, that is the lights were faced in that direction and I was west of it observing in profile. Well, it gets worse (or better depending on your interest.). At 7:00 PM ( This time I wrote the time down) a dancing light that looked much like a star or planet appeared to the north of my position in an area that I know has no geographical feature. It was one of the first ""stars"" to appear that night but as it moved up and down and side to side in a kind of rough oval maneuver I knew it must be an aircraft. However I could not understand why a helicopter ( No other aircraft that I know of could make this jerky maneuver) would waste its time doing this for one hour when it finally apparently disappeared. My attention was drawn else wear so I did not see it depart. The following morning I checked that area out ( Though I already knew it well) and determined that it could not have been something in the far distance on a mountain as they are more than thirty miles away and below the horizon from my relative location. It appeared to be roughly over an area called Box Canyon. It! s location and motions exactly matches descriptions of one of the so-called ""ghost lights"" famous in Anza-Borrego folklore of which information is easily found on the web. No one knows what they are though there are many strange theories and/or excuses from actual ghost spirits to bizarre pseudo-scientific theories involving metallurgy. There is more. This area is a flyway for aircraft heading from the east to San Diego and or Hawaii as well as military aircraft to and from the many bases to the north in California and into or from bases in Arizona. There is also visible air traffic to and from LAX and destinations beyond. Of course there are also some general aviation aircraft in this mix. As I watched these obvious aircraft I noted that each and nearly everyone was either being followed or led by a small white dot of light that ""flitted"" about in its general flight path as opposed to the smooth movements of the known airplane. I tried to objectively explain this to myself but could not. Naturally as with previous long term sightings I grew bored and turned in for the night. In the days that followed numerous military helicopters, armed with rocket pods and door gunners, scoured this area at low altitude.  I followed them up to the location of Box Canyon where two actually touched their skids down on a craggy mountain top not two hundred of yards from me. They were unable to set down there so I found it strange that they would perform that dangerous maneuver. They then went over this rise and could be heard landing or perhaps hovering on the other side out of my view. I believe that they did not like me viewing them especially with my binoculars. There were no markings on these craft but they were painted in military camouflage. Also, this is important, this is NOT a military base or practice area but a state park yet they spent several days flying in and amongst these dangerous canyons! Those who are pilots understand this. There are many thousands of square miles to practice combat activity yet here they were instead. I identified all of these ! military craft as Huey Hog gunships and concluded that they were likely USMC or Reserve. The venerable Huey, though a quality craft, has been considered obsolete for decades though still in use especially with the Marine Corp. Notably, USMSC and USN air bases are not that far distant. I stayed in this campground for five nights and did NOT witness ANY of these phenomenon again that week. After exploring other campgrounds for more than one week in Borrego and the Southern Mojave as well as SW Arizona, where I saw no unusual activity at all, I returned to Mountain Palm Springs again for two nights and observed no other phenomena. Although I had  an inexpensive digital video camera with me I consciously decided not to use it as it is old and has poor pixelation. Any lights witnessed would not appear unusual in a video.

That day we (and others) had been working on a coastal research project, setting up radar antennas on the dunes between Fort Caswell and the southern beach line.  During the day we noticed military activity many miles south-southeast of the beach, where we could see and hear naval ships firing artillery.  Around noon we also watched as two jets soared overhead, to and from the ocean, turning and banking as jets do.  (We have no knowledge of a connection between the military activity and the sighting.)    Later that night, after we finished work and had had dinner, my two colleagues and I decided to explore the old fort where we were staying.  After roaming around for about 40 minutes, we walked onto a broad patch of lawn behind one of the structures where we stood and talked for at least half an hour. Just before the sighting occurred, we were discussing the constellations and were aiming my iPhone into the sky, using the SkyView app to reveal star names and constellations.  At about 10:00PM while all three of us were simultaneously staring upward, we noticed two bright (but small) lights appear from the western horizon, swiftly cross the sky, and fade away into the eastern horizon.  They were moving at a very rapid pace, one light following the other’s path at the same speed.  It appeared as though they were very high up in the night sky. There was no noise that could be heard, and they simply looked like two points of solid light following each other. My colleagues and I are geologists and marine scientists. We have seen our fair share of planes, shooting stars, jets, helicopters, satellites, and bugs, and what we saw was none of these. Immediately after acknowledging that we all three saw the two lights, we agreed that they could have been none of those things, based on their apparent altitude, speed, as well as the lack of sound. I myself have always been a UFO enthusiast, and in my 22 years of living I had never seen anything that I would confidently call a UFO, until that night.",2012-03-13T00:00:00,33.9083,-78.0785

This kind of thing makes you doubt your own sanity. I was driving east on 84 headed towards Connecticut, about 5 miles back before the bridge, I had seen something strange. It almost looked like a derby hat hanging (I know goofy but that’s what it reminded me of) in the sky but from a “straight’ on perspective. I could see the bulge in the middle and then what sort of looked like a brim sticking out at the sides. It was weird but I was doing 75 mph and it quickly passed in and out of my field of vision because of mountains and hills that the road cuts through. By the time I got to the Bridge itself I had forgotten all about it. As the highway bears right, just when you’re approaching the bridge, I came around that bend and there in the Sky right above the highway was a massive object, I mean huge in relation to the bridge and the skyline behind it. I couldn’t just slam on the brakes because I was in traffic but I looked up as I went underneath it and it looked to me to be almost Diamond shaped and a matte gray, as I passed fr! om underneath I flipped up my rearview to see if I could see it more, but it was gone.. This all transpired in about 30 seconds. I know I wasn’t hallucinating because I looked around to see if anyone else was looking and the people in the cars around me were also looking up and then back at the road. When I got to the Toll collector I asked her if she had seen it and she said “I finally saw one” she was beaming.. I asked her again because this is a very surreal experience, even for someone like me that has always wanted to see one. And she confirmed that it sort of came from nowhere and then just as suddenly disappeared.  The weirdest thing about it, it looked aquatic almost like a manta ray and had 2 black circles underneath that looked empty just black holes. It was completely still and silent, and really freaked me out... I wondered if it wasn’t a military craft as there’s  a base close and it was that color, but the woman at the toll booth seemed pretty positive it was a UFO.   I tried to snap a pic but all I got was the roofline of my car. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2012-03-13T00:00:00,41.4885,-73.9434

At about 9:30 pm my daughter, who is only 8 yrs old, was looking out our bay window and asked me to come look at this yellow/orange light in the sky.  I said, oh it's probably just a helicopter but as I pulled back the drapes to reveal the enitre line of sight from the window, I was astonished to see that the sky was full of them. The lights were clearly moving and all of them seemed to be moving in the same direction, across the mountain from the SouthWest heading NorthEast.  The mountain we live on is some 2300 in elevation and the lights were not too far higher than that, but clearly above the mountain, as they passed over the mountain. My father and his wife live next door and we called them to come out on the porch and look. They both witnessed the event as well.  My father (68) and myself (40) have lived on the mountain for most of our entire lives, on the brow of the mountain since 1980 and neither of us have ever experienced anything like what we saw. I have looked every night since and have not seen anything at all in the night skies other than distant planes and helicopters that rarely, if ever, come across the mountain.  Most all commercial flights into the city approach from the South (atlanta) and are visible way off on the horizon flying direclty north into the airport. I would be very interested in recieveing some feedback about what we experienced.  I will go on and say that since this night, we have been watching a lot of internet and TV shows about UFO sightings and we found out experience very similar to the ""Lights Over Phoenix"" experience.

Shortly thereafter, a second golden ball appeared where the first one did, and it looked exactly the same as the first one. It flew down and kind of ""fishhooked"" up, then accelerated to make a pilot/wingman formation with the first gold ball (who had risen quite a bit by now).   After catching up to he first ball, both balls curved slowly toward the west and then faded out completely, in a pilot/wingman echelon formation.  They covered about 10 degrees of sky and the whole thing lasted maybe 10-15 seconds, if that. Gave the distinct impression of two craft flying in from space, then flying back up into space.  No noise at all during the sighting, just the beautiful gold / molten color of the spheres of light, both with golden radial rays like a diamond's fire.

I had not yet fallen asleep when my two dogs started to growl and bark.  As I listened, one dog started to bark very loudly and was pacing rapidly all through the house.  My other dog, who NEVER barks or growls, began growling as if it were in extreme defesive mode.  I was still in bed and soon realized they were reacting to a dog outside and a few blocks away.  This other dog (outside) was freaking out so bad it sounded like it was being killed.  (This was included only because it got my attention. I am not saying the lights caused the dogs to bark, although it was very abnormal)  This got my attention and I turned over to look out my 4 ft. x 4 ft. window by my bed.  Up in the sky I saw an orange light. I was not wearing my glasses and the image was blurred, but I could immediatly see that it was unusual.  I stared, squintng, trying to adjust my focus thinking what the hell is it.  I ju! mped out of bed, grabbed my glasses, got back in bed, and watched. It hadn't moved.  I couldn't wrap my mind around it at first, I have been interested in UFOs my whole life, but to see one is mind bending!   First I deduced that it was not a reflection of light on my window as no lights were on in my house. Second, not a helicopter or plane or star or planet, this looked like it was a huge star that had come to Earth.  I was amazed, I leaned down to get a bigger view of the sky, as my roof eave was obstructing.  There was another!  I literally said ""Oh shit!"" I jumped up grabbed my phone and ran outside in my boxer shorts.  I live on a mountainside, three quarters of the way up to the top, with good views of thecity below.  Once outside I could see the huge clear open sky with FOUR round lights in a straight line! Just above the city to the left. I looked around and nobody was outside watching, I felt they should be so I let out a ""WHOOOO!!"" but no one heard.  The lights wer! e equally spaced, their height looked like they were level wit! h the to p of the mountain.  Which is not that high as the mountain is barely classified as a mountain.  The line of lights appeared as if it was around a mile long from the first light to the last but there really is no way to tell I guess. But they DID appear to be inside the semi-circular mountain range surrounding the city below. So to me they seemed close. I was unbelievably excited!  I stared at the lights trying to understand.  They were all the same.  I am assuming they were spheres,  because if they were discs or two dimensional circles they would have had to be facing me dead on because they appeared as a round circle of light.  The light did not glare as normal lights do. It seemed to be a ball of light that was contained within itself with a dull look almost like it was pulling in light instead of giving it off. there was no sound. There was movent within the orbs, I could not tell whether there were rotating lights inside or if there was a swirling effect and  changing co! lor from red to orange rapidly.  Basically it looked like four giant fireballs floating still in an evenly spaced long line.  I pointed my camera phone at one of the lights, all four would not fit in the frame, and took a picture. The result looked like a black sky.  I was frantic trying to fumble with my phone, I did not want to take my eyes off the lights.  I took another picture, my media storage had been reached and it did not let me save the second picture!! I couldn't believe it and did not want to waste time with deleting pictures.  By this time one of the lights, I do not remember which, started to  move slowly.  Maintaining the same distance, it moved into a triangular position with two other orbs forming an equal lateral triangle. T  he forth orb started to move slowly into position between two orbs and outside the triangle.  Seconds later all orbs moved simultaneously very slow from west to east right over the city. Anyone that looked up at that time would have seen them.  They passed over the city and &#8206;Saturday, &#8206;February &#8206;11, &#8206;2012phone. I realised I got a picture, it looks like a u-shaped light that is different colors. I put it on my computer and it's a little clearer, but my camera phone isn't great.  Although you can tell it is not a plane.  A few minutes later I actually called the police which I normally would not do.  I wanted to see if they had recieved any other calls about it.  He did not seem to care, although he did ask me a question or two.  I called my brother right after as the lights were headed towards his house, but he didn't see anything.  A couple of days later, I was on YOUTUBE and found a video: ""UFO OVER CHATTANOOGA 12/28/11"" the same date as my sighting.! The video shows exactly what I saw except ther are three lights.  This made me feel good to know that some one else saw them.  His location was the opposite of my view.  There is also a video of ufo over chattanooga that is a hoax, japanese candle balloons.  They don't even come close to what  I saw.  I have always read about UFO witnesses saying that it was liked nothing they had ever seen. Now I know what they mean.

At arms length this craft seem to be approx. the size of a standard house large ceiling air vent, at 500 feet high over the freeway.

I noticed a large spot light type light in front and to the rear of the craft, which may or may not be the direction of travel of this craft, as when I first noticed UFO it traveled in a north by north/west direction, within a split second it shot northbound out of sight approx. 1/4 mile only to return over our car in less than a second.  I open my sun roof in our ML-350 Mercedes Benz, and lost sight of the craft for a second or two but noticed the craft seemed to ! be pacing our car, I should make mention this SUV/ML-350 has radar function which may of helped the craft pace our car in the begining of the sighting and just prior to speeding forward the 1/4 mile, again hard to tell because of the octagon shape. Moreover, the spotlight in the front and end of the craft always remain on, the circumference of the craft displayed red lights over box like windows which were white, blue lights circled the craft.  This craft then traveled in a north/west direction and gave the appearance of rest on top of a medium size hill 1 & 1/2 miles away.

At 2258 hours I was driving heading South West on Hwy 49 coming down the mountain from Gold Flat/Ridge Road, I saw a flying object threw my front windshield with three constant red lights hovering in the sky close to the ground above tree tops.  It would stop then move toward me in a slow fluid motion then stop move toward me then  stop again. Taking the Hwy off ramp at Brunswick Road I waited at the stop light, and when it turned green turned left heading over the bridge East.  It seemed to me the stationary craft was very close to my destination so I decided to check it out.  I turned right on to Plaza Drive drove past the Flyers gas station.  At this moment I saw the craft start to move so I stopped in the road behind Perko's diner, shut off the engine, turned off the head lights, and got out of the vehicle, and stood behind the door.  The craft now had three lights but as it turned it revealed a forth. It made a complete 340 degree turn like a glider would (no sound) in a 20 foot diameter.  My approximation of distance is 300 yards, 170 feet from ground, over a wilderness area, (using the local cedar  trees as a guide), and only blackness between the red lights.  The lights made a X like any respective airplane would, and one was clearly definable as the front since motion forward stayed with that light.  From my estimation the lights were 20 feet apart, and they did not illuminate what they were attached to.  It was only 20 feet above the cedar tree tops, and completed its turn ending heading in a North East direction. It  looked to me that is was traveling at 2 Mph top, in a slightly lowering altitude. Losing sight of it behind trees I did not see it a gene. I did try to relocate it by estimating the drop speed, speed, and direction, but was unsuccessful.  Note- there is a local air port in the direction it was heading. I have gone threw a mired of emotions and thoughts about this. I have questioned myself over and over, on what exactly I had seen. The main point I keep reminding myself is that most of the time I watched this craft it was fixed motionless in the sky, and to the best of my knowledge we do not have that ability on our air craft. Second was the silence, it made no noise at all, and the traffic noise that might have masked that was almost nonexistent.  I will have to recall this account, and the main thing I will recall is that I can only classify what I saw as a unidentified flying object.",2012-01-12T00:00:00,39.16412530864198,-121.02348333333333

Well I saw it again this morning, this time in the Western sky over the gulf of mexico. Same object but much, much farther away. This time I was able to view it through binoculars for appx 30 minutes. Actually got my wife out of bed and made her watch it with me. I am a little freaked out as to what the heck this was. This time with the aid of 16x32 power and also 7x50 power bino's I was able too observe many, much smaller points of light dance all around the larger object. The large object again pulsated and changed from red to blue to green to yellow. It Appeared to remain stationary for the 1st 20 minutes of observation as the smaller red and blue points of light danced all around the large object. Had too be at least 10 to 12 of them but they were so fast and erratic in their movement that it was hard to confirm an exact count. After ap! px 20 minutes the small points of light just merged into the Large object and it slowly began to drift up and to the south. From my location/angle it appeared to rise in the sky about a foot and drift to the south about 4 feet. Then it just dissappeared like someone turned off a light. No flash, No nothing, just there one second gone the next. So now my wife and I are both freaked out a little and as we take our dogs for their morning walk as I proceed to tell her about my Dec 23rd sighting that occured the previous morning. Same object without the little light's dancing and much, much closer/larger. When we got home from walking the dogs I went back outside to see if anything had returned to the area in the sky we saw the object. Saw nothing at first but then I thought I might be seeing some twinkling lights around the same general area in the sky. Looked through the Bino's and saw 2 Military jets flying all around the area flying larger and larger circles. The scale of th! e jets were that of the small dancing light making the scale o! f the la rger object HUGE!!! This went on for appx 25mins then they headed out over the Gulf of Mexico out of site.

I watched this for almost 15 minutes, the time may not be exact, but close.  At one point I left the room to get binoculars (I knew my camera would never capture any detail ) and the binoculars did not add any detail either as it was so bright!  Shortly before it simply disappeared, it appeared to shoot out beams in red and blue.  They were similar to this _-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_- and shot out from the lower left side, then the lower right side, but not at the same time.  Then it was simply no longer there.",2011-08-07T00:00:00,39.59146094420601,-77.00426309012876

When in Vegas, our routine is to get to the pool at or around the time they open, which is typically 9:00 am.  That day we arrived at the pool, picked our spots, and were in the pool by 9:30.  At this time, half of Las Vegas is still asleep, so there were no more than 20 people at this pool at this time. Weather conditions: Hot (probably high 80’s already, I believe it got up to 103 later that day); not a single cloud in the sky. No wind. Shortly after dipping in the pool, I noticed a large, unusually shaped white luminous come from over the mountain range to the West/Northwest of the Las Vegas strip (I believe the Spring Mountain Range?).  There is not one thing I can think of to describe the shape, except that it was a cluster of some sorts, with a rod coming down from it.  My initial skeptical reaction was that it was balloons, but: at that distance, and it’s size, it could not be balloons, and at that point is was easy enough to see detail that it definitely was not balloons.  Plus it emitted a bright, glowing light. I was pointing it out to my wife, and other people around us began to notice and talk about it as well.   The object got higher in the sky, then started moving south along the mountain range (towards the flight path of McCarren Airport).   Then, another object came over the range.  This object, was smaller, and appeared to be a single oval shape.  It was the same white color, and also emitted the sam! e bright white light. Over the next hour or so, we watched the objects as they moved to the south/southwest.  They were definitely moving in tandem, and sometimes swap positions (left/right), but they always were fairly far apart.   It was around 11:00 am when I saw the two lights for the last time.  They were quite faint, far & at a high altitude.  One was straight to the south, and one was southwest; they were very far apart at this point. Here are some other notes:   -Right after the second object came into view, the area they were would have been directly in the flight path for departures/arrivals at McCarren Airport. I noticed that during that time period, no planes took off or landed from that direction. If possible, can you attain air traffic control recording, chatter from that day? Whatever the objects were, they had to have been talking about it, because the control tower would have had clear view of the objects the whole time. -Also, there were approximately 10 helicopters the roared overhead (LV strip/Grand Canyon tours) during the time period where the sighting took place. Pilots & tourists had to have seen it. -Reason for waiting to report after a month: I thought for sure someone else, perhaps an aviation professional would have made a report by now. I’ve been checking this site and others like it daily since this sighting happened hoping to see something but to no avail. I am still disturbed at how blatant these craft were above a major city, one of the busiest airports in the US, and the fact that they came from the general direction of Area 51 & the Nevada Test Site. -I’d be happy to answer any questions an investigator may have. -I can draw a picture of the objects; and/or a diagram of the timeline of the movement of them upon request.",2011-08-07T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

Above and to the right was  the second and a little farther behind, above and to the right of the second was a third.  They appeared as helicopters would, entering my view low on the horizon and about the same speed.  Objects were silent. In my experience, helicopters at that range would have been clearly audible.  At this time a wittness began observing objects. We continued to watch the lights as they proceeded in an easterly direction when, one by one they turned, seemingly at the same point, to a southerly direction, traveled a  short distance, grew dim, and ""twinkled out"",  like a candle running out of fuel.

This occurred on the evening of Thursday, January 19, 2012 at around 7:00PM EST, and lasting for about an hour.  This took place about 10 miles north of Macon, GA.  I would estimate the angle at which I viewed this object relative to the Earths’ surface was about 35 degrees.  As seen at arms’ length, I would say that it appeared to be about 1 ½ to 2 inches across and about ¼ inches high.  It was a straight, horizontal rectangle.  I saw nothing above or below this shape.  Its size as compared to the full moon would be about 1/16. It was seen in the SW sky, and was hovering completely still in mid-air.  What made it so outstanding were the colorful lights moving along constantly from left to right.  The colors were vivid blue, less green, less red and white.  They were intermittently blinking on and off as they moved along.  Then suddenly, all of the lights would momentarily go off.  Then all at once they became a solid line of bright white light with some brilliant flashes of that bright white light.  Then the colored lights started moving along again.  There appeared to be no repeat pattern.  I reasoned that, even though I couldn’t see it, the lights were probably circling around something and I could see only one section.  As the stars moved in a clockwise direction, this “object” very slowly sank to the right (westerly) until it was out of sight.  At any rate, it was the most fascinating thing I have ever witnessed in my life",2012-03-13T00:00:00,32.849716789667895,-83.67467029520296

A small non-flashing, red light (like a LED light or power indicator light) came into my field of vision; I wasn’t looking up at the sky or anything.  It immediately captured my interest because I thought it was flying extremely low.  I then considered a logical explanation; I thought it must be a helicopter?  However we don’t see many helicopters in this neighborhood unless it’s the law chasing somebody & if that were the case, there would have been searchlights.  We are not close to the hospital district, downtown police helicopter landing strip, or airbases. I considered that maybe it was an airplane of some sort?  If it was, wouldn’t it be flashing?  In addition, don’t they have flashing white lights as well?   As it approached, I heard absolutely no sound whatsoever. The sky was clear; however it had rained for the 1st time in over four months most of the day before.  The air was humid & thick.  What I saw was moving at an extreme high rate of speed, faster than anything I've seen.  I couldn’t take my eyes off it and I blinked a couple times, just in case my eyes were playing tricks on me. It remained at the same elevation, heading from my right to left diagonal path.  As it grew closer, I noticed some sort of circular type field around the red light in center.  This circle was not a sphere; it was more like a sheer curtain, flat, possibly a force field?  The circle was translucent & it was glistening/shimmering opalecant colors (pink, blue, green crystal).  It was not twinkling like Christmas lights, no blink pattern at all, it was more iridescent like abalone shell, but again it was about 40% transparency.  There was also some sort of crystal beams or rays; I think 6, surrounding the opal circle.  They were shining from the circular field, all the same length, just about the length of the circle in size. I simply couldn't take my eyes off it. I then realized I had my Android mobile in my hand, so I hit the buttons to quickly try to capture it on digital.  It took me less than 5 seconds to get it started, by then; the object was straight above me. I tried to get it in my viewfinder, but it was moving so quickly, I just couldn't keep up.  I attempted 3 shots, about 8 seconds apart, unfortunately, I've no flash & the lens was on the full zoom out level. It then was out of my view as it flew over the building.  I ran down the stairs trying to adjust the zoom in, I got to ground level and out of the breezeway.  However, my view was then blocked by the building. In retrospect, I should have run to the street, but I didn't think of it, I was so amazed!  The event lasted about two minute’s total.  I felt no fear of the object; I know they didn’t notice me.  I gave up & went upstairs & into the apartment.  I looked to see what I might have gotten on digital, but with no luck, just darkness.  I went to sleep.  I woke up at 10am & the first thing that went through my mind was the event.  I plan to upload the photos onto my computer & see if I can find anything by resizing them.  I have started a drawing of the object in Adobe Photoshop.  To my knowledge, no one else witnessed the event. I will send a drawing of what I saw in a future report.

I'm not sure if it went into the clouds or just turned off.  It didn't jut blink off but faded out over about 1/2 second.

The craft the completely silent also seemed to ""hover"" and slow down when I did. I turned a corner and it followed me briefly for approximately 50 yards.

I took this photo at a tourist attraction called the ""Old Faithful"" geyser about 2 miles outside of Calistoga, California on December 24 2011. According to my computer, the photo was taken at 11:49 am local time. (This time seems right to me because I remember we were there in the late morning.) I haven't edited the photo in any way - this is the raw image I downloaded from my digital camera. My husband and I briefly visited the geyser as tourists. We didn't notice anything unusual in the sky at the time and we didn't hear any unusual noises. I only noticed this strange object when I later uploaded the photo from my camera phone (an iPhone 4) to my computer. It is possible that we were both distracted at the time because we were watching the geyser itself, which makes hissing and splashes noises as it shoots hot water from underground. There were several other tourists there and from memory they were all acting normal. I don't remember anyone pointing out anything in the sky. I took several other photos of the geyser and several short videos. The object does not appear in any of the other photos or the videos. Interestingly, the image I have emailed you is time-stamped as exactly 11:49:05 on my computer. The next photo I took is time-stamped 11:49:08 (which I assume means it was taken anywhere between 2 and 4 seconds later). The object is nowhere to be seen in that next photo, even though I took it from the same standing position. For this reason I really doubt that this object is dirt or grease on the camera lens. The object also appears to be reflecting the sun, so I believe it was something in the sky.

As I was driving down my street to my house, I saw 6 orange lights in the sky.  I was thinking at first they were Christmas lights someone had figured out how string high up in the sky across the street, but realized they were too high to be hung using the telephone poles.  My next thought was that they were strung somehow using the church steeple on one side; but couldn't figure out what was holding them up on the other side of the street.  I parked my truck, walked to the top of the driveway. I was planning on walking down to the church (1 block down) to see how they had strung the light across the street.  When I got to the top of my driveway, only 3 lights were left in the sky.  Not only that, but they were no longer crossing the street, they were now hovering over the homes one block up to the left.  I walked a couple houses up to get a better look. I realized the lights were forming a triangle! shaped object.  Then I realized I could acutally see the object against the dark sky.  It was a long, thin triangle about the size of the block it was hovering over.  It was also completley silent.  It was hovering and then began a lazy spin.  The tip of the triangle was spinning away from me.  I saw the two base corner lights.  The right base light faded, then the left base light.  It seemed to take a long time for the left base light to fade out.  When I realized there was an actual triangle shaped object hovering over the block of homes, I also realized that I must have first seen two triangle objects over the street.  I also realized that this meant the tips of the triangles were in the middle of the street, the bases on either side.  That is the only way to describe the lights I saw across the street.  Two vertical from each other on either side and two in the middle of the street.  I looked around to see if there was anyone else in the street who might have seen this! as well, and of course, there wasn't.  Neither did a car pass! by duri ng this time.  The area where I saw the triangle hovering is a quiet block of homes, however, the street they face is a pretty busy local street.  I would be surprised if I was the only one who saw this.  I'm going to listen to the 10:00 news to see if anyone else reported this, but that's probably futile.  I also know there are two airfields in the immediate area. One is Lambert Airfield, the other is Scott AirForce base.  I do remember a few years ago (8 or so maybe?) there was a report of a UFO that made the news on the Illinois side of the river.  I cannot identify what I saw, but I know I saw something I've never seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was about a half mile away, high above the tree tops and moving from west to east across the sky.  It was approximately 6 to 7:15 p.m. on Monday, June 20, and happened in Lafayette, Colorado. The object made no noise and was the color of steel.  When I first saw it, I thought it was a plane since it was moving through the sky, but I definitely saw the rounded right side of it, so I was confused about its identity.  I took a photo of it with my camera using the telephoto, and then continued to watch it cross the sky until it was no longer in my sight.  It moved in a straight horizontal pattern and did not dart around.  Its speed was similar to our airplanes.  Since I was not even thinking about UFOs, but merely taking photos of clouds, the sighting caught me off guard; I was bewildered or I would have taken more photos as it moved off. I was in an area next to a golf course.  No one was with me.  Since it was a while before I saw someone, and other things started being discussed, I forgot about what had happened.  A week ago, I finally had a chance to check my memory stick from my digital camera, and there was the photo I had taken!  I was so surprised to be seeing it clearly for the first time.

I then saw that no navigation lights were visible, and that the lights were traveling much to slowly for the normal F-15s I usually see.  The lights passed in front of me at about 2000 ft. elevation relative and what I estimate to be ¾ mile distance.  No structure was visible and the lights were separated by about ten diameters, with the front light above the rear light about 2-3 diameters . The impression was of a slowly flickering orange fire with a tinge of yellow ! around the edges. I turned on to Rt. 114 and travelled East toward my work and following the lights.  The lights seemed to speed up and they faded into the distance toward Poor Mt. above Roanoke, VA.  At the intersection of Rt. 114 and Rt. 460  I turned to the North toward my workplace in Blacksburg, VA.  I traveled about 1 mile and to the Northwest I again saw two orange flickering lights traveling Southeast approach me and begin a slow turn heading East.  I pulled my truck over at a car rental lot and got out and stood beside my vehicle as the lights passed in front of me at a distance this time of ¼ mile and about 1000 feet elevation relative.  The objects made no detectable sound.  My impression of the appearance of the lights was the same.  They continued their turn and proceeded to the Northeast fading into the distance over the Ellett valley.",2012-03-13T00:00:00,37.103904615384614,-80.42051846153846

Our family was traveling in the outskirts of Dallas, Texas.  Our GPS led us astray, and somehow we got off track, and started traveling down gravel roads instead of the turnpike which we should have taken in the first place.  We were traveling down this little highway when I looked up and noticed this black smoke ring up in the clouds.  Nothing else in the sky even resembled it, and I didn’t see any air craft in the area at all. In fact I took pictures of it and I had it in my view for miles.  I commented on it to my husband.  We live in Missouri, so I am not familiar with this area at all.  The closet town that we came to was Gunter, Texas. In one of the pictures I saw different crafts that I didn’t see with my eyes.  I thought it may have been dirt and grime on the wind shield, but if that we true the dirt would show up in the other frames.   This reminded me of something a smoker would puff up in the air but the smoke was very dark. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

To my right was the Salt Lake. The highway travels parallel to the dry lakebed.  I estimated the highway was about 20 yards above the bottom of the lake.   I had my cruise control set to 74mph. No radio, no other vehicles around.   A craft triangular in shape flew up alongside my car. It was approximately 75 feet from my vehicle.  Slow close I could see the texture of the paint.  It was triangular in shape, not unlike what a jet might look like, but triangular because there were no ‘wings’ on the craft but instead it was triangular in shape.  The paint was matt-black.  And the dome on the craft was yellowish and opaque. I noticed out my peripheral eye line that something was there.  I turned to look at it. The craft was perfectly visible out the passenger side window.  I estimated the length to be about 1.5 car lengths.  Maybe 15 long.  And the flying height to be at the same altitude off the lakebed as the highway was for it to be visible out my passenger window, maybe 60 -75 feet above the lakebed. As soon as I looked at it, it banked at a 45-60 degree angle and disappeared into a pinpoint as it reached the opposite side of the lake. I estimated and later confirmed the width of the lake to be 8-10 miles.  It took approximately 1.5 seconds for the craft to become a tiny dot on the other side of the lake.  Based on my math.  It appears that the craft flew at speeds in excess of 10,000 mph.  It made no sound whatsoever.  And seemed to fly around a corner in the lake as it disappeared.   It appeared to have a sort of anti-gravity component, as it came up to the car and then turned the way it did and was able to travel at such high speeds and so close to the bottom of the lake. I thought it must be military.  But as I have relayed the info. to some people I know including commercial pilots, the fact that it was completely silent makes one wonder.

There were no ""running lights"" – just one big light that I thought was red and my husband thought was yellow so maybe it was changing. No noise either. When I enlarge the 2nd pic on my camera it looks like there might have been 2 orbs???  The tail on the second pic (above and below) I think was from my moving the camera but not sure. It was traveling horizontally and then shot up dissappearing for a short time and then reappearing in one location and then quickly in another and then dissappeard again and then I saw it in ""space"" (up very high) traveling horizontally at an extrememly rapid speed - faster than any airplane would go and then dissappeared totally. It was difficult to check the characteristics below as I'm not sure on some of it.  The trail in the picture could be from my movement, it was pretty high in order for me to really determine if there was a haze or aura, there appeared to be some beams in one picture at the lower left corner and as mentioned above I thought it was red and my husband thought it was yellow, so it might have been changing color. Pictures were taken with a Sony camera set at ""twilight"" at 10:00 (approx.) at night.

The best way I can describe this thing was a glowing blue jellyfish with VERY short lash-like tentacles, or just a brighter glow underneath.  It wasn't bright flashing lights, it was a faint glow.  The closes thing I could find online, was a moon jellyfish, which of course isn't known to fly in the sky... and the view I had was from the side.  It had the swirling center just like the jellyfish, but I only saw two, instead of the clover pattern. No noises heard, but it was too far away to hear, even if it was.  I drove in that direction it went behind the treeline for another mile, and saw nothing.  After finding nothing online to explain what I saw, I told my mother the next day.  She said she had seen something also the day before.  On the 5th of February in the early morning as well, and she was a globe-like red object in the same area in the sky but a mile further way.

But as we moved further south the thing quickly appear to both of us as a small hang glider or experimental aircraft.

It was then we both got an incredible close-up view of this thing as follows: only about 4 feet in length, and about two feet across, dark dull gray in color with kind of like a tear drop shape, the rear being much smaller than the front.  There was something hanging just under the body, like a camera mount but no markings on the craft.  I was stunned at the proximity to us and failed to turn on my camera phone function.

I called my son in Nevada and asked him to look these things up on the computer.  He said there were some discussions abut a year ago that the Oregon department of agriculture was thinking about using drones.  Later that night, I got on the Internet myself and looked it up, only to find a ridiculous looking octopus shaped device with eight little helicopter blades which would be Oregon's drone.  What a laugh!  What we saw was actually sleek, quick and beautiful in a weird sort of way.  There was no visible means! of propulsion at all and as I said, no markings.

The sun had come up over the horizon and the sky was lit up with no clouds in that area of the sky.  Initially I thought the object looked too bright, to big, and oddly shaped to be any standard object found in the sky.  There were no other visible objects in the morning sky.  The object was approximately 30-40 arc-degrees above the horizon. I grabbed a pair of binoculars to inspect further.  Using the binoculars I saw a tear dropped shaped object that was approximately 10-20 times the size of a planet when viewed through the same binoculars.  The tear drop was orientated with the largest part of the shape towards the zenith and the narrowest point of the shape towards the horizon.  The shape wasn’t a perfect tear drop.  Along right hand side from the mid-point to the bottom there was a slight inward notch on the form. The object was a solid luminescent bluish white color with no interior features and fairly bright, possibly as bright as Venus maybe brighter.  Along the upper right edge of the shape the color was a little different being a very vibrant violet-blue in color, almost like light coming from a prism. I watched the object for approximately 40 minutes in this state.  During that time it appeared to move a short distance through the sky as if it was in a fixed position (i.e. Earth’s rotation was moving it through the sky). I wanted to rule out any planets being in the area so I went into the house to look up sky charts.  After looking at the star charts and ruling out the possibility of any planets being in that position I returned outside.  This was approximately 6:40am.  At that time the tear drop shaped object was gone and there were two other objects in that area.  My assumption is that the tear drop shaped object broke apart into these objects, but without seeing the transition I can’t say with certainty. The two new objects were approximately 3-4.5 arc-degrees apart from each other.  One was slightly below and to the left of the other.  The upper most object appeared to be a reddish orange object that changed shapes during the time that I observed.  It was approximately 1/5th the size of the original tear drop shaped object.  It brightness was significantly less than that of the tear dropped shaped object.  It kept changing shapes at one point it looked like Saturn with a ring around it, then it changed to a circle, then to half circle.  After that it appeared to rotate between circle, half circle, and an oval shaped object. The second object appeared to be a cluster of small individual white orbs.  The orbs within the cluster moved around in a chaotic fashion.  Every once in a while an orb would shoot up towards the zenith from the cluster.  It would travel for about 10 seconds or so in a slow, straight, trajectory before it faded out.  I studied the orb cluster for several minutes watching this same activity repeat itself until the cluster could no longer be seen. I then switched back to the reddish orange object.  I observed it for several more minutes.  It continued to cycle shapes, circular, oval, half circle, before I couldn’t see it anymore.  The event lasted till approximately 6:55am. I have spent some time studying the daytime and nighttime sky, as an amateur astronomer.  My daytime profession is that of an engineer.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,33.29885793871866,-111.86506392757661

Our children were playing outside in the front yard while the adults were talking inside the home (birthday party for one of the adults). Suddenly around 8:15pm (at dusk) all the children ran through the door yelling for us to come out. My brother-in-law and I went outside to see what all the commotion was about and all the kids were pointing toward the mountain and the sky. As I looked in the direction of where they were pointing, I clearly saw a tiny, reddish/orangish, circular object slowly floating away from the half way point of the mountain and into the sky (with NO noise whatsoever). The object continued up until it hit about 1,500 feet (no way to really tell how high) and then nearly stopped and moved horizontal to the left about 200 feet. Then it STOPPED! And for about 4 seconds in twinkled almost like a star, and then POOF it was gone! STRANGE TO SAY THE LEAST!!!  I then quizzed my son, 13 years old, about what he saw. He said that initially when he saw the light it was larger then when I saw it and it was ON the mountain's half way point, and in his words, ""Dad, I thought it was a campfire."" He said, that the ""campfire"" just lifted off the mountain and started to float up. Again, STRANGE!  After we talked about it for about 30 minutes, my brother-in-law decided to call the police. They came to the home in about 15 minutes and we gave a full report...and they mentioned that no one else had called it in. It was funny because one of the officers was on his first day on the job!  To be clear, there are NO homes, structures, or any man made things at the half way point of this mountain...just pure mountain, and no trees...just shrub oak. There is no way that it was a plane, helicopter, balloon, model rocket, laser beam, etc...at least not by my observation. I don't believe in the traditional ""UFO"" concept, nor do I believe that creatures from other planets visit this earth in a ""UFO"" sort of way...but I have to admit, this was really weird, thus the post.

To the south I noted a light coming towards me heading north to cross the highway.  It caught my eye because the leading light on this craft was a pale-blue, or almost aqua in color and did not flash. As I watched it start to pass over me I noticed only a rear light, which I can only describe as a dull dirty white glow.  It was difficult to make out the shape of the object because of the time of day, it was twilight, and the sun had gone down below the horizon. I thought that it might be a helicopter and I expected to see that shape, but that is not the impression I got of it from its silhouette.  The object was not moving fast and seemed very low, if I had to guess, I would say that it was maybe 500 feet above the ground and travelling at approximately 100 mph. In closing, I spotted this object coming from the South, heading North and it seemed to be passing slightly west of Milford, Nebraska.  There were no flashing lights, as one would expect to see from an FAA aircraft.   If you have any answers as to what this may have been, I would truly appreciate it.

The shine was most bright in the middle of the object and faded as it got closer to the sides of the object where you could see medal it looked like tin foil.  This object was about 6 or 7 times the size of when you look at the sun.  It was only maybe 500 or so feet directly in front of me. It took up about 2 or 3 of the limbs on the tree.  There was not a cloud in the sky.  I do not remember the shape but I know it was a solid shape like a circ! le or octagon or some kind of shape like that.  There was nothing hanging off the object like wings of propellers.  This whole time I was on the phone with a friend (she is planning on making a report of what happened on her side of the line.)  But I thought I had only seen it for a glimpse of a second.  But my friend told me I stopped talking for over a minute.   When I came to the other side of the curve there was a few trees, but the object was no longer there.  I think the weirdest part is that there was NO noise at all.  I do remember as soon as I saw the object I was so infatuated with it.  It happened so fast but just remember being amazed not even thinking about if it was a plane or not but just wanting to see it.

In the distance, to the east, I saw one orb approaching as if it were 1/2 mile away. It proceeded west across the sky from the east, with the path crossing approximately at Square Lake Road. (It would have crossed Rochester Road as well.)  The second orange tinted orb followed the same path about 5 minutes later. Height was approximately at 4 or 5 stories high.  (I viewed them from 2nd story.)  Reason I saw the orbs: I was watching the eastern sky due to a brilliant full moon, and very bright skies; spectacular night. However, it was curious:  There were a star-like object in the east, about 3 to 4 inches above tree-line to the east; I cannot determine how far away, perhaps a mile or two?   (There is no way to determine.)  The object does not seem to have been a plane because it hovered for 3+ hours; I was checking it every half hour.  It would move up and down, and over about 3 inches every so often. The two orbs came from the same direction of the star-like object to the east. I do not believe the objects were Chinese lanterns, which was my first thought.  (I saw what I guess were Chinese Lanterns in this same area during early fall of 2011; a few neighbors saw them, too.  I observed about 4 or 5 orbs that night; they all following a similar path, and seemed to be moving at wind speed; they passed by about every 10 or 15 minutes.  The neighbors saw 21 of them over a few hours, so we all thought perhaps they were for a birthday celebration--with Chinese Lanterns.)   They did look like they could be floating paper bags of some sort, higher than tree level, but not as high as airplane level. At any rate, I explain the Fall 2011 suspected Chinese Lantern event for comparison purposes:  The orange-like tinted light orbs of 2/9/2012 did not look the same as the lanterns; they moved faster, were detected much farther away, and had a more intense light. It was this evening that I googled orange orbs over Troy and discovered this website. Today, I read that others saw the orbs, so I have decided to report the event.  (I was trying to dismiss the event somewhat these past few weeks; but the star-like light low in the east was quite intriguing.)",2012-03-13T00:00:00,42.56675797546012,-83.15395782208589

They were all regrouped together above in the sky at the left of the port entrance of Puerto Vallarta _ a bit higher then the 3 ~10 floor buildings just at the entrance of the port at Puerto Vallarta. They all came as one group and then spread apart at the horizon in the sky, but stayed within a kind of close formation.

It started by one of those 8 lights that all the sudden flew closer toward our direction, and slowly drop down (within a fraction of a second and absolutely no noise at all) what seemed to me to be like maybe a few 100 feet in the sky... then another object all the sudden kind of detached from this first object and slowly went down to the water vertically, directly below that first objet, but very, very slowly dropping down into the ocean. At the time that it detached itself from the first object I noticed some kind of sparks or flares coming from the point where both separated from themselves. It was now two big round objects and it looked like metal in fusion sparkling over, which lasted only a second. As the new object was dropping into the water (in about 3-4 sec) and again totally without any noise, the first ball went smaller like it was going away from us and up at the same time, then it disappeared totally. Two other rounded objects then did the same thing, but this time there was no flares or sparks as they released each another their own object, They also seemed to stay at the same level and position, while each one were releasing a new object, which were dropping too into the water directly underneath them.  Once the last of the 3 round balls went into the water, they all vanished in the sky. It was like within a fraction of a second they all became very tiny dots then vanished completely... If it would have been only flares, I would have seen lights or glares coming from down below and up, but there were no lights below at all. By the time 3 of those objects drop each 3 other objects, about 4 of them were spread apart to what I would say, half of the bay.

My daughter, a new driver, and I saw an object while driving north on route 43, just outside of Hartville, Ohio.  It was just after 10:00 PM, on Thursday, February 9th, when we were just coming out of town, and I first saw three bright white lights which were pointing down, and a single flashing red light.  From a distance of about a half mile, it looked like a hovering and rotating helicopter, which was at about 300 feet off the ground.  I asked my daughter if she was seeing the lights and she was seeing them too.  I asked her what she thought it was and at first it seemed to look like a helicopter, as I said before, but neither of us could really distinguish what we were seeing.  As we got closer, we realized it was not a helicopter, because it was way too large.  It was as big as a commercial jet. As it rotated, I thought it might be a very low commercial jet liner, and the bright lights were the lights you see on jets during low visibility, but there were no clouds at all.  The moon was very bright, since the night before was the full moon. As we got closer, we realized it definitely was not a commercial jet either.  Yes, it was as large as one, but at last, we could see it clearly.  It was a large (isosceles) triangular craft, muted or flat black, with the bright white lights on each point, and the fact that it rotated flat, while hovering in the same place, quickly ruled out a commercial jet. When we first saw it, it seemed to be pointing east and slowly it rotated 180 degrees and as we got nearly underneath it, the lights turned and pointed outward and it began moving, silently to the west.  It was huge, and there were lights underneath, alternating red and white in a row from the tip or front, to the center of the rear, and these lights pulsed in a line from front to back.  It began moving slowly, but seemed to gain speed as it moved, but I never saw it accelerate fast. As I said it seemed to gain speed, or momentum, as it moved towards the west. At this point we entered the first turn (left) in an S turn on route 43, north, and as my daughter continued driving, I watched the triangular craft move towards the west and as we entered the right turn, I lost sight of it because of the trees and the fact that it was moving west as we were moving north. The whole event took about two to three minutes. I wondered out loud, with my daughter, whether we just saw a new type of blimp, since we were a few miles south east of the Wingfoot Lake Airship Operations Hanger for Goodyear.  I truly wondered if that could be what we saw, and I did not want to freak her out, either, if what we saw was not from here.  It was truly a UFO, and it was just too weird, no noise and we did not see any windows either.  We saw the color, the shape, the size, the unusual flight characteristics and movement, but if we did not see the lights, we probably would not have seen it at all. Our backgrounds are as follows:  I am a college educated IT professional, an entrepreneur, a coach, as well as a city board member and my daughter is a high school sophomore, honors student and a two sport varsity athlete, preparing for a post secondary program and a possible major in the medical field.",2012-03-13T00:00:00,40.9586,-81.309

I woke up several times that night and it was Friday morning about 3:15 a.m. when I looked at my clock.  I turned over to get comfortable again and settled in when I heard a very faint noise.   At first I thought it might be my own breathing so I held my breath then heard it again.  As I listened it appeared to get louder which is when I realized it was getting closer.  The noise was always whisper quiet and almost sounded like heat going into a hot air balloon but not as harsh.  It was consistent but not rhythmic and not fast.   I turned my head and could not see any light around the edge of the window curtains and heard no noise from the wind chime on my front porch.  At the loudest point (which was not very loud) the house groaned as the air pressure seemed to change like something was passing overhead.   Then noise began to get softer again as it seemed to move away until I cou! ldn’t hear it any more.

We were naming the various constellations that we could identify when we noticed this obviously flashing, rather than twinkling star, cruising across the night sky at a notable pace. I thought nothing of it just as my friends did. But as my curiosity faded, the flashing object (which was flashing blue-red-blue-white-blue-red-blue-white) had stopped suddenly right above the horizon.  I noted that this “thing” was no longer a satellite.  It was just stationary for maybe 2-3 minutes, until it started to bounce around in a bumblebee-like manner, almost if it were pacing in an infinity symbol or figure 8. It continued to just roam around the sky freely. Back and forth up and down side to side. This “satellite” then came to an abrupt stop. It just dropped very slowly and consistently downward and then to another stationary position. My friends were still sol! d on the idea of it being a satellite because, “Dude, satellites are advanced now the have propulsion. They can do whatever they want.” I argued the point of earth’s infinite orbit and how something in it could not have the capabilities to just stop. After that we were done marveling.

Road is not highly populated w/homes & street lights are few and far between so it was quite dark.  I was the only car on the road.  As I looked up, 2 triangle shaped objects went right over top of my car in a northern direction (I went back next day w/compass to check this out). I was shocked at how low they were - barely higher than the trees lining the road - and that I hadn't heard their engines.  Put my window down a bit to see if I heard anything but it was completely silent - as if they were gliding. They weren't going super fast - again, just kind of gliding thru the air. One was behind the other so close they were nearly touching. I hardly think any type of planes would be flying so dangerously low or that incredibl! y close to each other. There was a light on the front tip but I cannot remember color.  On the tips (wings?) yellow lights for sure. I believe a light on the back as well but am not positive about this. Went back next day in daylight to see what was beyond the trees to my left (the direction they were headed) & if it looked like a place where 2 planes could have been gliding in for landing. It was a field but I couldn't imagine these large objects could or even would land there in total darkness.  I'm so mad at myself for not grabbing my iphone & taking a picture.

As we drove west up 11800 South (west of Herriman High School) toward Bacchus Highway, I noticed a large light in the sky. I wondered at first if this was an airplane, due to its brightness, however the object didn’t appear to move. It remained stationary in the sky, slightly elevated above the top of the mountain range.  I pointed it out to my spouse who could clearly see it. I watched the light the entire time during our drive back home, about 15-20 minutes. The light was still visible by the time we arrived home. I quickly went inside to get my small video camera and went out onto the stairs behind our house. I was able to film the object for approximately 5-6 minutes. I am not very talented when it comes filming, so the video is shaky. I had to zoom out and in several times, but once I was able to locate it in the viewfinder I saw it fairly clearly. I watched the object as closely as I could. It appeared to grow larger and smaller, possibly brighter and dimmer, but always quite bright. When it appeared larger, I could just make out a smaller ball of more concentrated light in the center. I was able to film what appeared to be something solid moving across the front of the object from left to right, which obstructed the light. It reminded me a bit of a lunar eclipse, but the dark form blocking the light in front of the object wasn’t as big as t! he object itself. After watching the object for about 5-6 minutes on camera, it gently dimmed and vanished. I waited with the camera rolling for about one more minute to see if it would come back, but it was cold and I decided to go inside without seeing it again. I checked outside several times that night to see if it had re-appeared, but I never saw it.  I have been looking for it every day since, and I haven’t seen it again.  I know there is other amateur video on YouTube of a strikingly similar object hovering over the same mountain range, yet filmed from Tooele, which is on the other side of the mountain range from where I filmed my object. The skeptic in me says it was some sort of extremely bright light they use at Kennecott for mining, but I’m fairly certain it wasn’t touching the mountain and I haven't seen it before in the five years we have lived out here.

Our back yard has another residence about 60 - 75 feet north of where we were standing.  I noticed what I thought was an aircraft to the north when two more bright red objects appeared over the roof of the residence to the north. I was in the USMC air-wing.  I grew up studying aircraft of all types.  I know what they look like day, or night.  They were red and white, but not blinking steadily.  They appeared more like a twinkling between red and white, only far brighter than any navigational lights I've ever seen.  I would have said they were fireworks, but fireworks don't fly off at an upward angle like these did. I got my wife's attention, saying: ""Look at that!"", while pointing at the two new red objects.  They were gaining altitude and heading west at about a 25 degree angle from the horizontal.  They another one appeared over the roof.  And another, and still another.   There were six in all.  They weren't in any formation unless it was so staggered it didn't look like a formation, but they all originated at approximately the same place and all were on a relatively similar, but not exact trajectory.  After about 8 - 10 minutes they had disappeared one by one. Neither my wife, Nor I have ever seen anything like these things, and I'm familiar enough with all types of aircraft to know aircraft when I see them. At air shows I can point at a B-17, tell that it's a G model, recall that there were just over 12,000 made and it has four Wright 16-20 1200HP engines and a crew of 10.  At one air show, a group of old timers were looking up asking what the aircraft were that were flying over at about 10,000 ft.  I looked up and told them they were OV-10s.

It then moved to the right horizontally, lights still flashing.  The object then moved to right and up.

To whom it may concern,  On the evening of Sept 19th 2011at about 8:45-9:00 pm I was driving home and noticed an orange ball/sphere in the sky. I was heading north and only a few min away from my house.  At first it didn’t look like it was moving, as I kept driving north I tried to keep my eye on it, it was moving pretty fast though because by the time I got home which was about the equivalent of 2 city blocks it was already in the south end of the sky and appeared to be a little smaller than when I originally saw it. The movement it made was forward but in small increments up and then down, it never moved from side to side and it was way too large to be a plane, I would say it was about the size of a full moon quartered. When I got out of my car I immediately looked for it, at the same time I was getting out of my car my neighbors were getting into their car.  I brought it to their attention; I asked “what is that?” “Do you see that up there?”  I have seen the man only a few times as they just moved in a few weeks ago and I had never spoken to them before. At first they looked at me like if I was not all there, but then when they saw it also we were all in awe, and just watched it until it disappeared in the sky going south. It was like nothing I have ever seen before and I had no doubt whatsoever this was a true UFO.  It was too large to be a plane and the movement was different. It didn’t have a haze around it nor did it have a “tail”. I have seen other strange lights in the sky, I was never really sure of what they were but they could always be explained away.  This one caught my eye because of the size and the color.  Very intense orange like a fire contained in a ball. I have to say it left me feeling “invaded” somehow, not as safe as I had felt before. I always believed we are not alone on this planet but I NEVER thought I would ever see something that would seal it for me. When it finally disappeared my neighbors thanked me for bringing it to their attention, I’m just glad I wasn’t the only one who saw it, I’m glad there were other witnesses.  I know no one would believe me if it was just me but the fact that there were 2 other people there and the fact that I didn’t know them prior, made me feel better about the sighting. Thank you for your time",2011-10-10T00:00:00,40.42028898809524,-104.75199613095239

On the way to the car I looked up as I do often when the stars are showing but it was 6:33 and the sun was about to come up so there was only 2 showing, And I thought that one of the stars was Brighter than normal at that our in the morning, the other being the north star or whatever star is almost directly straight up (I just call it the north star because I thought that was supposed to be the brightest star but I'm to lazy to do the research). I told my girlfriend to check it out... and she said I don't think that's a star i think its a plane or something because its moving.... I replied yeah it is moving isn't it?, but its to bright and its not blinking like airplane lights and it looks to high anyways maybe its the space station and somethings going on up there that's why its like testing that's why its so bright. Now what happened next is something almost like what I always see on u tube videos when I look up UFO videos.... instead of just flying straight and really slow like the space station always does.... its speed increased, then slowed, then slowly increased again and started curving like a car would to take a corner going right at an intersection, i don't know how else to explain it because it didn't turn a little or alot, but then curved back the opposite it then faced when it took its right hand turn and curved in the shape i would compare with a car making if it was to do a u-turn like a perfect half circle then I lost track of it in what looked to me like above the clouds. I Said to my girlfriend Wow that's not the space station did you see it turn like that? she said yeah its probably an airplane. I replied NO WAY, Airplanes don't turn like that they bank.. and they don't turn left and right and speed up and slow down, or have lights that bright, and besides, don't they blink? I really think We just saw a UFO. She laughed it off but I'm pretty convinced it was something.. I'm not saying little green men but I Am sure it wasn't an airplane or the space station... and not a star since we both say the same thing its not that we where getting dizzy looking up. I wanted to call the airport and ask if there was something wrong with a plane or something but that sounded stupid.... so I called 411 to see if there was anyplace to report this kind of thing and she suggested the police department and connected me... but I couldnt see it behind the couds and I wasnt about to tell a police officer I thought I saw a UFO. So i asked my girlfriend to look up on google who you call if you see an unidentified flying object and she got your hotline so i left a message this morning. I mean the whole experience probably was under 45 seconds.... It wasnt some long drawn out deal but it thought it might be important to tell somone I just wish i would have gotten it on video on my iphone, and still wish I had been able to talk to the airport and see if maybe some plane was flying manually in different directions or malfunctioning to explain the fluctuating speeds. Just thought I would tell SOMONE. So this is it I did and thats all I know and saw this morning.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,43.54381423001949,-96.72227173489279

As I looked up into the darkening sky I saw 4 bright orangish, yellow fireballs in a diamond formation.   These flashes of light all appeared very low in the sky.  Immediately they got much brighter and larger but stayed in the same general position for a second or two.  They then disappeared as quickly as they had appeared.  The light seemed to fade out and slightly upwards and the scene was over in 3 seconds. About 20 seconds later as I was staring dumbfounded at the sky wondering where they went, 2 fighter jets came flying in to the exact vicinity where the ufo's disappeared.  They were very high and not identifiable to the visible eye as fighter jets but the roar of the engines were so loud and the speed at which they traveled was so fast there is no question that is what they were.  These 2 jets then began combing the sky, from the east towards the west, and back and forth for the next 30 minutes, at least.    Once I realized they were fighter jets searching for the ufo's I called my hunting partner who was 7 miles away from my position.  I knew nobody would believe me so I wanted my cynical friend to see the jets.  Well we were talking on the phone and he heard and spied the jets too.  Within another minute or two both of us identified 3 orange fireballs, now much further to the west.  From my location they were in a line and they once again only appeared for a few seconds, brightened, and then quickly faded away.  My friend counted 3 also and was saying that there was another orange fireball, the fourth, more directly above him.  I could not see that one.  However, the fighter jets were combing the sky where they disappeared, they were clearly tracking and trying to follow the ufos. It was also Monday night football and the Packers were playing the Vikings at 7:30 PM.  They were supposed to have a fighter jet flyover before the game, which never happened, my brothers were at the game and no jets did the pre game flyover, they were all busy with the ufos. About 8:30 PM, we were watching the packer game in the cabin.  I thought I could hear more fighter jets and looked out the window.  Both of us saw another orange globe of light west of Wautoma that disappeared seconds after seeing it.

Both objects were stationary and appeared to be stars at first, although I wondered if one might be a planet.  They were perhaps 2 to 5 degrees apart (uncertain exactly but not right next to each other).  In retrospect 24 hours later I would hazard two finger widths apart. Jupiter was visible about 50 degrees to the left of the pair and at roughly the same height above the horizon.  My thought was it might be something that would be mentionable in a current astronomical magazine due to the strikingness of the combination.  Only minutes to moments before, I was checking out 3 high-flying aircraft in the northern sky. I had been out at night on my bike frequently all throughout this year and it must have seemed unfamiliar enough to me to zero-in on it so quickly when I first looked in another direction.  The upper object was the brightest shining with almost approximately the same magnitude as Jupiter (although it seemed a bit smaller than Jupiter).  The lower object was not especially exceptional other than possibly being a brighter star for a lower altitude.  Both objects appeared whitish.  Jupiter appeared to be about 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon incidentally. Muddling the matter were high and elongated thin cirrus clouds nearing the pair. Anyway as I was looking at the two the brighter one dimmed into nothingness quite abruptly (but it did breathtakingly dim as it wasn’t quite instantaneous).  This occurred before any obscuring by clouds [emphasis: certainty]. The puzzling aspect however was that it appeared absolutely stationary and not moving like a satellite would be moving out of solar glare.  Once years ago I viewed the ISS at Kennedy Space Center and that seemed to travel at a fair pace across the sky, though I wonder now how it would appear at the very end of visibility. I noted the time via my cell phone at 18:05 hours.  I then resumed riding and as best as possible given conditions continued to observe  that area of the sky for almost 30 minutes but high and thin clouds had more or less covered that region of the sky preventing visibility in that region. I was unable to get a clear fix on the second object which might have dimmed out soon after the first one or it may have been a star slowly masked by the cloud cover.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,,

I noticed four dimly lit objects over the city, moving in a straight line from the direction of Lake Erie towards the northeast.  At first glance I thought these were the lights on the wings of a far away commercial aircraft, but appeared too low in the sky and were approaching too quickly. I noticed a corresponding whistling sound as they approached.  The sound was not unlike the sound from those whistling Nerf balls.  It was changing and varied, as if there were more than one Nerf ball sounding at once. It was not loud, but clearly audible.  I could then see that there were four separate objects.  They were black or dark gray, seemingly lit on the underside from the lights of the city. There was also the dim yellow light coming from each, probably coming from the leading tip of the object, because the light was less visible once th! e objects passed overhead. The four objects were flying very near to one another in a flexible delta formation. The formation was like a small flock of birds; imperfect and changing, but they were moving inexplicably quickly with no visible wings.  I noticed them just before they were directly overhead, and were out of sight and earshot within 10 seconds.  I was not able to discern the shape clearly, but my best guess would be rounded triangles, similar to the “flying wing” design of the F117 Nighthawk. They all appeared identical to one another. As they passed, the sounds diminished accordingly, and I quickly lost track of them in the night sky.  Both my friend and I were duly creeped out and went back inside immediately.",2012-01-12T00:00:00,42.902226093175315,-78.85083919084595

The craft continued at a constant speed towards us at an altitude of between 2000 and 10 000 feet.  As no one could figure out what it was, we joked that it could be aliens and that the craft would zip away.  As soon as that was said, the craft seemed to vanish. About 5 minutes later, a second craft appeared and followed the exact course as the previous, moved at the same speed, and vanished at the same time. Another 5 minutes passed before the third and final craft appeared.  As this one appeared, a friend (who is an amature astronomer) quickly ran and got 2 sets of binoculars. As this craft followed the same course, and the same speed, we could see that it was a disk shaped opbject giving off a bright orange light.  At the point where the previous 2 vanished, one of us continued to follow it.  He says that it it shut off the orange lights, but had visible smaller blue lights under the body of the craft.

I have been a police officer for ten years, and I served active duty in the United States Army in a reconnaissance unit.  One of my duties in the military was to observe and be able to identify aircraft from many countries, primarily those from the United States and the former Soviet Union.  I am also a huge fan of helicopter aviation. I was working patrol on the night of 7/16/11 on the 2230-0630 shift.  I was in uniform and in a marked patrol car.  While patrolling on a main street in town, I was driving southeast away from the lake and toward the downtown area.  At approximately 2352 hrs., I noticed a single, white light in the sky moving northwest.  The light appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 1,000-2,000 feet over the downtown area.  I first thought the object was a helicopter.  Just up the street from me was a large hospital which averages probably 4-5 medical helicopter transports a week.  I am very familiar with the medical helicopters which frequent my area, and after a few seconds I realized that what I was seeing was not a helicopter.  I also heard absolutely no sound from the object. As the light came toward me, I realized that it had no navigational or hazard lights (the green and red lights which flash on an aircraft).  It had a single, white light.  It was very bright at first.  As it got closer to being directly overhead, I noticed that the light appeared to be cigar shaped.  But as it got even closer to being overhead, the light seemed to dim.  By the time it was overhead (approximately one minute since I first saw it), it was as dim as most of the stars in the sky.  In fact, if it hadn't been moving, I probably would have thought that it was a star. I actually stopped my patrol car in the middle of the street and had to stick my head out of my driver's side window to look up at the object because it was directly overhead.  The object continued to move northwest, but it was dim and appeared to be much higher than when I first saw it.  In fact, it appeared then that it was 10,000 feet or higher. Then I was amazed when the object stopped dead in it's tracks and began to zig and zag, back and forth!  It went in all directions.  I would estimate that if it was 10,000 high it was probably moving maybe 200 feet in each direction around the point where it had stopped. It became difficult for me to watch the object with my head sticking out the car window and looking over the roof of the car to my west, so I made a u-turn and parked along the curb.  I could now see the object by looking out of my window toward the west.  Shortly after I parked, I phoned my wife to tell her what I was seeing.  My cell phone indicated that I called my wife at 2353 hrs. on 7/16/11. Just after I started talking to my wife, the object stopped zigging and zagging and it began to move toward the east.  Just then, another police unit with two officers pulled up and asked what I was doing.  I ended the phone call with my wife and I informed the officers about the object that I was watching.  We then exited our respective vehicles while we watched the object.  Both officers saw what I was seeing.  One of them believed it to be an aircraft.  The other officer said she wasn't sure what it was. As we watched the object continue east, we noticed an aircraft far out in front of it, also flying east.  The object and the aircraft appeared to be around the same altitude, but the object had become so dim that it was hard to determine how high it was.  In fact, several times the object's light appeared to fade out completely and then quickly fade back in.  However, at no time did the light of the object appear to flash or blink. All three of us watched the object move east and, once again, it stopped in mid flight and began to zig and zag around the point it stopped.  The one officer continued to believe that the object was an aircraft, and the other officer said she didn't know what it was.  Then the other officers had to move their vehicle because they had stopped in the travel lane and they were blocking traffic.  I got back into my vehicle and drove east and parked in a parking lot one block east of my original location where I continued to watch the object.  It continued east and its light faded in and out a few more times.  I lost track of where the aircraft, which I had seen in front of it, had flown.  Then I received a call for service from my dispatcher and I had to leave the area.  The total time I watched the object was approximately 15 minutes. Later that night I looked to the sky in the direction I last saw the object but I didn't see it again.  Through the course of the night I did see two meteorites, one to the north of town over the lake and one to the south.  However, I am familiar with what meteorites look like and the object I watched was NOT a meteorite. Later in my shift I tried to call the local international airport to see if they had any aircraft or any other contacts on radar at that time.  But I only got an automated system and was never able to get through to anyone there.",2011-08-07T00:00:00,42.09974517647059,-80.07763388235293

It was a continuous ""string"" of lights, as you will see in the video, at times certain objects out of the group would accelerate past the others, proving that these were not ""lanterns"" or anything sent into the sky.  If they were balloons they would not be traveling in a perfect formation like these were, they would scatter or simply travel upward and disappear.

At the time I snapped the photo, I did not see anything in the sky.  Reviewing the photos the next day I realized that what I had formerly assumed was the sun, was casting a shadow, which seemed unlikely.  After further review I realized the object was rectangular and not round.  I put the photo on to my computer so that I could zoom in, and saw that it is actually four sun colored lights in a row. I researched the time of sunset for this area on that day and it said the sun had set at 8:14 p.m..  I also realized that facing East, I would never have captured a photo of the sunset anyway, which as we all know sets in the West; let alone a sunset casting a shadow.  I was between The Breakers Hotel and the Estee Lauder Estate.  The only sounds I heard were the ocean and some birds.

Generally a cigar shape or rectangular shape with angular-to-rounded ends at front and rear. No wings.  No delta shape.  No stubs on sides.  No tail appendages. Silent.  No engine sounds.  No air rushing past ""fuselage"" area. No vapor trail.  No smoke trail. Precise straight line and constant velocity flight. Hard to determine size of object and its altitude, since it had no wings, and it was not an organic (fowl such as goose, hawk, duck, etc)  Sharp contrast of straight black edges of ""fuselage"" to blue sky and to white clouds it passed under. Flying under base of clouds provided limit to estimate of altitude. My feeling of my eyes focusing on the object gave a sense that I was focusing at infinity focus, meaning, I can only estimate object was from 600-feet to less than 10,000-feet altitude. Bottom of object was solid black and non-reflective. No Gaussian distribution of any reflected light, giving sense that bottom was flat or nearly flat and matte or was a complete light absorbent. Could never focus on indistinct rear area. As it was nearing a virtual intersection (my point of view) with another small white cloud, while still in blue sky, with a large gap of blue sky between it and the cloud ahead, while easily resolvable in size, color, shape, contrast, while not shrinking via perspective lines into a dot, while not fading and not blending with the sky’s water vapor, It discretely winked out. It suddenly, instantaneously disappeared. Testing the idea the object may be a science test of visibility cloaking (contrast reduction technique), I expected to see a silhouette of it against the cloud wall as its path would lead it there in the next 4 seconds.  No silhouette appeared. I would not expect a test of dynamic adaptable contrast to occur from my observer’s point of view while it transitioned from one level of background luminosity (the sky) to another (the cloud column); I was not involved in any such test; There was no apparent observer’s station in sight. There was no deviation in pitch, roll, or yaw before it winked out. Time of duration of sighting: approximately 7 seconds as object transitioned from observer’s initial overhead sighting to its discreet and sudden disappearance. Angles of transition: approximately 90 degrees (from occultation by neighbor’s roof line) to approximately 45 degrees before it suddenly winked out. Felt no emotional reaction. Was reflective on uncanny sensation of feeling need to look up just in time to see it emerge from roof line. Perfect timing. My seated position was facing NNE, as was direction of object. Fig. 1.

Just before we were going back into the house I noticed a bright light in the north eastern sky.  At first I thought it was an airplane. However the light which at first seemed to be the headlight of an airplane within four or five seconds faded to only the brightness of the smaller dimmer stars in the surrounding sky. The object was travelling in a south east direction and slightly away from my position.  After the light had dimmed the object never seemed to change in speed but the direction was definately moving away from us.  It remained dim and I followed it until it got too small to see.  It seemed to be going away from earth.  This all took place in under a minute.  What ever I saw was moving faster then any airplane I've seen.  I don't know, it's very hard to explain. There are several small airport""s nearby and we are situated about halfway between BWI and Philly Intl.   I know that some people could confuse an airplane at great distance, but I am confident it was not an airplane because it was nowhere near the normal air traffic lanes for those two major airports.  I am puzzled as to what I may have seen?  I have always looked up when I'm outside at night and seen many aircraft and shooting stars alike.  I just have no frame of reference what I saw.  Is it possible for a meteor to merely pass through our atmosphere?  If so that would be a logical explaination for what I saw. Thank You",2011-08-07T00:00:00,39.61701592920354,-75.86718938053099

It was low but I could not actually see anything but a white light.  It was like it was racing or keeping up with me.  I mentioned it to my granddaughter and she looked over and saw it.  I told her I was only going 35-40 miles and it would pass us when we stopped for the red light.  When I stopped it stopped. (on a dime). When the traffic light turned green I started it started.   I was in shock I was afraid to go home so I went to Walgreens the plane or whatever stayed in the sky until I began to drive again and followed me to the post office.  I called my son and daughter and another friend.  No one answered.  I went in the post office to get some stamps and returned to my van. The plane or whatever was still hovering in the sky.  My son called me back and I told him what was happening.  My son said a plane could not stop like that.  I heard no sound from the flying object.  I only saw a big bright light.  I proceeded to 24 hr Wal-Mart about 15 miles away.  On my way there I asked my grand daughter if she saw it following us.  When she looked up she said yes and another one has joined it, but it had a smaller white light flying right  next to it.  When I pulled into Wal-Mart parking lot there was another flying object that had a red and green light on either side.  I could not see what was in between the lights. It hovered over Wal-Mart as we entered the store.  We stayed in the store for about 1 hour and came out the doors at the opposite end.  We decided to exit Wal-Mart from the opposite end from where we entered. When we stepped off the curb and into the parking lot the object with the red and green lights followed us to my van.  The other two were still at the end of the store where we had entered at just standing still and very close together.  When we got inside the van my daughter called and I was explaining to her what was happening.  Then I began to see more of the objects with the green and red lights. There were approaching from the North. So I began to tell her “here comes another one and another one and another one”.  She asked me what was going on and I said I don’t know.  I was freaking out but trying to stay calm for my granddaughter.  Then the smaller lights began to arrive as well.  When I pulled out of the parking lot there were approximately 6 objects with the red and green lights and 12 of the white smaller lights that were following me.  This time I traveled the expressway.  We could still see! more and more white lights coming toward us from the left and the right.  I pulled on the median on the expressway and stopped.  When I stopped they all stopped.  It was late and my grand daughter had school the next day, so I told her we would just go home.  We went home and the lights followed us all the way home and was hovering over the parking lot and my apartment.  The big white light was right on top of my apartment.  We counted approx 30 of the white lights and the red and green lights stayed on the perimeter.  We went in and I told her not to cut the TV on or any lights.  We closed all the blinds.  I went back outside with my camera and took 4 pictures, because I thought people would not believe me.   I went back outside around 3am and they were still in the sky.  I went to sleep.  I did not think about them any more until Thursday night February 16, 2012 around 7pm, we were leaving a restaurant and my granddaughter told me to look up and there was the big bright light.  I said not again!  As were on our way to bible study the white light was following us.  Then came the smaller light beside it.  Then we could see more lights begin to follow us down the expressway.  When we got off at the exit we say the red and green lights but only one of those this time.  We proceeded to our destination and got out of the van and counted 9 white lights that followed our every driving move.  Bible study was over at 8:30pm.  We came out and counted the white lights again it was 12.  We proceeded home and we could see more and more joining the other lights.  When we arrived home we counted 20 of the objects with white lights that had followed us home.  I called another of my friends and was counting them.  Then people from the other apartment building came outside to! smoke and the lights lifted straight up in the air and just appeared like stars.  I told my friend what had happened.  They were no longer visible, just faintly.  But I could still see the one with the big bright light.  When the neighbors went inside, the white lights descended again.  They are not spread out like planes would need room, but these are close together.  And the one with the big bright light appears to be the leader, because it always appear solo and first.  Friday night February 17, 2012 when it got dark outside I looked out the window and called to my granddaughter to come and look.  The white lights were back over the apartment again.  She said I’m going outside to see.  She came back in and said there are more than before.  I put my shoes on and went outside and looked up there were more than before.  I did not bother to count them.  I walked up the street to the mail box and they followed me to the mailbox and back down the street.  My daughter in law came over to pick up my granddaughter and I told her what was happening. I told her to watch as the lights followed me up the street and back down.  She just stood there with her mouth open.  She had no explanation.  She was wondering if it were good or bad.  I don’t know but I wish these lights or whatever would STOP following, watching or whatever they are doing. As me and my daughter in law were looking up a normal plane flew over and we could hear and make out that it was ! a plane. We saw the body and wings on it.  I called another of my friends and she suggested that I call and report it.  So that is what I decided to do.  This is an eerie feeling because I don’t know why me of all people in the world why me?  If you have any information you can help me know what or who is following me PLEASE let me know.  I was calling them planes at first but planes can’t stop on a dime and go that slow and stay in the air and just hover for long periods of time.  I need some logical explanation of what is happening and why I am being followed by all of these light things.  This is very serious and I am concerned for me and my granddaughter’s safety.

After staring at them for a few minutes, he opened the door and called myself and my cousin out to view said lights. As my cousin and I came out to view the object, a third light began to appear intermittently. We continued to stare for almost 45 minutes, only going back inside to quickly search for a number to call to report, for a video camera, and for our phones. Additionally, we called my aunt who was able to see it, a just under five miles away. Upon calling the UFO Reporting Center, we quickly received a call back directing us to contact our local news.  As my uncle and cousin attempted to contact somebody, I quickly ducked out to my garage to locate my telescope.  When I returned, my uncle informed me that one of the lights seemed to drop from the sky, at which time a new and different light began to appear to the right of the bottom light, with the same third light still blinking. Almost immediately after the light appeared to fall, the object began to sway back and forth, while dipping rapidly with low buzzing noise.  When my uncle and I tried to use a flashlight as a backlight for my telescope to work, it seemed to stop working when pointed toward the object in the sky, yet it still worked when pointed in all other directions.  All cell phone cameras and my digital camcorder were also unable to pick up the object. When we finally gave up staring for the night, the object seemed to be standing still again.

Then a third line started forming in yet another direction all of which seemed to start from close to the same spot but going off in different directions.

I looked into a clear north sky.  My location was about 30 miles south of Mt. St Helens.  My elevation was about 500 ft above sea level. The skies are relatively free of light-pollution from Portland, OR, Portland is about 45 line-of-sight miles away. At about 7:40 pm I was gazing intently to the north sky and at the instant of sighting I thought I was seeing a meteor.  In the next instant I could see the object was fairly close to me and at a distance close to the earth.  It could have been 2,000 to 3,000 feet high, traveling west-to-east and in the distance only about 1-2 miles away.  My head was raised only about 15-20 degrees to place it in the center of my personal viewing window. The shape was best described as a modern fishing bobber. I thought first to describe it as an onion, sis kabob or giant child’s toy--a top.  But its symmetry and aerodynamic shape made the fishing bobber or onion pretty good descriptors.  The front had a large diameter, perhaps about the diameter of an executive jet—10-12 ft.  The diameter of the object decreased gradually if one were to measure from the maximum diameter at the front and then moving toward the rear of the object, the diameter gradually decreased to a dimension of a foot or less.  However, there was also a long cylindrical rod which looked to be a foot in diameter, or somewhat less; the rod extended from the front of the object by about 5 or 6 ft, passed symmetrically through the entire body of the object and extended about 10 feet beyond the end of the bobber-shaped part. The bobber-shaped part was a bright pumpkin orange  It looked like the entire object was engulfed in an orange flame. The flame did NOT burn as a liquid fuel with flames extending---there was a flame but more like the metal of the skin was on fire or just orange-hot. The speed was subsonic-probably 400-500 mph.  I watched it in clear sky for about 2-3 seconds; then it sped into fir trees at a higher altitude on the hill; the trees are about 150 ft high.  But as I watched, it appeared in a second ""window"" through the trees for an instant and then out of sight. Its trajectory appeared very much in accordance Newtonian laws of motion-just a gravity-controlled descent with no obvious deviations---which might have been caused, says, by steering.  All is very quiet here and I listened intently to hear a crash; I heard no sound. The country-side is familiar to me.  I would say that it impacted on a flat-topped hill, called Bear Prairie which is north of me; the point of impact would have been about 2-3 miles from me. To give you a latitude and longitude, I would say it crashed near the north end of a short road, called Bear Prairie Road and at its end and intersection with Skye Road.  These places should be easily identifiable on a good map of this area.  If my estimates are way off, it might have traveled as far as the valley of the North Fork of the Washougal River, Bob’s Mountain, but certainly not beyond Silver Star Mountain (5,000 ft in elevation)  and about 20 miles away. This appears to have been the routine death of a satellite or other man-made object falling from orbit.  The only really curious thing was that about half a minute later I saw a 2nd orange-glowing object which was traveling at about the same speed, but it was 6-7 miles away to the west of me.  It was traveling in pretty much the opposite direction---from the east to the southwest toward the hills that rise up north and above downtown Washougal or Camas.  Or if it was traveling in the gap in the hills which rise to the north of both towns, it might have landed in one of the cities, the Columbia River or in Northeastern Portland, perhaps even as far as the Portland airport. Probably not a very exciting entry into your log of UFO sightings, but interesting for the record and probably of interest to the Air Force that probably likes to keep track of where satellites that fall to earth.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,45.6173,-122.236

No, it didn't fly over the house or anywhere in the direction of the hospital, it was on a straight line East like toward ADA. And, again, It Made No Sound.

I happened to look towards the north, then I looked back, no more than two seconds later, and I noticed that the light was suddenly gone.  That was strange. I continued scanning the clouds, looking in the direction where the blinking light had been headed, when a large dark triangle amongst the clouds came caught my attention.  The lines were just too straight to be clouds, and it was a muted gray in color.  The triangle had no lights, and it didn’t move.  I guess it was trying to blend in with the clouds.

The temperature on that evening was about 40 degrees, not much of a breeze, no moon to show for, and the sun was about to set over the mesa in the west. My oldest daughter was the first to see the lights and then my third oldest son and then my second oldest daughter. My oldest daughter and my son called my name to get my attention to look at the lights.  When I turned to look, I only saw a light indigo/purplish color sky with the North Star shining bright about ¼ up into the sky. I said, ""Where?""  My kids pointed and said, ""Right there!""  They were pointing eastwards just beneath the North Star.  I repositioned myself on top of the bed of my truck. I had to re-focus my attention against the darkening sky.  Then I saw the lights.  The lights were like lights on an airplane or helicopter only it wasn’t. Aircraft lights was what came to my mind but how wide the lights made the object, changed that thought. There were about 15 blinking lights in a row (in a straight line pattern from our position).  Most of the lights were evenly placed from each other but on the left end there was a group of four lights that were close together (See small design below.  This design might change if copied and pasted). .     .  .  .  .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     . The lights were white in color and against the background of the sky were no bigger or brighter than the stars. The blinking lights were irregular and all blinked at different times.  All the lights were permanently placed but moved as a whole, as if it belonged to an immense spacecraft. I would place the unidentified object approximately 25-30 miles wide.  The distance from light to light for a majority of the even placed lights was approximately 2 miles.  From our position the unidentified object was approximately 40-50 miles away, 3-4 miles high and moving slowly in a North Western direction.  My wife and I calculated these numbers after hours of discussing the event and looking over pictures through the internet and television in the following 2 days. We could not see the outline or the unidentified object itself. We could see fog or somewhat looks like clouds beneath and surrounding the lights.  What was also strange about what we saw was that we could see the sky behind or through the blinking lights as if the object were transparent. I was thinking this object could not be of any aircraft on Earth. Not airplane, not helicopter, not hot air balloon, not weather balloons, or any unmanned drone. There was no sound coming from the object either. At approximately 5:46pm I called my wife who was at the local grocery store working. I was outside with my kids observing the object in the East when I called her. I told her we see lights of a UFO. She said, “Where?!” I said, “Towards the East!” She said, “Wait!” That’s when she went outside to look for herself. She said, “Where is it at?!” I said, “Do you see the North Star?!” She said, “Yes!” I said, “Look just below it! There is a line of blinking lights! Do you see it?!” She said, “I can’t see it. I’m not good at looking at specific details”. I said, “Just look below the North Star. There is a line of blinking lights.” She said, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see it!” Then I said, “I recorded it on my phone. I got it on video”. When I checked my phone later that evening I couldn’t find the video. I discovered then that I didn’t actually record the sighting. I thought I pressed the record button but didn’t press it hard enough to initiate the recording. While observing the unidentified object in the East with my kids, I called my brother, who lives in Mesa, Arizona, at approximately 5:48pm. I said, “We see lights of a UFO!” He said, “What? Where?” Then I explained to him exactly what I was seeing and what the UFO was doing. I asked my brother if he was near his computer. He said, “Yeah”. I said, “Look up the phone number where we can report UFO’s and call me back.” He said, “The National UFO Center or something?” I said, “Yeah.” At approximately 5:57pm I called the local Police Department to report the strange lights. I was outside with my kids when I made the call watching the unidentified object which was approximately in a North Eastern direction now. The dispatcher said, “Police Department.” I said, “Hi, I would like to report……is there a number where we can report strange objects…..cause…..this might sound kind of funny but I see….” The dispatcher said, “You mean the lights in the sky?” I said, “Yeah”. The dispatcher said, “We already got calls about that”. I said, “Oh, ok. Thank you”. Then at approximately 6:00pm I called my brother again. I returned back inside the house at this time. I asked him, “Did you find the number?” He said, “Yeah”. I wrote down the number to the NUFORC to report the event. I first reported it to the NUFORC at 6:04pm. After reporting the incident, my kids and I stepped back outside into the night to check for the mysterious lights in the sky. The lights were now in a northern direction. At this time the night sky was clear. We could clearly see the stars and there were no longer any clouds or fog that we saw earlier when the object was located in the east. If there were traces of clouds or fog then the night sky hid it from our view. My 3 kids and I observed the unidentified object, from start to finish, for about 40 minutes until it disappeared over the horizon of rocks north of Kayenta at approximately 6:20pm. After it disappeared over the horizon my wife arrived home from work. At 6:23pm NUFORC called me back also wanting a written report of the event. At approximately 6:25pm my wife, kids and I got into our car and drove north to Monument Valley, UT hoping to witness the strange lights again. In the next hour or so, all we could see was about 10 airplanes flying throughout the Eastern and Northern skies. With nothing else exciting to see we headed back home.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,36.6486,-110.1876

((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally eloquent and objective, in describing the incident.  We suspect that she is an exceptionally capable witness.  PD))  UFO Sighting: November 16, 2011   I was driving home from work the evening of Wednesday, November 16, 2011 on County Rd D through the White River Marsh located between Berlin and Princeton WI.  It was very dark and I was about halfway through the marsh, I don’t drive very fast because the marsh road is very curvy and I was approaching some ""S"" curves when I noticed a car parked alongside the road with its lights on.   This is rare in the marsh so I was busy watching the car closely as I drove by because I had thought they had hit a deer.  I believe I kept watching the car in my rear view mirror because I can’t believe I wouldn’t have seen ""it"" sooner. As I rounded the 3rd curve, veering off from the Rustic Road, I looked straight ahead and there it was.  Straight in front of me, eye-height looking out my front windshield, the only way I can explain it was that I didn’t have to bend to see it above my car.  The object was just above tree height.  The object/row of lights appeared to be positioned over the abandoned farm area near the next curve.  I cannot believe the people in the house on the corner did not notice it.  There are only about 4 homes in that area of the marsh. I saw a row of rectangular shaped lights that were illuminating the object above and below the lights but not the complete object.  It appeared to be circular in shape, maybe grayish in color.   At first I thought and may have even said it aloud, ""Oh my goodness, do hot air balloons fly at night?""  ""No, not with lights,"" I said.  It was that close to me at first, the ‘texture or surface’ of the object appeared to have the ""look"" of a hot air balloon or something similar to the :Airbus"" surface.  The big Wisconsin balloon flies low and close by in the summer sometimes, so that is why I thought it had a similar look to the surface of a balloon, but not colorful more of a matte gray. The illumination on the object from the lights reminded me of the haze around a streetlight when it is misting. By this time, my mouth is wide open I am saying, ""Oh my God!"" over and over.  I’m sure I was barely going 10 mph but for the life of me I don’t know how I made it around the next curve without going off the road because I never took my eyes off the object,   Within seconds of first viewing the object, I could no longer see the object illuminated around the lights; all I could see is the row of vertically rectangular lights.  I assumed later that the object was moving from me. It appeared to be backing further away but off to the left of its original position.  The curve of the roads veers to the left and the object was still pretty much in front of me.  The lights were like vertical windows at night, framed by black darkness, I believe about 7 or 8 lights, and the ""row"" of lights was  slightly curved which seemed to support the circular shape I had first saw.  The sky was completely dark with the exception of these lights. Then all of a sudden the lights went out but not like someone had switched off a light switch but more like someone was pulling a curtain or drapery shut over each window, from my  right to left and then the lights were gone.  Right after they were gone a small flash appeared that looked exactly like the flashing lights of an aircraft flying at night except it only flashed once and then all I saw was complete darkness.  I kept watching in the area where I had last seen the lights to see if I would see movement or a shadow or something but I did not.  I kept driving slow and watching out the window to my left almost the entire way home.  I did notice a lot of jet-noise that night and also remembered hearing the jets flying at night the 2 nights previous to Nov. 16. It was strange because I met another car about ¾ mile on a straightaway in the marsh parked alongside the road with its lights on as well.  But I think this car would have been too far away to have seen it.  I am wondering if the first car that I had met parked alongside the road had seen it.  It was only about ¼ mile from where I saw the object. The entire time I was driving, more like crawling while I am watching the lights/object   I am reaching in my purse for my phone to try to capture a photo.  Never did get it out.  But I kept staring at it to get a clear picture in my mind and immediately came home and drew what I saw.  At first I drew the row of lights with the light framing black rectangular darkness but when I also drew the row of lights with the darkness framing the vertically rectangular lights that appeared to be closer to what I saw.  I’ve scanned my drawings the first drawing is closer to what I remember. I told my husband and my son when I got home.  They really didn’t react too much.  Later it was bothering me, I felt I should report what I had seen.  I did place a call to what I thought was the Green Lake County sheriffs dept but instead I had dialed the Green Lake City police dept.  As I explained it to him he kind of laughed, said he had not heard of any other reports but would mention it to the sheriff's dept if he spoke to someone.  He did say I could call them to report it.   The next day I told a friend of mine at work of the sighting and he encouraged me to contact the UFO center.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,44.0079,-88.9666

I live in Gouverneur, NY near Fort Drum.   I’m 44 and I’ve lived here all my life.  This sighting occurred as I was riding my motorcycle home from Watertown Tuesday, July 19th, at approximately 10PM.  I was traveling north on US RT 11. As I approached a the crest of a hill outside Evans Mills, NY, I saw a string of 8-10 orange horizontal lights appear from east to west in the north northeast sky ahead of me.  I would say the elevation was roughly 35-45 degrees. Upon first notice, I assumed these were flares being dropped by some type of military aircraft, as this is a pretty common occurrence at Drum.   Two observations made this incident a little different, however.  First, if it was an aircraft, it displayed no lighting whatsoever and was utterly invisible from my location. The only indication of its presence was the afore-mentioned trail of 8-10 tightly-spaced orange globes that appeared ""behind"" it. Second, while what I saw were similar in appearance to military flairs, they didn't drop, emit smoke or have the halo usually characteristic of flares.  They just appeared, one after another, in close horizontal formation, then disappeared after maybe 30 seconds in the same order in which they appeared. I saw 3 or 4 groups of these lights appear and then disappear.  The whole incident occurred in what appeared to be a broad west-southwest counter-clockwise arc in the sky over the road I was on.  To continue the clock analogy, if I’m riding towards 12, the lights started at 1 and, in 3-4 groups of 8-10 lights each, arced to 10.  This took maybe 3-5 minutes. I slowed my bike to watch the show, and a car in front of me had also slowed and pulled over to watch.  I did not pull over.  I was traveling around 30-35 miles per hour throughout, and was wearing a half-helmet.  I could hear nothing such as a helicopter or airplane.  Also, I read a report from someone on a bulletin board who claims to have seen something similar near LaFargeville, NY, around 11PM.  That’s about 20 miles from where I was.  It was probably military, but it was certainly unusual.",2011-08-07T00:00:00,44.094500000000004,-75.8179

Most of them appeared to have a brighter tail end.  All of them were silvery in color.  No sound, seemed to just float by.  All of them were by themselves in the clear sky, except a pair that were travelling opposite directions came fairly close.  Not ""dangerous"" close, but certainly closer than airplanes fly together. These objects seem to appear out of thin air and we watch them in the sky until they have gone so far that we can no longer see them.  I have made a few other reports this past month and decided that 7:45-8:30pm CDT is the prime time to spot these things.  We have witnessed more that we haven't reported because they have all looked the same, appeared the same way, flew casually, etc. The past few observations we made, tonight included especially once it got around 8:15pm with the sun going down, was that there is a tiny blinking light at the tail end of these crafts towards the top back, although there is no ""tail"" like there is on an airplane.  These objects are perfectly smooth looking in contour, perfect cigar shapes and sometimes cylinder when the tail end looks abruptly ""cut off"" but still has the slightly tapered nose.  Also, there appears to be something stemming off the objects in the middle, coming off the side.  Almost like a wing, but certainly not long enough to be a wing.  The ""stem"" off the side isn't even half the size of the craft, not even a fourth of the size and is barely detectable.  The only way we can see it is by looking at the perfectly smooth contour of the craft in broad daylight (and sun going down) and you can tell some small object comes off the side of it. Some of them fly lower than others.  All of them fly higher than airplanes.  Make zero noise, float along slower than airplanes.  Silvery in color, more silver than airplanes.  Very pure looking.  They fly all directions.  This evening a couple flew towards Downtown Memphis, towards Southwestern Memphis, many towards the Frayser area, and some that go straight East from where we are which is towards the Germantown area.  These things are at least the length of a football field and you would not notice them at first glance because they are so high and the silvery color blends perfectly with clouds if you're not looking for it and once the sun starts going down, the objects take on that orangish-reddish color, so they are extremely reflective. We will be getting some tapes for our video camera now.  I think we can actually commit to this.  You know, I have been envious of people that see these things to what seems to be ""all the time"" and now that we are, we really don't know how to conduct ourselves.  I really wish you guys would send an investigator out here or something.  I know somebody else will be able to see them and they have been consistent now.  We are going to ask some people if they have some binoculars or anything.  Details of these things would be easy to make out with a pair of binoculars.  These objects almost look to be inspired by our airplanes, the way the long tube part of it is, except they aren't propelled ""forwards"" and have no wings and no contrail, of course.  We think there may be windows on these things, but we are not sure and are not willing to speculate that, but it certainly looks possible and it certainly looks as though we see these objects once they slow down tremendously from a g! reat speed.  We also see tiny ""blips"" in the sky like things moving so fast we can't see them, but it hasn't been worth mentioning because there's really nothing else to describe but that and that may sound crazy, but you just know there are more than what we can physically see at any given moment. The sky was very clear tonight, just like all the other nights we have seen them.  Oddly enough, there were zero airplanes taking off or landing during all of this and usually seems the case around the same time.  We have wondered if the airport picks these up on their radars (they must!) and stops sending flights out around that time and picks back up when we stop seeing them because that's exactly what we see happen.  A few airplanes take off at about quarter till 8 and it's usually dead till well after 8:20pm as these objects just float on by, then around 8:30pm the airplanes have their night lights on and are taking off as usual.
