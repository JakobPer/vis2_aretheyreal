I noticed there was two 747 type planes in the air space at the time of the incident.   For approximately one second, I observed a round illuminated object travel across the sky.  The object traveled at a high rate of speed, passing the two airplanes in air space.   The thing that made me believe this object (UFO) was not a shooting star, was the fact it had no trailing line.   It traveled alone as a solid object.  It started at a slow rate of speed and disappeared into the nearby clouds.",2014-06-27T00:00:00,34.0092,-118.1083

It was around 3:30am that I looked out my balcony and as I looked up at the tree, enjoying the breeze, a red/blue orb streaked across the sky. My balcony faces north and the object flew right above my house heading north.  As it past my house it made a weird noise too. I can best describe it as the sound when you steam something.  That ""tsssh"" sound. It was a bit foggy too. So was it going fast enough to cause that noise due to the foggy mist?  Being that I'm on the second floor ( balcony ) I could still see the object. It flew and then stopped in midair about 3-4 blocks north from my house.  It stopped and then descended to where I could not see it anymore because of trees.  I waited of course to see if it'd go back up, and what do you know, it did.  It quickly flew up and started moving left, then right, and vertically up.   Clearly NOT some airplane.  It looked like it would appear, and then disappear, and appear again to be on the other side of where it! was. There was one major blue/red light that really stood out, but then I saw another light right next to it. Then I could Bailey make out what looked to be one more orb/light trailing with the other two. At one moment I even thought they were a single object. Like one of those triangle UFO's, but then again my mind might just have wanted to make a picture out of the orbs. This lasted about 2-3mins of my clearly seeing it, and then 2 or so more mins where I could sort off still see it appearing and then disappearing. Oh quick thing too. When I saw it ascending and descending I tried communicating by flashing my lights on and off. Didn't seem to do anything. Either way this was pretty cool. I was able to record it descending once with my iPhone. So I have proof. Also one more thing at the end I could have sworn I saw it shoot out acouple beams out ( reddish beams ). And even if the trees weren't blocking my view, I could swear it looked like it at one point might it also mi! ght have landed. I was so close to running outside down the 3-! 4 blocks down to see if I could get a better look. I didn't though because I didn't want to miss anything in case it flew back up again, which it did.

It was definitely not any plane or helicopter I've ever heard it sounded like a plane descending kind of humming whistle but it was constant and almost sounded as if it had a melody to it.  Doing what any one would do if they heard something strange like that I walked outside to investigate I couldn't see anything but I could still hear the sound it sounded as if it was coming from everywhere at once.   I tried recording the sound but when I played it back you couldn't hear the sound (the recording device has bad audio).   Around ten minutes after trying to record it with no luck I went inside to get online and see if anyone else had heard the sound and my internet froze just completely stopped working. It wouldn't come back on until the next day I usually don't have internet problems so that happening is very uncommon.  At around 10:25-10:30 pm, I heard at least 4 helicopters flying over the area they hovered over the area for at least 15 minutes before dispatching.  I walked into my living room and  asked my sister if she had heard the sound she told me she muted the TV because she thought she heard a really weird melody coming from outside but didn't think much of it... she is not as in to the  UFO scene as I am. Although I didn't see anything that would say UFO, I definitely heard something very strange and simultaneously lost connection to the internet which is in my mind definitely proof of something.   I've had a couple experiences with UFO's in my life, but none as strange as this this sound was not from any mainstream aircraft.  It could of been a HAARP test but I don't know I am mainly posting this to see if anyone else has heard something similar.

Tuesday April 29th, 2014. West of I-10 between Chandler Arizona and Casa Grande Arizona approx 9:45pm. Looking West towards Maricopa about 10 miles south of Chandler 2 yellow lights first appeared to be hovering over a lit up sports complex out in the desert.  Not sure it IS  a sports complex out there, but the lights on the ground are similar to one.   As we drove south on I-10 and got more directly east of that complex we saw the lights start to move further apart and head in a south direction.  At first there were 2 lights, but as they moved south 2  more appeared and trailed behind those.  They were somewhat larger lights than you would see on a plane moving across the sky. The height seemed to be about double or triple the height of the sports complex lighting. As they moved south the first 2 lights rose higher with the last 2 remaining closer to the ground. It appeared to be a line of 4 lights at varying heights.  One of the lower lights dimmed out along the way.  We drove along watching those till they were obscured by the hills approaching the rest area by Casa Grande.  The ride from where those sports complex lights are to the rest area is approx 20 – 25 min.  We observed them the whole way down.    A couple times the lights would dim somewhat and then disappear completely. There was always at least one visible.   2 lights reappeared as we passed the hills (don’t know if they went out or which ones they were) and we followed those 2 lights- which dimmed again, one went out, one came back on, for a period of another 10 min., or so, as we drove west, up to Kortsen Rd, 8 miles west into Casa Grande. We could  no longer tell if they were the same lights or 2 new ones as they would dim out, and then re-emerge further down the road.  All the time being the exact same yellow light and same size as previously observed. We then headed back north on Kortsen Rd. for about 2 or 3 miles to the big plant that’s out there.  We are now about 30-35 miles south of Chandler.   We sat and watched the 2 lights till they faded out, about 20 minutes.  At this point they no longer seemed to be moving, just sitting pretty high in the sky, well above where we had first seen them hovering over those sports complex lights, pretty low in the sky.  Before fading out we saw what appeared to be a smaller craft, which looked more like a plane with the regular small white and red lights circling these 2 yellow lights.  As it circled, it headed west, then south, and as it came around heading east again and appearing to be almost in line with these 2 yellow lights, the yellow lights went out.

It was low in the sky just above the outline of the horizon still visible in the west.   The object’s overall color was bright red.  (When I say red I mean fire engine red!)   However, there were three “hot spots” that were sort of pink, sort of purple in color.  These spots were not symmetrical on the object but were concentrated in the lower right quadrant of the object.  There appear to have been some lines or some structure radiating from the upper left down to the hot spots.  On a clock face, the lines appeared to come from about the 11:00 position down to the hot spots at the 3:30, 4:30, and 5:30 positions.

I was travelling north about 50 mph, and as I was passing through a large pasture area I noticed it out my left hand window.

It was in view for about 15-20 seconds before trees on the roadside blocked my view.  It did not seem to be moving relative to me, so this gave me the illusion that it was far away.

On the left side of the hills about a mile away was this massive orange, reddish almost circular light.  We couldn't take our eyes off of it.  The light was immensely bright and looked to be hovering very low.  A helicopter or plane was a suggestion but the lack of noise, light color, and also lack of movement were all wrong.  My nephew suggested a tower of some sort.  Seconds later the light looked as though it shifted into almost a sliver and quickly vanished to a tiny dim light and suddenly gone.  Nowhere in sight. Moments later it reappeared. This time it looked like it was descending but very slowly.  The light was so bright that there was an almost transparent beam going thru some of the few clouds that were above it, and again, seconds later it was gone.

I was driving on the road and saw the moon was covered to show a sliver(crescent shape); nothing out of the ordinary.  I then observed while driving a shadow that was covering the bottom half of the sliver (crescent shape) of the moon hence separating the bottom half from the top. When I arrived at my destination, the moon was back to a normal sliver and I assumed it was just an obstruction in my line of sight while I had been driving, however I decided to stay and observe the moon to see if maybe my eyes were not playing tricks on me.  Low and behold, they were not. As I was looking at the moon, I saw the same type of obstruction. I can try to describe it logically as much as I can, but the best way I can describe it was this: It looked very similar to the shadow of a hand covering the moon.  Not conducive with any other eclipse pattern I have ever heard of.   As of 10:38pm central time, it is still covered.  Cloud coverage is not an explanation.  I observed the dark side of the moon until it was completely covered, and even now I can still see 100 percent visibility all around the moon.   What I saw was not a cloud; it was most definitely a shadow covering the moon.   I had 2 of my friends tell me that they observed the change as well; one actually called me to see if I had seen it because he said it freaked him out; unlike anything he had seen before. I am an extremely skeptical man when it comes to the supernatural.  I believe in such things, but I also am very leery to believe every story I hear.   I will be reporting this to other news sources in the morning.

Finally, I said what was that, let's chase it Which we did we were young this was 25 years ago  This was happening in the countryside of the small-town we grew up in anyway we did a U-turn It was still in sight. We followed it  this was happening in the West End of town It took us to the south end of town still in the countryside using back roads we followed  This is when we saw the craft break into three pieces doing all kinds of different things At this point we're still in denial not sure what to make of this 4 more join the mix so now we have seven red dots doing all kinds of weird things in the end form two different triangles And then started moving towards the east which we followed and then lost At this point I'm not sure what just happened i'm thinking maybe we saw UFOs Now were on the east end of town in the countryside we decide to call it a night we drive through town we live on the west end of town right on the edge. As we get closer to home my mind is full thoughts I start thinking to myself if I saw what I think I saw they should be able to read my mind ? At this point I think I'm going to write it off as military activity or something so in my and I asked them to prove themselves to be over my house when we arrive As we approach the house there was quite a big UFO there I told my brother to stop the car I got out to look at it it was right above me. It was very big all I could see was the bottom of it It look like a maze of tubing so I can't tell you what it look like but I can tell you imagine you've never seen a car before and the first time you ever saw one you saw it from underneath the car that's what it look like Anyway within seconds it pitched off silent sounded like the wind maybe and was gone in like no time The weird thing is well one of them my brother and I both go in to the house without saying a word to each other he goes to his room I go to mine blown away by what we just saw I look out my bedroom window at the stars I see nothing but stars too restless to sleep I decide to walk a short distance to the 24 hours convenience store on the way back from the store I started thinking well they seem to read my mind once maybe they can do it again I know this parts crazy But I start thinking if you can read my thoughts I want to win the lottery this is no joke at this point I don't think I'm even legal to win I was only 17 years old the next day my brother and I were still blown away we called some officials to see if there was military activity in the area but we got nowhere anyway within a year I won the lottery I bought the ticket from that store.

Both were distinctly different. I was looking up at the sky as I walked and chatted with my girlfriend, on the phone.  That's when I noticed the first one. It was a bright, red light moving north to south, in the western sky, as it flew erratically.  It zig-zagged from east to west. I'm unsure of its distance or altitude.  Even this objects speed was unimpressive. It was its course correction that made me stand in amazement.  It moved from east to west without slowing down.  It didn't circle like a normal aircraft.  It just changed course without even coming to a stop. At one point it seemed to come to a dead stop.  Then it continued south as its light faded away. I didn't lose sight of it.  I continued to maintain a clear look of the object and the sky.  It just faded away, like it simply disappeared. 2nd incident. As I continued to watch the sky, as I chatted on the phone, about 2 minutes later a second light/object appeared. I wasn't expecting it and only saw it for a second or two. It moved from east to west and it was VERY FAST AND VERY BRIGHT!  The light was white. It was low in the sky, probably a mile or just over and it didn't make any noise.  Neither did it leave a trail of any kind. It wasn't quite as fast as a shooting star but MUCH faster than ANY aircraft I've ever seen.  Nothing we have could have caught up to it. Just before It disappeared behind the buildings the light simply went out. I've never witnessed anything like it.  They were just incredible. Absolutely amazing.

I looked south and yes, there it was moving from the south, to the west.  I looked at my wife and said , see that's what I saw earlier. She then said look, it moving  north now.  Without a arch, type turn, the Light just went from moving south, to immediately, moving north, still satilites altitude, high rate of speed, coming north back in our direction.  There was no noise, when the airliners fly over us at 30, 40 feet, one can hear them.  This flashing lite, no noise like satilites.

UFO Sighting May 22, 2014.   California State Route HWY 152 East bound to I-5 South bound at Coalinga  Road  Conditions Clear/ Traffic Moderate / Temperature 65 to 70 degrees F. / Windy    At approximately 9:00pm to 9:20pm, while travelling east bound from San Francisco on California State Hwy 152 towards Interstate 5, my daughter sitting in the front passenger seat of our vehicle asked if I could see an object in the sky.  I was sitting in the rear driver's side of our vehicle but looked out the drivers side window and did see a huge, very brightly lit object.  It was not a linear shape as I expected to see, but an oblique yet rounded object of massive size with blinding lights. My husband could not look at the object very long as he was driving, and the lights were so bright, dangerously so.  My daughter clearly saw the object and was becoming somewhat excited by it's unique, unexplainable nature.  I only had a few seconds of vision before it (or we) moved beyond my line of vision.  My daughter in the front passenger seat continued to track the object for several minutes through the front windshield until we moved beyond it and her line of vision was also lost. Upon coming to the I-5 interstate (approx. 20 minutes later) we took the south bound exit and continued traveling towards Los Angeles.  After a few minutes my daughter once again asked if we saw an object in the sky.  Initially my vision was again obstructed.  I could not see out of her passenger side window so instead I started looking out my rear side window.  Off in the distance I could see bright flashes of light and a thick cloud mass.  The flashes of light were not streaks of lightening but the kind that is more horizontal and widespread.  There was a noticeable tingle in the air and the heavy cloud mass looked like it was rolling. I asked my daughter if she could see the light flashes and clouds and she said yes, then suddenly I looked towards the front the the windshield and could clearly see a triangular object flying low towards the passenger side of the vehicle.   The object was moving very fast and changing directions and stopping in short spurts.  There were bright red and white lights pulsating from the craft.  It was not only triangular in shape but the craft moved in ways I had no explanation for.  From side to side with no arching and up and down with no regard to speed or conventional pattern.   My daughter was able to track it once again from the passenger side of the vehicle and she also started to film the object while describing it to me.  It now looked as though there were multiple objects flying through the sky, some very high and very fast.  This went on for some time and I could now smell and see cattle stockades out of my rear passenger window.   The triangular object then flew back across the highway very low and ended up on the drivers side of our vehicle where it stopped near an overpass.  We all exclaimed that whatever it was it could cause a wreck flying so low and over the highway with the bright lights on.  The lights of this craft were not as bright as the ones on the craft we saw on State Highway 152, but they were certainly bright enough to be a potential hazard and a distraction for drivers. My daughter decided to report the object to the California Highway Patrol which she called on her cell phone.  The time was exactly 10:15 pm and we were at the Coalinga exit.  She explained what she had seen and was transferred to the correct person by dispatch.  She told them what she had seen and of her concerns about the danger to traffic as well as the unsettling, unexplained nature of the craft.  Before she could finish she was abruptly told that there was a airstrip nearby and the receiver hung up. This experience has stayed with us and has become a very real, yet unexplainable, part of our lives.  We have never felt compelled to document an experience like this before.  We have never before called the Highway Patrol or Police from a moving vehicle to report something unexplained.   My daughter's video is very dark and it is difficult to clearly see anything but flashes of light.  Perhaps someone with better technology can clean up the picture and make out discernible shapes and offer some insight into what we saw and experienced on May 22nd, 2014.",2014-06-06T00:00:00,36.1966,-120.3906

My son pointed out a very bright light to the north of us at ground level.  I told him that it may be a vehicle with bright lights on a dirt road in distance.  Our view that night was very clear all the way to the Wind River Mountains approx. 40-50 miles.   After setting up tents and making a fire we sat facing the north and almost immediately, a second light appeared and started to move erratically above the ground.  A third, and fourth light appeared and would pulsate and then disappear and then reappear.  Once all four lights appeared in a perfectly spaced line at approx our same altitude.  Maybe a mile or two across.  Perfectly spaced.  At times two would come together and  seem to dip below the hills and move very rapidly up and dance in the sky.  I have no idea as to size so distance was hard to judge but I would guess 5-10 miles out.   We watched them for 3-4 hours.  No sound.  At times would move farther out but would come back. Lights on and then off.  We did not have binoculars and tried taking a video with IPhone.  It did not come out all that well.   I am in my late 50's and have spent allot of time in remote areas and have never seen anything like this.  At first we were somewhat spooked but they seemed to never come closer than what I estimated above.   We watched them until approx midnight and went to bed.  We had no cell service, or I would have notified the sheriffs dept. that they were missing quite a show.   We camped out at a lower altitude the next night facing same direction hoping that we may see them again.  Nothing the second night.

There were no other lights, nothing blinking, and there was no noise accompanying it. Within 10 seconds or so after that disappeared, I heard what I though was a helicopter coming from where that light had originated, and looked back Northwest to where the light had come from, only to see an even bigger light moving even faster, bearing southwest this time.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, but the sound accompanying it faded out while the light kept moving.  I then thought it might be the ISS, and it turned out it was.  I was able to verify that it had just passed over when I came back inside using the tracker site. I watched the ISS speed away, and immediately saw a third light directly above me, heading straight South.  This one was smaller than the first, and I pegged it as a satellite because it had the usual dim steady light and relatively slow straight movement compared to the first light.",2014-06-06T00:00:00,38.04475955882353,-78.53657691176471

Mr. Davenport….I heard you (on Coast to Coast AM some time ago) say you would even like reports from previous years.  This is one such report. As a child in the fall of 1952 (estimate), my grandmother reported to my step father – a town policeman – that she witnessed a very large cigar shaped airship traveling North to South.  She lived on East Section Street (close to 27th on the east side of Mount Vernon, Wa) and this object was about a block East of her home. She had been doing dishes and watching East out of a window above the sink.  Her husband, ((name deleted)) was preparing to scald a hog with their neighbor in his back yard.   The craft was almost directly above the two men, and she thought it odd they didn’t hear it and look up.  It was only about 200 feet above them. She almost leaped to her door (about 10 feet away) to yell at them to look up.  They failed to hear her…..and when she jumped to the door it had traveled about two miles away and was now cruising over Little Mountain.  They did not get to see it. When she reported to my step father, he laughed at her and I doubt he made an official report.  The next day, however, he was told at work that the chief of police reported that his wife had viewed the craft at almost the same time.  They lived about 1 mile North of my grandparents. The sightings occurred in early afternoon….sorry I cannot be more specific. My grandmother said the craft was larger than any blimp she had seen and it was absolutely silent.  She had lived in Anacortes during the war (near where the Navy had a blimp base) and she was very aware what they looked like.  The craft had no gondola like a blimp.  It was light gray in color and she did not report it having any lights.  It had no markings or insignia.",,48.40760578034681,-122.27763815028902

I heard a faint noise that sounded a little like a car or motorcycle engine, which isn't uncommon here.  When I looked out the window toward the road I saw a light about mid-way in the tree line, about roughly a foot or two off the ground.  I thought someone might have been coming through the trees in something with only one headlight. It made it to the road rather quickly, but as it moved and when it reached the road it pulsed or sort of glowed from bright to dim. Bright..2..3..Dim..2..3..Bright.  Once it reached the road between two signs that mark a merging side road and a ""No trucks"" (church property) sign, the humming intensified.  It was only there a moment when it made the sound that reminds me of static discharge, and sparks covered the road in a flash of white light, followed by a web of what I can only describe as lightning in nature, laced in a purple hue.  One of the branches of that light forked over and touched the light in the parking lot which made a loud static, almost sonic sound which startled me away from the window. When I looked back, it was gone. The only animal that seemed bothered was my smallest cat, who walked up to the door of my room with wide, narrowly slit-pupil eyes and ears swiveling, as if he were listening.  My uncle, whom was asleep at the time, heard it and thought our heat pump had blown. I went out after the rain slowed to investigate, but nothing seemed to be struck, or damaged. Not the power lines, or metal signs or light post. It was like it never happened. This last part might have been my imagination getting away from me, but as I was walking back and forth searching the area where I had seen the orb hovering on the road, I heard a rustle in the low bean bushes in the field in front of the trees just on the other side of the road.  I moved closer to it to see if it were an animal, or just my imagination and I heard a guttural sound. It was a gurgle, or a croak of sorts, but nothing like I have ever heard before. My uncle told me it was probably just a frog, but I have lived here for almost 6 years now and have never heard a frog make the sound I heard. It scared me so badly I ran back across the road and inside without looking back and locked the door.

West Simsbury, CT Masters School - Mountain Pass Located near Saddle Ridge. Observing waterfall at end of street in woods, acquaintance rushes towards my location saying that ""someone"" is coming after us and we need to leave at once. I look up mountain ledge and see as well a ""person"" so blacked out that you can not even tell who or what they are - this beings features are so blurred you can't take any descriptive readings. Chased about half way out of woods by this ""person"", entity has not been seen since this occurrence by myself.  Shortly after, the entire area would flood with overflow from an old storm.  I believe at the time we were in 7th grade and enjoyed playing near the forest.  Have heard from others strange things have happened in these exact same woods and sometimes you need to steer clear of these places to be safe.  Perhaps someone else has had a similar experience. I would not say it is demonic in nature, perhaps closer to alien like activity which is why I believe it may be of interest here.  Supernatural in the same sense, we can push aside such folklore and myths of the past to suggest it may have been some type of extraterrestrial, not the traditional cliche grey though something much more fearful scary and sinister, a reason to look your doors and windows at night.  It may be taken as demonic by some except that would be not be the full understanding of such a being and how it would see us.  I am not sure if it ""radiated"" we ran so fast away from this  being of great dark power.   The closest approximation of it's appearance would be a nightmare imp from Doom. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=90383333  I doubt this artist's vision can give it justice though.  I advocate for others to share if they have run into this same situation, whether it was a hallucination, dream, or something else. Perhaps it could be something far worse. None the less people need to keep their eyes and ears open for such a ""person"" as it is worthy of study.  This has been discussed on the web and no one has really offered a rational explanation beyond the obvious; it was a hallucination, or even a imaginative reaction to the shadow people folklore, perhaps a hysterical occurrence of normal origin mistaken. My own opinion on this matter is if you encounter this being you could stay to see exactly what this person is and what they are doing, though it may be wiser to turn a blind eye and run very fast never looking back.  You would be better off protecting yourself than learning what this exactly is and leaving it alone at just that.

I’m not exactly sure of the date, but this is a reasonable guess. At the time I worked every other Saturday night and I was going downtown into work traveling east on 16th avenue.  As I drove down the road, in the distance I saw what I thought were spotlights from a sale of some kind, yet they were facing toward my direction.  As I got closer I noticed it was one bright light and there was an object.  There is a stoplight at the intersection of 16th Ave and 18th Street.  The object was on the west side of 18th street (41.962633,-91.696363). I would guess approximately 40 feet in the air was a dark triangular object with the light on the end facing west (I was traveling toward it).  As I was stopped at the stoplight there were others around, but I can’t say if anyone saw it, but it could not be missed.  I rolled down my window and it was not making any sound and was not moving.  There were three less bright lights underneath at each “point” of the triangle.  The edges were slightly rounded. I could not see any detail beyond the dark shape and the lights. I drove on as the light turned green watching it in my rearview mirror. It did not move.  I wish now I would have stopped and waited to see what it would do, but I had only been at my job for a few years.  It was also an odd excuse to be late in a production environment.  I arrived to work approximately 15 minutes later and told a few people, who responded with joking, and then called my girlfriend at the time.  I asked her to go down the road as it was not far from my apartment and see if it was still there.  I called her back after a little while and she said she did not see anything, so it was have been gone approximately 30-45 minutes after I saw it. At the time I thought it was an odd shape, but later I saw the reports from the Belgian Air Force and the Illinois Police sighting and it was very similar. My friends know that I am open minded and have an interest in this.  I would never fake information as it does nothing to help people be objective on this subject. I also never thought something like this would happen to me. As I tell people now - it was truly an unidentified flying object. I won’t say it was definitely extraterrestrial, though I’m not saying it wasn’t.  It could be of earthly but unknown origin, but it was something that I have never seen or heard reports of other than in the context of other UFO reports; even to this day. It’s funny that when something like this happens, you are just incredulous. I can see how more people don’t make better notes or document better as the reality of it does not hit you until later and then it’s too late, and I’m someone who should have known better or accepted the consequences of being late for work.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,41.977694906621394,-91.6758648556876

I even called the newspaper but they had no other reports and were not! very receptive.  It really seemed like it never happened but it did.

I just wanted to share something that may be of interest. It was around the year 2000 in mid November in Hartford, Maine, a rural town of about 800 people.  From 1993 to 2005, I would make my annual deer hunting trip to my cousin ""Jane "" and her husband, ""John""s""(not real names), place in Hartford.  I drove up from southern Connecticut and would plan on being there each year during that time for about 10 days each time being in the middle of November.  They owned and lived on about 60 acres of prime deer hunting land.  95% of their land was pristine Maine hardwoods.  John was an avid outdoorsman, a hard working guy and very protective of his family and property. It was a Saturday night and since there was no hunting allowed on Sunday, John and I stayed up late watching TV and chatting as we had many things in common.  It was a cold clear night  (about 20 deg F) and I suggested that we sit out the back deck and enjoy some star gazing (it was around midnight).  We were on the deck over looking a field that he cleared out some years prior that extended out about 300 feet to a 2 foot tall rock wall.  Just at that point and beyond it was an all hardwood tree line extending left to right for quite a distance.  There were no homes,buildings, roads or streetlights or any source of lighting back there in the woods.  There were few close by neighbors and none of those properties were anywhere close to the area I described. I knew the lay of the land very well and it was pitch dark. We were facing in a northerly direction.  It was a moonless night as well. As we were talking for a while, I noticed a ""glow"" of light illuminating the bottom of the trees at the above mentioned tree line extending up to the upper branches.  It was not real bright, not dim but somewhere in the middle but it was there.  The glow was white , the best I can describe, was like the headlights of the newer cars these days.  There was no noise, no movement and the glow stayed at the same intensity and did not move either.  It covered a wide swath, left to right.  In a scary movie, one would expect to see the dark outline of some creature leaving the woods with the ""glow"" as a backdrop!  Anyway after a few minutes of seeing this, I said :""John do you see what I see?""  ""See what?"" ""That glow in the woods"" ""What glow?"" ""oh yeah...wanna go out an take a look?""  ""Ahhh no John thanks""  ""Oh come on lets go out there and look.... are ya chicken?""  ""Yes I am""  ""Oh well, I guess your not that interested then"" That was that!   We stayed on the deck for at least another hour, John was just chatting away like nothing was wrong and I, well, kept one eye on the glow!  The glow was still there when we went inside about 2am.  The next morning I scoured that area behind the tree line for several hours and found no trace of anything unusual.  There was no trail back there and no real access by any type of vehicle.  I never again saw the glow on my return trips, nor did I ever see it before. Upon my return trips after the event I would ask John about what we saw that night.  His answer was always the same ""hey, you didn't want to out and look that night so.........."" And he would just change the subject.  I never did get his take on what we both saw that night. John was not a practical joker.  In fact during that event he was recovering from an auto accident and had limited mobility-it took all he had to go hunting with me that year so setting up an elaborate ruse to scare the begeezus out of me is of out of the question.  But for a guy who had the safety of his family and the privacy of his land at the top of his important list..that glow we saw caused him no alarm. It's a mystery to me just what was going on out there!  John knew SOMETHING and even my cousin Jane was closed mouth about it as well.  John passed in 2011, never saying anything about what we saw unless I brought it up and his answer,again, was always the same as mentioned above.  I have asked Jane many times about the strange glow in the woods that night after Johns passing and well, she would just kind of ignore the question and move the conversation in a different direction.  So for me, the 64 dollar question is has anyone ever seen anything like this?  It was not the Northern Lights as I have seen that up in Maine before.  What I saw was from the ground up.  It was not anything that was the result of human activity that I could explain. Just a little about me personally:  I'm now 57 years old.  I'm a high school graduate and work for the local power company as a transmission/substation supervisor.  I have been with the Company for 36 years.  I was, for 10 years, a seasonal Lake Patrol Officer with a local lake authority/ State DEP Law Enforcement.  I am an active Ham radio operator and a history buff and I love to read.  In my younger days, I was into astronomy.  I have NO rational explaination for what I saw that night.  I have an open mind when it comes to UFO's or other events that can't be easily explained away.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,44.4081,-70.4707

We got to the very secluded place (Beauty Spot, Erwin, TN, 36°07'03.2""N 82°19'59.0""W) and sat on the tailgate of my truck watching the sky till it got dark.  Not long after darkness fell, I noticed a red star in the sky that was ""wiggling.""  By that, I mean moving almost imperceptibly back and forth.  I watched this for several minutes trying to decide whether the motion was real or not.  Once I decided that it was, I elbowed my friend and said, ""Hey man, look at that.""  As soon as I did this, as though it cued the event, the light rushed down out of the sky and grew as it approached us. It came to within a hundred yards or so of us.  One of my friends yelled and ran.  The other of my friends and myself stared in wonder at the light for about 2 minutes.  It was very difficult to determine many details about it, but I wi! ll list what I observed: 1) It was an absolutely brilliant red sphere, it lit up the whole damn valley. 2) It seemed perfectly spherical. 3) It was ~50 feet in diameter. This is a rough estimate as I wasn't really sure how close it was to us. 4) It emitted no sound whatsoever. So, we watched this, one of my most vivid memories of my friend is when I looked over at him and saw him in full rictus bathed in that red light. After the 2 minutes or so had passed, the light lazily floated away from us for a few seconds and then shot up with unimaginable speed. I saw sparks fly off of the light as it passed through the atmosphere. Then, it winked out and was gone. The take off, escape from Earth, and winking out may have taken only a single second. After the ""event"" my friend and I got into the truck and drove around a mile down the road and found our friend. Then I drove home and no one said a word. We were all totally silent the whole way. In shock, I guess. Many, many times I tried to bring this up with my friend who was there, and he would always acknowledge that it happened and then quickly change the subject. If I pressed, he would get angry and clam up. He passed away in 2006 and we never really had a chance to talk about it. My other friend, the one that ran away, I met again only a few times as we weren't very close. It was basically the same thing with her, evasive, unsure, and eventually angry if I tried to discuss it. I noticed her at a high school football game about 4 years ago and tried to broach the subject, but she was again evasive.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,36.0858,-82.5059

They werent spinning, it was like the lights were fighting one another, but coming out from under the craft.  What was weird-the lights would slow-then speed, fade-then brighten.   Immediately after noticing I directed my two colleagues to the phenemenon and one, the driver, pulled out his knife in panic-got out of the vehicle and stood in the bridge of the door, we directed him back in.   Due to the intense adrenaline and fear-we got the heck out of there.  We were about 50 feet from this object and the next day we had sunburn on parts of our body..

This event took place on July 15th, 2003, in licking county St.loisville,Ohio on graceland lane rd in the deep countryside.  I walked outside the home i was living in at the time and looked up into the sky as i always do for anything out of the ordinary,and this time i did see something extraordinary. 	Since it was in the middle of summer it didnt get dark until around 10oclock.This took place between 8-9pm, most preferably around 9:30pm.It was a 95% clear blue sky day with a few patches of clouds here and there.  Once i walked outside the house and a few feet into the yard i looked up and saw a huge airplane roughly only a couple miles high into the sky heading slightly towards the columbus area.  Thing is i've seen many airplanes in this area time after time, but never seen one so slow to the ground before,not in this area.If i wanted to i could have counted all the windows one by one on left side of that plane,but didn't.Time after time i've heard the roaring sounds of plane engines soaring by even though they're 5-7 miles high in the sky,night or day,yet I didnt hear any noise at all from this plane,and it was the lowest to the ground i've ever seen from any airplane! 	As the plane was flying on by,making its way just above the pine trees I noticed a small whitish dot few feet away from the plane,but far away at the same time.Within a few seconds that small whitish dot was right up on that plane,making it up at least 1/4 size of the plane,and the airplane alone was huge.Instead of being a small whitish dot,it was a huge 3 gray layered oval shaped glowing ball of light.The center was dark gray,the middle was a more lightish gray and the outer layer was a light gray.I stood there and watched this object,which was probably 50-60 feet away from the right side of the plane the whole time,move along side of the plane heading not towards columbus this time,but straight south,for 5 mins until i could no longer see either the plane or the object any longer. 	As i said before it was a pretty clear blue sky that evening with a few clouds here and there.This wasn't a cloud simply because the clouds were nowhere near either the plane or object.Plus this object was perfectly oval shaped and no cloud has been perfectly oval shaped and moved in a fashion such as they had.Not to mention clouds are white,not gray. 	I was alone as i witnessed this incident.After i could no longer see both the airplane or the object,my first words out of my mouth were ""that was a ufo"".I walked straight into the house right after that explaining to a few relatives i had just witnessed a ufo. 	two relatives of mine reported seeing unusual flight patterns from an object with colorful lights at night in 2011off of the very same property i experienced my ufo encounter,but their incident happened facing north roughly a few miles out,couple miles into the night sky.Both people claimed object moved very,very fast and made sudden stops with angle turns that no flying object could do from what they know of.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,,

Until we seen it get closer we noticed it made no noise my dad still thought it was a helicopter but i knew there was no way.  It got so close to the ground I actually thought it was gonna crash but as soon as it close to the floor it shined 3 lights on the desert floor I noticed it was a triangle shaped object.  My dad and I were shocked that we didn't want to wake my mom up because she was sleeping.  It was odd because it was silent and it moved in a way which reminded me of a glider...

Just for fun, my 13 year old son and I decided to test it on the way home... just to see where he was at.  We traced him to a neighborhood about 2 miles from the house, where he was visiting friends.  We honked and waved at him as we passed him sitting in his truck.  We stopped at a stop sign in this very populated neighborhood.  While stopped, a bright green (almost lime green neon) cylinder/capsule shaped object appeared high in the sky.  This object was not moving.  It was just hovering.  After about 5 seconds... it started to move very slowly and then suddenly it flew at a phenomenal speed and suddenly disappeared.  My son looked at me and said, ""Dad... did you see that?""  I immediately called my oldest son to see if he or any of his friends saw it.  They didn't.  I checked the news for t! he next week, and even surfed the net.  Nothing was ever mentioned about anything.  This was only 30 minutes from the largest city in Alabama.

I had just finished working for the day and I stepped out side outside about 11:30 pm to look for my cat.  So I'm walking around and I take a gander at the sky because it looked beautiful, and I see what looks like a little yellow light bouncing around.  Shorty after seeing the yellow one, I notice a blue one beneath it doing the same thing. just bouncing slightly. I mentally debate if what I'm seeing if actually moving at all, and my vision is observing it wrong, then all of a sudden the blue one does a full circle in a split second, just WOOOSH!, then back to where it was like it just answered my question for me. At this point my jaw is at the floor, and Im just watching waiting for more. So I look at the 2 lights for a number of minutes, I'm going to guess 5.  I felt like taking my eyes away from the sky would have been a mistake so I kept my eyes locked. After a bit of time passes I see in the corner of my eye, a tubular long object with a light along it that looked like a flowing lightening bolt. It was emanating from the body of the object and flowing like a beam of electricity. On both ends there was bright flashing lights too. I see this objecting spinning in full circles and traveling extremely fast while its spinning. So it comes from out of my vision to into my vision along the horizon, so it blows right past the other 2 hurdling by, absolutely blowing my mind, then it disappears for a split second, completely black, couldn't see it, then it reappears, and the lights on it are going completely insane and flashing up a storm and skipping from one area of the sky to another like it was literally teleporting across the sky in different places. it disappeared while it was on the left side of the sky, then reappeared on the right side, lights going absolutely crazy the whole time. It did that off into the distance till I couldn't see it any more. At this point I am completely rethinking my entire life and what I believe in. The 2 yellow and blue ones where still there, bouncing. Then I feel a bump on my back and it was my cat, and he sat there with me, and acted strange, like he knew to me. Like he was trying to comfort me, and help me be calm. So I took some deep breaths and tried to call somebody to try make some sense of what just happened. Nobody took me seriously after calling 2 people. Feeling like I'm wasting my time I go back outside. I look up and I see a star sized light to the naked eye. It is flashing back and forth between red and blue and white. Flashing pretty quickly. I cant believe my eyes so I go inside and grab my camera. After mounting my tripod I zoomed in as far I could, and the object became allot larger in the camera. It was a perfect circle. Spinning in one direction flashing, then it changed the direction it was spinning. The color flashes weren't consistant at all and where at times getting really fast, then it would slow down, and it would be brighter white, the faster it spinned. After being fixated on that one for nearly 45 minutes, the spinning tube one came back just spinning across the sky.  I managed to snap one picture of it, where you can see the beam of light that went along the whole thing. It came and went allot faster than the first time. I took pictures and videos of the spinning disc till my camera died. Hungry for more I go inside and charge my camera in hopes to get more footage because I felt like I couldn't get footage that was good enough. Once my camera was charged I went back outside and it was covered in clouds and I couldn't see a thing. While I was inside I did allot of thinking and this sighting changed my life in many powerful ways. I felt blessed. I feel like a fool for not reporting sooner, I thought it would be smart to do it, then to let it go unheard.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,45.424299999999995,-122.3727

When we stepped outside this is what we saw immediately.  This was no meteor... It approached from the west at a very high rate of speed, came to a dead stop with no hesitation or slowing down.  It then zipped miles to the left, stopped and zipped miles the right, came back to center-point to a dead stop again.  Then it started flipping and shooting all over the sky and this is the image I caught.  I had no idea it would of been this detailed until I had opened it up on my computer. Who knows if it was aliens or a black government project but it certainly was nothing we have ever seen before.  It was certainly an anti-gravity craft because nothing in the U.S. arsenal could pull this off in the sky.  Especially a human-being with all the G-force on the body.  It has a bright blue-white aura or haze around it, left a trail which is evident in the image.  We were in shock to say the least.  After it was moving all over the sky for a about 3-4 minutes, it came to a stop.  We watched it for about 15 minutes sit stationary until the clouds started covering it up then went inside and viewed the images.

I'm 54 years old and I've been walking this route nearly every day for ten years and what I beheld at 11:33 p.m. on a very quiet Sunday night was abnormal and totally out-of-place!  Most of my neighbors probably were in bed.  I was fortunate to view the mysterious glowing object that seemed to be hiding up in the tree and I partially attribute my good fortune to the fact that it was a new moon - the darknest night of the month!  The silent UFO first was rod-shaped with a glowing blue light on the left end and a pinkish-violet light on the right end.  It was hovering horizontally in a place where a human could not be.  It was not a new-fangled bug zapper and there are no cable-TV or electric lines running near the tree and definitely not at that height.  No logic for the uncanny faintly-glowing lights in the tree. So I stopped and shot video with my iPhone 4S but with no zoom in vid mode I switched to still-shot so I could peer closer.  I took 30 pics spanning about ten minutes and during this time the small anomalous cylindrical UFO/entity? morphed into an orb which sometimes appeared cobalt-blue and other times violet with a freaky purplish core.  Then it morphed back into a rod that was more white colored and appeared to be segmented, reminiscent of a bacterial rod under a microscope. This flying object ain't one of ours - NOT a drone, stealth bomber, planet Venus, or swamp gas. I did not hear any sounds coming from the object that night but later when I downloaded the video I was surprised to discover that my iPhone had picked up some intriguing clicking noises and when I showed the video to my neighbor S-- she said ""It sounds like Morse code.""  Not meaning that it actually was Morse code but that it definitely sounded like some form of code and/or intelligently-contrived electronic signal. I stood motionless and alone on the shoulder of the street for approximately ten minutes, taking video and photos, before continuing my usual walking route home as I already was walking later than normal and did not want to be out after midnight.  The small, glowing, cylinder-orb UFO/entity still was hovering up in the tree when I left the scene and I have no way of knowing how long it may have lingered behind my neighbor's house that night?  So far, I have not shared this with the people who live in the house where the sighting took place because I did not want to run the risk of freaking them out, but coincidentally enough, they started leaving their back-porch floodlights on immediately in the wake of me seeing the UFO in their backyard.  I did, however, tell one of their male neighbors and B----- agreed with me that maybe his neighbors who live in the house in question saw the object too and it spooked them?  For the record, my neighbor's back-porch and backyard floodlights again were burning brightly when I passed during my walk tonight, 10-29-2014, before submitting this report to NUFORC. I've been watching for the UFO/entity ever since during my exercise walks but no encore yet, and I wasn't even going to submit a report because I didn't know whether this clicking, glowing, morphing rod/orb was an ""alien/UFO"" or spiritual entity, but then some other odd ""occurrences"" came to my attention that made me change my college-educated mind:  1. My sighting in Richmond was at 11:33 p.m. on August 24, 2014 and just four hours later at 3:30 a.m. on August 25, 2014 a motorist on I-295 N near the Hopewell exit, which is only 22 miles south of Richmond, was followed up the road by a bright UFO orb that was moving a lot faster than manmade highway traffic.  Then the orb targeted another car in the southbound lanes and when the sphere made contact with the other vehicle both the orb and car vanished into thin air!  Then the driver of the first car saw the orb reappear, and when it started following their car up the highway again they became ""terrified,"" put the pedal to the metal, and made a hasty retreat off the next exit in sight.  I learned of this fascinating occurrence at the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). 2.  Then a few hours later around 9 a.m. on August 25, 2014, a seasoned colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve was killed when his F-15 fighter jet crashed under ""mysterious circumstances"" in the Blue Ridge Mountains west of Richmond near Deerfield, VA.  Coincidentally enough, this was in an area where lots of residents have reported UFOs in the sky and orbs near the ground.  They say it took two days to recover the colonel's body and the official Air Force story was that he was from Massachusetts on a ""routine training mission.""  Synchronistically enough, I also heard  NUFORC's esteemed Director Peter Davenport mention this odd fatal F-15 jet crash in Virginia's mountains during his Oct. 17, 2014 appearance on Coast-to-Coast AM radio with host George Noory.  Keep up the good work Peter as the efforts of you and your associates are greatly appreciated by a world starving for accurate, thoughtful information and truth. I'm not going to speculate or draw conclusions, but it seems like an awful lot of high strangeness for such a small region in ten hours!  Last but not least, a couple of weeks after my ""close encounter"" in Richmond, Virginia USA I was prompted to discover a seemingly-credible YouTube video of a small blue-pinkish-violet rod-shaped UFO that a man and woman in Ontario Canada videoed while sitting around a campground firepit and the anomalous silent hovering object looks uncannily similar to the UFO that I photographed in Richmond, VA when it was in ""rod mode.""  The Ontario sighting was on August 20, 2014, only four days before my sighting in Virginia, and the Canadian couple was prompted to upload their video to YouTube on August 24 which synchronistically was the same day as my sighting!  Upon request, I will gladly make my photos and video available to Director Peter Davenport and NUFORC.

Looking overhead, we were right on the edge between the two. Wife & I were out walking the dog when we both noticed a distortion or wave in the sky overhead.  Neither of us was looking up at the time but is was so large & distinct, we caught it out of our peripheral vision. Looking up we see 15+ faint lights in a perfect bow or arc shape approximately 2000ft up & almost directly overhead ...  All the light were very dim but perfectly equal distant from each other.  The total distance of the arc from end to end was 300+ feet and making absolutely no sound at all. We watched it as it moved towards the south for approx 4 to 5 secs ... I would estimate it moved a couple of miles in that time ... And at that point, the lights just disappeared ... Not that it had moved so far that we couldn't have seen them ... But the lights just seemed to be blocked from our view once it moved out that far. Total time of the sighting was no more than 10 seconds. Above is what we seen as best I can describe ... The rest is pure speculation on my part. I believe what we seen was some type of a cloaked craft ... As I stated all we could really make out when we looked up were these faint lights ... But I believe what we were seeing was just the leading edge of a larger craft (Most likely circular in shape) ... And I say this because the distortion we first notice was large & round'ish in shape ... I would describe it as what you would see if you were looking at a still pool of water and then throwing a rock into it ... Undulating waves. But by the time we looked up that distortion had cleared and all we could make out at that point was this large faint arc of lights. Secondly, as this thing moved to the point where the light just seemed to disappear. I believe what happened was that as it moved to the south our viewing angle changed so we were now looking at the back of this craft ...

I study them for as long as I could, and then decided I had to stop trying to figure out what they were because I was driving and having to divert my attention to the right of my vehicle and off the road to watch. I considered pulling over, but then justified to myself, that these must be some sort of collections of lanterns or something  being lit and let go into the air by the college or something (though realistically I think they were to high for that). I honestly have no idea what I saw, they were slow moving little balls of light, almost hovering and had a glow that did not appear to really match conventional aircraft wing,nose,tail lighting, just a single glow which seemed to hover and move slowly in a type of formation, but ever so slightly in varied directions (again why I thought perhaps lanterns of some sort. For the first time in my life I did have a bit of fear about it, but again having a father that did flight test, I quickly began to rationalize what I saw. I have been trying to figure it out now by looking online for some celebration that may have occurred or something, but I truly have no concrete answer.

I don’t usual visit UFO websites and rarely see something that I can’t logically explain (I am an engineer and tend to be very grounded and logical), but what I saw on October 10, 2014, truly has me wondering.  It was not a Chinese lantern, typical aircraft, star, or shooting star/meteor.  The only logical explanation seems to be some kind of unusual craft, either from this world or another (and I find the latter to fall into the category of “what’s left after excluding what you know it is not, no matter how extraordinary, must be true”.....though I still find it difficult to consider this possibility). I was camping in the Finger Lakes Region of New York.  While looking east about an hour after sunset, I saw a large bright orange light moving at approximately the same speed as a satellite that one can see by the sun’s reflection as it passes overhead.  The orange light was moving from NE to SW and was inclined at about a 45 degree angle from ground.  There was no sound coming from the light.  I watched for about a minute as it moved through a clearing in the trees.  I thought perhaps it was a satellite, but it was much brighter and a different color than other satellites I have seen, and at one point it appeared to slow down and its course appeared to shift slightly and briefly before resuming its previous speed and course.  I thought it was possibly a plane, but there were no navigation lights or beacons.  When I saw the speed/course change, I thought possibly it was a helicopter with a search light, though not sure why it would be orange, and it did not seem low enough or bright enough for searching. The light appeared to glow like a star or planet. There were no shimmering or fireball effects, and no tail as from something falling through the atmosphere. The brightness was constant. Again, no sound. About 10 to 15 minutes later, I retrieved my 10x50 binoculars to do some star gazing when I saw a second orange light that appeared in the same location and on the same course as the first light. When I looked at it through my binoculars, I saw that the orange light was actually three orange lights clustered in a tight triangular formation. (This triangular formation was not visible without the binoculars.) These three lights appeared to just be glowing; no shimmering or fireball effects. It made me think of the glow of rocket engines when you are too far away to see the flames (or the engine glow of spaceship engines in countless sci-fi movies/shows). I watched the second light for about a minute as it also moved through a clearing in the trees. The second light did not appear to change course, speed or brightness.  I started to ask my friend if he saw the lights when he asked me the same thing.  He also has an engineering background and is very logical and not prone to wild assumptions.  Unfortunately there was not enough time for him to view them through the binoculars, so only I saw that the second light was not just a single light. I have been periodically checking on-line for the past few days for other reports of sightings or news of these lights.  The only thing that I have found that is similar is a UFO report in MA (orange light traveling NE to SW).  This other sighting date/time/description seems right to possibly be the same lights I saw assuming they transited over both MA and NY.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,,

Ten minutes later, at 7:50 P.M., in as long as it takes to count from 1 to 18 I counted 18 lights-objects literally swarming through this entire area.  This is the most objects I've ever seen all at once and they were hovering at treetop level, hovering above nearby hills, suspended over the S.F. Bay off in the distance, crisscrossing each others' paths, and nearly colliding into each other and hovering and approaching other objects to make triangular and rectangular formations in the sky etc.   I don't think you can blame the Blue Angels for this because not one of these objects was making a sound.   For a couple of minutes it looked like a total invasion until it thinned out a bit. I was wondering what would happen if an actual plane came through the area when all of a sudden at about 8:05 P.M. a plane came through from the northwest heading right through all this activity.  The plane was flying about twice as high up as all these other objects and flew over a cluster of about 6 to 8 of these lights and 3 of these lights were forming a triangular shape above one of these hills near the water between San Quentin and Corte Madera area.  I had binoculars and you could see the whole plane and hear it.  In the 50 minutes of continuous sightings of these other silent objects I could not identify any specific shape except somewhat disc or oblong teardrop shape maybe diamond or triangular.

We live in Pittsburgh west of the Allegheny County Airport (located in West Mifflin). My wife, walking the dog in our yard, noticed a string of uniformly spaced red lights at altitude (as one would expect a Life Flight helicopter to be) spanning at least 40 angular degrees. She called me to the yard, and I also observed them. I observed (at times using binoculars) that they appeared to be rising, in a spaced fashion, one after another, from a single point in the southeast and heading to the southwest. We estimated they were rising in the vicinity of the airport. One plane observed was perceived by us to be lingering in the area, but the plane, a commercial airliner or cargo plane, subsequently flew over our house, so the perception of lingering must have been due to a great initial distance and we observed it flying into the area. Towards the end of the event, we perceived helicopters to be flying in the area of the airport near the point we witnessed the lights ascending.  The lights were red, similar to radio tower lighting. The light to the southwest most point merely extinguished, and being distracted, but not seeing the others, they too apparently went out. My initial assessment is that they were some man made thing, such as ""Sky Lanterns"" lifted by balloon or the heat rising from a candle, but problems exist with this theory.  1. They were launched near the County Airport, which I would suppose to be forbidden for a legal launch, as interference to or confusion of air traffic may ensue.  2. To suppose that they were equipped with electrical power for lighting or being equipped with a candle should have provided the most recently launched light with the ability to travel from the southeast launch point to the southwest extinguish point before itself extinguishing, this clearly did not happen.  I returned to the house and alternately listened to a scanning radio for the police frequencies in my area of Pittsburgh and to Aircraft Frequencies collectively. Nothing was heard to indicate that any others had called to report this incident, nor were pilots, in their very brief communications, mentioning it.  I subsequently noted an establishment across the street from the County Airport as having a Grand Opening sign, but I'm not sure how old the sign is. I drove past the County Airport travelling to work, on following days, but did not notice anything to account for the lights. We perused the media for a hint of a man made cause, but found none. We found this reporting page as a result.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,40.443091945513764,-79.97424169381107

Initially I thought it was a plane, however the aircraft was moving too slowly to be an airplane.  I then noticed the object coming closer to the ground.  I immediately became frightened because I was the only one outside in my neighborhood because how late it was. I went inside the house and heard the dog barking across the street and it would not stop barking.  I then got scared that maybe the object saw me so I turned off my lights in my room and went under the blanket.  Thirty minutes later I was touched one time and became dizzy and saw lights shining in my eyes through my blanket.  I believe the extraterrestrial is invisible to the human eye but not invisible in general. I was so scared I didnt move hoping it would leave.  I then went into a sleep still feeling dizzy.  I believe the ext! raterrestrial was touching me making me feel dizzy in hopes I would forget however when I woke up I still remembered everything that happened. Unfortunately the extraterrestrial has been coming every night for the last few nights doing the same activity.  Shining a light in my eyes, touched me one time and shocked me, and making me dizzy. I am not sure what the extraterrestrial wants or why.  I believe it wants me to forget the situation however it frightens me so much its impossible to forget.  On the last encounter the extraterrestrial dropped something in my ear.  I am reporting this to every internet site or agency I can in hopes the extraterrestrial(s) leave me and my family alone.

All lights.  I'd never seen one before! A week ago, I think on Sunday, Oct. 5, I was doing yoga on a wooden platform in my yard in Prescott, AZ, in the mid to late afternoon.  I saw a white pinpoint of light move erratically around the sky.  It was moving so fast that I assumed it was a laser or other natural phenomenon.  I watched it for 1 - 2 minutes while I was in shivanansa pose (on my back) before it disappeared.  I didn’t think much about it. Yesterday, October 11, my partner and I were at a campground in Cornville, AZ (near Sedona).  We had a good, clear view of the sky and were lying on our backs watching the stars sometime between 7:00 and 9:30.  We both saw what looked like a bright star in the sky (she saw it first), except that it was swinging back and forth by what looked like an inch or two, like an ornament on a tree, like it was tethered there.  Sometimes it would lurch a short ways forwards or backwards, but stayed in essentially the same spot on the sky for the 20 or 15 minutes we looked at it.  My partner thought she saw a faint dark circle outline around it.  I thought it looked more triangular.  The moving light was all we could see for sure.  Several planes tracked through the sky at the same time, but this was definitely not a plane. The next day, October 12, at about 5:00 pm, we were at the mall parking lot in Prescott, AZ and a guy in a Jeep was pointing to the sky out his window.  I looked up (my partner was driving), and I saw a light than seemed large and fairly close.  I thought it was a plane at first, but then (within 30 seconds) it quickly faded into the distance and disappeared, faster than any plane I’d seen.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,34.63572068965517,-112.5686275862069

They were in a loose cluster formation traveling east to west, much slower than an airplane and without any sound.  The sky was clear to the north with high, thin clouds coming in from the south.  The lights were below the clouds but appeared very high. There were also lights from a plane traveling north, above the clouds and above the cluster, but from my viewpoint ‘through’ the cluster. The wind was light and the direction the lights were moving seemed to contradict the wind and the cloud movement. I know winds can vary with altitude, and I do not know how high these lights were flying. Having seen a fireball recently, I stopped to consider what I was seeing and realized it was not fireball, fireworks or anything else that I’d ever seen before.  I watched th! em for several seconds, thinking they would quickly vanish, and when they didn’t, I called my wife and asked her to bring the camera.  There is over 5 minutes of video that document most of what we saw.  What they looked like to me were electrically generated lights, not flame, pulsing from a very bright orange to a not so bright red and back again. No way was it flame! They pulsed at about 1 second intervals, not in unison. The lights were moving at about the same speed and direction with some slight variation. There seemed to be two types – one type was definitely brighter than the other type.  I went inside to get the phone to call our neighbor but stopped, grabbed my binoculars instead and returned when my wife said the lights were disappearing. The way they were disappearing was just to kind of fade out. No loss in altitude. Each one just fizzling out where it stood, bunches at a time until the only ones that were left were a handful of the brighter ones. As those last ones diminished, a few more of the brighter type drifted into view from the east. The position of our house and a large holly tree prevented us from seeing where they originated, they just drifted into our small field of view and every single one of them vanished within our sight after crossing our small field of view.  A couple at a time, then one at a time, with longer spaces in between, and then they were done. The last one seemed to change direction after crossing the opening in the sky. It seemed to move further away to the north before vanishing.  When I tried looking at them with my binoculars and it appeared that the orange light was coming from the bottom of the object and the red light was coming from the top. It also appeared that they went a little faster when the red light was glowing, and slower when the orange light was glowing, though that could have been an illusion. I’d like to think this could be explained as being Chinese lanterns or something of the sort, but the intensity of the electric light, their height, the fact that they remained in a such tight formation, and that they vanished so simultaneously, make it difficult to explain.  I’ve lived my entire 50+ years under the flight path of Philadelphia International Airport. I’ve worked outdoors all my life. I intentionally spend a lot of my leisure time looking at the sky, day and night, and enjoying the variety of light displays, natural and manmade.  This is a very urban area and it’s not uncommon to see distant fireworks or balloons from a party. What I saw on this date was something I’ve never seen before – and I’m just amazed.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,39.750686611265,-75.56602068328716

He immediately shouted back to me to come outside and bring the camera – his tone was urgent. I fumbled for a moment getting the camera, and when I stepped out our back door I was aghast!  The sky to the north of our home was lit up like a Christmas tree with a large cluster of red pulsating lights that were flying in formation from east to west.  I set the camera to video and started filming.  I was standing on the top step and my husband was below me, and to my left, at ground level. He told me to step down for a better viewpoint.  I had difficulty doing so because I couldn’t see the stairs in the dark.  He helped me down, and I filmed all the while.  The video jiggles around during that time. The sight of these lights was startling.  The lights pulsed from a dim glowing orange red to a strong, deep red.  While they moved in one large formation, each light was variable enough in its speed and pulsing that they appeared to be individual crafts, as opposed to many lights on one large craft.  I estimate there were between 25 and 50 crafts.  They moved in unison, but did not pulse in unison.  The visual effect was scintillating, like Christmas tree lights that fade in and out rapidly and randomly.  They moved slower than the average airplane, and they made no noise. My husband ran inside to grab the phone during the sighting.  He intended to call our next door neighbor so there would be another witness.  As he did so, the lights began to fade out and disappear.  I called to him that they were disappearing!  He abandoned the phone and returned outside to catch the last of the crafts. There were some stragglers that followed after the large formation was gone. These later craft were slightly different from the others; they flew more in a single file line than in a cluster, they seemed to be larger lights than the others and the color was more orange. While their color also pulsed, it seemed slower and stronger than the formation lights. I tried zooming in on one of these craft. My SD card ran out of space during filming and I had to run inside and change to a new card. I resumed filming on the new card. I also tried to zoom in and take some still photos, but the shutter speed was too long for a hand held shot. (I got photos of smeared lights). At some point during the sighting, I checked my watch and the time was 8:10pm. Upon reviewing the videos, the red craft are not as visible in the film as they were to the naked eye. The brighter ones appear in the video, but the camera didn’t capture them all; the sky was shimmering with them! Also, reviewing the video I noticed some larger, more orangeish craft on the upper right side. These look like those other craft that came afterwards – but they appear to be flanking the mass of red sparklers.  I didn’t realize this until watching the video. In my video, you can hear the traffic from I-495, which is nearby. There is no sound to the crafts that I could discern live, or in my video. I could not discern a shape to the crafts with my naked eye. To my view, I could only see them as lights. The weather conditions at the time of the event were chilly with a partly cloudy sky. The patchy clouds were semi-transparent, low, feathery type. The clear parts of the sky were clear enough to see stars. I estimate the temperature was about 55-60 degrees. NOAA wind maps indicate winds from the south at 3000’ and from the west at 6000’ this evening. I called our local police station to ask if anyone had reported some unusual lights, and the trooper replied that they did have a man come in around 10pm to report some unusual lights in the sky.  I also called the Philadelphia Airport to learn if they had any explanation for strange lights this evening, such as an air show, or other events involving flying objects, etc.  They said they would normally be informed of these kinds of events, but they have no such events on their calendar for this evening. My background: I’m 49 years old and have worked in banking most of my working life. I enjoy the night sky, sometimes with a telescope, but usually with the naked eye. While I have little knowledge of airplanes, I have lived under the landing pattern of the Philadelphia Airport all of my life. I see planes in the night sky all the time – I’ve never seen anything like these lights.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,39.750686611265,-75.56602068328716

It was not brightly lit either, maybe the equivalent of a TV left on at night seen from across the neighborhood.   It was FAST.  I've never seen anything like that and I've never seen anything move that fast in the night sky before.   Its path was straight with no deviation whatsoever, it just zipped across the sky and disappeared in the East.  If I had to guess how big it might have been, I’d say maybe the size of two jumbo jets put together given how high up in the sky it seemed to be.  No sound.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,27.911743440233238,-82.30077871720117

It was shaped like a boomerang and twirled quickly, silently across the sky. It was huge.  From my perspective, I would say it appeared to be about 5 feet wide, but I sensed it was very high in the sky and could only imagine the true size to be much, much larger.  And the shape was very sharp, I knew immediately it was made by an intelligent being.  It glowed green, like the color of a glow stick, and it seemed that there were markings on the boomerang: a circle near the terminus of each ""wing"" and three thin lines on each side where the ""wings"" met at the center.  The craft appeared, spun across the sky from east to west, and then disappeared in a second/second and 1/2; however, I saw so much detail because I was already staring at the sky when the craft appeared.

Approximately, at 6:15 in the afternoon of October 14, 2014 my son and I witnessed the following events in downtown Denver, Colorado. I was visiting him from Atlanta and enjoying a clear blue sky in his 3rd floor loft condominium that is surrounding by windows.   I suddenly noticed a bright silver streak in the sky as if the bright son was reflecting off of an airplane.  I kept waiting for the image to change and then the streak just disappeared.  I didn’t at the point think much of it, but a few seconds after I saw what appeared to be a fire trail from nowhere burning into the clear sky. At that point, I told my son, and we quickly went to his deck to get a better view.   Just as we arrived on the deck about 3 orbs appeared.  They were far away and looked about the size of large star.  It was daylight and you could see them clearly.  Perfectly round and moving slightly; some moving faster than others. The one that was the steadiest and affixed in one place for a while as if staring at us, suddenly burst into a flame it appeared.  Making a definite light streak as you will see on the video.  On the camera it appears as white, but in reality, pink to coral was the color of the streak and quite beautiful.  In a matter of seconds, the streak was gone, but the orb remained just as it was before.  It had, to the naked eye, to not have moved at all.  As we were witnessing and trying to video this astonishing sight with a camera during the next 20 minutes, we noticed a total of 5 orbs in all.  These 5 orbs started moving toward the same location.  Some of them streaked as the moved, and they were moving due west of Downtown Denver to the right of Mount Evans.  As they approached the outlying hills, they dropped from the sky and fell behind a smaller peak.  One by one they disappeared slowly, deliberately to the same point.  I immediately called the local news channels to ask what they were.  I was hung up on by two of the major channels and finally the local ABC affiliate asked for a video.  We had to condense the video to the point I am sure it was hard to see, but as we watched the news there was no mention of these events at all.  I have called the FAA in Washington and they were helpful and told me to report these events to the local office here. Which I have done.  It does not have to be explained as aliens invading the earth, but it would be nice if the powers that be would at least tell the public they are not crazy when they see an actual event.

The top of it had two flashing white lights and the bottom a single flashing red light.  The three lights formed a triangle.  It was approaching me head on. The craft appeared to be about a mile away, but it is difficult to gauge the distance because I didn't know the actual size of it.  Since this is not a usual airline flight path, I assumed it was a helicopter.  I watched it for about 15 seconds and saw it change course at what looked like a 90 degree turn to its left as well as about a 45 degree trajectory upwards.  Not that unusual, I thought.  But before itdisappeared, I saw two more identically looking objects approach from the same spot the first one appeared.  They were at the same height  the first one was when it initially appeared and were side by side about the width of my pinky finger held out in front of me.  These two also turned to their left and began an ascent at about 45 degrees.  A second set of two identically looking objects then appeared just as the first set had done.  They approached me and then made the same turn to their left and about a 45 degree ascent.  I saw a total of five objects.  As each object made their turn, they became barely visible and looked like little dots of white  light.  I could no longer see any red in them.  Each object disappeared into the clouds  about 15 seconds after it turned.

It maintained a horizontal trajectory, never falling the way a shooting star would.  We watched it for approximately 20 seconds before we lost view of it in the distance, still glowing bright white as it traveled down the valley towards Soledad.  There were clouds in the sky, and while we saw common airplanes in the sky immediately after, moving slowly in comparison and receding occasionally behind a cloud, we both noted that the UFO never receded behind any clouds during our brief observation.  This indicates that it flew below the cloud line low enough in the Salinas Valley to rule out a satellite or missile.

It made a couple maneuvers that were not possible for even a small plane.  It suddenly dropped low and then shot up at a steep angle.  It had 3 white lights that changed to 3 red lights, no flashing lights.  The object then did a loop.  It was too low for any craft I know of, even single person craft to make a loop, so I tried to pull over.  There was a lot of traffic on the road so by the time I pulled over there were trees or bushes between me and the craft.  I also observed at least 3 other cars pulled over on the right side of the road.  It was difficult to see because of the trees; but i could still see the lights as it flew up and down at the south end of the lake.  I drove up to the first off ramp and turned around.  As I was! heading south, it flew by heading north and I did not see it again.  There were still 2 cars pulled off after I continued back north on my way.  I did not hear engine noise, but there was also background noise from the traffic.  I would have noticed the distinct sound of a helicopter and I think there were lulls in traffic that I could have picked up the sound of a small plane engine.  Planes from the airport were clearly visible and completely different from the ""craft"" lights I could see which were much brighter, lights were white and had no flashing lights at all.  Planes from airport were much higher, lights looked yellower and had blinking lights and flew in a straight line.  I was a skydiver and have had a lot of experience with small planes.  I have no explanation for what I observed.  It appeared too large to be a drone or any remote controlled craft I've seen.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,39.16921421319797,-119.75176954314722

Momentarily I thought they might be Mylar balloons, but then realized that each oval was floating away from each other ""on purpose"" and there was a very dim circle of lights around each oval. I started to shout, ""Look, look, look"" to my boyfriend.  As I was shouting for him to look up, the ovals purposely moved into a ""V"" formation, very similar to what a flock of birds looks like when flying long distances. The singular oval craft stayed to the left of this formation and then the entire group of ovals picked up speed.  During this entire time, there was no sound of any kind being emitted by these objects.  They did not fly like a plane...  They propelled forward, but could also move from side to side or up and down.  It took less then 2 seconds to get into the V formation. By the time my boyfriend spotted them in the sky they were already in the V formation and flying away. They flew away from where we were and just appeared to ""disappear"" into the sky, like the sky ""swallowed"" them.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,33.85897941176471,-118.00041029411764

We had rented a beach front home in the Plantation area, which is at the west end of the island.  We noticed the light around 11:00PM EDT.  There is virtually no light pollution at St. George Island, and it was very clear that night with plenty of stars and you could see the Milky Way Galaxy clearly.  The light did not move or flicker at all and was present for over 2 hrs.  We went to bed around 1:00 AM and the light was still in the exact same spot; no change. The next night (Thursday, 16 Oct, 2014) we were sitting on the front deck of the house around 10:00 PM EDT with our family members (total of 5), when we noticed the same light that we saw on Wednesday, but only the light had moved from the east to the west/south west.  Again, way off in the distance and high in the sky over the ocean.  We watched the light for a while, and then all of a sudden 5 additional lights lit up one at a time in 2 second intervals until all were lit. They were in a straight vertical pattern from right to left of the main object; the 5 lights were equal distance apart, stationary and didn’t move and were crystal clear/bright.  They were slightly smaller than the main object/light.  The 5 additional lights were bright orange/red, but the main light was green with a slender orange/red circle. Once all 5 additional lights were lit they stayed on for 15 to 20 seconds and then went dark at the same time, while the main object/light stayed lit and did not move. Then approximately 3 to 5 minutes later the exact same thing/pattern happened again.  In total it did this 3 times and on the 3rd time the 5 lights and main light went dark at the exact same time and didn’t not appear again, just vanished.

My fiancé and I were sitting in the back yard facing West near Kellogg and Ridge Rd enjoying the evening and a fire I had lit in our fire pit.  We were layer back in zero gravity chairs watching the fire and looking up towards the sky.  I noticed what seemed to be a falling star and got her attention to look up at it.  As it moved from the North kind of in a South-West Direction it got brighter as a normal meteor would when it breaches the earths atmosphere.  It was moving at an incredible rate of speed as most meteors do.  Out of nowhere, the object did a complete 180 degree turn and started heading in a due North direction.  When I saw this I yelled at my fiancé who was also watching it.  I was excited and started explaining that meteors don't just change direction.  I don't think she quite grasped how important and significant this was.  I continued to watch it and it bobbled in the sky (like a line on a heart monitor would blip downward) but still mainta! ined the same speed.  I lost it behind a tree and never regained sight of it again.  I work as a supervisor in the aircraft industry and have even worked on military aircraft.  This was not a plane.  I am not saying it is alien in origin, but nothing I have ever seen moves that fast and changes direction as quickly as this did.  If I had to venture a guess I would say it is possible it is some sort of military project not yet brought to light, but honestly I am dumb-founded by it.  I told my lifelong friends, and they just kind of snickered.  I am not the type of person who would make up stories.  I know what I saw.  Until last night I never really payed to much interest in these sorts of things, but I would love to find an answer as to what it was.  I will continue to watch the sky at night.

The two went out again one at a time and about two seconds later the entire triangle disappeared at once.   The lights were all round and white, resembling headlights from a vehicle.  They were much lower than an airplane and resembled nothing that I have ever seen except for the picture from the nashua sighting, the picture that was circled.   There was no other color except for the extremely bright white lights and the black outline behind the three that formed a triangle(boomerang).  The bottom of the triangle was not outlined.

I had a couple drinks and I thought my mind was playing games with me when I saw vivid objects right in front of me. The harder we looked at the stars we realized these aren't stars. I saw one distant flashing something that caught my eye.  I just knew I was imagining until Randy asked if I saw it and we was seeing the same thing.  We studied harder and harder and there was more than one of the weird flashing star.  We watched it together as it transformed into at least ten different obvious pictures.   As we talked to each other and realized we both saw the same thing,  We stood up found one in clear view looked at it and it became clear.  Like a space ship flashing blue then changing shapes, dimensions, colors, etc..  Something you thought was never possible. As we stared and talked to each other we noticed it kept moving closer but fast and all of a sudden in literally half a second it flew down in front of u! s turned around and flew back. This sent us in serious fear running inside freaking out.  We go on the front porch look at the sky only to find that there's over 100 ufos flying around us. All so different and unique but nothing we've ever seen or can comprehend so I will use what vocabulary I have to try to describe these mystery machines. As me and Randy are looking at all this going on in the sky in the trees to our right was a strange bold orange glow circle that caught your eye. I thought well that's weird but I don't know. Later looking at it we noticed the orange circle had a red beam coming out.. We could tell it was tall rectangle and could love right and left almost as it was scanning us. As we are witnessing this we don't want to be the only ones to see it so we call over a friend to come make sure we are really seeing what we are seeing. As she pulled up and we pointed stuff out at first she only saw stars, but as you stare longer you can vividly see the objects ! and size. Kind of. She told us that she saw it and it was some! thing cr azy going on up there. We kept calling people over to come witness what we was seeing, most laughing and saying ""what drugs are you on"" like no really, please come see this. so we was up to 5 people watching in amazement, shock, and fear. As we were all scared watching from the porch Randy would get closer. Then out of no where a green laser is on his chest. He freaked and we all ran inside slowly making it back out to keep watching the magic show in the air. My paw paw who thought we was crazy and a non believer came down and as we showed him and he really saw it he actually admitted it. He was truly frightened and went home. The main things are the flashing blue ""mother ships"" there was about 18 in view. Each flashing blue and changing to a white halo form at different times or a suoer bright white thing.  Occasionally sending out red dots. The next thing we noticed we called ""glow worms"" they looked like little glow worms in the sky moving we! irdly but as any light would be shone around them you could then tell that these things were like helicopters? They flew around in no certain way just weirdly with huge wings. You can not describe the size, shape or texture everything seemed paper thin floating weirdly in the wind. We also saw the flashing blue mother ships open up and let out two flashing blue ""babies"" we watched both of them float down to our yard. When they hit the ground a white light came on them and they literally explored. We lost them as they scattered. They were literally dropped 40 feet in front of us. All of a sudden from the side of our yard just SWOOSH flashing hovercraft going so fast you could barely see it, but you could hear it. It flew out of no where right over our heads, and it sounded like a plane, it was silent and out of no where for three second just a loud jet plane sound. This scared Christy home. The flashing blue mother ships then let out a long ""rope"" I can't! describe it any other way, and somehow picked up the babies o! ff the g round and picked them up swinging them in the air like reeling them in but not all the way in. They would let the babies hang under them but thanks to the flashing blue lights you could clearly see a rope type something coming out both literally connected. as we stared at the sky and tried to connect what we could we was finally able to put together a hugeeeeeeeeeee gray ship the size of double our trailer hovering above us. It wasn't easy to spot but as we looked straight up you could just see the shadow. With all kind of compartments and lights. It opened up in weird places releasing flashes of light. Some ufos would send down a bright white light to the ground that looked exactly like a shooting star. But we watched about 15 of these so we knew they was shooting something down here.We walked inside walked out and noticed half of everything that was in the sky was gone... However some stuck around for hours almost like they didn't want to leave us cause they was watching u! s.  I would say start to finish for us we noticed them around 9 pm and didn't see them all gone until sun rise. As we watched as long as we could as most cleared out we noticed a massive platform. HUGE. We then heard weird noises coming from around us it was weight on leaves, a gargley weird notice, and the sound of a bird getting his head chewed off. Me and randy realized that we was the only two actually amazed that it was happening. Everyone else to scared to stay or admit it, they just didn't seem as interested as me and randy. Me and randy could see the smallest things and tell what they was. This was one of the most life changing experiences of my life and scariest moment ever. I fear the unknown and what we saw going on was to crazy to comprehend. As we wondered the whole time why here? Why us? Why won't they leave? Who is controlling this? I mean the ships would literally tansform into a flat line. How does it know where to fly? Oh yeah we also noticed a red light c! oming from back yard we did not look further into because we k! new for a fact we had no kind of red lights around and it was a huge red beam with white on top like on the ground it looked like that's where they landed or something but like I said we wouldn't go close enough to actually see. We did notice when we first realized it was a UFO we immediately got negative vibes. Paranoid, scared, unsure of self. The technology was unbelievable. Something my brain literally could not Phathm at all. When it finally turned daylight we went to search outside to see if we could find any evidence from where we saw the ships dropping stuff all over our land. But we found nothing. But as we looked in the tree forest not to far into it we both saw it. Yes a space ship. We both froze just thinking are you serious? Did they really park this in our back yard? We could perfectly see the tall 4 metal legs that was tall as the trees with a metal egg shaped thing on the legs with green stripes. We immediately started walking towards it and when we got there, nothin! g was there.. At All. We looked again from where we was originally standing and nothing was there. My cats were weirdly paranoid and all ran inside with a look of fear. When we was inside peeking thru the windows we also saw one of the glow worm air plane things 3 feet from us hovering right there by our front porch as soon as we went to get a picture it was ZOOOP gone.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,31.4955,-89.3012

It dashed across the sky in a straight line, and she thought it traveled horizontally without gaining or losing altitude.

The glowing sphere would dim and brighten regularly.  It appeared to stay stationary or slowly either drifting northwards.  I observed the object for several minutes trying to determine what it was. The size of the object was way larger than any plane or helicopter that I normally see following a flight path from west to east in that area of the sky.  The object was also much brighter than any lights I have seen flashing from any conventional aircraft. Therefore I was able to rule out the source of the red glow being from a plane or hovering helicopter. However, it was difficult to gage the exact height of the object and I started guessing at other possibilities, in case the object was closer to the ground than I could actually tell, such as a hot air balloon, a flare, or other hoaxes I know of revealed on UFO type TV programs.  Nothing I could think of matched what I saw, and as I studied the object my depth perception was putting it much higher in the night sky than any of the other possibilities that ran through my mind. The closest match I have ever seen to this object is related to giant, colorful, glowing circular clouds produced from rocket launches, or intentionally created by a rocket for research.  I have seen these before and that was my first inclination as to what the object was.   However, 2 things changed my mind about that theory.   1)  the object was in the northern sky.  I have only seen rocket launch related phenomenon in the southern sky, particular from NASA from the southern DelMarVa peninsula.  And the other is that this object had a bright light that would dim and brighten, and regular intervals, consistently  At this point I decided the object was too unfamiliar and I became too excited and decided to show my wife and ran into the house and woke her.

We are both smokers, but do not smoke in our apartment, so when we smoke, we go out on our back porch.  We see airplanes constantly.   We know what they look like, we know the speed they travel in the sky and the direction they fly.  This was not a plane.  I have also seen many shooting stars and have personally launched many Chinese lanterns.  What we saw, were not either of these things. I stepped out to smoke a cigarette around 8:30 pm on Saturday night October 18, 2014.  I saw a light coming towards me which caused me to pause because planes do not come north to south towards me.  I watched the light and noticed it almost appeared a solid orange- reddish color and appeared about the altitude of a plane, but was completely different from a plane.  I sat there in almost shock as it went over my apartment.  I snapped back to reality and ran in to tell my girlfriend to come outside and look as I knew we could see it out the front door.  She quickly came out it as it was going out of sight.  The strange thing is that we could see it, but the orange- reddish light had dimmed to where you could see it, but could not tell its actual shape.  Here is the amazing part..... I looked to my right and saw two more coming.  I showed my girlfriend and we both watched as they approached.  They flew close together with the same orange- reddish light, at the same speed a! s the first, and in the same direction.  We watched as the objects lights dimmed and went out of sight.  I tried to film the last two with my cell phone, but got no satisfying results. I do not know what these objects were, but I can say a few things..... They traveled too fast to be planes.  They flew in a completely different direction than the many planes we see every night.  The lights were different than any plane we have ever seen.  The objects were not shooting stars or Chinese lanterns.  I am hoping we were not the only people to see these lights. On last thing to mention....  as I stated before, we see planes all the time.  After these objects went by and at least an hour afterwards, we did not see any planes in the sky.  Thank you and I hope this will help....

They appeared to be something like final stage rocket reentry vehicles of some sort.  There were no sounds or vibrations associated with the over-flight.  And, no vapor trails associated with them.  So, they were either traveling in near earth or upper ionosphere.  There was also no change in appearance or fading of their glow and maintained relative distance from one another. Neither they nor the aircraft that they passed over seemed to pay any attention to the other or deviate from their course for fear of collision. normally, if I see satellites they are singular but also behave in the same way.  But the glow was more like a planet then a satellite. Possibly like a Mars type appearance but traveling.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,28.519246697974758,-81.35409597886704

I read that Clear Lake, California, had a number of UFO's sightings over the years, and since this woman and husband had a secondary home there, I asked her if she had seen any UFO's. 	She said that several years ago (1980s) that she had been walking her dog during the daylight hours.  They came to a small rise overlooking the lake, and when she looked down she saw a saucer-like metallic craft parked by the lakeshore with a plank extended out from the craft over the water.   She saw three very tall and thin beings with translucent skin.  There were not like any human beings she had ever seen before.  Their clothing material looked similar to our rainwear material.  Even though she was very close to them, they never looked at her directly.  They seem to be preoccupied with the water, as if they were taking some onboard. 	She became frightened and ran to some nearby homes that overlooked the lake. She knocked on the door of a friend of hers.  When her friend opened the door they saw the craft shoot straight up at tremendous speeds and disappeared.  She also noticed a neighbor from behind his fence who also witnessed this event. 	She said the next day there were UFO reports in the local paper.  She did not report it.  Before this encounter she had no interest in UFO's and wouldn't know where to report it.

It was a perfectly clear summer day.  I don't remember the exact date, month or year, but I would estimate the summer of 1987.  I was in my back yard around mid-day and I looked up in the sky and saw two silver disk-shaped UFOs flying eastward toward Lake Michigan at a rapid speed. We lived in the middle of the city near the corner of South 35th Street and Custer Street.  The objects were flying at about the altitude a single-engine prop plane might fly.  The UFOs were flying at slightly different altitudes but perfectly parallel to each other and at the same speed. The objects were circular in shape, but not as flat as a saucer.  The bottom of the objects were smooth and metallic, but had seams/crevices originating in the center and extending to the edge of the object, almost like the edge of a scallop shell or sea shell.  The objects made no sound. The objects were flying directly overhead in an easterly direction.  I ran into the house to notify my mom, who came outside in time to see the objects herself but not in time to capture a photograph as their speed was too high and they had disappeared on the horizon within about 20 seconds' time. In hindsight, my first thought was that the objects were two round parachutes or balloons, but there were a few problems that would make that impossible.  The objects were flying low enough to tell there was nothing suspended from the bottom-- no person and no scientific instruments.  The objects could not have been parachutes because the bottom of the objects were not concave.  Most importantly, it was clearly visible that the objects were not made of fabric, but of a harder material; and there were no ripples or indentations caused by the wind.  Lastly and most importantly, the objects were moving too fast to be an un-propelled object such as a balloon, parachute, or a fan-propelled parachute.  The object was moving at at least the speed of a small single-engine prop plane-- faster than the wind could naturally move the objects, especially on a clear day. What is most interesting about this sighting is that it was in the middle of the day, over a metropolitan area of about 35,000 people. This is the first time I have ever posted this story online, but I have told many friends and relatives about the sighting.  I have done a lot of research to try to find photos of the objects online, similar stories both in Manitowoc and elsewhere, but I have found nothing.   The only similar story is a sighting that took place in 1987 in Sheboygan in the northern sky, also in mid-day.  That sighting is similar in geographic location, time of day, and the color and shape of the object (silver and round).  It differs in that the sighting only mentions one object (not two), and they witnessed oscillation, which I did not. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date may be approximate.

She lived in Ohio County Kentucky near Hartford.  I can't recall the zip code now.   At any rate I have always tracked the International Space Station and receive alerts when it is in our area. I live in Utica, Ky, about 13 miles from where my daughter did live at the time.  I happened to be at her home this particular morning early and remembered the ISS would be coming over around 8 AM.   I stepped out on the porch and waited and recognized it once it came in view.  The sun wasn't totally up but the sky was light.  This was one of the longest views I'd ever had of it as it crossed the sky in front of her home.  I noticed something strange behind it that I had never seen before.  It was metallic and then realized there were two of these objects.   Neither object wavered or danced in the sky but steadily followed along some distance behind the ISS.  I'd seen the ISS many times both at night and during the day and this seemed strange to me.  I called for my daughter to come out and she saw them also.  What interested me was the steady motion in which they moved..the fact that they seemed to be on course with the ISS.  They weren't large enough to see first hand what they were but it was quite curious.  I mentioned that it seemed odd something was following the ISS in a perfect line and was prob much farther behind it then it appeared to us.  That night I emailed NASA. I mentioned what we had seen and asked if they could give me any information as to what the objects might have been or if there was some other aircraft in the area at the same time of the sighting.  I really never expected to receive an answer.  However the next day NASA responded.  The man gave his rank and all but I no longer have the email.  He assured me there was nothing in the sky at the time of this sighting in this area or the area around the ISS.  He said the crew had released some silver or met! allic de bris  at some point during the flight.  I think he said bags.  I don't remember exactly what he called them but the first thing I thought was how in the world would we see a bag from that distance...even if the sun were shining on it?  Compared to the ISS, a bag, as far as I was concerned, would be like an ant there in the sky.  It seemed to me I was getting the standard answer of ""debris"".   At any rate I simply responded with a thank you and left it alone.   At least I learned there was nothing in the area and I know we did see something following the ISS.  It would have had to have been large for us to see it at that distance. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Sorry....it was around 8 AM...my mistake.

First off, I'm not crazy.  I don't hunt UFOs or even believe in ghosts.  I have seen questionable lights in the sky, even 6 of them 30ft away from me but I still question those and can't confirm they were alien or UFOs.  But this one is different,.  It had dimension and reflected the ground.  Plus it moved. It was on the 4th of July 2005. I was at a holiday party, in the back yard of the house next to a swimming pool.  Ever since I was a kid, I usually like looking at planes take off and land.  So when I was in the back yard and heard an approaching plane, I instinctively looked up.   While I was facing north. I heard to the left of me, a plane approaching.  So I looked at it and thought, ""cool, a C130 military plane is approaching"".  Which made it even more interesting to look at.  Right behind the plane was a small round object. My first thought was that the lane was towing something.  As it got closer and closer, I kept looking for a tow line, a chord, a rope, a wire,... something to make sense that it was towing this round object.  Then as it was almost right above me, I saw that the object was shiny with a chrome-like reflection.  That's when it hit me that this is the orb stuff I've heard of in the past.  So I opened the sliding back door and yelled for people to come out! and see this cause I didn't want to be the only one seeing this.  They all tool their time to come out cause they thought I was crazy.  While they were coning, I tried to pull my Iphone out to take a picture or video, but the stupid phone took a long time to boot up and initiate the camera.

My husband was on the balcony at approximately 11:00 PM.  I opened the sliding doors to the balcony to join him.  I saw as I opened the doors a large ball of white light that appeared to be hovering over the ocean near the water's edge.  I asked him what it was and he said he didn't know but had been watching it for a few mins.   I moved to the left of the balcony to sit beside him and realized this object had no trailing light behind it.  We didn't believe it then to be a light from a ship and there was nothing notable on the water that we could see.  I hadn't been in my seat more than 3 seconds when it disappeared right in front of us.  I don't know which way it went because it went so quickly it left us really puzzled.  It didn't change colors but remained white the entire time before it was gone.   We just sat there not saying anything for some seconds and then we started to speculate as to what in the world it could have been.   My husband hadn't gotten up to come and get me because he was trying to figure out what it was, and he didn't want it to disappear if he made movement on the balcony.   He then said that it was much bigger than we probably realized and appeared to him to be farther out than I thought it was.  Its light was cast on the water underneath of it.  I especially wanted to ask my husband if he had seen any beam of light behind it and he hadn't.  He said it was solitary...just hovering there over the water.   This particular night I didn't see anyone on the beach and usually there were people walking with flashlights all through the night on that beach.  I have no idea if anyone else saw it.  I tried to remember if I had reported it here on this  site before but couldn't so I decided to report it just in case.  Needless to say I didn't sleep well at all the remaining nights.

Neither myself or my friends saw these objects with the naked eye at the time the pictures were taken.  The attached photos provide all l of the specifics of the pictures.""

The light emanated from the center of the object and would rise from out of the corn and then lower back into the corn.

I could tell by the sound something was moving in the corn, but also some sort of weird watery chewy sound that I can’t exactly describe. Deciding not to enter the field I returned to the house. The light continued to raise and lower into the corn. I decided to flash a light on it from the house, and it receded into the corn. After a few minutes it came back out. We sat and watched it through binoculars and a night vision scope trying to figure out what it was. At around 100 in the morning, it receded into the corn and did not appear again. After 30 minutes of waiting we decided it had left and went to bed. In the morning, I decided to search the corn field for evidence with my father.

I am a student in my late twenties.  I have two graduate certificates, a degree in Environmental Science and am currently enrolled in a post graduate program in Geographic Information Systems. My UFO experienced happened over a year ago. I didn't write anything down after the event which I deeply regret.  I had a hard time believing what I had seen with my own eyes, but I know that I could not of imagined something that was so vivid and real, something that was so large and close.  I am an honest person. It frustrates me when I tell people my story, because they almost always doubt what I am saying. I had just left the school and was heading north on Albert Street South.  I was walking on the sidewalk on the right side of the road.  I had just passed the large empty lot located next to the College property.  The lot next to this has an old office building that has been empty for years.  Running parallel along the sidewalk is a row of large maple trees. On the left side of the road, there extends a small forested area and a large double parking lot. Next to it, running up to the intersection is a series of two-storey townhouses and a couple of trees that stand only marginally  taller.  The Albert Street/Mary Street intersection is brightly lit by street lights.  I was directly across from the townhouses. I was starting to pass the first maple tree, when I saw something out of the corner of my eye.  I looked up and right above the north end of the townhouses there was a black acute triangle.  I would estimate that it was about 25 meters in length.  It appeared to be hovering only slightly above the houses.  It made absolutely no noise. The air felt totally quiet.  I didn’t notice the craft before this point; I am not sure if it just appeared out of nowhere or if it just blended into the sky.  The spot where I noticed it, was being somewhat illuminated by the street lights.  My memory is a little fuzzy on the locations of what I perceived to be the lights.  Not because of the time that has past, I felt this way even immediately after the experience.  There was at least 3 lights on the bottom of the craft; one being at each point.  There may also have been a fourth light in the middle.  There was a few lights along the side, but I am unsure of the exact number.  I believe that what I have d! escribed were lights, but they were not lit, so I can not say this with 100% certainty.  The craft was heading approximately in the same direction as I.  It was moving extremely slow; it appeared almost as if it were drifting.  All of the sudden it made a quick leap forward, lingered for a millisecond, dodged left at an incredible speed, then shot forward and disappeared into the sky.  I did not see nor feel any means of propulsion.  I believe the entire experience probably lasted less than 2 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date may be approximate.

1200-mph dart silhouette seen for 6-seconds.,Dallas,TX,2013-12-11T20:00:00,triangle,6 seconds,"Occurred : 12/11/2013 20:00  (Entered as : 12/11/13 20:00) Reported: 1/4/2015 2:08:39 PM 14:08 Posted: 1/7/2015 Location: Dallas, TX Shape: Triangle Duration:6 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116499.html,"1200-mph dart silhouette seen for 6-seconds. My first ever UFO sighting occurred from Sylvania Drive, near its intersection with Sinclair Avenue, at about 8:00 pm on December 11, 2013, during a walk.  The night was cold, the sky was clear and there was a day-past first quarter, or fat half-crescent moon.   I saw the object through an opening between some trees across Dixon Branch Greenbelt Park.  The sighting was a brief glimpse of a far-off, dark, silent, dart-shaped silhouette against the clear luminous night sky.  Because the object appeared to be so sharp, I assume that I was looking at an edge-on view of a triangle, but cannot prove this.   Initially, I thought that the shadow was a swept-wing fighter accelerating upward in my direction at a supersonic speed.  It was climbing toward me from the southwest – note that ALL of my view of this first UFO was along a straight line approaching from the southwest of me.  The craft apparently moved twice the speed of a commercial jet and traveled about two miles in six seconds, both estimates, when put together, gave its speed at about 1,200-mph.   There were commercial jetliners visible to the far north and south, providing a direct comparison.  The silhouette appeared to be generally airplane-sized at 2 to 4-miles distance, but was silent despite the velocity – a jet interceptor would have been on afterburner and audible at that speed and range. The UFO first caught my attention when it was about 35-degrees elevation and it disappeared at about 50-degrees elevation.  The first quarter or half-crescent moon was at about 60-degrees elevation, also to the southwest.  I roughly estimate that the silhouette first appeared to me about 4-miles away, possibly over the Deep Ellum area, and it disappeared when 2-miles closer, approaching White Rock Lake.  It climbed from 2-miles altitude at Deep Ellum to 3-miles altitude at White Rock Lake.  If the climb and direction were backtracked, its original ‘takeoff’ may have been the Cockrell Hill areas, which are 8-miles to the southwest.  Although it was getting closer to me, I lost it in the half moon’s glare and could not pick it up on the other side, which would have been almost directly overhead.   The thing seemed phantom-like and eerie, and I was surprised to see it.  The object appeared to be going on a straight course from a lower altitude to a higher destination and I recall chuckling to myself that, “It must be carrying some cargo.”   I did not think much about this first sighting because it was so distant, vague and impersonal, and did not make a report or discuss it with anyone.  However, I did begin accessing some websites and buying various books about UFOs, for the first time in my 73-years.  In addition, I began scanning the night sky, looking for a repeat performance.

"On June 4th, 2014, we saw a fireball at close range and were able to observe it for some minutes.",Millboro,VA,2014-06-04T23:55:00,fireball,10 minutes,"Occurred : 6/4/2014 23:55  (Entered as : 060414 11:55) Reported: 1/1/2015 4:08:15 PM 16:08 Posted: 1/7/2015 Location: Millboro, VA Shape: Fireball Duration:10 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116411.html,"On June 4th, 2014, we saw a fireball at close range and were able to observe it for some minutes. At approximately 11:55 pm on June 4th, 2014, I went outside for some air and was almost immediately stunned to see, at extremely close range (between 50 to not more than 65 yards away, and close to the ground approximately 12-15 ft.), a strange object.  This object had a ""roiling"" surface, with the appearance of an orange fireball. It was circular in shape, and looked as if molten metal was dripping off of its sides. This was quite dramatic, shocking to be candid. It was stationary, there was no noise whatsoever, the weather was calm, clear and warm, with no observable winds - and this object seemed to have a very deliberate purpose.  Now, this is just a strong mental impression I had, that was formed immediately, on the spot, in my head; as it was such a strong impression, it struck me as odd, alarming, and frighteningly real.  Frankly, I was too stunned to run inside to look for a camera, and stood outside staring at it for approximately 5 minutes, as I just could not believe my eyes yet at the same time I knew it was true - a very odd sensation. I had the strong impression that its purpose was quite deliberate, yet I have absolutely no idea what gave me that impression - the best I can describe is to say that it seemed to be very deliberate and bold in both its presence and appearance, above and beyon! d the shock value. Strange. Once I was satisfied that I was NOT sleepwalking (something I have never done), not out of my mind or perhaps seeing things (so to speak), I ran inside to wake my wife to get her to see it as well.  By this time it was right at midnight, almost exactly. Normally she awakes quickly, but this night it was very hard to rouse her, taking a good 2 minutes to get her to awake and finally stumble out of bed. I rushed her outside to show her what I was seeing, and we arrived in time to see it for perhaps 5 more seconds, and then it suddenly shrank in size very quickly & dramatically while at the same time appearing to travel directly away from us at an extremely rapid pace - literally disappearing from our sight almost instantly. It looked as if it disappeared into a slight cloud of smoke, though there was no real smoke present afterwards.  Odd, I know, I just cannot explain it any better, and am trying to give all details, as each of these impressions were so strong. Within roughly 15-20 minutes, 3 helicopters appeared along the mountain ridges where we live, and they maintained their presence non-stop over the next 3 days straight (though obviously in rotation for refueling, etc.) - since then, we see these choppers only from time to time, but in the same areas.  That night of our sighting, all we could see were the nav lights of the choppers, but during the days these helicopters looked like black unmarked units.  After the first night, there were never more than 2 helicopters in sight at any one time, and usually only one, though we could always hear at least one additional helicopter(s) over on the other side of the mountain ridge, which runs anywhere from less than one-half mile to perhaps 3/4 of a mile away from our house, and is easily visible in any weather. Our background is I am in my 60's, my wife in her 50's, we are professional and educated people.  I suppose for the sake of fairness I must also say that I have personally had a strong interest in UFO's for decades, and have spoken with many of the ""names"" in the ""industry"" - many of whom I consider to be either quacks or having a personal agenda, unfortunately. For many years we (my wife and I, and on occasion also a long-term friend we have known for the better part of 30 years) have studied the skies at night, and particularly in our area, we see strange things in the skies almost nightly - but they are usually at significant distances and high elevations.  However, I have studied this for enough years to have some ability to identify things like space debris, stars, rockets, ""shooting stars"", planets, and their various behaviors, etc.  Some satellites and especially space debris (that loves to tumble and give the uninitiated incorrect impressions) can make you think you are seeing something else, so it takes a brutally honest mind, keen eyes, and long periods of time getting familiar with how to study and evaluate various objects in the night sky, especially before attempting to label something as potentially being ""not from this Earth"". What we saw on the night of June 4th 2014 was not from this Earth, IMO.  I am familiar with most types of aircraft, both military and civilian, here in the USA and across most of Europe, and this round fireball has no peer in my personal experience. I have waited these past months looking for other similar reports from my area, and across the state, before finally deciding to report this experience tonight. I tried calling but because my home phone blocks outgoing Caller ID, your phone number will not take any such calls, completely negating the possibility of spoken communications. Rather disappointing after seeing you on TV a couple of years ago, the episode about you being a one-man operation, showing inside your office, showing you personally taking calls, etc. This I find to be a real issue, as I had wanted to speak in further detail about this, due to aspects I will not put in writing. Despite that, I sincerely thank you for your efforts, and want to wish you all the best with hopes that you will continue. We seem to be in a decent sized ""flap"" over much of 2014 here in Virginia, judging by talking to others and the reports here.

I observed my first and only two UFOs ever.   Both of these sightings occurred within a 6-month period from the same general location.  Since these objects appeared to be about the same size and shape, I have the impression that both sightings might have been of the same craft; however, I have no other proof of this assumption.  These are given in chronological order, and the first sighting in 2013 was vague, distant and impersonal – I did not file a report on it then, nor even mention it to anyone, including my wife.  By contrast, the second encounter in 2014 was a life-changing event – it was shocking to be shown that we humans are not the only intelligent beings here. My second, very much unexpected and extremely more vivid sighting occurred six months later at 11:00 pm on Friday night, June 13, 2014, near Hexter Elementary School.  I had walked to Gold’s Gym at Northcliff & Buckner at 9:30 pm and had left at 10:50 pm.  It was a beautiful night, comfortably warm, the sky was clear with a full moon and no wind, and there was not the usual city noise.  Nobody else was seen outside and there was no automobile traffic in the neighborhood.  I was walking alone in the middle of the street in the full moonlight. As I was traveling roundabout back to my house, a lighted craft suddenly appeared high over me at Northlake near Peavy.  I was rounding a curve heading generally northward and the lights cleared above the 30-foot trees to my right, or east side.  This occurred within the usual flight path of airplanes originating from south Texas and landing at Love Field; however, at this time most scheduled Southwest Airline flights had finished for the night – which seemed to be a very important factor in the presence of this thing.   Before 10:00 pm, mostly 737s and some corporate jets fly over here at about 8,000-feet or 1.5-mile altitude, heading north to cross I-635 where they will make a left, west to south U-turn and land at Love Field.  Now, there were not any planes in the sky anywhere.  Subconsciously, I assumed the lights were an airplane, but the object actually stopped directly above me as I was walking alone in the middle of the street.   I instantly looked up and felt that it had be! en watching me on the roadway in the full moonlight – I was the only rabbit alone on the road.  The craft appeared to be positioned almost 1-mile straight up – maybe 1 or 2-degrees eastward – with the apparent size of a large corporate jet; it seemed to be slightly smaller than a 737.  Although it is difficult to estimate size and height at night, I am reasonably sure that it was not over 1-mile, nor under 1/2-mile. (I have since studied airplanes flying directly overhead to confirm this perceived altitude and size.) -See illustration of UFO provided - It had extremely bright lights of pure colors, the brightest I have ever seen and the most beautiful red and green. There was no softness to the lights, only a sharp piercing glare.   The object had a strange jerky aspect unlike any aircraft.  No Federal Aviation Administration navigation lights were apparent – specifically, green on the starboard, red on the port, flashing strobes on the wingtips, with fore and aft white lights as required below 10,000 feet altitude.  Its lights were arranged in a nonsensical pattern as in my diagram above, with the red lights blinking on and off every 2-seconds – this appeared to be the front, as the craft moved.  All of the red lights pulsed together; there was no 1-2-3 sequence.  The green lights shined steady, did not blink and appeared to be the sides.   Each red and green row was composed of about 10 individual pinpoint lights, all like bulbs with equal intensity. No other lights, colors or emanations could be seen.  My sketch diagrams the bel! ly of the craft as seen from below.  The body was not visible as a silhouette against the sky because of the bright lights; however, I am certain that there was a rigid structure because the lights maintained their relative position at all times.  If I were to guess, I would say the object was rather triangular because of the arrangement of the lights, but I cannot be sure of this.  It had a clear-cut, garish carnival midway appearance – there was no vagueness at all.  My initial and vivid impression was as if a Texas State Fairground contraption, such as a Ferris wheel, with its colorful, blinking lights, had been placed 1-mile overhead in the night sky to float around –  it was totally out of place and illogical.  I instantly realized that this was not an airplane, so I quickly stepped under a front yard tree to my right or east side on Northlake, to hide from its view.  My actions were largely reflexive and fear-responsive, so I probably was only visible to the craft for a few! seconds. Immediately after I hid, the object seemed to have lost me, because it began to go back and forth, do figure-8s, hover and rock as I watched from between the leaves. Imagine that you are standing on the bottom of a lake watching the bottom of a big motorboat circling above you on the surface; similarly, seen by me from below, the circling craft acted as though it was floating on a flat horizontal surface.  The effect was like looking up at the bottom of a large launch that was being driven around on a choppy lake surface; perhaps the medium or force upon which the craft rode – or it created – was wavy.  The craft stayed contained within an imaginary circle of about 1/4-mile diameter eastward of me as it apparently searched; it never strayed to the west side of me.  Of course, its actions were faster than a motorboat as it maneuvered around searching the bottom below.  When it stopped, it seemed to rock like a boat, as though floating on waves.  The craft appeared to be driven or controlled by a coxswain who was methodically searching the bottom below, making its movements selective, erratic and chaotic as it went back and forth, repeatedly, stopping and going. The object emitted a very faint but perceptible whirring sound from high up, similar to an electric motor brush.  This sound had that same distant overhead audio quality as some hot air balloons, ultra-lights and blimps that I have heard from the ground while they were high above me; I have heard voices, burners and motors from these.  With this UFO, I had both eyed and eared confirmation of an actual materially structured mechanical craft and of its apparent vertical distance above.  Furthermore, the tone or pitch of the electrical motor sound seemed to change throughout its movements overhead, as though accommodating various mechanical requirements. Throughout all of this, I was busily playing devil’s advocate – “Could this be an electrically powered human-fabricated aircraft?”  Suddenly, I realized that if whatever was controlling this thing had infrared vision that I had better get behind the wooden tree limbs, which I promptly did.  For whatever reason, the object appeared to be searching for ground-based subject matter, so I remained cowing against the tree trunk and became a certified tree-hugger.  To add to my problems, the front yard’s motion detector light turned on. This weirdness went on for the longest three minutes, my anxiety level was rising and I began to wonder how it would all play out.  Suddenly, without any warning, the object instantly streaked nose-first at a downward angle, around 45-degrees, east-northeast toward the Lochwood Park area. It went from hovering almost directly overhead, down to the horizon, traveling over a 1-mile distance, at one constant and terrific speed. There was no observable acceleration against inertia or deceleration against momentum. I have watched high-performance jets stall out several miles above and then rev up to flight speed – this takes several seconds. My UFO did this instantly! When its lights disappeared through the trees and just above the horizon, it was still travelling at the same speed without slowing down. Its observed lack of inertia and momentum implied that the object had no mass, as though it were only a mirage or light image, and it actually looked somewhat that way during the d! ive. Although I could only see the lights, the craft appeared to be intermittent between a real object such as a bus or airplane, and an artificial movie-projected image of such. That is, at times, it would have passed for a solid material night-flying helicopter; while at other times, the lights seemed transparent and unreal, like projections on a movie screen. The greatest division in this dichotomy appeared between the very separate hovering and diving phases. During the overhead circling, I felt as though I could rap my knuckles on the craft; conversely, during the dive, I felt as though my arm might go through it. This division was reinforced by the whirring mechanical sound of the craft as it hovered, contrasted by the total silence when it dived at supersonic speed. Lending to this impression, a solid form would have created friction, pushed the air aside and made a horrific noise; this thing made no sound whatsoever. There was no noise at all during the dive – any air-dis! placement whoosh, sonic boom, crash or explosion – anything! Artillery shells make a distinctive sound as they pass through the air, and this speeding UFO should have done likewise. Incredibly, there appeared to be no resistance from the air. I felt that if I had shot this thing with a rifle, the bullet would have gone through it. Because of the lack of both inertia and air resistance, I must assume that there was no solid object – AS WE KNOW IT – during the dive phase. This raises my question of whether the UFO was somehow outside of our physical reality, a consideration that might apply to the origin of these things. I assume that a craft from another solar planet or star system would obey the same Newtonian physical laws that we do – but this thing did not do this. - See diagram of flight path provided - Visualize a right triangle with me on the ground at the 90-degree angle, and the craft 1-mile above me, searching within a 1/4-mile diameter circle to the east.  The full Moon is southeast, at about 50-degrees elevation at 11:00-pm CDT, at its lowest zenith in June – exactly opposite the Sun. The UFO dove toward the east-northeast at about a 45-degree angle. I have fine-tuned the compass direction with several visits; however, because it dived away from me, the exact descent angle cannot be exact.  Therefore, I have bracketed or averaged it as 45-degrees, and the ‘landing point’ would be approximately 1-mile away horizontally at the other 45-degree angle.  On the map, that would be around the Lochwood Park area.  Draw a line from Northlake-Peavy east-northeast across Lochwood Park and somewhere along this track is where the UFO ‘landed.’  By geometry, the flight path or hypotenuse would be about 1 1/4-mile long – or a little over 1-mile when discounting the 10-degree roofline.  The object’s closest proximity to me would be about 7/10-mile as it slid down the hypotenuse.  I watched its lights through the trees until the craft was about to slam into the ground about 1/10-mile above the actual horizon.  Seeing the UFO dive to the horizon greatly helped me to scale and confirm my original vertical estimate as about 1-mile altitude, and no lower than 1/2-mile. I have used three methods to determine and confirm the exit speed as about Mach-1.  First, my daughter and I have attended the Fort Worth Alliance air show annually for over twenty years – a father-daughter thing.  There are always jet interceptor fly-bys, usually by an F-18 Super Hornet, at Mach-1, whereby the sound shock wave is visible forming off the fuselage.  The June 13 UFO simply appeared to be diving that fast and that is what I settled on. Second, it took no more than 5-seconds for the craft to go from 1-mile overhead, then 45-degrees downward to the horizon, a dive distance of over 1-mile.  Here, I estimated the dive time, based upon my gut feel of 5-seconds.  Third, at home I pointed my finger at an imaginary UFO and had my daughter time my downward sweep with a watch, always getting about 5-seconds.  In summary, 1-mile multiplied times 5-seconds works out to 720-mph, or about Mach-1. At the short end of the spectrum, time is easy to estimate. Two, five and ten-seconds can be accurately guessed.  As time gets longer, estimating becomes more inaccurate – one minute is more difficult and an hour is even more so.  Five-seconds were easy to guess and to confirm by dragging my hand downward and having someone else clocks me.  My object had lights that pulsed every two seconds and it dove within about five seconds – these times were simple to bracket and measure.  I estimated that the craft hovered above me for 3-minutes because it seemed like 3-minutes, even when considering the lengthened anxiety factor.  In addition, I bracketed the hovering phase – it was certainly longer than 1-minute and probably shorter than 5-minutes – thus, 3-minutes.  My calculations of distance, time and speed all conform to one another mathematically – its red lights blinked every two seconds, the object hovered about 1-mile above for 3-minutes and exited at a 45-degree downward angle, di! ving within about 5-seconds at a speed of around 720-mph. As the craft streaked downward toward the horizon, its lights were visible through the nearby trees, but of course, the lights were blocked when they went behind the roofline.  The angle of total disappearance was about 5 or 10-degrees above the actual horizon, which would have been about 1/10-mile above the ground at the ‘point of impact.’  Seeing the object go through the far tree line greatly reinforced my vertical estimate as 1-mile distance.  The UFO’s path of descent formed an imaginary ‘hypotenuse of a right triangle,’ which is depicted in the third diagram.  At the horizontal, its size and distance could be compared to foreground features – much as a rising full moon can be compared to nearby hills, trees, houses and so forth – this confirmed my estimation of the overall scale of the UFO flight path. The contrast between the 3-minute hovering and the 5-second dive was astounding, and suggested that there were two methods of control during these two phases – manual and autopilot.  This dichotomy erased all doubt as to whether or not this was a human construction.  The circling and wobbling object appeared to be silly, jerky, and almost Warner Brothers cartoonish with the super bright garish lights – the reds pulsing on and off, and the greens glowing steadily.  The searching was asymmetrical, irregular and chaotic – as though a coxswain was steering the boat randomly and impulsively as he searched the ground far below.  If I had witnessed only the hovering phase, I would not be convinced that it was not some type of human-made aircraft. By contrast, had I seen only the 5-second dive, I would not be convinced that it was not some reentering satellite debris.  This exit plunge was straight, steady, mechanical, meteor-like and almost blurred.  Unlike in its erratic circling phase, the fast diving craft did not appear to be arbitrarily piloted, but went down uniformly at a constant speed in a straight line from A to B as though programmed and automatic.  It appeared as if a switch was flipped, which said, “Take me from here to there.”  Certainly, no human pilot would have had nerve reflexes fast enough to control this suicide dash downward and I assume the same for any biological organism.  As it dove, the form or basic structure of the object was perfectly retained – the blinking red bar of lights in front and the two steady green rows of lights on the sides. However, more so than when it was circling, the craft looked strangely like an artificial light image as it dashed downward, with the pulsing red lights at th! e front. Possibly, the angle of the lights were turned away from me somewhat, making them appear dimmer, thus contributing to the dichotomy of appearance. The object went down angled into the dive and all of its light structure was retained intact, as though it being a rigid object. However, both of these phases, when put together said that this was not grandma’s biscuits. I looked straight at this thing for 3-minutes as it hovered, and for 5-seconds as it dove – it definitely was NOT a human-made aircraft! A saying goes that we should always look for ponies before we look for unicorns. In the best tradition of looking for ponies, immediately following the sighting I attempted to eliminate all plausible possibilities. I considered a DRONE as an explanation, and several other folks, including my wife, have since offered the drone scenario (which seems to be the contemporary Debunker explanation for all UFOs today). This would certainly fit the hovering and whirring electric motor sound, since several drone models are electric powered hovering devices. Immediately after this event, I asked myself, “Did someone launch and retrieve a drone from the Lochwood Mall parking lot?” However, I quickly dismissed my devil’s advocacy here because this explanation would have been more unrealistic than a ‘flying saucer.’ The large size, mile altitude, glaring lights and exit speed ruled against a drone. Hobbyist’s electric RC craft are small, weak and slow, and they fly at very low altitudes. ! Military drones are larger and more powerful, but still rather slow. These are secretive, conserve power to remain on patrol for long periods, and they do not waste batteries on bright lighting; the CIA is not going to advertise its presence with glaring, blinking lights. All of this goes against the large corporate jet-size of my UFO, which was hovering 1-mile up with lights blazing while milling back and forth. Consider the Mach-1 exit speed. No drone, civilian or military, is streamlined or powerful; indeed, such a design would be antithetical to the hovering purpose of a drone. All drones have propellers or rotors. No propeller driven airplane has ever achieved Mach speed and survived – ever!  This formidable velocity requires an aerodynamic, reinforced coke bottle-shaped fuselage, sweptback razor thin wings, and a turbojet engine with a powerful afterburner.  Even the fabled F-86 Saber Jet and MiG 15 of Korean War vintage could not reach the speed of sound.  Moreover, no human-constructed aircraft – prop or jet – would have pulled out of such a steep dive at that speed. Finally, yet importantly, all aircraft, civilian and military, CIA or FBI, drone or whatever, flying high in United States commercial airspace are required by law to conform to FAA lighting standards.  This is to prevent mid-air collisions with other planes.  As ruled by the National Transportation Safety Board, an ‘aircraft’ is any device used for flight in the air – there are no exceptions!  My observed object was violating a main landing flight path over northeast Dallas, which would have been filled with vulnerable commercial Love Field traffic an hour earlier.  It was shining and blinking bright garish lights that were arranged in the bizarre pattern illustrated above, that made no sense and which conformed to no codes or regulations.  If it were any human-made object, it would have been flying illegally and in violation of United States law. My UFO had a definite symmetrical structure, differential lighting, a variable mechanical sound, a 3-minute time of operation and a complex behavior, so it was not a natural phenomenon such as a mirage, ball lightning, plasma, Venus, meteor, swamp gas and so forth. It moved back and forth against the wind, so it was not a passive lighter-than-air object such as a balloon, kite or Chinese lantern. During its high-speed dive, the UFO exhibited no inertia or momentum, and it made no sound; therefore, it was not a human-made aircraft – no human construct can do this. All of this taken together leaves only a NOT human solution. Of interest, the June 13 object appeared to be predatory by its raptor-like tactics. First, there was the sneaking up and hovering above me. Second, after I hid under a tree whereby it lost me, the craft started to circle as though scanning the ground for a replacement. Third, it seemed to have spotted another ground-based subject, toward which it made a dive. (Of course, we want to believe this target was an abductee – whether true or not.) The entire affair was reminiscent of a hawk circling in the sky and stooping at a mouse in a field. I suspect, but will never know, that my quick reflexive hiding may have saved me from being confronted by whatever was operating this thing. It was never closer than 7/10-mile during the 5-second diving. Other than the expected natural anxiety and elevated adrenaline, I have never experienced any unusual symptoms then or afterwards. I actually arrived home earlier than planned because I did not proceed with my exercise walkabout, thus had ! no ‘missing time.’ Several months later, I have not experienced any side effects, so I guess that I am in the clear… The weirdly blinking red and the stationary green lights made no sense; were they designed for them or for us? I have reviewed many other UFO reports and have never seen any pattern described like mine; therefore, I assume it was either a custom job or the object could configure its own lighting scheme.  All that I can surmise is that the garish, colorful lights might have been an enticement or gimmick to instill interest and attract a sucker to stand still and gawk. I know that I certainly was enticed to observe this thing; only my fear of the unknown overrode my curiosity and kept me from standing in the open street and observing it.  This entire affair became a delicate balance between me hiding from the craft and me peeking at it. Of note, the UFO did not execute whatever action it desired, against whatever ground-based target it apparently had – from high up during its hovering position.  There were no visible projectiles, rays or whatever extending downward from the object toward any ground subject; conversely, there was nothing from the ground, which came upward to the craft.  Apparently, the object had to dive physically from its mile-high perch down to whatever it had targeted at ground level.  It appeared to have needed to get near whatever its interest was to accomplish whatever it wanted to do.  This would be like a hawk needing to get down grasping a mouse with its talons.  I estimate that the UFO ‘landed’ somewhere along a straight path, east-northeast from Northlake-Peavy, with Lochwood Park as the central impact.  It was traveling at a constant Mach-1 velocity as it approached about 1/10-mile above the ground.  I did not see it again as I walked home after that, so the object either stopped instantly or else it drilled into the ground.  Afterwards, there was no explosion, no news report and no evidence of damage. Two days after my June 13 observation, I wrote a short letter to the Dallas Morning News in hopes that other witnesses, perhaps near Lochwood Park, had seen where the object went and what it did after plunging below the tree line.  My letter was not published, which suggests that when these things are reported to the mainstream news media, they are laughed off.   Circuitously, since no one hears about them, there is nothing to them!  During my lifetime of 74-years, I have never seen anything that I could not explain; I can even explain my two Unidentified Flying Objects and thus make them Identified Flying Objects – they simply are highly advanced machines, designed, built and operated in our atmosphere by intelligent creatures that are NOT human.  What these beings are or where they are from, I can only speculate; however, their existence and activity in our environment is a 100-percent fact, from my direct observations.  This reality should help support those claims by other witnesses of fantastic and bizarre UFO occupant activity, as being a very real physical possibility. All of the testimony given here is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of two high-quality reports which have been submitted by the same witness.

However the oddest part was the accompaniment of a aircraft that had a blinking light that caught up to it. as the second aircraft caught up, on this clear night I watched the solid light object go from 60degrees to around 45 degrees at a much higher speed than the blinking light could.  it left it behind and they never caught back up to eachother.  my only problem is I didn't know till recently that only military aircraft in a wartime zone could change their lights to off or not blinking otherwise it was mandatory to have signal lights.  the light was a solid white orb. not very big, but was about 2x the size of the blinking aircrafts lights.  I couldn't tell if the object made a sound or not seeing how the other aircraft did. but I know it didn't change color didn't blink just kept moving slowly then quickly.",2015-01-07T00:00:00,41.8439,-86.2164

It was stationary and was surrounded by a larger bright blue/purplish ring. It almost appeared like a halo around the smaller light. Both light sources were constant and not blinking. It stood still and made no noise. After about a minute it started to move very slowly in an almost fluid motion that didn’t have any real pattern.

At certain moments between changing directions it would stay stationary for a few seconds.

I was leaving the house at about 9:25 this evening to pick up my spouse from an appointment.  As I was locking the back door a bright flash of light caught my eye in the northern sky.  I turned to look to see what it was.  About 15 seconds later, it flashed again.  It was about 15 degrees above the horizon, about 5 or 10 degrees west of due north, between two closely spaced pine trees in a neighbor's yard that I could use for reference. After about 40 seconds, it flashed again (I was counting off the seconds to myself). I could not discern that it had moved at all in that time.  About 15 seconds later, it flashed again. Immediately after that, another bright light flashed to the east.  It was about 20 or 25 degrees above the horizon, and about 5 or 10 degrees east of due north, between two tall pine trees that I could use for reference.  In fact, I would say that it was in almost exactly the same location as a similar flashing light I reported to NUFORC in 2008. The first light flashed again about 40 seconds after its last flash, and the light to the east immediately flashed again. I watched for another couple of minutes or so. The one on the left seemed to flash at 15-40-15-40 second intervals; the one on the right at 40 second intervals. Both lights had not changed their positions in that time, as near as I could tell. After a minute or so, I could hear a high flying jet aircraft. I looked high to the northeast and could see an airliner traveling a familiar flight path, typical of commercial flights between central or eastern Canada and Edmonton International Airport. It was about 60-70 degrees up and northeast of my position. I could clearly see that it was a commercial flight, as I have seen many on this route. The navigation lights were flashing regularly and could be clearly seen. It was then that it occurred to me that the other flashing lights were much brighter, easily 3 or 4 orders of magnitude brighter than the airliner. In total, I may have watched the lights flashing for four or five minutes, and then had to leave to meet my spouse. I mentioned this to my spouse, and when we returned home, about 9:50 p.m., we watched the northern sky for about two minutes, but did not see the lights. I considered whether the lights might belong to aircraft. I have never seen commercial flights in the direction of the first light. It is too far north and west. However, it is possible that military traffic from Cold Lake, Alberta, could be in that area, en-route to eastern Canada or overseas (the CF-18s assigned to the current missions in eastern Europe and the Middle East are stationed in Cold Lake). The other light, to the east, may have coincided with commercial traffic on a Great Circle route between western cities in the USA and Europe. It's possible that I was seeing the navigation lights at the rear of various aircraft, but I've never seen any aircraft lights as bright as what I was seeing tonight, especially if (being perceptually closer to the horizon) they were a long distance away. But that doesn't explain why the lights did not appear to change position in the time I was watching.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,52.1078373650108,-106.66923239740821

Lightening was reported to the West North West over Delaware, Ohio.  I observed  cloud reflected lightening in that direction, as well as to the South.  Cloud deck was reported as 3,000 to 6,000 feet at 97%.   While feeding horses and looking to the West, I observed at about 280 degrees azimuth and 25 degrees altitude,  a small dull red spot,  which appeared unmoving.  It grew somewhat brighter for about 3 seconds, but still remained dull red, the color that  heated steel  just becoming red might appear. At this time, it began moving  very rapidly across the shy towards the East South East,  heading approximately 100 degrees. It disappeared  at approximately 170 degrees azimuth and 85 degrees altitude, the whole episode lasting about 7 seconds from first seeing it until loosing sight of it. There was no sound associated with it’s passing. When this object (yes, I am going to call it an object) was almost overhead,  I had the impression  it had a rounded  shape, possibly  oval or u- shaped, and that the dull red portion was the leading part of some airframe, glowing from air resistance heating. It’s body was totally black with no lights, appearing against the clouds as an empty spot with a dull red part. My  analysis of this event is that when I first observed it, the unchanging bearing means it was coming essentially directly at me. As it got to a lower altitude, it’s linear motion became apparent, and the fact that it traversed  70 degrees of sky in 4 seconds means to me that it was  below 5,000 feet altitude and hence subsonic, disappearing into a cloud bank.. That fits with the cloud deck height. No sound means it was gliding or silently propelled. The whole thing had the feeling of a re-entry event. Re-entry into a thunder storm seems a good way to cover the sonic booms, and thick clouds providing visual cover. So, either  someone has a really advanced  stealth aircraft, or we are not alone.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,40.3636,-81.7531

On the evening of November 18, 2014, at about 7:35 PM, I was walking outside my place of work (a business park), and noticed a bright orange-red colored light hovering in the night sky, maybe a half mile away. From the direction it was, it seemed to be in the airspace above the nearby Joint Forces airbase at Los Alamitos. At first I thought the light was a helicopter, as they fly in and around the airbase quite often, day or night. But at this time, I saw no other air traffic going or coming from the airbase. After maybe 20-30 seconds of watching the hovering red light, which made no noise, as a helicoptwer would have, it began to drop small red balls of glowing light (or a glowing red-hot material?) I thought that this might then be a chinese lantern, but it hovered in one exact spot, not drifting left or right, and dropping about 5-6 of the glowing 'red balls' (which dissappeared after falling halfway to the ground). After 4-5 minutes of observing the above, the 'object' or orange red light then went out - but a few moments later, I saw a non-symetrical object there in the same spot in the sky, very dimly lit from the city lights below, which slowly moved in a North-Westerly direction, and seemed to slowly lose altitude. I lost sight of it after 30-40 seconds, as it was too far or low to see clearly anymore, now traveling behind a building and trees across the street from my location. I also thought the object was a silent drone, but the asymetrical object that I saw at the end of my sighting was definitely not a drone, or a chinese lantern, or any flare - the shape was so strange I can barely even describe it. And the usually busy airbase (helicopters, etc.) was absent of other air traffic before or after the sighting of the object - like they might have been watching it too, and did not want to interact with whatever 'it' was (my own guess here, of course).",2015-01-07T00:00:00,33.797054464285715,-118.06249107142857

Today, Tues. Oct. 21, 2014 at about 3:49PM Central Time I was in a conservation are I believed is owned/operated by the University of Missouri name Turkey Farm Lake with my dog.  I had my camera and took photos along the path leading up to the lake. 	When I entered the actual lake area I saw a couple of dead looking branches and was attempting to focus on them without getting any colored leaves in the frame.  When I looked up I saw an object in the sky.  I said out loud, “What the f*ck is that?!”. 	The object was not a plane, nor a helicopter, blimp, etc…  It was not extremely high in the sky.  I would say maybe a couple football fields’ lengths from me.  I was shaped like a semi-deflated football, actually, and silver in color and extremely shiny.  I did not notice a sound and it was moving slowly horizontally. 	I immediately aimed my camera and took a photo.  I then realized the branches were still in the frame, and because they were so close to me, that the object it’s self would not be in focus.  I then looked to the sky, saw the object moving away from me and stepped forward trying to get a better shot… As I looked through my viewfinder I could not spot the object so I removed the camera from my eye, looking to the sky and the object was gone. 	About a minute after spinning myself in circles trying to figure out where this object moved to and feeling totally confused about what I just witnessed I opened the clock on my phone and took a screenshot to document the date and time.  It was 3:51 PM. 	After I returned home and transferred my photos to my computer I saw something totally unexpected in the one photo I got of the object.  Instead of  an out-of-focus silver football shaped flying vehicle I knew should be in the photo I saw a partial outline.  It is a dark shadowy outline, boomerang-shaped, representing only the leading end of the object, probably about ¼  the size of what I saw with my eyes.  This is shocking because the object was fully visible to me even after I took that initial shot, however in the photo it appears to be almost completely transparent. 	So far I have only told this to my mother and father… I attempted to call your hotline about half an hour ago, around 8:25 PM and I left a message because no one answered.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,38.91147669172933,-92.30242962406015

At approx 7:50pm on 12/20/2014, I walked outside and noticed something that looked like a sort of amythest-colored, purple-pinkish light in the sky.  It was completely odd and caught my attention right away.  It actually looked like 2 lights side-by-side, horizontal to the ground,  very close together or possibly even attached.  Brighter than a star.. well, brighter than Sirius (which appears in the Eastern sky this time of year)  I started watching it, completely perplexed by the color.  My first thought was that it might be someone playing with a drone, but it wasn't like any drone I've ever seen (I've seen a few in my life.. my neighbor even has a large one).  The light was steady and brilliant, not flashing.  It didn't have the typical red/green, flashing lights that you would expect from an R/C toy or airplane.  It wasn't a satellite either.  I'm former military (Navy Electronic Warfare) and I can assure you that I've never seen anything in the sky with the same color light.  In fact, the sky was totally overcast that night, but below the clouds it was very clear and there was good visibility.  No stars were visible, nor could I see any of the usual air traffic heading into the Bay Area because of the cloud layer.  When I spotted the object, it looked like it was maybe 200-300 yards to the East at less than 500 ft in altitude... essentially over my neighborhood.  At first it looked stationary, like it was hovering.  Then it started to slowly move East (away from me).  I noticed that I couldn't hear any 'drone' sounds.. nor any other sounds from planes, etc.  As I watched, it seemed to speed up a little, the all of the sudden took a 90-degree left turn (at speed) and moved a short distance before abruptly stopping.  I would estimate it moved maybe 200 yds in less than one second.  I literally said  “#@!*%$&!*” out loud to myself!!   That's when I realized I had my phone in my left hand... duh!!  I immediately launched the camera and started to record some video.  It's not great video...  the object looks really tiny, almost invisible on my Samsung s5, but you can certainly see it when playing back on a laptop, or something with a bigger screen.  It looks like a white star moving away fr! om me and unfortunately, you can't see the purple-ish color, it just looks like a white dot.  By the time I got the video going it had started to move Eastward again, slowly almost wavering a bit before moving behind the trees across the street from my house and out of my view.  Several minutes later I was still outside trying to play back the video and one of the typical airliners that I usually see flew overhead.. I couldn't actually see it because of the cloud cover, but I could definitely hear it.  So, whatever I saw and recorded that night was flying below the clouds and not making any noise.  It wasn't a plane or any other celestial object, not a drone, missile, meteor, etc.... I'm somewhat of a trained observer...  I have a military background and also have a couple pilots in my immediate family.  Unfortunately, the video is only a few seconds long.  At one point I tried to zoom, but it went out of view, then I un-zoomed and found it again.    I'd be happy to share a link to my Google drive if your interested in seeing it.  Otherwise, I don't really want to post it online anywhere.  Curious if anyone else has report something similar?  The color was amazing hard to describe.. neon fuchsia, pinkish-purple... really really odd, but pretty.",2015-01-07T00:00:00,37.77417,-121.2256556

This object was just hovering there between two roof lights at a distance, I told my partner and grabbed her cell phone to record, she looked at it and we questioned eachother; what could it be? then while recording this light moved straight up like an elevator and as if spotted then stopped traveled right toward the West in a fine precision turn very quietly into a straight parallel line then it made a turn our direction where it was about 200 feet away, this object was under 7 feet long about 4 feet wide but could not see a shape due to the lights; this is when I got startled because the window was opened and there was no noise coming out of the object just flashing colorful red and blue lights it stopped hovered for about 3 seconds;  Then the object ascended about 1000 feet up and away then stopped where it started to descend slowly as if a slow falling star, the Freedom Tower is noticeable about now in the background.  Then when at an equal height as in the beginning the unknown object made a left sharp fine left turn towards the East moving very parallel straight then stopped again then as if in an escalating motion continued in its path disappearing behind the buildings traveling East as if heading towards the East River; unknown object seemed to be heading towards the Williamsburg Bridge area. My research shows No NYPD, Commercial or News Helicopters reported in the area this date and time thus explains why I am reporting it as an unknown object",2015-01-07T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

UFO Sighting report – 10-22-2014, 5:30 AM in Andalusia Alabama. I got up early this morning and was standing outside enjoying the clear night sky. It was about 5:30 to 5:45. I was facing to the WNW and looking up at about 75 to 80 degrees. (almost straight up). I noticed that Orion was very prominent and that almost straight North or maybe NNW of Orion, I noticed what looked like a big smiley face in the sky with four stars in it. It made me smile. I thought to myself that it looked really cool and pondered why I had not noticed it before. I watched for maybe 15 to 20 seconds and then two of the stars (lights?) moved in exact opposite directions the one on the left went straight towards Orion and the second from the right headed what I’ll say is Northerly.  It seemed to be the exact opposite direction from the far left star.  I watched them moved for almost a minute.  The one on the right seemed to stop moving, the one on the left kept going and it seemed like maybe (since it was well far away by now and very dim) it had some sort of a tail.  The star on the right remained in the same position. I was watching it steadily.  Especially since the left one had moved and disappeared, I wanted to see what it would do.  After about 30 Seconds I noticed that it too was moving.  Only it was or seemed to be moving straight away and getting smaller and dimmer. It disappeared quickly. (10 Seconds?). Holy Cow! The only star left in the smiley face was the second from the left. It was also the brightest of the four original lights.  It seemed to be staying stationary.  I started wondering if there were other lights in the night sky moving around so I started to check out the rest of the sky. When I started watching the smiley face, there was a very very dim glow in the east from the sunrise.  So dim that if I was a rooster I would have waited a few more minutes to crow.  The sky was clear and all of the stars toward the west were still very bright. I looked all over the rest of the visible night sky and nothing caught my attention, so I looked back at the smiley face fourth star.  And it was completely GONE.  That’s it that’s all I know.

This tower as the Crow flies is about 10 miles away so from my point of view makes the tower appear about the height of my middle finger when I have my arm stretched out in front of my line of sight. The tower is right next to the Arizona Highway 191 and approximately halfway between the towns of Sanders and St. Johns. I noticed a silver object that appeared to be circular in shape and giving off of very bright metallic appearance similar to seeing a signal mirror in the Sun. The object from my point of view was perhaps no more than 400 yards South of the tower which from my angle it was right of the tower. It was also sightly lower in elevation than the top of the tower. I was fortunate to get another point of reference when I was a white box truck driving Northbound on Hwy 191. At that point I could easily see that this floating object was in appearance no larger than perhaps the cab of this box truck. I thought perhaps this was an optical illusion involving the Sun but as I shifted my angle in relation to the Sun and this object it remained.  I drive the 191 quite often and have done so for over 2 years now and I can tell you that there is no structure of that kind or anything else that would explain this. I quickly moved to even higher ground to get a look but after turning my head for only a second the object had vanished.

I was just taking pictures of the sunset and didn't even notice the orb.  The pictures were taken from the Mukilteo to Whidbey Island ferry as it was loading cars. You can see the Mukilteo Beach Lighthouse to the left of the photos and Whidbey Island in the background, and the orb appears in the area of roughly the SW sky from Everett/Mukilteo. Two seconds maximum is the time between taking the pictures.  You can see how fast/far the orb moved in that small time frame, and there is also two birds flying together to the left of the orb that appear to have traveled ten-twenty or so feet to backup the two seconds. There is also absolutely no cloud movement at all. Also, something I found to be very interesting is what appears to be similar in appearance to a vapor cone in the second picture.  A vapor cone is what is created when a jet breaks the sound barrier at around Mach 1 speed. (I'm ! sure you already knew this).

I had my sliding glass door open and I noticed 2 bright green orbs (circular balls) in the sky side by side. I would estimate that they were about 1 to 2 miles away from my house in La Habra when first saw them. I was looking in a south west direction at them. Within a few seconds they began to separate and go in different directions. One of them went in an easterly direction the other went north. There were no visible blinking lights on them. Just a green glowing ball of light. I walked out into my balcony and continued to watch them. They both seemed to be completely silent. The one going east was going over the hills along the south La Habra and Fullerton border. This orb was not high above the hills. Maybe it was only 200 to 300 feet above the hills. The other orb going north eventually went out of my sight range when it passed beyond the hill where I live. At this point I continued to watch the orb headed in an easterly direction over the hills along the La Habra and Fullerton border. I would estimate that it was traveling about 50 miles per hour I would guess. I noticed that this green orb then turned completed red for maybe 5 or 10 seconds and then back to green. After traveling about 1 to 2 miles it then came to a stop and just hovered for about 30 seconds to a minute. Then it began to descend straight down getting closer and closer to the ground. Where it was descending is about 1 to 1 ½ miles from my house. I expected that it would descend beyond the hill and out of sight but it turned out that it was on this side of the hill and I was able to continue to see it descend. During it’s descent I noticed that the other orb that had left my field of view reappeared from behind the hill and was moving directly toward the other. The orb that was descending then appeared as 3 lights. I saw a green light, a red light and a white light. The other orb as far as I could tell passed the one that was descending and seemed to go over the hill and out of sight. The orb that was descending eventually was obscured by trees across the street from me. I waited maybe 10 minutes to see if it would reappear but it did not. The next night I kept a watch out at the same time to see if they reappeared but I saw nothing.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,33.94119111111111,-117.95529333333333

I awoke, naked in a copper colored translucence room with rounded corners and indirect lighting.  A feminine (machine) voice spoke to me, answering my questions.  There was a rhythmic machine noise (or hum) in the distance and vibrations could be felt in the floor and walls of the craft. I believe the craft was quite large and that a form of artificial gravity was being used.  When I dropped objects they seemed to fall into their own footprint, not off center as would happen with centrifugal force generated gravity. The craft was large (I could only gauge its size from the rooms that I was allowed to traverse; hallways, hangars, corridors).  Perhaps as large as an American aircraft carrier. It appears to have been built for a humanoid form and the Air and climate was earth normal. All my communication was with the ""voice"" whom I knick-named ""Mother.""  It wasn't unpleasant.

The skies were dark at the time so it was easy to see.  It was not clear if it had flared out before making contact with the ground, or if it had disappeared into the trees.  It may have either fallen somewhere in North Carolina, or on the NC/VA border. As for the light itself, it appeared to be a pure white color, nonchanging.  From what I could tell, it didn't appear to be completely circular - I have vision corrected to 20/20 with glasses, but my eyes could have been playing tricks on me when it came to the shape of the object, due to flaws in observation or due to the fact that it was a ways out.

I was preparing to drive home after spending Christmas with family, when I first noticed what I thought was a meteoroid.  It caught my attention in the Southern sky at about 35 degrees and was on a Southerly heading straight down toward the horizon.  As a former member of the North West Jersey Amateur Astronomer club, I found it unique in that it clearly changed color from blue to purple, but the flight path was straight and the speed was commensurate with a typical fast moving meteoroid, so I continued to prepare for my drive. Within one to two minutes, I noticed that the object had climbed back out of the horizon and was making a series of turns that resembled the maneuvers of an aerobatic aircraft, with loops and turns that seemed to slow lightly at apex.  The object changed colors about 2-4 times per second and seemed distant in the Southern sky, climbing no higher than about 45 degrees.  What was especially odd was the relative speed of climbs and dives, which were closer to the speed of a a meteorite but clearly with maneuvering.  Based on my experience as a certified PPL, I would describe the maneuvers as governed by aerodynamics, with no sharp angled turns, but the speed of climbs and the acceleration in directional changes exceeds what I have seen out of even military aircraft at close range during airshows.  At an apparent distance, no conventionally powered turbine aircraft could display such speed and even if my judgment of distance was off, the climbs would still be out of the realm of possibility for any rotorcraft such as a drone.  The climbing speed was dramatic. In order to verify what I was seeing, I went back to the house and pounded on the window to get my sister's attention.  I motioned for her to come outside and when she did, the object was still maneuvering aerobatically and changing colors.  After another minute or so the object dove back down into the Southern horizon and did not reappear. From my perspective, the object had bounded its maneuvers within and below the constellations of Canis Major and Orion. The object appeared distant and was only seen as a bright point of light, approximately equal in magnitude to Sirius.",2015-01-07T00:00:00,40.94856006006006,-74.24151141141141

Houses were on long, narrow 10 acre lots - about two tenths of a mile up a hill on the edge of the woods.  I was 15 years old and no fear.   After the family went to bed I walked a mile up the road to my friend's.  Leaving about  1AM ,  walking alone  and  50 ft from the bottom of my driveway, I looked up to my left  and out of the north sky came a large lighted object!  It  stopped in mid air silently  hovering, just past the edge of the woods.  		I was so scared, I hid behind a large oak tree  peeking out not knowing what to do.  I was looking at a flying saucer and somehow knew "" they""  knew I was there.  Finally I ran up the driveway and stopped in front of the house watching "" it"".  It was maybe 200 ft across and  glowed a pale wite light in the center and rectangular shaped lights of different pale colors, red, blue, maybe green.  I wish I could be hypnotized to really remember the details.   All I could think of is "" who are they?'  I was overcome with a feeling they wouldn't hurt me.		   After I don't know how long it finally began slowly moving south, parallel to I71 with a slight up and down motion.  On top of our hill, I could see it for a few miles and it stopped, made three loud whirling noises and went straight down.  						I went in the house and looked at the clock.  It was 3am.   Later that summer, I saw headlines in the Columbus Dispatch where an airforce pilot reported seeing a UFO.  I had my proof.  Now I watch the skys and wonder.

The drive home is about 25 miles from where I worked.  The road that I traveled on goes through heavily forested land with many curves and no residences.  It was a dark, clear night, in a rural area. Now this is what happened, it’s like a scene out of a SYFY movie…  I was driving home through the woods, coming to the end of all the curves on the road, when all the sudden a man was standing out in the middle of the road (in the middle of nowhere) with his hands up in the air motioning me to stop.   I noticed he had blood dripping from his head.  I was hesitant to stop, God only knows why there is blood dripping from his head and I see nothing around us, no car, no homes, no one!  However, I did stop.  I made sure my doors were locked and I rolled down the window just a crack to speak to him.  He said “I just got in a car accident and I want you to drive me back to another city.”   Because I was a young female, and I didn’t see any evidence of a car accident, I told him to sit on the shoulder of the road, and I would go get help for him (no cell phone at the time), so I continued driving.  After arriving on the last curve, I came upon an accident scene, the police were there searching for the driver/victims of the vehicle.  I pulled over and told the police, “There is a bloody man back there a couple curves away.”   The police jumped in their car and sped off.  Meanwhile, a guy I knew from high school was there at the scene.  He was passing by on his motorcycle with his buddy.  He said to me, “This accident was pretty bad, pull up your car and put the headlights on it to see it.”  So I jumped in my car pulled it around so the headlights lit up the area.   When I got back out of my car, I continued to talk with them.  I was facing them and they were facing me, and that’s when something got my attention out of the corner of my eye!  All of the sudden, it appeared out of nowhere, hovering above this huge tree in the woods. It had no sound, and it was sphere shape (like a ball).  It was the brightest white light I’ve seen and you could actually look at it and it wouldn’t hurt your eyes.  I couldn’t see anything other than this big ball of white light, but you know something was in it, but all I could see was the illumination of it.   As I was seeing this unfold before my eyes, all I could say was, “OH MY GOD.”  When I said that, the guys saw the expression on my face and asked me, “What”? What?""  I couldn’t even speak to them at this point because my eyes were fixed on it, and this UFO moved so fast that it’s unbelievable!   I watched the UFO going from hovering to the heights of the heavens in the blink of an eye.  As the UFO traveled it had a fluorescent green exhaust beam come from the back of it!  I remember the night being so clear and you could see the stars.   All this happened within 30 seconds or less.  The UFO’s speed and destinations have no limits.  I used to watch the Stealth fighter fly and this UFO's speed makes the Stealth Fighter look like a standstill compared to it.  By the time I got the words out of my mouth, “Oh my God,” that is the amount of time the UFO needed to go from hovering at a standstill to going out into outer space!  How on earth do you measure that speed?   The UFO flew in an upward Northwest direction.  I’ll never forget this night.  I was standing outside very close to the UFO, I was on the ground, and it was above the tree.  I was scared and shaken after this.  I knew UFO’s were real, they do exist!",2015-01-26T00:00:00,44.3918,-83.8359

I have no idea what they were, my best guess is possibly satellites, but 5 or more in a perfect line seemed very odd.  Anyone seen anything like this?

At one point when I was facing in the exact direction of the light, I clearly seen a neon green flash of light and I asked my boyfriend if he had seen it and he did.  It was funny too because he also told me had kept seeing it at the corner of his eye as well and he thought it was something messed up with his vision/eye as well.   So, after we both realized this flash of light was legitmate, we both sat and stared in the direction of the light.  There was a wide tornado-shaped cloud above the mountain range in the distance but we had a clear view of this phenomenon.  The cloud kept lighting up neon green and at some points it would blink very fast and at other times it would go bright gradually and then dim down slowly.   Also, there was a strange humming or buzzing noise accompanying this incident.  It was very strange....we also started to hear coyotes crying/howling in the distance so we ended up leaving the spot we were at.  After hearing the coyotes, the light also went away.

We spotted the craft while driving west bound on interstate I-10, between Kenner, L.A. and Laplace, L.A.  The craft was to our left, to the south west.  At first it looked like an airplane was on fire and falling out of the sky.  There was a long trail of what can only be described as fire followed by smoke.  At first glance I would guess that this streak of fire was somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 feet in the air, which made me initially think that it might be an airplane on fire.  We continued to watch the object as we drove west bound on I-10.  We began to realize that whatever this was it was falling at a very slow rate, almost as if it wasn’t falling at all.  After watching this object for roughly 8-10 minutes, what appeared to be fire and smoke had extinguished and the craft ! was now visible and at roughly 10,000-15,000 feet in the air to the south west of Laplace, L.A.   The best way I can describe the object is to say that it was shaped like a pistachio shell.  There were no visible wings, props, or engines.  Its’ exterior was smooth.  When the body of the craft became visible it was apparent that it was no longer moving at all.  It was hovering around 10,000 feet.  We watched it hovering in the sky for roughly 10 seconds before it started to accelerate from a stand still.  It gained a tremendous amount of speed in less than 3 seconds.  Roughly 15 seconds after it began to accelerate we lost sight of it. I should note that the way in which it flew was eerily similar to what is portrayed in a science fiction movie.  It moved across the sky as if time had suddenly stopped and the only thing left in motion was the craft itself.  It was very strange.  I work in the aviation industry and am quite familiar with different types of aircrafts.  I can honestly say I’ve never seen anything move across the sky like I did on the afternoon of October 25th.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,29.96590338078292,-90.0784456405694

Residential neighborhood, houses on both sides, 30 miles/hour speed limit.  Light traffic (estimated about 5-7 cars driving behind my vehicle). Event Observation:  While driving back home through the residential neighborhood, there was an intense white light bursting into scene.  It happened by my vehicle’s immediate right, located near the lane divider, about spherical, diameter about 20 feet, height about 15 feet from the ground.  It lasted about 2-3 sec.   My vehicle drove right through it.  There was no sound, no smoke, no smell, no other phenomenon except the intense white light itself.  It appeared as a camera flash light, but magnified about 1 million times in size and intensity.   The street lights about 1 mile in radius went off (because the street lights have auto-light sensor and come on-off by themselves).  Then after about 2-3 minutes, they came back normal again.  The traffic light which was about 50 feet away from the spot was not affected.  The street lights came back none damaged.  None of the cars or other objects was damaged. Personal Experience:  I came back after a long meditation session and a bad day with family conflict.  My mind was very negative and dark, full of recursive heavy thoughts.  It was bitterly complaining about the meditation center and rumbling about it.  The exact thought while I was witnessing this event was, “These 2 spiritual experiences can be dangerous, people need to be careful about joining spiritual centers, they will brain wash you” (the 2 meant my previous Buddhist meditation center and the present one). I have been practicing meditation for a while and keenly aware of my inner state. Then the light came on, completely shocking to the minimal.  My 1st reaction was it felt like the street light above the vehicle (which is the modern yellow glowing high voltage powered one) or the high-voltage power line exploded.  It happened so fast that my car drove right through the light.  I had the aftermath wondering that how come my car did not get melted by it and I was still alive (I nearly felt my car would be exploded with it too).  The car behind me also drove right through, along with several other vehicles.  This made me feel safe that I was not hallucinating or hurt by anything, and my mind became very clear and calm. All the negative thoughts suddenly stopped and vanished.  I felt like being changed to my normal state again. Meanwhile, all street lights completed shut down.  Driving further 50 feet, I stopped by the traffic light which was red at that moment, and appeared to be very lonely in the complete darkness (a very interesting ethereal feeling).  I turned right as the way of going home, noticing the entire street lights on this road were also shut off.  After driving a further 50 feet on this road, the lights started to come back again.  I was very puzzled exactly what happened, and thought maybe something malfunctioned with the power line or street lights. I thought I need to call the city and it would be unsafe for people driving through the dark roads.  I took a U-turn through my house and drove back to the event location – this was about 5 minutes after.  Everything went back to normal, as if nothing had ever happened. There was no trace left whatsoever, except my mind was wondering about exactly what this was about.  Afterwards, a very close friend came unexpected and immediately when I got home, keeping me engaged busily for 2 hours before I went to bed.  The next morning when I recollected about this experience, it felt even more strange.  So I decided to file this report to see if other people have reported it or other similar events.",2015-01-07T00:00:00,29.5470222513089,-95.30299397905759

I saw something at about 45 degree in the falling towards earth at a very sharp angle, like if it was the hands of a clock, it would be facing seven o clock. It was traveling incredibly slow.  So slow, that I didn't know whether this was a contrail from an earlier plane or whether it was moving.  I had to use the telephone wire as a reference marker to make sure it was moving.   Once I realized it wasn't a contrail, a plane flew near it, on its own trajectory, giving me an immediate reference to the movement of planes.  As it started falling past the tree limbs it did something really funny.  It seemed to have compressed, almost like an accordion into itself and seemed just hover in the sky.  Watching this sent chills down my spine because it's movement was one I have never encountered in my life.  It wasn't a meteor because the speed was too slow.  Nothing could just fall from the sky at the rate it was falling.  The velocity was just too slow.   And it wasn't a plane.  I took a video, buts it's poor in quality, but I did take a few photos that didn't turn out so badly.  Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in seeing them.

It was slightly overcast and I could not see it or really determine what direction it was coming from. I actually expected a massive plane to come through the clouds and crash.  I felt the rumbling and the roar was as loud as being at the end of the runway when B-52's or C-5's are taking off.  It sounded very close.

Decades ago, in the middle of Winter, I believe 1975/76… my best friend and I experienced a U.F.O. event. It had to be the weekend as I was at my best friends house late, well after dark. We were watching t.v. and when a commercial came on, we decided to walk to the local Tom Thumb convenience store for snacks. The store was near, less than a block away. We left his house and walked around the side to the back of the house, heading toward Minnehaha Creek, which ran behind his house. The creek was frozen, and we chose to cross the creek over a bridge that was behind one of his neighbors house. It was a clear night, no clouds in the sky. The area back then was not overly developed, so there were only a few street lights scattered about, they did little to impede the view of the stars. The stars were bright against a black sky. As we approached the beginning of the bridge, we noticed a light in the woods to our left, or from the North. Without speaking, we stopped on the top of the tiny bridge, to watch the lights. My first thought was that it might be a snowmobile, though I had never seen a snowmobile in the city, it seemed the only logical explanation. Moments later, as the light moved closer to us, it became apparent that the light(s) were coming from above. As they came out from the trees, we could clearly see 2 distinct light beams, like search lights, beaming down from a source we could not see. The light originated from a source that was just above the tree tops, maybe 25 feet max? The lights moved slowly toward us, about the pace of someone jogging. The light crisscrossed slowly and seemed to be following the creek. I pondered whether it was a helicopter, but it made no sound and should have kicked up loose snow and debris. I wondered if it was a hot air balloon, but I never saw a flame, and it seemed unlikely. When it finally passed over us, we could finally  make out some shape, the object, which appeared to be black, with no reflection, cut a shape out of the sky. It blocked out the stars with a crisp circular shape. Though we could not see any details, the shape was undoubtedly circular, disc shaped. Again I stress, it made no sound. At this point the hair on the back of my neck was standing on end, this was clearly nothing conventional, we watched slack jawed as it continued on in a Southerly direction. We watched it slowly move around another cluster of trees and disappear. We hadn’t spoken a word the whole time, but then we turned toward each other, my friend spoke first. “Buddy, we can’t tell anyone we saw this”. Without further discussion, we went on our way. I knew he was right, no adults were ever going to take us seriously. I never spoke about it again for decades. We went down different paths, I lost track of my friend. But when I was a junior in college, coming back from a bar with my girlfriend, we ran into my old friend and his GF. We exchanged phone numbers and went on our ways. I began to wonder if I remembered the events from so long ago accurately, so I finally called him. Not wishing to taint his memory, I did not tell him what I saw first, instead I just asked him one question, “Do you remember that one night?” He then proceeded to describe the same event, in exactly the same details, with only one exception…  He claims we saw the UFO on our way back from the store, I am convinced it was on our way to the store. I consider this minor. The fact that he described the event in exactly the same details, confirms for me, that it was real and my memory is still clear. I reported this to MUFON, and the other 2 events from 2006/2009. They kept the 1976 report, and  the 2006 report, but deleted the 2009 report.

I had just gotten out of my car and was walking toward the front door of my house in Wheaton, IL, at around 10:30 PM when I looked south, up toward the sky, to suddenly see two lights zip across the sky faster than I have seen any craft fly in my life.  I believe this had to be only a single craft, because the two lights appeared to maintain the same distance from each other while flying through the air.  One light appeared to be red and the other green, just like a normal airplane would, but it covered a distance in what must have been less than a second that is physically impossible for any modern craft to travel.  It was there and then it was gone in an instant.  I could not decipher the physical shape of the craft because it was dark out and also because of the speed it moved at. I could see the lights traveling through the air however, and it looked like they left a streak behind them as it flew through the sky, but I think that had more to do with the fact ! that the lights were moving so fast.  When I looked over in the direction where I thought the craft had traveled (It seemed to be heading southwest), I saw a bright blue light that was flickering a little. I pulled up an application on my phone to see if it was perhaps a planet or star rather than any physical craft I might have seen. From what I could tell on my phone, it was just Neptune. The craft I had seen warp through the sky was nowhere to be found. It was just gone an instant after I had seen it streak through the sky at impossible speeds.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,41.85879405940594,-88.11430594059405

On the evening of Wednesday, January 14, 2015, I got onto I-91 North from an exit just up from the intersection of Rt. 89 (NH/VT border).  Shortly after getting on the main highway, I noticed that there were breaks in the clouds, and that I could see stars in the sky.   I glanced out of the driver's side window (looking West), and noticed an extremely bright object, which I thought at first was a planet.  I kept looking, off and on, as I drove, and as I focused, I could make out that what I was looking at, was actually a cluster of three, very bright lights.   I had an urge to pull over to get a better look, but I had a truck behind me, and no good place to pull over.  As it was, I slowed down temporarily to almost 40 mph, in an effort to get a better look at this array of lights.   To aid in my view, I lowered the driver's side window, to avoid any glare.  It confirmed that I was seeing a tight cluster of three lights.  They appeared bright white, while at least one had some red in it.   The cluster seemed mostly to hover, although I did detect some slight movement. The size was about 1/3 of a dime, held at arm's length ( 3-5 times that of a bright star).  The cluster was about 35 - 40 degrees above the horizon.   I had no camera with me, nor binoculars, but in the hope of getting a better look, I doubled back at the (8 miles further) Thetford, VT, exit.  By the time I had returned to the area of sighting, cloud cover had moved in, and/or the object could not be located.   I wasn't going to report this, but after checking to see if others may have seen something similar, and discovering that there had been similar sightings around that date and area, I decided to report what I saw.

It was dark, 18:30, when we saw three separate bright orange lights flying over the town descending from the north east in the direction of the airport.  My first impression was three aircraft on a very low approach to land at the Friday Harbor Airport. I stopped our car so we could watch, since the lights were starting to bob up and down.  I said they had to be helicopters.  But then they almost appeared to be going down  behind the buildings in town. They stopped getting closer and suddenly started climbing at a very high speed headed back northwest.  They grew dimmer, and one at a time, blinked out and were gone. The whole duration of this sighting was about two minutes.  I kept trying to find an explanation for what we were seeing.  I wish I had immediately reached for my I-phone to get a video.  I knew they were unconventional aircraft since they didn’t have red and green navigation lights.  Then the erratic flight and changing speed ruled out any aircraft I have ever seen.

My house at 1300 Mary Street West was only a couple of blocks away and when driving home I could still see it high up in the east sky.  The object then moved toward the airport right over my head but was still high up. I called my daughter out of the house to come and see this thing. It flew by us to my surprise I was so happy that I had another witness.  It took off without sound from the big dipper area towards Cassiopeia then disappeared. We waited around to see anything else around when maybe 20 minutes later I seen it or another one come right over a tree in front of my house heading directly east.  We were both amazed as it was very close to ground this time and appeared as a red/orangey fireball as my daughter put it.  It then gained altitude quickly and sped off towards Cassiopeia again and disappeared.  Most remarkable it didn't make any noise and there were no blinking lights like the many aircraft I am used to seeing in my area.  After watching a UFO TV show later I learned of the G force and estimated that the object could have went up to near 20 G's as it disappeared in a speed not possible for mankind.  I thought it could be a drone later but it was too big. It was slightly rectangular in shape and about the size of the bottom of a helicopter.  The remarkable thing was that it did not make any noise even when it flew by over our heads.

As usual, I was doing a sky watch as I have had several good UFO sightings up here in the past during previous camp trips here.  At about 22:35 hours I noticed a bright light below and to the right of the 'pointers' in the Big Dipper, about 10-15 degrees above the horizon.  Knowing there were no bright stars in this area I watched the light, which appeared motionless at first.  After a minute the light began to move slowly towards the west, too slow for an aircraft or satellite.  During this time an aircraft did fly over, moving much faster than the light.  I remember thinking that I hoped it would ! do something to show me it was a UFO.  After a minute I turned to grab my binoculars to get a closer look at the light and when I turned back it was gone.  I scanned the sky with the binoculars in the area where I had last seen it and there was nothing there.  No flashing lights that might have indicated a conventional aircraft, no clouds around that it might have gone into.  I have seen lights like this several times before in CO and also in AZ, so I believe this was a probable alien craft.",2014-10-03T00:00:00,,

I was out late on a Saturday night stargazing with my telescope and binoculars. I had just been viewing Messier objects such as M42 in Orion when I decided to give my left eye a break.  I moved over to the table near my back door and stood there in my backyard just looking at the sky, hoping to see some meteors as it was morning.  Then about 5 minutes of looking up something odd caught the corner of my eye, thinking it might be a meteor. I was standing, looking up, but facing west, where at the northwest part of the sky (near constellation Cygnus), high above the tree line I saw this dark gray winged looking object. There were no lights and it blends in well with the background sky.  There was absolutely no sound, this thing was completely silent even after it was gone.  I doubt anyone outside would have taken notice if they were not looking up at the sky.  I could not estimate distance, elevation or speed other then the time it was visible.  It moved from the northwest corner of ! sky to the south in longer than 4 seconds.  I reached for my binoculars sitting on my table but before I could bring them up to my eyes, I lost the object after it was below the constellation Cetus heading towards Girard, IL.  I can say the wing span when it past thru Cetus, was from the star Braten Kaitos to n-Cetus.  This is about 10 degrees of sky. My first thoughts were of bewilderment.  I don’t believe what I just saw. It was thinking of what it could have been.  It could have been migrating geese.  They do travel at night, but they move slower and often make audible quacks.  This moved much faster than geese. I also don’t believe it was close to the ground, judging by the trees.  It was much higher in the sky. What ever it was, didn’t want to be seen, because there were no lights and it was dark grey.  It had a distinct shape; I wouldn’t call it a v-wing but more like crescent shaped wing. It could have been some sort of stealth aircraft that is not publicly know.  Scott air force base is about 80 miles south of my location, but it’s not known to operate any test vehicles. I stayed out for another 20 minutes, hoping something would happen again or another vehicle would follow its same path. Nothing happened. During this time, I had many different emotions, from curiosity to fear. Fearful thoughts started take over and I decided to bring in all my equipment. I then began to look on the internet for similar witness accounts. I found this site and composed a report. I am hoping someone else in central Illinois may have been out late like me and saw the same thing. My background is former Navy, been around lots of naval aircraft. I have worked in the field of electronics for nearly 20 years. I am an amateur astronomer (hobby). I used to go to air shows at El Toro Marine Base before it was closed in the 1990s often in my youth in southern California. I have seen many different kinds of military aircraft including both the stealth fighter and stealth bomber flown at El Toro. As an amateur astronomy, I see plenty of high flying commercial and military flying over central Illinois at night. I also witness satellites such as the ISS to the random flare from an Iridium satellite.  I have also seen loads of meteors and bolides in my times stargazing.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,39.5011,-89.7482

At first glance they looked like very short contrails but as we continued to observe them we noticed that they were stationary and not becoming longer like a contrail. I was driving and had to pay attention to the road but my wife says she counted 9 of these disc shaped objects before they disappeared one at a time.  By the time she took pictures only two remained. I think in a couple of the pictures there are three of them. Not only did we see these objects to the west but we both saw one blinking orange star like object which was roughly to the south of our position at approximately 45 degrees (just taking a guess on that). I saw this object looking out the driver’s side window while still traveling westbound.  It looked a lot like a very bright Mars but I am certain it was not a planet or an airplane.  It was not quite dark yet and no stars were visible at that time. It was unlike anything I have seen in the sky before. I looked at it and it disappeared.  It did not blink like an airplane and I wouldn't exactly say it pulsated. It was more like a slow steady blink with roughly 10-15 seconds between blinks until it just disappeared.  It seemed stationary and I definitely believe it was in our atmosphere and not in space.  I feel that the star like object was closer to us but it is very hard to tell.

Not airplane or helicopter. I am an amateur astronomer with 50 years of sky watching, thousands of hours, a college degree in Geology.  Until now I have never seen anything in the sky that could not be explained as a natural, although sometimes unusual, event. I was out in my yard looking for meteors and relaxing when an object appeared from behind my roof.  It was in the SW sky about 15-18 degrees above the horizon, moving to the ESE and caught my attention, initially as an airplane with red, green and white lights over the trees.  It was far enough away  that the body of the craft was not discernible, due to its bright lights, and it was clearly high in the sky being visible over the trees at the back of my property.  I glanced directly at it, and immediately thought there was something very odd, in that the lights were blurry, fuzzy looking.  More like orbs than the lights of a plane.  There were stars clearly visible nearby that were pinpoints of light so it was just odd in the cloudless sky. The object was visible and moving West to SE slowly for almost five seconds until it slowed quickly and then stopped completely.  My first thought was that the object was turning and only appeared to stop but the lights, which were clearly separate colors, were not reorienting themselves as a turning airplane would certainly do.  The red and green light did not blink or change intensity.  The white light on the right (West) side of the object was pulsating, dimming and brightening, unlike an airplane with strobes that blink.  The object appeared to hover for about ten seconds with no other changes in the lights and then abruptly reversed its course back to the NW.  The way that it started moving was too abrupt for a turning airplane, it was almost like a computer animation in that it seemed to jump to its path with no curving motion and a very short period of acceleration followed the initial jump.   I then maintained a very steady, straight path in departing.  I was able to ! change position and watch the object for several minutes.  I attracted my wife's attention and she was able to see the object also while it departed NW and disappeared near the horizon. At no time did the orientation of the lights change as I would expect with an airplane. Nor were the lights pinpoints as typical with airplanes.  These lights were diffuse orbs that were close enough to overlap.  The brightness of the orbs and dark sky did not allow a hint of the actual shape of the object to show. I have always been skeptical of stories told by others about lights in the sky because I had never seen anything that I felt was not ""explainable"" but this event has made me wonder just what I actually saw.  I think that it was definitely not a ""normal"" aircraft and was obviously a craft under intelligent control.   It was an ""unidentified"" object that I hope others will have reported and perhaps identified as a natural object, but it was NOT something that I have ever seen before.",2015-01-26T00:00:00,30.19079350912779,-92.04514239350912

I could also make out a very dark point on the craft which I thought to be the front of it, or the tip of the triangle.   It stopped and hovered over a group of trees as I drove down the highway.   I quickly screamed to my sleeping mother in the passenger’s seat to look out her window.  She woke up and immediately saw what I was yelling about.  She was mesmerized.  I was trying to look at the craft and the road at the same time and that was when I noticed that the edges of the craft were more rounded, almost like a popsicle stick.  It had two layers, on the bottom was the color of the cloudy night sky, and the top was a very brilliant black color.   I fumbled for my phone that had a camera attached to it and my mom watched as it hovered over a group of trees.  It hovered only about five to ten feet over the tree tops.  She got a better view of the craft and said that the red light in the center of the “V” was very “unusual” and very large and red.

I had gone to my car to retrieve a book I wanted and as I returned I saw the object hovering and gliding around low in the sky.  The sighting occurred from about 8:10 till 8:30 PM. The object was round and bright red with a bright yellow spot in the lower right section. The object glimmered or pulsed in brightness.  Visually in size in appeared to be about one-sixth to one eighth the size of the full moon.   Since the trees and houses blocked my view of it as it went behind them, I estimate that it was at least 1000 feet away, perhaps a quarter mile or even half a mile or more, so it seemed quite large.  Its movements were very strange in that it seemed to float, totally silent, in various directions at various speeds, mostly at moderate speeds.  It went upward in a straight line, floated both left and right, reversed directions easily, descended below the tree line, then quickly ascended to its previous position and again moved around the sky silently. After observing it for two minutes or so, I realized I had my cell phone, and began videotaping the object.  After videotaping for a minute or two, I ran into the house to get my girlfriend.  She came out and together we watched the object for another three or four minutes, videotaping with my cell phone again, until the object descended behind the trees and houses toward the ground away from us at good speed.  It descended toward the north.   At that point, it did not return so we went inside.  Several times over the next hour I checked the sky and did not see it again.  Two videotapes were made of the object.  The cell phone video does not do justice to its actual visual size in the sky.  However, its gliding, floating movements are well recorded.",2015-01-26T00:00:00,27.065819,-82.39104

That night at around 11:00pm, I saw a very large bright light escaping from the second to last star on the handle of the ""big dipper"", it was heading due east for about 5 seconds before it shot straight up and out of sight in a blink of an eye.  My second sighting came in late March of 2000 at about 5:30pm on my way home from work driving West from Mound to Watertown.  I was looking straight ahead at a large cloud off in the distance when a silver UFO came peeking out of the clouds, it stopped about 20 feet out in the open when another one popped out and went right over it.  The two crafts literally played leap-frog in and out of the clouds for about 2 minutes then disappeared.   The reason I am emailing you is not because of those two sightings, but of my last one which was also seen by my fiancé and eldest son.  This time, there were two UFOS and we got one of them on video and the other one on camera.  This occurred on September 18th, 2014 at around 9:00pm just over our house in Waconia, MN.  The craft was hovering above our house for about 5 minutes then headed SE at an incredible speed and evenutaully out of sight.  The craft had lights but the entire thing was engulfed in a deep purple haze.  It looked like a purple ball surrounding the UFO. We captured this craft on video with my sons phone.  You can't see the color but you get to see it fly away, make a couple 90 degree turns, stop on a dime, go straight up and back down.  It made ZERO sound and was nothing I have ever seen on ANY alien show before.  I have seen hundreds of UFO Sighting shows, Hangar 1, etc....and what I saw has never been documented as far as I can remember. My son and I chased it for 15 minutes in our car but saw nothing so we headed back home.  Before I could pull into our driveay my son yelled to stop the ca! r.  We got out and sure enough the second UFO was right above ! out hous e in the same spot as the other one.  It too headed in the exact same direction.  This one was a blueish green color changing between the two. We got a picture of this craft. It also made no sound.  There was also a very large, low-flying, incredibly slow-moving(what looked to be a very, very large military plane) that my son and I both saw over the city of Waconia within 30 minutes of the original sighting. I have wanted to be a part of MUFON for the last 5 years or so.  I would love nothing more than to be an investigator. I want to help people with their stories and most importantly, I want to bring UFO's out in the open for everyone to see.  They are real, they are here and they aren't going away.  I would love to show MUFON my video and picture. I am not afraid nor do i care of what people think or say.  I honestly believe that this is what I was meant to be doing with my life.

Its a six hour drive from Asheville.  I was right on time. It would have been utterly impossible to go from Morganton to Rocky Mount in only 2 and 1/2 hours.

UFO above I-40 between Old Fort and West Morganton, North Carolina.  At 10 pm, last Sunday night, October 26, 2014, I was driving I-40 east-bound on my way home to Rocky Mount from a weekend checking on my elderly mom in Hendersonville, NC.  I left at 6:30 pm, took 26 west in heavy traffic to Asheville by 7PM, and then took 40 east.  I came over the Black Mountain Pass and stopped at the Old Fort McDonald’s for a quick break and was back on the road about 8:00 pm.  It was dark by then. I drove east on I-40 for about half an hour, when suddenly I noticed above me and ahead of me the thick edge of a brightly shining luminous white disk hanging in the night sky.  It was very high up, but right over the road.  It did not move.  The dashboard clock said 10 PM!  What!????  I was between a steep mountain ridge paralleling the road on my right, to the south, and a hillside to the north.  Both sides of the road were heavily wooded as far as I could see in the dark.  I could not see any houses or lights anywhere.  I looked for a mile marker, but didn’t find one. The object was amazing.  It was as if I Iooked straight on to the side of a doughnut, then lifted it up to about an 11:00 position.  I could see the brilliant white light and the thick wide curves of the right and left sides.  I drove under it a few minutes later, with some trepidation.  I thought the object might be a reflection of some sort off the windshield, so I opened the sunroof completely, sliding the glass back all the way.  Looking up thru the open sunroof, I could see that it was a perfect white circle with three very bright green circular lights under it.  The three green lights clustered in the center together, quite pretty.  They looked exactly like the three circular razors on the head of an electric Norelco razor.  Neither the white object nor the three green lights beneath it appeared to spin, move, or rotate, though.  There was no sound or vibration.  It was not a balloon. What was it?  The atmosphere was clear and not misty or foggy, so there were no perceptible light beams through the air.  There was not wind that night. I thought it might be a house on the mountain to my right.  However, the mountain was very steep and I could see the darker ridge line lower down to my right against the sky, farther away.  There were no lights on the mountain. So the brilliant light was not coming from anything on the mountain itself.  It was above me and not over on the mountain.  To my left was the west bound lane and heavy woods and trees and another steep slope whose top I could not see for the trees.  There were no lights to my left either. Above me, there were no clouds in the sky.  The object was against a starry sky. The moon was up that night, but it was to the south-southwest, according to the moon app on my cell phone, and it was out of my vision range, south of the high mountain ridge to my right somewhere.  The bright object was definitely not the moon or any planet.  It was way too big for that.  The light was brilliant, but not blinding.  If I put my hands up and held them about a foot apart, that’s how big it appeared when I first saw it, as I approached it. Looking up through the open sunroof, I heard no sound and did not feel anything.  The object was completely still in the air, not moving, not rotating, just hovering up above and very slightly off to the side, to the right/south of I-40.  It was lower than the mountain ridge to my right.  It was closer to the road than to the mountain.  As I drove under it, I was a little scared, but nothing happened.  I would say it was at about the 1:00 position above the highway.  There was no other traffic around me on the east bound lane.  Since I was looking up, I didn’t notice if there was any traffic coming toward me on the west bound lane.  I passed a small unlit exit on my right leading downwards to the south, but passed it too quickly to catch the number.  Then, I came into trucks and had to take my eyes away. When I looked back, I couldn’t see the object anymore because the road curved. I came up to the Morganton exit, several minutes after I saw the object. I don’t know how to explain the missing time between 8:30 and 10:00 pm. It doesn’t take an hour and a half to drive between Old Fort and Morganton!  I was driving between 65 and 70 miles an hour, so I couldn’t have fallen asleep.  I left Asheville at about 7pm, and Old Fort about 8:00, so I should have been past Statesville by 10 PM.  My dashboard clock is accurate. I will be 67 this month.  I am a retired school teacher and live near Rocky Mount, NC.  I don’t smoke, drink, do drugs, or mess around.  I have backpacked around the world twice and am an avid hiker and trekker.  As a teacher, I am rational, objective, and factual.  I don’t believe in UFO’s.  I have never seen one.  However, I try to keep an open mind and entertain possibilities without judgment. What did I see?  And what happened to me in the missing hour and a half?  Perhaps I made a mistake?  I think I will make the drive again soon and double check the time and my position.  I know that steep mountain ridge, just not sure exactly where it is.  I tried to check on Google Earth, but it does not give elevations, so I could not tell exactly where I was.  Surely, there must be an explanation.  I have reported the incident to the Superintendent of the Burke County Sheriff's office.  She told me that she would report it to the airport management for Burke County Airport. Photo?  My phone was dead and charging, but it would have been dangerous to do while driving, and I didn’t feel safe stopping that late at night in such a location.  Frankly, I MUST have seen a UFO, what else could it have been?  Yes, I have lost time twice before that I know of; once at twelve years old and once in India in 1976.  I have no explanation.  I experienced a great sense of urgency both times, but don't know why. “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophies.”  Hamlet, Scene V -W. Shakespeare.

I want to know what this was, and what's going on.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,35.58215752808989,-82.55326561797752

UFO above I-40 Between Old Fort and West Morganton, North Carolina At 10 pm last Sunday night, October 26, 2014 I was driving I-40 east-bound on my way home to Rocky Mount from a weekend checking on my elderly mom in Hendersonville, NC. I left at 6:30 pm, took 26 west in heavy traffic to Asheville by 7PM, and then took 40 east. I came over the Black Mountain Pass and stopped at the Old Fort McDonald’s for a quick break and was back on the road about 8:00 pm.  It was dark by then. I drove east on I-40 for about half an hour, when suddenly I noticed above me and ahead of me the thick edge of a brightly shining luminous white disk hanging in the night sky.  It was very high up, but right over the road. It did not move.  The dashboard clock said 10 PM! What!????   I was between a steep mountain ridge paralleling the road on my right, to the south, and a hillside to the north.  Both sides of the road were heavily wooded as far as I could see in the dark. I could not see any houses or lights anywhere.  I looked for a mile marker, but didn’t find one. The object was amazing.  It was as if I Iooked straight on to the side of a doughnut, then lifted it up to about an 11:00 position. I could see the brilliant white light and the thick wide curves of the right and left sides.   I drove under it a few minutes later, with some trepidation. I thought the object might be a reflection of some sort off the windshield, so I opened the sunroof completely, sliding the glass back all the way.  Looking up thru the open sunroof, I could see that it was a perfect white circle with three very bright green circular lights under it, quite pretty.  They looked exactly like the three circular razors on the head of an electric Norelco razor.  Neither the white object nor the three green lights beneath it appeared to spin, move, or rotate, though.  There was no sound or vibration.  It was not a balloon. What was it? The atmosphere was clear and not misty or foggy, so there were no perceptible light beams through the air. There was not wind that night. I thought it might be a house on the mountain to my right. However, the mountain was very steep and I could see the darker ridge line lower down to my right against the sky, farther away. There were no lights on the mountain. So the brilliant light was not coming from anything on the mountain itself. It was above me and not over on the mountain. To my left was the west bound lane and heavy woods and trees and another steep slope whose top I could not see for the trees. There were no lights to my left either. Above me, there were no clouds in the sky. The object was against a starry sky. The moon was up that night, but it was to the south-southwest, according to the moon app on my cell phone, and it was out of my vision range, south of the high mountain ridge to my right somewhere. The bright object was definitely not the moon or any planet. It was way too big for that. The light was brilliant, but not blinding. If I put my hands up and held them about a foot apart, that’s how big it appeared when I first saw it, as I approached it. Looking up through the open sunroof, I heard no sound and did not feel anything. The object was completely still in the air, not moving, not rotating, just hovering up above and very slightly off to the side, to the right/south of I-40. It was lower than the mountain ridge to my right. It was closer to the road than to the mountain. As I drove under it, I was a little scared, but nothing happened. I would say it was at about the 1:00 position above the highway. There was no other traffic around me on the east bound lane. Since I was looking up, I didn’t notice if there was any traffic coming toward me on the west bound lane.I passed a small unlit exit on my right leading downwards to the south, but passed it too quickly to catch the number. Then, I came into trucks and had to take my eyes away. When I looked back, I couldn’t see the object anymore because the road curved. I came up to the Morganton exit, several minutes after I saw the object. I don’t know how to explain the missing time between 8:30 and 10:00 pm. It doesn’t take an hour and a half to drive between Old Fort and Morganton! I was driving between 65 and 70 miles an hour, so I couldn’t have fallen asleep. I left Asheville at about 7pm, and Old Fort about 8:00, so I should have been past Statesville by 10 PM. My dashboard clock is accurate. I will be 67 this month.

As a teacher, I am rational, objective, and factual. I don’t believe in UFO’s. I have never seen one. However, I try to keep an open mind and entertain possibilities without judgment. What did I see? And what happened to me in the missing hour and a half? Perhaps I made a mistake? I think I will make the drive again soon and double check the time and my position. I know that steep mountain ridge, just not sure exactly where it is. I tried to check on Google Earth, but it does not give elevations, so I could not tell exactly where I was. Surely, there must be an explanation. Photo?  My phone was dead and charging, but it would have been dangerous to do while driving, and I didn’t feel safe stopping that late at night in such a location.  Frankly, I MUST have seen a UFO, what else could it have been?  Yes, I have lost time twice before that I know of; once at twelve years old and once in India in 1976. I have no explanation. I experienced a great sense of urgency both times, but don't know why. “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophies.”  Hamlet, Scene V -W. Shakespeare.
