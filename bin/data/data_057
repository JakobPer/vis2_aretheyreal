On Monday Oct. 27, 2008 while driving home from work, I observed three large circular objects low in the sky just to the west of Hwy 35, near Liverpool Texas.  I slowed as much as possible to get a better view.  If I had to do it over I would have pulled over and gotten out to at least take a photo with the camera in my phone.  I observed them for as long as possible through my side mirror. I then turned to the east off of Hwy 35.  I drove the one mile to our subdivision.  As I turned into the subdivision, I saw at the end of the street another of the large circular objects low in the sky, just above the tree line.  I was frightened at first thinking that one of the three had followed me home because I had observed them. I very slowly drove down the street keeping my eyes on the object in the sky.  As I came to the end of the street, I stopped and stared up at the object through my windshield.  After about 30 seconds, the object suddenly moved up over and behind the trees, as if to hide from my view.  I could see it through the trees and very slowly turned towards my street. As I came to my street I had to turn my back to the trees where the object was positioned.  As I drove down the street I turned to look behind me and saw the object very quickly coming over the trees behind me.  I stepped on the gas to get as much distance as possible between the object an myself.  I arrived home and got my husband from inside the house to accompany me to the street to see the object.  He too saw the object. Since that day I have been more aware of the movements in the sky and have seen many more things that would not have been a plane or helicopter.  But no others came as close as the one that appeared to have followed me home. Another incident: Two years ago on my way into Alvin early in the morning, I had to stop behind a school bus picking up children.  As I was waiting, it appeared to be a shooting star or meteor coming out of the sky from the west to the east.  It suddenly stopped in the air and the debris that followed it fell past the object. As soon as possible, I passed the school bus and hurried to see what it was that I had observed.  I could still see the object in the sky ahead of me.  I suddenly found myself underneath the object.  I rolled down my window and stuck my head out to get a good view.  It was shaped like nothing I had ever seen.  It was sort of an hour-glassed shape with lights on either end and a light on the underneath.  I could hear a hum and the pitch would change as the object would light up on one end and move in that direction.  It changed directions several times.  Then it slowly began to move to the west away from the highway.  I drove to the Kroger parking lot and watched it until it was out of sight.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,29.285,-95.2681

Anyways, after she started driving back to my home (about 5 seconds later) it lowered it self back down to its original section i saw it in (50-100 feet back down) and the glow was really bright, i can see it clearly and i can see the clouds details so good because of its glow it had. Once it went back down 50-100 feet it vanished as if it was never there, i dont know... i might have blinked??????????!??!  Either way i beleive in UFO's and i have watched a lot of documentaries.

I thought it was a strange constellation and they weren't blinking and suddenly I realized that they were moving directly away from me flying to the southeast. After about five seconds, they faded away from my view. Conditions were about half an hour or so after sunset, and mostly clear with just a bit of haze. The two lights appeared to be moving away in tandem with what I can only describe as a ""gliding"" motion, not fast, but not really slow, either. The courtyard is lit with orange vapor lanterns. I would describe the brigtness of the object or objects as being of medium intensity, and they were unblinking. My friend was facing toward me, so he didn't observe them. A small plane flew into the immediate area of the sky about a minute or so later, and looked quite different from what I previously saw. I would estimate that the objects were at about a 45 degree angle in the sky from my position and fairly high as I observed them over a two story apartment building.

It had no blinking lights like an aircraft so I called out to my boyfriend to come outside and take a look. He came out, took one look and said to record exactly what time it was (8:20 PM), he then went inside and retrieved a rifle with a high powered scope and we began to watch this thing through the scope. We live on a ranch so we have open views and dark sky. This object ""floated"" or hovered for 13 minutes before descending or headed away so that we could not see it, although with our naked eyes it looked like it descended somewhere in the Jewett Mine area. While watching it through the scope, we saw that it was emitting a faint white or bluish glow at varying times. It was very strange.

A color changing point of light in the sky turns out to be a whole lot more.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.

On the night of October 28th, 2008, I arrived home from work around midnight.  I got out of my car and stood in the driveway as I took the last drags of a cigarette, gazing into the clear night sky as I often do.  Looking in a southern direction, I noticed a point of light that seemed to be changing colors.  The light would change from blue to green to red to yellow with no apparent pattern or timing to the change of color.  As the color changes occurred, the point of light seemed to retain a brilliant white color throughout, seemingly intermeshed with the colors mentioned above.  The color of the light struck me as quite peculiar, and I thought to myself jokingly, “what if it’s a UFO”, but because the light was stationary, and because I was skeptical of extra terrestrials, I finished my smoke and dismissed the light as a strange star or planet and headed inside for bed. The following night (10/29/08) I arrived home at the same time and again looked for my strange light to the southern sky.  The light was there but seemed closer than the night before.  It loomed over my neighbor’s property along the wood-line, behind his cow pasture, approximately 300 yards from where I stood in my driveway.  Separating the light and myself was (in order from me to the light) my front yard, the road, and the neighbors cow pasture that ends into the wood-line where the light occupied a space above.  The night was relatively clear with the exception of a very small group of clouds that hung just above the strange light.  Once again I brushed off the lights appearance and headed inside. About an hour later I went back out to my driveway to have a smoke around 1 a.m.  I again looked at the light but this time its position had noticeably changed.  I was quite confused by the apparent change of the light’s position, but became dumbfounded when I watched it move with my own eyes.  The light shot towards me with incredible speed, but maintained its previous altitude.  I was shocked by the light’s ability to accelerate and stop so rapidly.  The light was much closer now.  It hung motionless in the sky above the road separating the neighbor’s property and my own, but not for long.  As I watched, the light began to move in a circular motion in the sky followed by a square pattern.  The light traveled the outline of an imaginary square in the sky, accelerating with great speed and stopping on a dime at each corner only to repeat the process until the square outline was complete.  About that time I had seen enough to become thoroughly frightened. My heart raced as did my mind.  I discarded the half smoked cigarette and ran inside making sure to lock the door behind me. I watched the light from my bedroom window, noting its movement by looking at its relation to near by stars.  It glided across the sky moving closer and then farther away and the closer, in no particular pattern and at slower speeds than before.  I watched the light from my bedroom for approximately half an hour until I gathered enough courage to go outside for closer inspection with a pair of binoculars.  Upon looking at the light I realized that it was not a single light but many.  I can only describe it as a gyroscope.  It was a series of three rings, arranged inside each other with the largest on the outside.  Each ring had a series of lights around it, and each ring seemed to have its own distinct color; blue, red, and yellow.  The rings were moving inside each other on multiple axes in no discernable pattern.  I watch this self described gyroscope through the binoculars for about ten minutes until fear got the best of me.  Back inside the house I watched the strange light.  Around 2 a.m. two other lights approached the U.F.O. but passed it taking no notice.  Judging by their speed and flight path, these two additional lights were jets of human making.  I watched the U.F.O. until approximately 3:30 a.m., at which time I closed the blinds, took some night-time sleep aid medicine, and fell asleep fully convinced that the strange light outside my window was a U.F.O. My opinion is changed.  I am no longer a skeptic, but a full believer.  My encounter with the U.F.O., in my small farming community of Palmyra, cannot fully be explained by words alone.  I only wish I had a video camera to capture the spectacle (cell phone cameras don’t work very well).  The feelings I felt that night are unexplainable.  In my twenty odd years of existence I can’t remember another time in which I felt such fear; fear of the unknown and the feeling of being watched, closely watched, by someone or something I can’t explain.  The most interesting sight in the whole experience was the gyroscope-like mechanism that composed the whole point of light.  My best guess is that the gyroscope-like mechanism was an advanced propulsion system, but that’s just a guess.  Overall, my encounter with that strange light was an eye opening and frightening experience that has forever changed my opinion of life and the universe.

He said it was about half the size of a football field, triangular in front and round in back, slightly curled sides and curled tip and resembled a sting ray. I interviewed all four of these teenagers and they each told the same description except for the estimated size of the aircrafts.  My daughter drew a picture of the underside of the UFO and they all agreed that it was what they saw. When the girls had reached the well lit parking lot at Wal Mart, an odd looking man, about 30 years old, wearing a green pullover top and blue jeans, approached their car.  They locked the car and rolled up the windows.  The man seemed to scan the car from the front, sides, top and back and even looked through the back window of the SUV.  He had a bulging forehead (a very large bulging forehead).  After a full scan of the car, the man suddenly disappeared from behind the car. Inside Wal Mart, they encountered a family of four blonde people.  The children looked to be 15 years-old and the younger one about ten years-old. All had the same exact shade of blonde hair. The girls were at the trash bag isle when the family approached. The family was asking questions about the trash bags. The mother spoke without an accent.  The youngest boy had a distinct British accent, and the father and eldest son had deep southern accents.  The girls felt like they were cornered by this family. When they got back home, their computer wouldn’t work.  It kept saying “Resend” when there was nothing they were sending.  After a while, it began to work again. All four agreed that they felt light- headed after seeing these UFOs and very groggy in the morning as though they had been drinking the night before.  The girls said that after the sightings, they seemed to have less and less memory of it even though they had talked about it.

On September 19, 2009 at 7:50 PM, I was laying on a hammock facing the southern sky on my raised (level to a second story) back porch. The sky was dark, after sunset. I had been watching the stars come out. The sky was clear, no cloud coverage at all. No moon in the sky. (The moon was in new phase, and rising and setting during the day, according to a moon phase website). The hammock is on a self-supporting frame, and there is nothing on my porch to block my view facing east or south. My house was to my right, or west. I was looking at my phone when a bright light above and slightly to the right of my perspective caught my attention.  The light was an extremely bright and extremely large white light, shining down towards the ground. It was very high in the air, possibly higher than aircraft would generally fly.  The light spread out like an upside down cone, but without a distinguishable tip.  For about 15 seconds, the outline or form of the light was very clear and distinguishable. The light was about the size of a normal full moon, or just slightly smaller.  The light rose vertically.  As it did, the clarity of the outline of the light dissipated and was replaced by a patch of “brightness” in the sky, which slowly became larger and larger, then faded slowly to black. This process lasted about 4 minutes.  At its largest, this patch of brightness against the night sky would have about filled the dipper portion of the big dipper before fading to black.  The simplest way for me to describe it is it was as if someone had turned on the brightest spotlight I could imagine from the atmosphere, and as it ascended, I seemed to be viewing the light from underneath the source.  According the compass on my iPhone, the light was approximately at 180 -189 degrees south.  I thought to run inside and grab my camera, but figured I would miss it. I attempted a picture with my iPhone, but by this point, I could only make out a bright patch against the night sky and the iPhone could not record anything in the sky.  The light was completely faded at 7:55 PM. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD))",2009-12-12T00:00:00,41.54710000000001,-72.343

I ran inside to get my husband, but by the time we got back outside (less than 10 seconds), the circle of light had disappeared.  There was, however, a very faint bit of light remaining that looked like a cloud. The remaining light was initially the cone-shape that was there when the circle of light was still visible, but once the circle disappeared, the cone-shape also dissipated.  I told my husband that it must’ve just been a plane passing through a! cloud, but then I realized there were no clouds in the sky and no plane ever reappeared, as it would after it passed through the cloud.  My husband said, “there’s a cloud right there,” but what he thought was a cloud was actually the fading light that remained after the circle disappeared.

In the sky at that time were several identifiable objects, two airliners with visible contrails and an ultralight aircraft. What caught my attention however was a very bright almost teardrop shaped ""light"" that seemed to remain stationary below the cloud bank. At first i thought it was the setting sun reflection of a third airliner, however the other two did not display such a bright reflection, nor did their contrails. The ultra light craft was on the opposite side of the sky and much much lower in altitude. I did manage to capture the light on my digital camera, though the photograph is rather inconclusive. I also had the opportunity to view it through my binoculars. It appeared to be somewhat spherical with what looked like an upward ""trident"" glow or aura. I have sketches in my field notes. the entire ""sighting"" took roughly 3 or 4 minutes before the object disappeared behind the distant tree line.

Seeing that this was a bit strange, I went to get my binoculars after a few minutes of observing this strange light. After retrieving my binoculars, it came closer at a high rate of speed.  As it turned to go west I observed what was orange, now become 2 red objects and one yellow/amber object. The light from all 3 objects did not strobe and the lights appeared as orb/arrowhead shapes in single file one behind the other with two red and one the amber object trailing. As the craft came closer these craft were of triangle shape and all were of equal distance,  but then converged into a triangular formation. The amber was at it's highest point in the triangle formation, and as the objects traveled through the sky, the formation changed to a single file formation and then back to a triangle formation with the amber object now at the bottom of the formation. There was no sound from these craft and there were no aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.  The speed was enormous for the distance I observed. The objects were about 32-36 thousand feet (perhaps less), descending quickly and were about 3 to 4 miles away. I was able to observe the object for about 6-7 seconds going west. I have a nearly unobstructed 180 degree panoramic view from the back of my house  which points almost directly north.

I yelled for Kim to pull over . She couldn’t see anything but light and didn’t know what was going on. I grabbed my Nikon d70 digital camera(I went to college and took photography classes) and when she stopped I yelled for her to get out and look at this thing and I started taking pictures. I remember her crying and saying ,”lets go, please.” I could only think of getting a photograph of this thing. I think I was just in shock! It was moving with us, but when we stopped the van, it stopped and was just hovering above us. It made no noise at all. It was round and had about eight lights around it and every three seconds would flash on and then off. When the lights would go off, I remembered every thing was completely dark. I had to count, 123…to get a picture. I did get nine photographs, Which later I discovered matched exactely to one I spotted on the internet on you tube that someone had taken! I got in the car because my friend was crying. We pulled up to 1050 rd. and called 911. I spoke to an officer . He asked a lot of questions about what I saw and then said that he was going to get his camera and head out there himself. He said that he would come out the next day and see the photos that I got and he never called.

(Yes, there were fireworks going off and no, these were not fireworks!) As a bit of background, I've been a Police Officer for 17 years, all of these being on operational duties.  I served in the Royal Air Force for six years and I have a life long interest in aircraft, thanks to my father.  I would say that I am very knowledgeable about aircraft types.  I am always looking up at aircraft so I am used to seeing things in the air. Just before Midnight on 31st December 2008, my wife and I went into our loft room in order to watch the fireworks going off over Cardiff.  The velux windows in the loft face north and we had a view of 180 degrees from west to east.  The weather was dry with a slight haze.  Even with the haze, visibility was good. At about 00.05 hours, I saw an orange coloured ball of light over the west of Cardiff.  I would estimate that it was about 3 miles away from my position and at a height of about 5000ft.  There were no strobe lights on this object and it moved at a steady pace from south to north, in a straight, horizontal line.  It was in sight for about 10 seconds before disappearing, and it did just vanish from sight as there were no objects between it and me to obscure it from view.  When I first saw it, I pointed it out to my wife who watched it as well. Within about 5 seconds of the first object disappearing, I saw another one, this time directly in front of my position so it was over the north of Cardiff, at about the same height but I would estimate at a distance of 2 miles.  It was exactly the same colour as the first and moved from east to west, again in a straight, horizontal line, remaining at the same height.  It remained in view for about 10 seconds and then just disappeared, like the first one. Within 10 seconds, I saw yet another object, exactly the same as the first two and exactly the same colour.  This one was above my position and was moving from east to west.  It was bigger than the first two and I believe that it appeared so because it was at a lower height.  Again, it moved in a straight line and was visible for about 5 seconds before vanishing.  Also again, there was nothing that could have obscured my view of it such as a building it could have flown behind etc. At this point, my wife decided that she had seen enough and went downstairs and, unfortunately, I had to go with her.  The sight of the lights had spooked her. I have mentioned these lights to colleagues and one of them put forward the Chinese lantern theory but the lights just appeared, travelled in a straight, horizontal line and then disappeared.  They were in three completely different places and they did not have the flight characteristics of a floating lantern. These things weren't travelling at a high speed.  I would say the speed was about that of a helicopter.  In fact, when I saw the first light, I thought that it was the Police helicopter but the colour of the light and the widespread locations as well as the complete lack of any strobe or other flashing lights on the objects soon dispelled that idea. I have no explanation regarding the identity of these lights.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

Sometimes there are several of the star-like things in the sky, but only one of the large objects, and only one of the star-like objects is closer than all the others. The one that appears the closest is always in the same vicinity. After reading some of these posts, I realized I am not alone in what I see.  I am a little embarrassed to ask any of my co-workers, etc. if they see what I see. I live alone. I took two pictures with my camera phone but they just look like dots.

Object stood sitll in air. January 1st 2009  I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette before heading to bed. I remember checking my watch because I knew I had to be up early and head out of town the following morning and I recall it was approximately 11:15 p.m. or so. I was standing out on my front porch smoking a cigarette staring at the tree tops which I often do and noticed a light which was yellowish white in color off in the distance. It was behind one of the trees in my neighbor across the streets yard and at first glance I assumed it to be a star. I noticed slight movement which I assumed was from the tree swaying but the light seemed to be getting closer. With an airport within 15 minutes away, it was not uncommon to see planes flying over head so I thought nothing of it. As I continue to smoke my cigarette, the light was moving closer and was ascending. As the object got closer, something told me to take a picture. I pulled out my phone and attempted to with the phones camera, but because of the night the only thing that appeared in the picture was the light (I have the picture archived on my phone). By the time the light reached over were the tree was, it maneuvered in what I can best describe as a half circle or moon shaped movement to the left. Still ascending upward, I was able to see the undercarriage or belly of the object. There were lights in the shape of a triangle under the object that were in some sort of series of blinking. The lights were red and a very white crystal light. I am still assuming at this point that the object is a plane. Within what seem to be a minute or so, the object then made another maneuver in the same half round or moon motion coming back around to the right in the direction of the tree I had first initially seen and maneuvered past the tree over to my side of the street a few houses to the right. At this point the object had descended and I was able to see the top of the object. The object was round in shape and had a ring of lights on the outer edge. The object sat in the air still almost as if it was starring at me. I opened my front door and yelled to wake my daughter off the couch to get her mother. Not very comprehensive from being awoken, rubbing her eyes, I directed her to get her mother yelling its important hurry. She came back and said mommy was sleeping. I yelled for her to wake mommy up now! The object is still sitting there while this is transpiring. Finally I dart into the house to wake my wife and fly out the back door of our bedroom onto my deck in the hopes for her to come see what I have seen. Standing on my deck, I saw nothing. I then run through the house back out front in hopes it was just out of visibility from the deck, but it was gone. I checked my watch and it was 11:28 p.m. After it was all done I was a little shaken by what I had seen. I was telling my wife of the experience and in telling her about what I had seen, my memory recalled that I did not here any engine noise that you typically would from a plane, and of course it was not a helicopter. I have always been quite the skeptic when it comes to the sightings, but I know I saw something I had never seen before and was unable to identify exactly what it was.

While standing in the parking lot next to my car I looked up into the sky to see if there were any storms approaching because while I was in the store, I heard a lot of low flying airplanes. (typical being that O'Hare is close by, but still out of the ordinary on a clear night).  To my surprise I noticed a fire in the sky. I almost called 911 because it looked like one of the floors in the Zurich buildings were on-fire. From the distance it resembled a flickering orange fire (no other colors present). There were airplanes in the sky coming and going, and this orange flickering looked like sparks from a random flame burning in the wind. My Wife was standing right next to me also in amazement. She was rushing me to get in the car but I insisted on watching.  Then in an instant the 2 lights turned about face and flew upwards and diagonal and nearly disappeared. At 22:45 I got in the car, and drove west down Golf road towards home, watching the sky as I could (being that I was the driver). As we passed Woodfield Mall, I saw the red blinking light atop the Zürich Towers, and verified that the second tower wasn't taller. I googled the Zürich Towers height and discovered both towers are 270ft tall. This means that what ever those lights were, they were definitely not one of the floors on fire.  As I continued home and at approx. 22:50, I noticed a fast moving military jet (had a different shape than a helicopter, nearly silent, and a distinct trail behind it). This jet was flying faster than any commercial planes would appear at its height in the sky. It had a distinct shape that reminded me of a fighter plane, however it too was silent. The Jet was capable of making quick rounded  arc turns. It appeared as if the Jet was scanning the sky (in the way it was traveling). The Jet headed in a direction south of Golf Road and appeared to be in the vicinity of where the fire lights would have been. Unfortunately we turned off and continued home and lost sight of it.  I do know that Scott Air force base has a Peoria branch and it's about 50 miles south of Schaumburg. If a plane were to be dispatched, it would take approximately 5 minutes at 600mph to reach This area.  My Wife, had reminded me that there have been a lot of recent sightings in the area, so the first thing I thought to do was check the internet then report it here. This is the first time I have seen something like this in the sky. I'll admit I was a bit skeptic of UFOs because I have seen my share of military aircraft as a civilian. I attended a college in the early 90's that was located near Whitman Air-Force Base.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,42.0678,-88.0185

Today, a friend and I saw something that we could not explain, the circumstances surrounding it were rather interesting to. This is what I posted at Open Minds Forum, I was told I should probably report it here as well. So I am reposting it here, in hopes that maybe someone else in the area saw something similar? and maybe got a pic ? I was too late for a pic of the object, but I did get a good shot of the Military style helicopter.. someone said it looked like a next gen.Cobra? Not sure myself. I know, this doesnt mean that what we saw today was 'ET', it just means that we are quite sure it wasnt an airplane, and it was far to low to be a satellite.. ( maybe new sats fly that low, but im not aware of them). so it could have been ours (man-made), or who knows what.. but the fact the this ""military"" helicopter.. ( thats what im calling it, you can tell me what you think it is, i got a pic of the copter). .. but the fact that that came shortly after.. is interesting, though at the time, the two didnt even click.... we knew it wasnt the regular hospital choppers that fly over , but we were wondering why one of those would fly over. Not even thinking about the weird thing we saw a little while before it. We were outback of my house, jamming a little on the Djembe and guitar, we were jamming for awhile, and after a bit, i just instantly got bored and stopped. My friend kept playing.. I looked over to the south, at a cloud shaped i thought looked like the shape of the united states kind of... and i got the thought to mess with my friend, and act all excited and say ""look dude a UFO"", but i didnt get that out, instead i just looked straight up, maybe looking for more clouds or something,  and saw waht looked for a second like just a shiny metallic ball.. and looked for another sec to be sure, and said to him.. in these words... "" look dude, i was just going to mess with you about a ufo, and look..whats that?""  he said, ""I dont see it?"" so i was pointing it out to him..... him still trying to find it.. by now, it was an elongated shape , a second or two after it appeared ""ball"" like to me, it got a little closer and looked elongated, so this was what i was trying to point out to him. a second or 2 later he saw it, and my first words were.. "" plane?"" I really didnt think it looked like a plane, but.. you know.... lol  He said, ""man, i dont think thats a plane"", i said "" yeah it doesnt really look like it does it"".... so we kept looking, as it flew north east... no noise to it like the planes that fly over constantly... just moved... not too fast...... but by the time he mentioned to go get my camera.. I ran in the house, and ran back out thru the front door where it was headed... and looked, couldnt see it.. i looked out back to phil, and said, where is it? you see it? he said yeah i lookin at it, hurry up... so.. i raann back to where he was... and i couldnt see squat, he tried pointing it out, but it was to far by then. haha, what a clown i am running around with a camera.. LOL  anyway... it was silvery white, maybe about 10 times as high as when planes fly overhead when getting ready to land.... ( best i can describe height).. LOL, silly way to describe it i know.  the ""body"" looked slightly 'thicker' than a planes body.. it didnt have wings, (no wings ive ever seen,) it had what i want to say looked like... uhhmmm.... ?claws? .. not claws.... but, kind of like a surfboard fin, on each corner pointing inwards, 4 of them from what i could see. and down the middle of the ""body"" or tube or whatever one would call it, looked almost like a spiral... much thinner than the rest of the object.. not a defined spiral, but thats the best i can explain it. my buddy said after a few minutes ~ ""maybe a sattelite?"" , i really dont think that could have been a sattelite. lol  he later stated he didnt either. I still had my camera outside from when i tried to get a shot of the other thing, and got a couple blurry ones of the chopper, but one decent one to, it was quite high up. this helicopter does not look civilian to me.. its not a medical chopper... what is it?  I dunno, now that i sit a couple hours later, seeing that weird thing and then the helicopter a little while later was weird/interesting. cool though. hmmm.....

As we were eating I looked up to speak to my BF and a very bright light in the sky behind him caught my eye - it wasn't there a minute before. No other stars were out since the horizon was a pale yellow and the sky above shades of blue - it was just starting dusk - but not nearly dark yet and a very clear night. I pointed out the light and the two people saw it and agreed it was really bright  - and stationary in the sky. They were puzzled by it as was I. I said it's probably a planet but I'll watch it and see if it moves across the sky. I would estimate it was 20-30 degrees above the horizon. I observed it for about eight minutes without it moving in the slightest. I then went inside to grab something from the kitchen (maybe 15 seconds) and when I returned it was nowhere in sight... and it couldn't have possibly moved behind something since we were so high up and could see for miles around it - nothing would have obstructed the view. It just vanished. We didn't see it again. Other aircraft were visible and easily identifiable and nowhere near this light.

She followed  the bright light down the road and then said it followed her, she frantically called me at 10:30pm to tell me about this. I did not believe it, she was just crazy, it was probably an airplane. So when she got home, my brother, his girlfriend, my sister, and I went outside to see this “UFO”. We all quickly realized that my sister was right, so we decided to take my brothers girlfriend home to Coxsackie. As we drove along I took out my phone and started to record it, that is until it stopped appearing on my phone, but was still in the sky, visible to the eye. We took pictures with my sisters camera and we watched it as we went to Coxsackie. When we got to Coxsackie however, going through the pictures on the camera we realized it was no longer visible when it was clear that it was visible at the time the pictures were taken. After dropping my brothers girlfriend off, we pulled out of her drive way and I noticed a light going down and sideways to the right, after flipping out my sister said she saw it too, we sat there dazed. Suddenly we saw two more, less bright, “ball” looking like things come from this other thing. Which the light was extremely bright and white and it was going bigger and smaller, when it got small enough and not as bright you could see the shape, more like a cresant. I thought I had recorded this on my phone but it stopped recording before we saw four more of these “lights” getting dimmer and brighter. It had looked like in “War of the Worlds” (which was oddly enough filmed in Athens, NY) during the storm the “lights” were getting shot into the ground, that is what it resembled as these things were coming down. After realizeing there were more than one of them we headed home, my eleven year old sister extremely frantic, watched them the whole ride home. We passed the prison in Coxsackie where it was near/over then suddenly turned a corner and it was all the way on the other side of the road, ahead of us. As we neared Sleepy Hollow, which is in Athens, it started to fade, I snapped a few quick shots and it “disappeared”. Coxsackie/Athens is a very rural area, with a lot of farms and fields, woods, and water, which can be quiet creepy if you’re already freaked out. When we arrived home my sister went online and talked to her friend, who said she and another friend of hers were outside of her house, in Sleepy Hollow, when they heard a very strange sound coming along Farm to Market Road, the very same road my sister had been driving on when she started to follow the UFO. After that her friend got a bad feeling and ran home, my sister hadn’t even told her friend about the UFO we saw or where we had seen it, making it odd and collaberating with this story. Although we didn’t hear any sound, we also didn’t listen for one. The sighting is extremely disturbing and scary for anyone to encounter, but it seemed as though the UFO was watching and following us.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,42.2823,-73.8294

A friend and I were on our way to school when we approached a stoplight. I noticed two bright lights on what appeared to be a very large, low-flying plane that, based upon the light positions, seemed to be making such a turn that its wings were vertical. In specific terms, I would estimate that the object was no higher than two hundred yards above the ground. However, as we turned right from the stoplight, and I was able to get a better view of the object, I noticed that it had not been turning, and that the effect of vertical wings had actually derived from the positioning of two of the lights with one closer to me than the other. As I looked attempted to observe the object better, which was difficult considering how dark it was, I noticed a third light, completing a triangular shape. At this point I exclaimed to my friend, who was driving the car, about the object. He took a very quick glance, and assumed that it may have been a bomber plane. As unlikely as that would have been, what completely ruled out that possibility was that fact that the object had not moved throughout the two minutes that I had seen it at this point. So we continue to drive, while I am watching the object, waiting for it to move and at the very least do away with certainty that it was a non-human object (I knew as a fact it was not a helicopter). However, as we approached yet another stoplight between a mile-and-a-half and two miles from the first stoplight, my friend decided that he would have a look at the object himself. He took a quick glance back, and said something to me, at which moment I took my sight away from the object to respond to him. We had a very brief transaction of words, and upon looking back at where the object was we found it no longer visible. The area that the object was over was that of a neighborhood, which was bordered on one side by a construction zone. At first I thought that maybe the lights were from a crane or construction lights from the frame of a multiple-story building that was being worked upon during the early hours. However, returning home that evening I noticed that not only were there no cranes, but the building that was being built only had about five floors. Large cranes for such a small building would be unnecessary, and the building itself was not tall. At least, not tall enough to match the height of the object I saw in the sky.

On October 30, 2008 I was driving up into Palos Verdes, CA, on Palos Verdes Blvd. coming from Redondo Beach, CA at approximately 7:50 PM to pick up some food I ordered. When I got up into the beginning area of Palos Verdes just passing the shopping center on my left I saw a circular object, straight ahead and slightly to my right that had a tube ring of light that wrapped around its perimeter. The best way to describe this light was if you were to take a straight tube fluorescent bulb and bend it to wrap around into a circle. This was around the perimeter of the object and was glowing powerfully, with a slight blue hue to it. There was also a square shaped lighting tube that was off to one side of the object that was the same color and intersected with the round shaped tube of light but was much smaller in overall size in comparison. The second I had caught view of the object it had made a very quick, smooth flight pattern that I would say was a 60-70 degree angle straight upward in the sky but still in my view. The instant I saw this I couldn’t believe what I was seeing because it was so close. I could easily say it was less than 1000 yards away at its farthest point during my sighting. As I saw the object make that quick flight pattern, I was continuing to drive straight when I glanced to my right to see a couple that was off the side of the road, standing beside their car, already trying to take pictures of the craft. I thought, “my god they are seeing it too and who knows for how long before me.”  	 After stopping at a stop sign immediately after and continuing to drive forward I see the craft lowering itself from the point it had stopped from the previous flight pattern. I then pull over the side of the rode where there are houses lined on the street. My eyes are staying focused on the object the whole time. I’m staring at this craft object through my windshield off to my right which is slowly lowering itself while making a flight pattern quite strange. I get out of my car trying not to loose even a second of looking at the object. The craft is swaying back and forth from right to left, to left to right. Then it begins to simply lower straight down very slowly and smooth until it is out of vision, below the elevated plateau I’m standing on. The area it was flying over and eventually lowering itself was over the ocean as Palos Verdes is a town with several layers of elevated plateaus and oceanside cliffs. I then quickly get back in my car to turn around to see if the couple I saw was still there but they weren’t. I’m not sure if they would have seen the lower flight pattern it took  because from their position you can’t see over the ocean and there are trees that possibly blocked their vision from their angle of view. I then try to drive down to a lower area to see if the craft was still hanging around beyond where I could see. I got down very close to the ocean, cliffside, but I saw nothing. The object was gone. I was completely baffled and couldn’t believe what I had seen. The fact that it was so close and could see it so clearly felt unreal to me. I tried to rationalize during and after the sighting what it could have been. There was only one thing I could come up with other than it being some “other worldly” craft. I thought maybe some talented guys had built a circular, remote controlled craft and were flying it. I then thought that this was not likely true because the lighting of the craft was simply too magnificent and the craft likely too large. That powerfully glowing tube of light around the perimeter was a light like I’ve never seen before. The couple that was taking pictures must have been awed enough to stop and take pictures. Also, that beginning flight pattern of the craft shooting straight upward at a 60-70 degree angle was too fast. Conclusions I came to were as follows:  - This was a “flying craft” of some sort that was being “controlled” somehow. - The object was obviously circular shaped - I have NEVER seen anything like this - The size of the object was estimated to be about the size of a car or larger considering the relation to the landscape and how close I it was to me. - The craft made no sound that I could here. I will never forget what I saw. I would love more than anything to know exactly what it was. I feel strange that I saw this so close to me. It was not just some point of light in the distance. I don’t know what to do with my experience as it was so “baffling” and feel incredibly unsettled about it. The thing I’m most intrigued about was the lighting. I’m not a 100% believer in UFOs and this lighting was like nothing I’ve ever personally heard reported in peoples sightings.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,,

It was approximately 40 degrees above the horizon, and looked like a light shining down on the Earth -- that is, it was shaped like a cone, brightest at the top and fading out at the lower edge, which was about 5-10 degrees lower. Several things struck me about this event. First, it was very large, covering several degrees of the sky horizontally and vertically. Second, the apex of the cone was flattened, as you would see if someone were shining a flashlight down -- it wouldn't come to a perfect point, it would be flat at the rim of the flashlight. Third, it did not move at all -- at first it reminded me of a comet, but I knew that couldn't be, and then a meteor, but that would be true only if it were coming straight at me (which is possible). I turned to the screen door and called for my wife to come see. When I turned back, ther! e was only a luminescent cloud where the light had been shining. My wife, exiting another door, confirmed this. Could it have been a meteor coming head-on at us? That's the best explanation I can come up with.  There were commercial aircraft in the vicinity, what I believe was regular westbound traffic from Logan or Bradley airports. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.

We were looking at the big dipper and trying to make shapes out of random star formations.   Then my brother casually said “look there is a spaceship.”  We both thought that it was a spaceship because it was moving up and was much bigger than any plane or helicopter we had seen flying by.  It was circular in shape and what was really apparent was a large cone shaped light that it emitted downwards.  The light was huge, roughly about ¼ of the horizon and formed the shape of an upside down ice cream cone/pyramid.   At first I thought it was the light of a plane shining through the clouds, but after the object disappeared we both noticed that there were no clouds in the sky at all.  Right before it disappeared, the light flickered off and then came on again for a brief moment and then the object and light both instantaneously were gone.  It was extremely startling how it disappeared because it was definitely not far enough away to make such an abrupt exit, as opposed to a plane fading in the distance.

All estimates of altitude, speed, and size are educated estimates and are believed to be very accurate.  It was completely dark at the time with little to no cloud coverage. A very large triangle shaped object was sighted above Midland Michigan. The craft appeared over the roof of a two story hotel North West of my position at an altitude of roughly 500 feet.  It was traveling west-to-east about one mile north of my position.  The craft was completely silent and moved very slowly (no more than 20 knots) it suddenly accelerated (easily mach1, probably more like mach 10) and disappeared behind a line of trees to the east.   It accelerated so fast there didn’t seem to be any acceleration period; one moment is was moving very slowly, and then in no more than a quarter-second, it was traveling very fast.  Even as it began to move away very fast, there was no sound or fuel burn at all, no sonic boom, no vapor trail, no exhaust, not even the sound of the displaced air moving about. It is important to note that on its present course the craft would have violated the class D airspace around MBS Intl. Airport 15 miles to the east. The craft was a dull black, almost the color of the night sky, but a few shades lighter, more like the black stealth coating on an SR-71 or B-2 military aircraft.  It was easily twice as big as a Boeing 747.  (twice as long and twice as wide)  It did not have any discernable wing structure or control surfaces; it was just a big solid triangle.   I could not identify any windows or a flight deck, but the only portion of the craft that I could see was the belly (which looked flat), and a small bit of the right side of the upper half.  There was no side portion, the top and bottom of the craft simply met each other at an angle.  There were no navigation lights, landing lights, strobe lights, or rotating beacon light on the craft, instead there were three whiteish-blueish lights on the belly of the craft, one at each point on the triangle.  They weren’t bright or dim, more like a glow.  All of the lights were very large, each about the size of the groups of lights at baseball stadiums.  There were much smaller white lights somewhere near the middle of the craft, in a circular pattern documented in the illustration. The entire incident only lasted about ten seconds, but is was instantly obvious that this craft was not a civilian aircraft, and it was not a known military aircraft.  It was not using any type of propulsion used in human aircraft since it was completely silent and there were no discernable air-intakes or exhausts.  The extreme acceleration mentioned above would have generated such high g-forces that a human would not only be killed, it would probably be squished against the seat like a bug on a windshield.  Not only was the propulsion system very advanced, the pilots, or their equipment, were able to handle very extreme g-forces.

In July or August, 2008, I was in central Idaho for approximately three weeks.   On one particular night, as I watched for the International Space Station to go over, I noticed a flash of light near the cup on the Big Dipper.  This flash caught my attention even though it was not in the area I was looking directly at.  I turned my attention to that area of the sky, and approximately 10 seconds later I saw another flash.  I continued to watch and about 10 seconds later saw a flash about the same distance from the second flash as the two ""cup"" stars (away from the handle) are apart from each other.  The flash was the same as a strobe light on an aircraft, but about 5 times brighter.   Where a strobe on an aircraft flashes about every two to three seconds, these were a good 10 seconds apart, and were not in a straight line.   About 10 minutes later I was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia and noticed the same flash just under the constellation, with another flash about 10 seconds later about the same distance apart as the second and third one near the Big Dipper.  A bit later I was looking to the east, and noticed a flash only about 10 or 15 degrees above the horizon, which was a bit brighter than the others.  All these flashes were extremely short duration, as in an aircraft strobe light, but much farther apart and not in a straight line, and appeared to be at very high altitude, or in space.  As I watched the sky over the next two weeks I saw the same type of flash on every second or third night. I thought that it may be meteorites coming straight at me but thought about it and ruled that out as that would probably be a rarity indeed. On one night I did see what appeared to be a satellite, moving in a straight line getting gradually brighter, and then fading out, southbound over Washington and Oregon states.  On one particular night I saw what appeared identical to the Space Station (very bright), but it was moving southbound over Montana and was visible 30 minutes before the Space Station was to appear from the west.  I waited the 30 minutes and saw the Space Station when it was predicted to come over from west to east. On this past Monday night (6/8/09) I went out to the back yard in Spirit Lake, Idaho (just north of Coeurd’Alene) about 10:30 PM and was looking at the sky.  I thought I saw a flash just under the Big Dipper, but wasn’t sure because I wasn’t looking exactly at that part of the sky again, so I turned my attention to that section of the sky and sure enough about ten seconds later saw the same bright flash as I had seen almost a year ago.  I saw three flashes that formed a triangle near the cup of the Dipper.  These flashes were not spread over an area, as if being generated by a large light source, say for example the Aurora Borealis, but were from a PINPOINT in the sky.  It would be as if a person was in the sky with an extremely bright flashlight and pointed it at me and turned it on and then off within a tenth of a second, or less. These lights did not form any logical trajectory but seemed to be random.  I have a feeling that if I were to go out again over the next ten or 12 nights I would see them again every second or third night, or possibly every night if I continued to look for two or three hours.  I have seen satellites go over so I know what they look like.  Obviously I know what aircraft look like at night.  Maybe there is a military operation going on and they set their strobe for every ten seconds, or so, to keep track of each other, which would explain the non-straight line flashes.  But with the use of radar I would think this would not be necessary, unless it is some type of stealth aircraft.   I am 51 years old and being a pilot I like to look to the sky (I am interested in Astronomy also) and have never seen this type of thing until the summer of 2008, which makes a person wonder why these sightings started to manifest themselves to me, as if there is something going on that had not occurred in my past years.  There are more satellites and space junk up there than ever before, but that doesn’t seem to answer the question as to why the flashes would be relatively close to one another in both position and time.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,,

I and a friend were positioned facing north looking out over the lake. light rain, cool temperature for early part of August.  With the naked eye, I confirmed with my friend that there were lights out on the lake (28 miles across) as seen first with the naked eye.  Then I asked my friend if he had a pair of binoculars.  Through the binoculars it was determined at first that a small boat appeared on fire.  This first bright light was furthest East in its proximity.  Then, on closer inspection I noticed and confirmed with my friend that what we were witnessing was NOT a little boat on fire, but fire balls descending extremely slow from the underside of this low slung storm cloud.  No identifiable sounds were heard in the vacinity. No helicopters, scrambled jets nor weather planes.  The story here is eiree as the fireballs continued to fall from the sky and as the first one went down behind the horizon, another one immediately appeared and began to fall.  This happened for a period of an hour to 90 minutes.  I was a little concerned, not knowing what was happening and decided to leave the neighborhood where this sighting was occurring-- a quiet neighborhood that lines the shore of Lake Erie.   After witnessing at least thirteen of these fireballs, I left the area (my friend lives in the house overlooking the lake and was concerned as well, but not as much as I was.)

I did not want to bring attention to the quiet little neighborhood, plus it was raining and the folks all seemed to be sleeping and not witnessing this.   Too bad, this is definitely one for the books.  I wished that I had had a powerful video camera to capture this phenomenon.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,42.09974517647059,-80.07763388235293

So I set out around 8 at night and it wasn’t dark yet.  I drove south on route 481 from fulton toward clay.  It was a beautiful clear night with only a few very well defined clouds in the air. As I get near the Phoenix exit there’s a bridge over the highway and I notice two bright headlights on the bridge but not moving. I look up and I see that it’s not a car and the lights are above the bridge in the air, way far off a few miles. But they are bigger and more intense than the headlights on cars coming in the opposite lane. And the lights aren’t moving so I thought it was some sort of tower I wasn’t close enough to see yet. The lights were white but tinged with that warm yellow light, not like the bluish headlights some cars have now. So I keep driving. I do not even think ufo-stuff because I just didn’t think about that kind of stuff (back then!!!). My eyes go back to it a few times and in the back of my mind I feel a nagging feeling because I grew up here and have lived here forever and I didn’t remember a tower there before or seeing lights like that. It’s still not dark out but it’s close to that time where it starts to get dark fast. As I get closer the lights don’t move at all. They’re very low in the sky so the trees along the highway block it momentarily here and there. After a couple minutes of driving I start being more distracted by it, because I’m not seeing any tower, and there’s absolutely no movement. I started to think it was a plane flying low, and that it was flying directly in my direction so it looked motionless, which I thought was cool. But as the highway slowly wound and turned, they were staying in the same spot. I finally have driven a few miles and felt as though I was getting close enough to see the tower or plane or whatever it was. I was a little bothered because I realized I was getting extremely close to it, and I could see a cell phone tower or something on the other side of it, and it was a lot smaller. At this point it was dark, but not full night. I wasn’t noticing any other air traffic at the time, but maybe I just wasn’t looking for it in all honesty. I finally came to a break in the woods (it’s farmy-kind of land) and looked behind me because there was light traffic in the oncoming lane, but none behind me, so I could slow down to about 40 from 65. At that point I passed the clearing on the left and saw that it was a plane that was so low and huge it looked like it was coming in for a landing, but it was hanging completely motionless in the sky, and the lights were very, very bright. As I passed, IT STARTED MOVING AND CAME OVER THE HIGHWAY AND DIRECTLY OVER MY CAR. I checked behind me and slowed to a crawl, stood up and put my face up against the windshield half-standing over my steering wheel. I had stopped breathing and was completely fascinated, and then scared. It took about six seconds to cross the highway over me and it’s only two lanes north and two lanes south. Someone could have jogged it about the same speed. The sky and cloud above it were a medium gray purple, and I got a pretty good look at whatever this was. I thought it was a plane coming in for a landing because it was huge, but made no sound (I did have my windows up, but it was directly over my car). There were actually three huge lights, one in each corner, and this thing had no wings, it was shaped like a perfect equilateral triangle, black. (or I’m assuming it was black). In the center of this thing were some smaller red and bluish lights and all these weird panels and things. It was so foreign as to what I was expecting my eyes were having a hard time grasping that middle part. Nothing was blinking, no lights you see usually on helicopters and planes. When it crossed the road and got over the field, it banked to the left (south again) and CRUISED south. I sped up, and it was less than a mile to my exit and I was staying steady with it, I could kind of see it here and there through the trees. I got to the exit, there was a red light so I did down my window and leaned out and up over my roof of the car, then climbed back in because there were cars and I felt crazy. I watched to the right. Over route 31 there are a million chain restaurants and walmarts and things like that. This thing crossed the highway and kept going south toward Syracuse. I turned right toward wegmans and tried to keep up and see it. When I got to another intersection red light I looked left and saw it further away, and it had stopped and was motionless in the sky again. The light turned green and I didn’t know what to do, so I just went and got my wife’s bread while in a stupor. On my way home, I didn’t see anything in the sky except three planes or helicopters way up in the sky in the same area flying around and around. I thought that was weird too. In all my life before or after I have never seen anything even closely resembling whatever this was. I was really thrown for a loop when I went home and searched “triangle ufo” and a million hits came up. I didn’t see anything online as clearly as the thing I saw, but the three lights –one at each corner, was right. I wanted to call the police or an airport just so they could tell me what it was but I never did because I felt ridiculous-I didn't see anything in newspapers or anything so I kind of shut up about it. Hope I find out what it was someday. I am very very nervous, however, about having my name released-Fulton is a small town.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,43.1843,-76.2001

As I looked up, I saw a rectangular shape with a row of different colored lights on the bottom. It was headed in a northern direction. I went back inside to get my boyfriend to see what it was. It was no longer than 30 seconds. As I looked back up, it was headed in an eastern direction. I looked at him and said, ""How is that possible?""  It was headed towards the north just 30 seconds ago. We continued to watch it. It had absolutely no sound. It was really high in the sky, and it was moving really slowly. To this day, I can not figure out what it was. I do not think it was man made.

I was listening to the radio when my phone rang, as I picked up the phone I happened to look to the west side of the interstate and when I did I was shocked and awed. There was a formation over the distant mountain. A triangle shaped formation was flying towards me. It immediately caught my attention because of the sensitivity of the cargo that I had on-board. There was a triangle formation with another light perpendicular to the lead light. The size of the formation was enormous. I also noticed before I decided to report this, that others in the area reported the same sighting.

A friend and I went on a drive after a bad night at work, and towards the end of our drive we were on east hwy BB, about a mile away from the intersection with hwy 13.  This is a road I take very often, countless times at night and during the day.  Out of nowhere we noticed lights above and in front of our car, I am unsure as to the width or elevation, that appeared to be two sets of lights set very far apart.   At first I thought it to be some sort of tower I had somehow never noticed before, but there no other lights present.  I turned to my friend and asked her if she saw it too, and she seemed to be just as puzzled as me.  By this point, since we were alone on a country road, I began to slow my car down considerably... since I couldn't take my eyes off it.  At first we asked, is it two planes next to each other in the distance? If so, then the two planes were flying completely parallel to each other, as well as taking turns to blink. The pattern of the blinking was fantastic. There were two sets of bright blue-white lights that would alternate in a sort of pattern. The left would blink several times rapidly, then the right would do the same. There were no tail lights or anything besides these two sets. I thought perhaps, since I am a UFO believer but still skeptical of my sightings, that it was just a plane flying low. We do have an airport in Warrensburg, and we often see stealth fighters from the base nearby. Our music was playing loudly still (we were too stunned to do anything but stare) and so I turned it off completely to listen for an engine. All we could hear were crickets, not even a hum. The strangest things about the behavior of this craft, or set of lights, was that it stayed in the same position, but seemed to be gliding slowly above hwy 13. If a plane were flying that low, the distance between the lights would have changed as it flew away or towards us. It did NOT change. If it were a helicopter, we would have most certainly heard something. Stranger still, as we watched the lights blink in succession, it seemed to suddenly rotate for a split second and blinked vertically over the road. As if, if it were a plane, the plane had turned completely sideways and the wingspan became vertical. And after the quick blinking it was back to normal. It seriously happened so rapidly that I wouldn't have seen it if I had blinked at the same time. After about a minute of driving toward the UFO, we came around a bend of trees to our left. The angle of the craft was so low, but still so large, that we lost it behind the trees. I kept my eyes on it through the treeline, saw a couple of blinks, and then it disappeared. We looked for towers, planes in the distance that were blinking similarly, anything. We could not find anything after driving around the bend of trees, nothing even to use as an excuse to ease how disturbed we were.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,38.7862,-93.7239

I was standing on my front porch, I had just lit a cigar and neighborhood kids were trick or treating.  As I turned around toward the street my eye caught a red light in the Sky at about 2 o'clock high.  This red light was approaching slowly toward me.  At first I thought it was a plane however it was moving too slow to be a plane. I stepped off the porch to observe the light as it was passing over my house.  It passed straight over my house at a height of I would guess to be several thousand feet.  Looking at the object straight above it had no flashing marker lights as a plane would have.  The object appeared to be round and it glowed orange/red.  As it passed over the brightness of the object suddenly changed to a faint red dot.  I could track this dot as it proceeded North East.  I lost it as it passed behind the neighbor’s house. The object made no noise. I called my Father at 6:58pm after the object left my field of view.  He lives about 20 minutes in that direction and I asked if he would go out and look west.  Hoping he would see this object as it approached.  My Father noticed a white light moving slowly but didn’t think anything more of it. While on the phone with my Father I looked up and another Orb was moving on the same trajectory.  I disconnected the call and managed to take one photo with my camera phone. The orb faded out as the first one did and I could track a smaller faint dot as it moved North East.   Second Sighting was at 7:00 pm, shortly after two older teens were walking in front of the house.

I looked up in the sky, as I always do; I am an amateur astronomer.  I was looking towards SWS at Jupiter.  That's when I noticed a green solid light, about the size and brightness of Jupiter.  I noticed it was moving towards ENE. I watched it for about a minute, then ran in the house to tell my wife.  Unfortunately, she was in the shower and could not come out and see it.  I then ran into the backyard and I could still see it, moving in the same direction.  I watched it moving ENE until I could not see it anymore. I then looked around, not expecting to see anything else, when I saw two more green lights, fairly close to each other, moving in the same direction.  I couldn't believe it. I watched them move in the same direction, until I could not see them anymore. I was trying to come up with a reasonable explaination for myself.  There were no other lights, like a red one, or a strobe, like on a small airplane, which fly aroung the area frequently.  Since it was Halloween, I had a strong feeling that maybe a kid tied one of those green glowing light sticks to a helium ballon, and it was just floating in the wind, since there was absolutely no sound coming from the objects. I later checked the NOAA website (weather.gov) to check the wind direction that night.  They reported at about 7pm and 8pm.  At 7pm they reported calm wind, no direction.  At 8pm they reported a south wind at about 7 mph.  I do not know what I saw, but they were not going in the direction of the wind.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,35.220108796296294,-113.90181018518517

I walked south down out of the Cul-De-Sac on which I live, and down the street. I was about halfway down the road when I decided to stop under a streetlamp, and do what I always do on cloudless nights.  Scan the Skies.  I called my dad to ask him something as I began to look around. I began to scan intently and saw a few planes in the distance, but when I looked in the western sky, I noticed an Orange Sphere/or Orb.  It was oscillating/pulsing as it drifted off to the north.  I told my dad I saw something weird in the sky and he must have though I was crazy. I began to feel very startled and almost freaked out by the experience, yet at the same time exhilarated. The object was following a direct flightpath of most planes in our area, but I assure you this was no jetliner.  I have seen many planes, jets, and helicopters; military and civilian in this area but it just didn't meet the description of any earthly craft I have seen.  Panic set in as I realized this definitely wasn't something I could not readily identify.  I began to review stories in my head of people being taken while on a stroll in their neighborhoods after dark.  That was when I decided I wasn't just going to just stand there and watch it.  I was still on the phone with my dad at this time I so I told him that I would be home in a few minutes, and hung up. I then seeming ran for dear life as fast as I could back to my house and watched from the porch.  The craft flew almost directly overhead and just then the Orange Light turned off and gave way to what looked like airplane lights but there was no green or red lights on the wingtips just bright yellowish-white ones, and there were no flashing lights at all. I went inside the house; my heart pounding.  I sat down and reviewed what I saw.  It was then that I noticed the craft also made no noise whatsoever.   After calming down I turned on the TV and began watching Ghost Hunters Live, and all the while I couldn't get the thoughts out of my head of what in the hell had I seen.   After a couple hours I began to get tired so I walked up to to my room, and jumped in bed.  Surprisingly I slept very soundly. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??

I was driving home from my girlfriends and it was late.  There were no other cars on the road.  I saw a light that was steady and not blinking.   It was just a plain white light. It looked like a bright star.  It was moving low to the ground and moving slowly.   At first I thought it was a helicopter and just kept watching it because it stuck out in the air over the open fields.  Then it started moving very fast in one direction and then back in the same direction it just came from.  When I say fast I mean very fast.  It did not accellerate it was instantly moving fast. It did this for about half a minute going back and forth in the sky.  Then it stopped moving for a few seconds all together and was stationary in the sky.  Then it started to move slowly around again like when I first spotted the light.  I then proceeded to pull over and tried to get a video of it on my phone.  When I was trying to get any kind of picture resolution on my phone it just shot into space so fast and was gone.   To someone reading this it might seem like a helicopter is actually what I saw looking for something or someone.   But there is no way a helicopter could move the way this light was moving.  I would not pull over to look at a helicopter.   I instantly called my girlfriend and told her what I had just seen and she said I was crazy.  I know that what I saw was a ufo there is nothing manmade that could do what I saw this thing do.  I never believed in ufos until that night and now im a believer.

We were planning on having a small to roast marshmallows.  I was looking up at the hill while they were collecting wood and they were about 50 yards away loading wood into our ‘Ranger’ or off roading vehicle and they left it running so they could not hear me.  As I was looking up at the night sky I noticed a strange coned shaped yellow light coming from a cloud.  I yelled up to the girls asking them to look and what did they think it was, but they could not hear me.  I then looked around and didn’t notice any other clouds in the sky.  The reason we were having the fire was to sit out and enjoy the night sky because it was so clear.  The light came down from the sky the way a bulb would emit light into a cone shape with it smaller at the top and larger at the bottom.  It was nothing that covered the whole sky but it was! definitely not light from a plane or helicopter. Neither was it the sun because the light was in the east and there was no moon at that time during the evening.   It stood still with no noise and the top of the cone was covered with the small cloud.  The light was there for around 45 seconds and within a couple of seconds it disappeared from the bottom up, almost as if it fizzled away. The cloud also disappeared immediately after.

It looked as though a spot light was shining down on us. My first thought was that it was just that, a spot light or something of the like. But then, it started to dissipate. Like it started to disappear, the light was going back to the sky. Not like it was coming from the earth but above it. We were like is that seriously happening? It just disappeared.

Oval shaped orange glows / craft travelling in sky in slow straight lines WEIRD BRIGHT ORANGE GLOWING OVAL SHAPES JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT ON NEW YEARS EVE, 31.12.08. And no!! I had not been drinking alcohol to see in the New Year!!!!!  Just pulling the bedroom curtains to go to bed, looked outside (facing towards South) looking and listening for celebration fireworks for the occasion. Saw to my left (South by South East) 4 very bright orange glows, in a straight line, not line abreast, moving slowly across the sky, but not very high up, about a few hundred feet up, possibly a few miles from my location, as if from the general direction of Portsmouth or the Isle of Wight travelling towards Southampton and the Docks area. The glows were not travelling at high speed but fairly slowly in a straight line, spaced wide apart, so were not fireworks or flares as far as I was concerned. I had never ever seen anything like this on this planet. They had no flashing coloured lights like you would see on aircraft / helicopters. I couldn't believe my eyes, as I could not work out what this was. I did not understand it. I ran outside to get a further look, but when I got to the front of the house, they had gone, .BUT then I saw several more spaced apart to the east coming over the trees at the back of my house, again in slow straight lines generally towards Southampton city area and again, a few hundred feet up in the sky. I could not make out any solid shapes, like metalwork, they were just very bright orange glows. I ran in to get my girlfriend outside to look with me, but when I returned outside, again they had disappeared, BUT then I saw a few more much further away over Southampton, again travelling slowly across the sky in straight lines, not in curved arcs, until they too suddenly disappeared. The sky was clear with a few clouds. The glows travelled quite a distance, maybe a couple of miles before disappearing. If they were fireworks / flares then they were of a type I have never seen and how did they travel such distances in straight lines across the sky instead of up and down. The glows were very large, perhaps the size of a craft but very difficult to work out in terms of distance away and true size. I got annoyed with my girlfriend as she refused to come and look. That experience stuck with me for weeks, as it was so ,;extra terrestrial&#8217; as far as I am concerned from my experiences on this planet so far. There was no noise with them either like you would hear from aircraft / helicopters. SO THAT WAS THE END OF THAT&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;UNTIL&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; At about 22.30 hrs on Monday, 15.6.09. I was driving an ambulance from Southampton to Totton area, along the road towards the Rushington roundabout, having just finished my last job. I saw ahead of me a few hundred feet up, what I initially thought was an odd looking lamppost light, which didn't match the others along the road. They were bright white, but this was bright orange. I then realised that this glow was higher up and further away in the background, as if over Cadnam area. I strained to work it out as I continued driving, then realised that it was moving in my general direction across the sky, slowly in a straight line. I quickly wound the window down to see if there was any aircraft noise but it was moving silently AND it was the same type of shape and glow as what I experienced on 1.1.09. as described above. It was SO WEIRD that I suddenly pulled up on the side of the road. As I did this it slowly passed directly overhead at a height of about a few hundred feet only!!!!!!! I strained to look out through my windscreen at the top as it passed over, but as it did, I DEFINITELY SAW A VERY BROAD AND FLAT SILVER GREY METAL SHAPE OF SOME SORT OF AIRCRAFT WITHIN THE VERY BRIGHT ORANGE GLOW. THIS WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE OR A HELICOPTER AND IT HAD NO FLASHING LIGHTS AND NO ACCOMPANYING NOISE. I jumped out of the ambulance to see if it was still above me but it had passed by and I saw it continue moving slowly in a straight line away from me towards Southampton. Again, I could not believe my eyes. The colour and shape of the glow was the same as at New Year. I could not work out what I was seeing, but it was MOST MOST MOST DEFINITELY A FLYING CRAFT OF SOME SORT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I jumped back into the ambulance and continued to drive now along the A326 towards Fawley. I looked out and saw the orange glow now a much further distance away and higher up in the sky but it was now moving in a slow straight line as if towards Romsey from Southampton. Then it disappeared. A couple of minutes after this, I saw it again, but this time it was high up again, but moving from the general area of Southampton Docks, south and east as if towards Portsmouth or the Isle of White along the line of Southampton Water. I never saw it again that night. I cannot say whether it was the same craft on the three occasions seen this evening, or whether it was three craft in different locations over the area. This occurrence has stuck with me ever since, BUT THE FANTASTIC THING IS&#8230;.on the radio the next day (WAVE 105 F.M.) I heard reports that other people had seen these orange glows in the Solent sky that same night before, SO I WAS NOT GOING MAD as there were other witnesses to it!!!! However, the report stated that this was being written off as a meteor shower!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I thought meteors were small white momentary streaks in the sky, like shooting stars up in space!!?? WHAT I SAW WAS ABSOLUTELY NOT A METEOR SHOWER, BUT A REAL LIFE EVENT INVOLVING A MOVING CRAFT OF SOME SORT!!!!!! DID ANYONE ELSE SEE WHAT I SAW???????????????????????????? I know what I saw and witnessed and I believe in U.F.O.s. The human race in my opinion would be very naïve indeed, if we think that we are the only living life forms in the Milky Way, Galaxy, Solar System, Universe etc etc. If such craft as reported as being seen moving at incredible speeds across the sky exist, then that suggests to me that they are also capable of travelling FAR FAR greater distances in speed and space than we have so far achieved from this planet. So I reckon that far superior life forms on other planets we have not yet reached in travel, can reach us already!!!! Reporter is a retired police officer and current ambulance driver.

I was talking to my mom and my daughter asked me ""Mom, what's that?""   I looked over at her and she was pointing up to the evening sky.  It was still daylight, there were no clouds and the sun was just beginning to head behind the trees in the western sky.  I gasped as I did not know what the objects were and asked mom to have a look.  She, like us, was dumbfounded.   We all stood transfixed as we watched the objects move silently across the sky.  I decided to go get a pair of binoculars, but by the time I came back whatever we had seen was out of sight.   There were 7 objects in all, six single round objects forming a triangular shape, but the objects were not connected, at least by anything that could be seen.  The seventh round object hung below the other six and to the left, however,  all 7 objects seemed to move in unison.   All objects also appeared to be solid and of a metal origin because the sun was reflecting off of them.  I also got the impression the objects were rotating, but of this I cannot be certain.

About a mile north before the city of Bountiful, Utah traveling south on I-15, I saw above me through the front windshield a bright white/yellow falling star traveling north to south my same direction. The “star” traveled quickly across the sky then “stopped in mid-air” over what appeared to be the ensign peak area between Bountiful and SLC.  This startled me and I said, “What the heck is that?”. No falling star here as the light then moved back north east over North Salt Lake and made a slow wide circling pattern as if it were going to land. At this point my wife said, “Maybe it’s a helicopter going to land”.  The light then traveled west quickly across the interstate and suddenly maneuvered straight up for about 300-500 feet over I-215 just south of the Legacy interchange. After that it traveled south towards the 7th north exit in west SLC desending at a high rate and disappeared from our site.  I am a private pilot and aware of natural speeds and maneuvers a “normal” plane or helicopter would make, but this to me seemed to fast and erratic in behavior. My wife thought she could see blinking lights around the main light. I could not see position lights only the white/yellow light it emitted from all angles. Besides, this is controlled airspace, would Salt Lake Center allow this kind of evasive maneuvering?

(Probably should not mention that sighting in this report)  7) Uncertain of altitude.  But being physicist/engineer and one time pilot I can safely state that the altitude was greater than 3,000ft AGL but less than 10,000ft AGL.

Looking up and to our west, we saw this object that I would estimate west-northwest, possibly 50 plus miles away and possibly near the altitude of 10,000 feet. At 7:00 P.M., the sky was clear and it was getting near sunset so we were guessing the object could be deflecting sunlight but this object was exceptionally illuminated and large for any aircraft.   We went to a nearby Wal-Mart, shopped and came outside and the object was still there and a bit closer.   We went home and the object was still there but more to our immediate west.  As my wife went to get our binoculars, I talked to a neighbor to justify what we were seeing and we all agreed we were seeing something unusual.  At 8:00-8:15, I saw through my binocular what seemed to be a balloon shape object sourcing this amazing golden-white light.  Upon further looks, this object appeared to be diamond shaped with an exception of being elongated and flat on the bottom.  Taking an eye off of it for a few short moments, maybe a minute, it disappeared. There was nothing on the news about it, but I’m sure others had to see this fairly well populated town. I felt compelled to write about this was extraordinary sighting.  We’re retired Air Force, lived here for over 10 years, and are familiar with night and daytime air traffic in the area.  I do not know of an aircraft that could remain in a nearly static position for more than an one hour with the exception of slightly moving south,  be nearly diamond shaped, generating the intensity of this blinding light and then disappear immediately.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,,

The problem with these excuses is that it was not moving so it was no plane, there was nothing to hold the light that high above the prison, and of my knowledge we don’t even use weather balloons any more.  At that same moment I noticed that the light was getting smaller turning a red orange color, ten minutes of this and the light that was so big about thirty minutes earlier was just the size of a small star.

The Big Dipper is easily seen from my front yard, as is the North Star. I witnessed said object from about 10deg south of vertical until it disappeared behind some trees at about 35 deg north. The object gave off light (white in color) and it did not waiver other than to dim somewhat as it went further north. As the object crossed straight overhead I saw what looked like an aircraft strobe suddenly appear right next to it (within 1deg of arc). Aside from the strobe I could not see a craft. The strobe was regular (I saw at least 5 strobes) which allowed me to connect the dots so to speak enough so that I would gauge the craft separated from the other craft on a vector of approx. 5deg. A strobe might be used to help locate an aircraft flying at night and at high altitude for collision avoidance. I find it interesting that a satellite would be tracking due north. What makes more sense to me is that I witnessed a spy craft.

As it went over my house we both thought it very unusual.It came out of the sky from the southwest and was traveling to the northeast.  We watched as it went out of sight.  Then she through her hands up and pointed to another one.  The first five came in a steady stream.  All at the same; altittude, direction and speed.  At this time I went into the house and got my room-mate whom has been flying since he was fifteen and was a commercial pilot for over fifteen years.  Then another light appeared and soon after another.  Then a moment later a third.  The first two took a path a little off from the first five and the third cut to the north.  My room-mate commented they were a diamond shape.  Then with a pause the final glow went through on the same path as the first five.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,40.1037323943662,-85.67924319248827

N.E Ohio, Canton. My wife and I stopped over to my mother-in-laws to pick the kids up after dinner. Mother-in law was outside on the back patio with a couple of her girl friends deciding on where they were going out to eat. This was around 19:50. Being a very clear night sky. Facing south, I looked up and noticed a very bright star a little Southeast from where I was facing.  This was just a normal star. I got involved in some conversation and then again at about 20:00 I looked back at the same star just noticing how bright it was on the clear night. I then glanced over to the East. I then saw another bright light that was very high, and illuminating light downward.  (like the sun does when it shines through clouds). First, I thought it was another star, but as I watched it , it was weird since it was shining a very noticeable light down like the sun shining light through the clouds.  I just starred at it wondering what it was since the light shining down illuminated like the sun shining through clouds. Not knowing what it was. I grabbed the attention of my wife, mother-in-law and her friends, and my oldest son. I asked them what it was. There was no reply as everyone just starred at it. I would say about 30 sec. after I grabbed everyone’s attention, the light giving off the illuminating light started to rise, slow at first straight up. Then within a sec. the light and the light shining downward were gone!! You could actually see the ball of light and the illuminating light rise up.!!! THEN....There was no light anywhere!! It was gone within a sec. of moving up. We couldn’t even trace it. It was gone!  I then looked over at the star I was looking at earlier just trying to make sense of what I just witnessed. the original star was still there and didn't move.  We tried to reason with what we just saw. My Mother-in-law and wife who couldn't believe what we just saw, took the skeptic approach. Trying to reason by saying it could have been a jet since the Akron/Canton Airport is 10 miles from the house. However, We were able to compare a jet flying in the distance about 8 – 10 min. later. We all came to the same conclusion. What we saw was not a jet. The jet did not give off nearly as much light as the light we saw in the sky (actually, there is no comparison).  Plus the jet moved. The light we saw sat still for about 30sec. while we all were watching it, The jet was considerably smaller, and had flashing lights. The light we saw in the sky did not flash any lights. We had no answers to what we just witnessed. I would say the light location could have been I the area of Canto! n/Louisville/East Canton, Ohio. We still can't get over how the light was shining down, then just raised and disappeared with in a sec. The jet we saw later, we were able watch it’s path as it flew in the sky at night which appeared to be around the same distance and elevation., But the Light we all watched  just disappeared. I didn’t know who to contact in the area to report it. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD))",2009-12-12T00:00:00,40.843307189542486,-81.40800021786492

My husband, sons and I were returning home in our car, when I spotted something in the sky. At first glance, I thought it was a helicopter with a spotlight hovering over a house a few houses down from ours. The light made a cone shape with the widest part closer to the earth and the apex was very bright. We pulled into our driveway and got out of the car, and there was no sound coming from it, eliminating the possibility of a helicopter. Then, it appeared as if the “spotlight” retreated into a small cloud or a sort of a mist and faded out. The “mist” quickly dissipated. There is a cloudless sky here tonight, and so whatever the mist was came from the object that we couldn’t see. It was just a light and then it was gone. There was no smell. We have eliminated the possibility of a flare, firework, or aircraft. No lightening. I! t is a clear, starry, cool, late summer, early fall evening. I am at a loss.

I can't tell how big they were, but they seemed pretty big from the distance, i would guess at least 15 feet in diameter. They were solid orange, not flickering, not blinking, not changing colors. Just bright solid orange. It seemed like they were hovering about 50-200 feet above the ground. While they were hovering there, i heard no sounds or noises at all. You could see the lights were bright enough to illuminate a pretty big area in the valley. My location was at http://maps.google.de/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=de&geocode=&q=34.565853,-115.489876&sll=34.562697,-115.490298&sspn=0.026082,0.055747&ie=UTF8&ll=34.501464,-115.557289&spn=0.208807,0.445976&t=h&z=12 and the lights could be seen at a west/southwest direction from there, at what i guess was about 5-7 miles away. The whole area is pretty much abandoned. Amboy is nearly a ghost town, there is virtually no traffic there (in over 1 hour, i didn't see any oncoming or passing cars). There are train tracks running not to far from Route 66 though and there seems to be a pipeline, since there was a pump station that i passed earlier. As soon as i drove over the hill and saw those lights, i pulled over, turned off my engine and my lights, grabbed the camera (which was readily mounted on a tripod, since i was doing night photography about 15 minutes earlier and placed the camera and tripod on the rear seats) and started taking a picture. I did a 1 or 2 minute exposure or so, and in that time i realized that those lights are slightly moving individually. The right light was not moving at all, the top light was slightly moving to the left, the left light was moving to the bottom right and the bottom light was moving up. Shortly after taking the picture, the bottom and the left/right lights were forming one line, with the top light above them. That all happened within a few minutes though. I wanted to take another picture of those lights, when the left light started moving sideways and dissapeared (kind of just turned off) with multiple loud ""explosion/thunder"" noise. The other 3 lights simply faded out a few seconds after that. I heard no unusual noises while those lights lasted, but i did hear some very deep short thunder/explosion noises. Not like rolling thunder, but like short ""boom"" noises a few minutes after i saw those lights. I waited for about 10 more minutes to see if they would come back, but they did not appear again. Since it was a relatively clear full moon night, i could clearly see into the valley, but didn't see any houses, cars, trucks, aircrafts or other vehicles at all. Since the location is pretty much in the middle of nowhere, i am not aware of any other people that might have seen those lights. I continued driving westbound on Route 66 and about 4 or 5 minutes later i realized there is another, smaller, orange light a few miles behind us directly on Route 66. I stopped to see if that might be another car, but it didn't seem to be one. That was another orange light, but way smaller than the other one. I couldn't tell if that light was on the ground or only a few feet above the road. It didn't come any closer and didn't seem to move, and also, after another minute or so, it dissapeared. I am not sure if that was in any way related to the previous sighting or if that was just another car or light from one of the pump stations/train signals or so. The picture i took is available at http://michaelkesler.net/blog/uploads/UFO4.JPG and a cropped version of the ""UFOs"" themselves is available at http://michaelkesler.net/blog/uploads/UFO3.jpg . I am not sure what that was. I am kind of thinking that it might have been some sort of funny military craft, since there is an Airforce Base not too far away from that location. However, i don't know if that could be an explanation for what i saw. I hope you might have any ideas to tell me.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,,

On the evening of March 22, 2009, at approximately 19:45 hours, I was traveling southbound on I-25 approximately five miles north of the Loveland, CO area when I noticed a set of lights in the sky that were approximately 250’ above the ground that were remaining stationary.  As I traveled closer I was able to see that the lights were part of an aircraft/mechanical object.  This object was directly above the southeast corner of the I-25 to C-392 interchange.  The object was comprised of square shaped beams making up a metallic silver cross of equal dimension on the x and y axis, with a circular shaped ring of the same silver metallic material that encompassed the outside of the cross and connected at the ending points of the cross itself.  The distance/size across the bottom of the cross/ring section was approximately 50 feet. There was a large dome light in the direct center of the ""cross,"" and four smaller lights at the end points of cross sections just prior to where the circular section met the square cross sections.  There was a dark, solid section that extended above the cross/circle, but I was unable to identify any specific details/shape of this dark colored area.  It’s height seemed to be about one third to half the size of the width of the craft.  The five lights on the bottom of the craft were solid white, neither blinking nor changing color.  The large center light was the lowest part of the craft, with no type of landing gear or runners (such as seen on helicopters) being visible. The craft was perfectly stationary as it ""hovered"" in the air, neither tilting nor moving in any specific direction.  After I passed by/under it, and traveled for approximately ¼ of a mile, the craft tilted on an approximate 30 degree slant and began to slowly travel towards the west.  I could no longer identify/see the craft after five minutes or so. There were numerous people/cars traveling on the road at this time who also could have seen this craft quite easily, but I have not been able to find any mention of this type of craft or anyone who saw it and/or had the opportunity to photographed or video capture the event.

Its luminous, phosphorescent lights made its shape out to be triangular or boomerang-like in nature, although the craft itself seemed to be cloaked. The whole spectacle lasted approximately ten to fifteen seconds until it just vanished. One of my friends later told me that he felt like he was being watched when it flew by. My other friend simply dismissed it as either a skein of geese, a weather balloon or swamp gas.

Time: April 19th 2009, at 12 o’clock, noon. The weather was warm with no cloud and no wind at all. I was at a friends house in the outskirts of the town, drinking coffee. From my spot on the sofa in her living room, looking out of the windows at the clear blue sky I noted that the contrails left by high flying aircraft didn’t move and were left hanging there, crisscrossing the sky and slowly spreading. I figured that the contrails would eventually turn this sunny day to an overcast one as they seemed to bloat over time in the perfectly still air and did not go away. This was the reason that I had my attention at the sky in the first place. At this point I noticed a bright light moving fast towards us from the left. It looked just like the landing lights on an aircraft but without the aircraft. This soon separated into two light sources spaced close together and I could just make out that they were connected to a solid object. At this point I called out to my friend: What is that? What the heck is that?! And I got to my feet. We both ran over to the windows to have a better look. At this point the object was rather close and it soon scooted in front of the windows and disappeared over the roof, out of sight and obviously moving so fast as there was no point in running through the house to have a final glimpse of it disappearing on the other side of the building. We were both very shaky after this and we started right away to try to find a rational explanation.  As of yet we are at a loss.  The object looked like nothing I have seen before. It didn’t have wings or a tail (no control surfaces whatsoever).  The closest thing I can compare it with is it had the general shape of a hat with a very tiny brim on it.  The two lights were on the upper half of it (or at the very top) and they shone with a bright white light (just as normal landing lights would).  The colour of the object itself was dirty gray or black.  I could not detect any further details as it was moving so fast. I noticed that the sun reflected off the top of it.  I estimate the size to be about 8-10 feet at its base and about 6-8 feet tall. It moved very steadily in a perfectly straight line with no wobble at all, in fact, it was almost as if it were moving on a pair of (invisible) rails.  I estimate the speed at around that of the sound or slightly below (much like when fighter aircraft fly past the crowds in air shows, just under the speed of sound).  There was no sound whatsoever (not even a swoosh), and the windows were open because it was a hot day.  Also I noticed that the leafs on a big tree in the garden did not move as the object streaked just a few feet above it.  The windows should have rattled when an object of that size moved so close at such a speed and this fact puzzles me more than anything about this experience. My friend saw it pass overhead, which I didn’t because of the angle in which it moved in relation to the windows and she said that it had a purple ‘hazy’ colour on its ‘back side’. I read the local newspaper thoroughly the next day but there was no mention of it.  The course of the object was NE which would lead away from any built up areas. This is the only experience of this kind any of us have had. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2009-08-05T00:00:00,,

It's path seemed straight, made no noise, and bore no navigational lights. I had observed it's path as being approximately 20 degrees elevated from the horizon, and traveled a very approximate altitude of 10,000 feet. It may have been higher, but that would have meant the craft would have had to have been quite enormous. It's flight made it from the Western sky horizon to the Eastern Sky horizon until I lost sight of it behind some neighbours trees. The craft was just as illuminated whilst traveling from me; as it was approaching me. At that altitude, my best calculation of speed would have been several times the speed of sound. Yet no sonic booms or vapour trials were evident. Incidentally, this is an exact duplicate sighting of the same craft I saw one night in Stewartown, Ontario with a number of multiple witnesses 6 years ago, one of which was a MUFON representative.

I was driving on the westbound 101 around 8pm in the Reseda, California area when I spotted a blindingly bright light hovering off to the right side of the freeway. At first I thought it may have been a plane flying in my direction at an extremely low altitude. Then the object began to descend straight down, a small but noticeable distance, and continue to hover over the residential area of Reseda. I turned to by boyfriend in the passenger seat and told him I knew what I was looking at. At this time a freeway sound wall blocked our view while I was driving in the inside lane. I quickly shifted to the fast lane and waited for the object to come back into view. The object had to be relatively low in the sky if the sound wall and tree tops could easily block our view. When the object was visible again, all the bright lights had been shut off and now the craft’s anti-collision/beacon lights were blinking, and I could clearly see the outline of the unit under the full moon. Disk shaped, with a protruding top and bottom, with the blinking lights arranged around the widest part of the craft. It looked as though it was made of dark grey metal since it was reflective in the moonlight. We had driven around the craft, proving that it was stationary, and decided to circle back to get another look. In the 2 minutes that I was able to circle around back to the craft’s original location, it had moved higher up in the sky and less than a half mile west. We followed the craft by street and observed it, now stationary again, for 15 to 20 minutes. Every now and then we would see the lights on the craft dim and brighten, then descend straight down and hover. On the crafts ”low-light” setting; I could see multiple colored lights blinking at different times. When it began to move further west, we followed again until it was just a small speck in the sky. We decided to finish our errand in Reseda and head home. We were now driving on the 101 southbound through Studio City, California at about 9pm when I looked up and saw another similar-looking craft with bright lights hovering over the freeway a little higher than the treetops. As soon as I pointed in its direction, the craft took off heading north over my vehicle. Again, we turned around to head north and follow but the craft had traveled a considerable distance and we decided it was too far. I believe that I may have witnessed two separate spacecrafts. It is also possible that it was the exact same craft that I saw in two different locations when considering its speed capabilities and the time in between spotting the craft(s).",2009-03-19T00:00:00,34.20054642857143,-118.5400982142857

On January 10 2009, 2110 hrs, I took a break from watching a movie (paused it) and went outside to smoke a cigarette. I enjoy looking up to the night sky especially on clear nights when clouds are at a minimum or none are present (the latter applies to this event) and visibility is excellent. On this night I was smoking my cigarette when I noticed a commercial and most likely civilian aircraft making its aerial maneuvers for approach for a landing at Miami Int’l Airport. This is typical at the area where I live since aircraft traffic is directed through this area for landing approach. I did not think too much of it given the fact that I see aircrafts performing routine maneuvers on a daily basis. On this night, however, I noticed two objects flying through the night sky (no particular shape) in a constant formation on the background (relative to the aircraft making its northward turn) of the commercial aircraft. These objects were being displaced at a relatively high velocity (or speed, since their general direction and displacement seemed constant). At first I thought that I was seeing “things” and removed my eyeglasses and cleared my eyes. I went ahead and put my glasses on and saw the objects again. The commercial aircraft had a northward direction to while the objects had a general northwest heading. Military aircraft came to my mind in trying to identify the objects but no audible noises were emanating form the objects and no beacon/strobe lights were visible. Unless there are stop secret military stealth aircraft out there flying hypersonic with silent engines (especially at the altitudes these objects were flying) that the civilian population does not know about, I think this classifies as a UFO event. Furthermore, as they traveled in their direction (by the way, one object was leading the other by approximately a couple of thousand feet,  at approximately a 30° elevation, measured relative to the trailing object) their emitted visible lighting was fading. I am very skeptical about UFO sightings and associated reports on the tabloids. The main reason is probably because I am an engineer and to me almost everything in life has an explanation through engineering and science. This is the first time in my life that I have encountered a physical event that I do not know what to make of it. By the way, I am certain that these objects were not satellites.

It was coming from the same direction. It stopped and was hovering. It pulsed as did the first one when it was hovering, almost to the point of dissapperance.

I would gaze at the moon, marveling at how beautiful it was as it was rising into the night sky and then pay attention to my dog. My dog is an elder fellow and is blind so I need to be careful to keep an eye on him and give the correct ‘signals’ to help him navigate. I noticed groupings of several people, some were talking around a golf cart and some were partying, or at least that is how it sounded. Both groups were far enough away from me that I could not converse with them nor did I know who they were so therefore I was unable to ask them if they had seen what I just saw in the full moon night sky. I gazed up and saw two pulsing red/white orbs circling each other to the right side of the moon. They were pulsing light objects with red in the center with bright white around the perimeter of each one. They moved in unison and always parallel to one another. They seemed to be equidistant from each other. If one moved up, the other kept the same distance or so it seemed to me. It took me a few seconds to realize what my eyes were seeing. These pulsing orbs of light were playing with each other and then suddenly the pulses started to dim and they were gone. I kept looking up to see if they showed up at any other place in the night sky, but they were gone. I would guess that they were not visible by me for more than 2 minutes tops. Or at least once I noticed them in the night sky. I immediately walked my dog and I back home as fast as I could and let my husband know exactly what I had seen. He could tell I was excited about this episode!! I have searched the Internet this morning to see if I could find anything about this episode and that is how I came upon your site. I am not sure what I saw, other than it was an unusual sight. One I have never seen before nor will I forget.

The light caught my attention initially because it was the brightest light in the sky, much brighter than any of the stars. But then as I sat and watched it, I noticed it was traveling incredibly akward to be a plane. First off, it was traveling left to right, then remaining stationary (hovering like a helicopter), then continuing to take off again, sort of zig-zagging. As it proceeded this routine, I ran back inside and grabbed my digital camera and batteries (nothing substantial seemed to come out, but they're open for review). I did notice, however, as i tried to focus on the object with the camera, i could clearly see a purple, cyan, blue alternating color pattern (this could just be coincidental, but even with the naked eye an alternating strobe could be seen).

He was about 20 miles south of US Route 30.  An immense craft was visible in front of his vehicle.  He was unable to determine at what height the craft was flying, but he thought it might be somewhere near 150 feet. The craft was emitting strong strobe-like flashes which gave him the ability to determine that its shape was similar to a wedge of cheese.  It was, according to him, certainly triangular. When the craft came into view, he immediately slowed down from about 70 MPH to below 55 MPH, as did other cars on the interstate.  When the craft either flew over his car, or he drove under it, his radio went out for about three to four seconds, as did his GPU. He slowed further and tried to site the craft again in his rear view mirrors, as well as over his shoulder, and was unable to see any strobe lights or craft.  According to my son, he said that people in other cars had clearly seen the same thing and were distraught. Please understand that my son is not usually accurate with regards to distances, so it is possible that he had traveled further (or shorter) than he told me he had.

When standing in the middle of the yard, one can see almost from horizon to horizon.  The weather was clear and the stars were shining in the dark night-sky.  We observed many ordinary-like satellites and at least two shooting stars during the evening.  I would consider me and my brother as two sane and perceptive young men.  We had drunk a few cans of beer but we were not ""drunk"".  This report is filed some 4 hours after the sighting and is written without the participation of my brother. At approximately 2000 hrs (GMT + 2) I observed a moving, faint, red dot of light high in the sky in direction NNW.  I told also my big brother to take a look at it.  At first he said that he did not see it, but I used a bright star (Vega) as a static target to point the object to him.  Now he also saw the light.  The light was moving quietly in a straight line towards SSE maintaining a visible speed of an ordinary satellite or high-flying commercial aircraft and kept doing so during the entire sighting which lasted about 2 minutes. At first I thought that the light was an ordinary satellite but it was red in color.  Next I noticed another blinking red light in the absolute vicinity, on the right-hand side of the first light, moving into same direction with same speed.  This observation made me think that it was an ordinary airplane we were witnessing and that the blinking red light was a wing-light or something.  However, I estimated that the aircraft was flying at an altitude of at least 15000 meters because it seemed too distant to be an ordinary commercial aircraft yet too close to be an ordinary satellite.  Moreover, no sound was heard from the aircraft during the entire sighting. As the aircraft reached the southern part of the sky the first light started to change color from red into bright orange.  Also the blinking red light could no longer be seen so there was only one light now.  This orange light made me think of a tail-light of a low-flying aircraft that typically seems to change color as the aircraft passes by.  The light kept traveling in straight line into direction SSE and it was still visible high above the southern horizon as we started paying attention to other things.  The sighting had lasted about 2 minutes and, as said, no sound was heard from the aircraft during the entire sighting. My big brother did not take the sighting very seriously.  Also, he is no expert in astronomy and was of the opinion that the object we had just witnessed was flying outside our atmosphere.  He even said that the object ""had it's braking lights on"" as it was red in color.  I however have astronomy as my hobby and this sighting was someting that I've never seen before so I took it very seriously and that's why I decided to file this report.   My best guess is that it was some kind of sophisticated domestic or foreign aircraft flying from NNW to SSE high over the Finnish airspace.   I also see that there's a very similar sighting filed in your database from 10/25/2008 from location Cedar Rapids, IA, United States.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,,

It was a beautiful sunny day and the highlight of the show was the USAF Thunderbird performance. I took snapshots with my digital camera throughout the day, and even tried to use the cameras video feature to get some of the nice formations in motion. When I got home and was reviewing the footage, I was shocked! I had three videos that had objects in the sky or that flew across the screen that I could not identify. During the show, there was nothing observed by myself, or openly by any other observers there that I am aware of. This is my first photo or video of a UFO, and I have never seen one in person before. Time of day: between 2:00pm and 3:45pm CST Camer: Cannon PowerShot A620, 4x optical zoom, digital zoom disabled Media:SanDisk Ultra II 2BG SD card Weather: Clear skies, winds <10mph, temp. mid 70's (F) Observer: 28 year old male, married, Air Force veteran with 6 years experience in visual and radar identification of aircraft, as well as aircraft capabilities and limitations knowledge. Photo/Video experience: Novice  The first video is poor quality due to the limitations of the camera. It depicts what I consider to be a cloaked UFO. A single F-15 was performing a vertical climb. I was filming in video mode and trying to follow the movement of the aircraft and zoom in with the climb. In the footage there is a circular distortion on the right. This distortion is stationary in the sky and not a smudge or particle on the lens of the camera. As the camera moved slightly under my attempt to control the zoom and keep the fighter in frame, the object remains stationary, at the same time dust/smudges move with the camera to the left. (The dust/smudges are not in the photo captures.) The fighter does remain blurred considerably on the lower left during zoom. The object in question is very translucent with a slight shimmer around the edges and glimmering slightly over the whole of it.

Four of the F-16 Thunderbirds are in an opened diamond formation (my description not theirs) awaiting a solo F-16 to come flying through the middle of the group at a higher rate of speed from behind. I am in video mode and following the 4 ship formation. In the review I notice that behind the formation an object moves across at an extremely high rate of speed. The UFO crossed the cameras field of view in less than 1 second! There were only 6 aircraft in the sky at the time, all F-16's; 5 of which were participating in this pass. Another was preparing to come from a different direction. UFO in frame from seconds 0:06-0:07 coming from right to left behind(?) the fighters.

Shortly after 21:00 hours I went outside to snack on 3 pieces of left over pizza at a patio table next to my motor home.  I saw some flashing lights in the sky.  I thought at first they might be sky -searching advertising lights but saw no connection to the ground.   I saw two very large circular/oval white nebulous shapes making very quick circular patterns in the sky.  The two white shapes were hazier than search lights and their patterns danced quickly as if two children were playing with LED lights.  They circled counter-clock-wise continuously and always avoided overlapping each other.  They seem to be chasing each other like two butterflies in the sky.  Their flight patterns seem to be extemporaneous and random circling left in small areas and at other times very large areas many miles apart.   At times they disappeared behind thin layers of clouds.  The clouds were not low and there were not many clouds.  I was fascinated by this and thought to myself I had never seen anything like this in my 63 years on Earth.  I walked two doors down and brought out my neighbor to view the scene.  He agreed that he had never seen anything like that and added he did not believe that it could be search lights, LED lights or airplanes and stated that it looked very high.  We watch the sky together for 10 minutes as the lights continued to circle in playful quick patterns.  I heard the Apartment Mgr. calling her cat and went down two more trailers to tell her to look up in the sky but before I got there the lights disappeared.   I went back to my patio table and watched the sky for another 30 minutes but saw no more activity.

I would estimate the height to be somewhere between 3 and 5 thousand feet.  I was immediately suspicious because the object was bright orange in colour.  As it drew closer (less than one mile) it slowed down and maintained its position above the ground.  A short time later, it backed away, whilst climbing sharply at an acute angle.  It was travelling at an incredible speed and within 20 seconds or so, it was the size of a distant star.

There were 4 of us who saw it.  We were eating dinner on our patio at night.  I looked up and saw what looked like a spot light shining down from the sky through a mist or a cloud.  I pointed it out.  First reaction, rational, was that it was a helicopter.   We heard no sound of a helicopter at all, and the light seemed to high up to be a helicopter, especially given the fact that it seemed to be emanating from a cloud.  About 20 seconds later, the light seemed to rise straight up, getting enveloped in the cloud.  I say this because the light became diffused as if in a cloud of mist.

On the nights of May 27th and May 28th 2009, I and 16 other members of my family witnessed UFO’s off the coast of Surfside Beach/Myrtle Beach, S.C.  We were on vacation in an oceanfront house and had an unobstructed view of these objects. Beginning at about 10:30, my wife and her mother as well as a few other family members saw lights begin coming on over the ocean almost directly off the coast from the house we were in.  The lights were approximately a mile off the coast and about 1000 to 1500 feet in elevation. They saw 4-5 white lights slowly come on in a row and then disappear after hovering 20-30 seconds. My wife then came in and told the rest of us to come out. At around 10:45 we saw 3 - 4 lights appear hovering about 2-3 miles up the coast from us and then disappear. At around 11:00, 2 sets of 2 lights came on near directly out from us at about the same elevation and distance at the first sighting. The 2 sets appeared offset and one above the other. The lower set after about 10 seconds, tilted or banked to the south and then moved under the other set. It slowly rose a little, and then both sets moved away to the southeast and disappear within a half second or so. This third appearance lasted several seconds. There was no sound. On the second night, May 28th, the lights appeared at about 9:30. They appeared in front of us much as they had begun the night before. Their second appearance was from the southeast moving toward the northeast with an almost vertical banking to the south. The object slowed to a stop as it leveled back out. This time lights appeared to be rotating on the top. It hovered for several seconds and appeared to return to a southeast course with great speed as to almost disappear again. Again, there was no sound. After this, there appeared to be 3 planes - with blinking wing lights that by speed, directional, and elevation changes we took to be military jets - come from the north and fly up and down the coast for at least half an hour. It was as if they were following or looking for something with the patterns they flew and the confined area they were in. Since this time, I have been in contact with several people who saw the same things we did that night. I also have several minutes of video from both nights documenting parts of the sightings. Among my party were a teacher, retired and former military personnel, medical professionals, and other reasonable and educated people.

I went out my front door talking to her and initially looked in the direction of Chandler, NW, to try and see what she was talking about. Didn't see anything and joked with her about needing to drive into Chandler to try and observe what the radio was talking about. Said good byes. I then went back out and leaned on my Honda roof and slowly started to scan the sky in the direction of Chandler. I then came across 2 white/shiny disks/orbs at about a 35degree angle. They were side by side with about a pinky width between them. I then continued scanning the skyline, due to the reported 11 to 16, and ended up observing 7 more white/shiny orbs/disks at about a 45 degree angle that stuck out against the clear blue sky. This second set of obrs/disks were in 2 groups. One group of three were in a triangle pattern while the other was in a box formation (one orb/disk in each corner of a ""box"" and a ""triangle"" formation. Ran in and told my wife (which she just laid there) and then grabbed the camera and proceeded to take 40 pictures with my Vivitar, vivicam 5386, 3x zoom f=5.4-16.2mm.

At approx 2045 hours I looked out of our second floor bathroom window to check the weather . Brought to my immediate attention was a very bright (brighter than a KC-10 landing light seen at one half mile distance) , very large (larger than a seedless grape viewed at arms length) , object which was shaped in the form of a child's ""top"" . The object was spatially stationary (I fixed its position relative to two near tree branches.) , although it was rotating counter-clockwise at (best guess) about one RPM . It's color was ""opalescent"" white ; there was a small red , eccentrically located red light near the upper portion which rotated as if fixed to the object . As a ""best guess"" , I'd estimate the object to be about two or two and one half miles distant , the direction being to the N.N.W. . As for atmospheric conditions , the sky was overcast with a ceiling of about 3k feet . The object appeared to be approx 1.5 to 2.0 k feet above ground level . I watched the object (with fascination !) for about three minutes , after which I left the bathroom so as to procure a camera . When I returned , the object was no longer viable . I continued to observe the area for about two minutes , at which point I noted two slow moving ""conventional"" aircraft circling the area where the unidentifiable object had been sighted . These ""conventional"" aircraft were circling in a 360 degree ""holding pattern"" , about 500 feet above and roughly a half mile beyond the diameter of the unidentified craft . Although I could ascertain no distinct shape of the two circling smaller aircraft , I assumed them to be helicopters (nav lights , and air speed too slow for fixed-wing) from McGuire A.F.B.  I watched the circling aircraft for an additional five minutes or so , and retired for the night . I awoke at approx 0400 , and immediately (even before coffee !) checked the television news programing for additional details about the very strange object - There was none . The network news did (at about 0920) , however , make mention that some people in Arizona had become alarmed after viewing a U.S.A.F. weather balloon . Why did I wait so long to report such a strange object , when its size surly must have attracted the attention of very many people ? Although I'd never witnessed such a thing before , I suppose that the answer would have roots related to both a sense of frustration/disappointment and the potential risk of loss of credibility . If you've ""stayed with me this far"" , I'll seize the opportunity to note that I've been an aerophile (an airplane ""affectation"")for over fifty years , that I'm a former member of the United States Parachuting Association , and that I'm an armature (very)astronomer . In closing , although the experience only lasted for about three minutes , it was quite a show ! I thank you for your kind attention .

This light will appear about 3 hours after dark and slowly move across the sky in a south to north direction.   The light moves way too slowly to be a plane or satellite, and is not always present in the sky, which rules out a star, as previously thought.   On occasion I have seen this light move south to north quickly and then return to its original location.   The light does have star light characteristics but its unusual movement and brightness have aroused the curiosity of local witnesses.

On the night of Monday, January 12, my son and I were outside facing the south-western sky when we saw this bright light that appeared to be a star.  It was HUGE and for a moment I thought that it could have been Venus, although, I've never seen Venus so enormous.  Upon starring at it for a few minutes it appeared to have a red center.  The Asheville Airport is near here so we are familiar with aircraft travel and appearances.  The aircraft from the airport that we did see during this event would pass behind or to the side of this bright object. I called my Mother who lives in Etowah (about 20mins west of my location)  and she said that she also saw the bright light.  We don't have a telescope so we used binoculars to look closer.  Looking through the binoculars  also appeared to have a red center and trails of yellow which turned blue at the top coming off of it, almost like a meteor or satellite coming into the atmosphere.  However, this changed.  It then began  to appear that what I thought had been trails were surrounding it.  I checked to see how it looked at that point by the naked eye and it appeared to be as I had originally seen it;  just a huge star with a red center.  After being unable to determine what it was I went inside the house and checked back 30 minutes later where it had appeared to have moved latterly across the horizon toward west.  I know that it moved because on first seeing it the object had been right between two trees and on my seconding outing I saw it behind a tree more to the west. I have seen this same light on other occasions but assumed that it was Venus or some gigantic star. If I see it again, I will definitely post again.   Could this be Venus?  Or a satellite falling?",2009-03-19T00:00:00,35.4589,-82.6035

This morning I decided to stop at the beach in Port Hueneme, CA to admire the ocean after leaving my boyfriend’s house.  I arrived about 1:40 AM. I parked my car with the hood facing the pier with the tail end facing the Seabee military base directly behind me.  I left my engine, headlight sand music on as I was only planning to stay for a minute or two.  I put the car in park and stepped out of the vehicle.  I stood up on the ledge of the driver’s side door to get a better view of the waves.  I noticed what appeared to be a set of stadium lights facing the perimeter of the base over a fountain of water. After a minute or so I noticed the lights shift their angle/position out of the corner of my eye.  Shocked, I began to stare and then witnessed the lights move.  The first object consisted of five white/yellow lights.  There was no visible craft, just the lights.  They moved together at times and separate at times. The lights were able to move over the water independently of each other and collectively as a group.  They moved up, down, right, left, forward, backward--any way you could imagine.  There was no sound and no disturbance of the sand or water.  The lights remained completely static and motionless at times just hovering over the area and then were able to move slowly or quickly at varying speeds. The lights were low to the ground maybe 25 to 40 feet off of the surface. I observed this for a minute or two and was so startled I jumped in the car and took out my cell phone to take pictures and record video evidence.  I took a picture and then decided it would be best to record a video because it could capture the fluidity and motion of the objects.  I turned off the car engine, lights and music.  I kneeled on the driver seat and recorded the movement for twenty minutes out of the sunroof resting my arm on the roof to keep my hand as steady as possible. During this time a second object appeared, which was lower than the first and considerably closer to the base.  It was also comprised of the same five lights.  It also displayed the same characteristics and motion. However, it moved much more than the first object.  Suddenly, the first object disappeared completely and the second began to move toward my car.  I dropped my phone and it slid shut erasing the video.  I became concerned for my safety and started my engine, called my mother and drove away as quickly as possible. No sooner than I started my car the first object reappeared and then both retreated farther away.  Once on the phone with my mother, however, I became more curious and turned my car around in the direction of the lights to get a better view.  Both objects moved much more quickly then they had before in the direction toward my car.  I was so scared I stopped the car immediately in the middle of the road and turned around as quickly as possible and left the beach.  I am left with only one crappy cell phone picture, but a picture nonetheless. I saw no craft. Just two objects made up of five lights each, which could move collectively or independently of each other.  The objects made no sound and were able to hover very low to the ground.  Neither seemed to disturb the water or sand on the beach in any way.  They illuminated the area.  At one point one or two of the lights seemed brighter than the others on the first object, almost as if a light, beam or object was emitted.  But I cannot be sure of this particular detail as it was quick and hard to clearly observe.  I am unsure of whether or not it may have landed.  It was very near to the water/sand, but I did not witness it do so personally. They appeared on the perimeter of the military base!  There had to have been military personnel on duty who also witnessed the lights whatever they had been.  There are airplanes on the base none of which fit such a description to the best of my knowledge.  I did at one point notice what appeared to be a regular airplane far off in the distance, but was unsure if it noticed the objects.  There were three other cars parked nearby.  I am unsure whether or not they were occupied.  There are also a great deal of apartments and condos on the beach, in which other people may have noticed the lights. I am a reliable, lucid, sober, sane witness.  I am a recent college grad about to begin graduate studies. I have never believed UFO stories.  I am open to a logical military explanation of what I saw, as it was outside the beach perimeter of the CBC base, but I have never witnessed or been aware of any man made object with such properties or capabilities personally.  I watched the objects for about a half an hour myself.  I am sure they may have been there before I arrived at the beach and remained after I left as well.  They were still visible as I drove away to turn left back down Ventura Road.  I am flabbergasted at what I just witnessed.

We were talking about for a few minutes, trying to debunk what I had seen. Then we heard screaming.....it was very chilling.  We cracked our bedroom window and heard it over and over. it sounded artificial, not like a human, so we started guessing it was an owl perhaps?  i don't know what they sound like, but i have heard there are some that make wild ass noises. Then about 2 minutes later, we heard a swarm of sirens go past our neighborhood and off to the east, where the light had gone. I wish I was more prepared and had more than just a story to share. So question, where can I find out if there is to be a meteor shower?  Is there some website that records this information?   2ndly, is there any type of owl that makes a screaming noise like a human?   The answers to those questions would set my mind at ease.

It was difficult for me to make out because it was a bit far, but it looked like a banner with embedded balloons or something of sort. It wasn't very long. Its Length was twice its height. It was floating silently to the west, too fast for a balloon. To my estimate, it was about the speed slightly less than a helicopter at normal cruise. Later it changed direction to northwest and started ascending slowly as it became less visible, until it was too far to be seen. This all lasted less than 5 minutes. It had various colours, mainly purple and a yellow, roughly spherical part that was swaying. The background was cloudy.

As we continued to stare curiously and talk (2-3 minutes after the light went out) 6-8 planes that seemed to me very high and only noticeable by there wing lights seemed to ""comb"" the sky.  What we saw WAS a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch at 19:40 hrs.  Time above may be wrong.  PD))",2009-12-12T00:00:00,40.9919,-72.1989

Description:  Object was a light, appearing from this vantage point to be above the Wells Fargo Tower.  The taller IDS Tower is located to the left of the Wells Fargo Tower, the object would typically move slowly from the right of the Wells Tower, left above the top of the Wells Tower, and continue further to the IDS Tower, and would go out of view behind the IDS Tower.  The object would come from behind the IDS Tower back over the Wells Tower, then move to the right beyond the Wells Tower, and back again. The object sometimes performed fast complete loops in the air, would abruptly stop, and would drift slowly once again.  Sometimes the object would change direction abruptly moving up, down, sideways, or diagonally at a high rate of speed, sometimes instantaneously changing direction at a high rate of speed several times before abruptly stopping and then beginning to drift again.  There were times when the object would appear to hover without moving for up to a minute.  On at least two occasions the object quickly, at a high rate of speed, darted down at a diagonal between the towers toward the ground, covering two thirds the height of the Wells Tower in perhaps one half second.  There were times when the object would go dark and reappear several seconds later, sometimes at the same, sometimes at a different location.  There were times when the object would become dim, then brighter.  There were times when the object would appear to pulsate in intensity.  The second witness, ! a woman who stopped to watch, stated that the object changed colors. Luminosity:  Variable, from dark to dim, but often about as bright as Jupiter would appear in a dark sky.  Note that downtown Minneapolis is highly lit at night, as is the Wells Tower itself. Other:  The aircraft obstruction light on the antenna mast at the top of the IDS Tower functioned normally during the entire observation.  Several large commercial aircraft, apparently on approach to MSP International, made typical runs across the general area appearing to be at a higher elevation than the object observed.  There was an advertising searchlight scanning the sky in Minneapolis that night but it had no effect upon the observation of this object.  I observed the light for twenty five minutes, left and returned twenty minutes later to find the object still presenting itself as before.  I left and returned once again thirty minutes after the second observation and could observe no trace of the object. Opinion:  This was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter, or bird.  The abrupt stops, instantaneous change of direction, zig-zagging, and fast rates of speed, loops, and abrupt stops are inconsistent with such explanations.

So this report is complete and includes all 5 sightings***  11:25 PM PST (2 Objects) Hayden Idaho  Two shooting star like objects appeared approximately 60 degrees above the West by NorthWest horizon. The two objects were exactly parallel to one another flying at a declining angle toward the east and about a pencil length apart. They began to bank North and as they descended and changed their course the objects morphed into these glowing iridescent reddish, orange, pinkish boomerang like craft. They disappeared to the NorthEast. My girlfriend missed these as she was viewing another part of the sky and could not orient on these objects because they were moving very fast. 11:43 (2 Objects)  Two more boomerang like objects appeared over the Western horizon flying East by North East at a constant altitude. These 2 craft flew right over us and were much closer together than the previous 2. As they flew over us they split apart and came back together as if they were going around something so as to trace a sort of vase in the sky. When they came back together they were in the East and immediately banked to the North and disappeared out of sight. We both witnessed this event and were blown away trying to figure out what it could have been. 11:50 (6 Objects)  As we were glued to the skies SIX more of these craft appeared directly above us. We did not see them fly in from any direction, they just sort of appeared. They were in a very tight single file formation and flying a snake like pattern through the sky. They moved from directly above us to the eastern sky before what appeared to be collapsing onto one another and disappearing to the North. Again, we both witnessed this and were in total shock. We ran through the house tearing it apart looking for cameras blankets phones etc. No other event took place and by 1 am my girlfriend went to bed. I stayed up. 2:15 AM PST June 4th (9 Objects)  NINE more of these craft popped into my view in a triangle shape formation. They were flying from due South to due North about 30 degrees from my horizon. This was an amazing sight. The formation was very tight and the craft on the inside appeared to have this sort of electric glow to them and they appeared to be fluttering or wavering inside of this formation. They disappeared to the North. I was complacent by now and left my camera by the coffee pot. Approx 3AM (1 Object)  After the last sighting I vowed never to be without a camera again and began to make a record of what I saw. While I was describing the previous events I pointed the camera to the sky and I saw ONE more object. This object appeared to be flying much higher than the previous ones. It was darker and broader shaped and flying slower. It was about 70 degrees above the horizon and flew from due South to due North. I was in shock and praying that the camera would pick up the image, unfortunately nothing showed up. SHAPE AND DETAILED DESCRIPTION:  The first time I saw these and my girlfriend didn't I explained it to here as watching headlights in the sky point directly at you and then change course. I described the crafts as pinkish rose and glowing with a misty aura, angelic like. They appeared to have bird like qualities. After the next sighting I had a very clear impression of these crafts. They were a near perfect half moon shape with a protruding nose... there is a crop circle image that is amazingly identical to the shape of what we saw.  The link is here:  http://www.luisprada.com/Protected/IMAGES/cropcircle_walkershill1.jpg  They appeared to be glowing like the moon, sort of translucent and undefinable, but the colors red, orange and tan kept coming to our minds but there was definitely a mist or aura to them. As far as altitude goes, it is very difficult to say as there was nothing to reference.  My best guess is that they were flying much higher than a commercial airliner and traveling 10x as fast.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,47.7887,-116.7112

The balloon object; no lights,  was flying away from my position like a knuckle ball at about the 2:00 o'clock position, but the wind was blowing into my face from the north. Than without a noise, the balloon object went straight up about 12:00 o'clock position, dove straight down to the left, came right at us over another fast food place and grew to about 10'-14' in diameter. I told my daughter to look at the object when i pointed over the buildings horizon. She saw the tear dropped balloon looking object and within a second it darted up and out to the left and was gone in 1 sec. It shrank in size as if traveling at a very very high rate of speed.

It also had small lights going around the sides, mostly white.  The object was hovering, as if suspended in midair, above the tree line, probably 150-200 feet off of the ground.

However, as we drove by it, I watched in the rear window and the object began to move south very slowly, probably about 20 mph, over the interstate and disappeared over the trees.  Neither of us was sure what to think and I haven’t seen anything in the news today but I know others on the interstate with us must have seen the object too.  The object looked very similar to what was described in the Travel Channel special titled “UFO Over Illinois.”  Prior to this, my boyfriend did not believe in extraterrestrials or UFO’s but now claims to be a believer.

I was driving down Hardscrabble road nearby the intersection with Chaffin going due west.  At the top of the windshield appeared a streak of light which I originally registered as a shooting star.  It was a pale blue green light fairly bright, consistant with perhaps a trail from a firework, but without any smoke.  It streaked across my vision from the top of the windshield straight due west and possibly down and escaped my vision behind some trees.  It was going far to fast to be an airplane, and it was not a reflection since I have driven that road many times at night and never witnessed the same phenomenon.  The only logical explanation I could come up with was perhaps a firework remain, but I didn't see smoke and it was an unlikely day and time.   I tried to turn down the radio to hear anything but it was probably too late.  The one thing I did notice was a slight increase in static on the radio which grabbed my attention before I saw the object. ADDENDUM TO REPORT: Correction to previous post.  It was pale in comparison to the lights of the street. However then again, there were no stars visible and it was much brighter and larger than any shooting star I have seen. Also since it was dark and I'm slightly nearsighted it was difficult to tell whether it was moving parallel to the ground  or downwardly.

I am 45 years old. Me and 6 other adults ages ranging from 17 – 58 and 5 children witnessed this event. At a house on Woodlawn Ave. in Walled Lake, at around 10:00 p.m. on Saturday, 9/19/2009, we were all outside.  We noticed a group of 3 round orange lights coming out of the southeast sky heading northwest, then turning gradually west. They appeared to be moving slowly and made no noise but they seemed to cover a lot of distance quickly; they looked like they were about 4 miles away when we saw the area they were coming from and it took them roughly 30 seconds to be over the top of us. Though they looked like about 4 times the size of the brightest star in the sky or the size of a porch light from 50 yards, we could not tell exactly how big they actually were.  They seemed to maintain the same size the entire distance.  As the first group went over they disappeared overhead but not into the clouds; it was mostly clear except for some very light clouds overhead and I don’t think they were high enough to even be in the clouds.  There were many visible stars in the sky.  It made no sense that we couldn’t see them after that.  The glow of light was not like a flame though close to the same color. The glow of the light didn't go outside of the object. They stayed as glowing circles and didn't vary in shape. They didn't fizzle out, they just disappeared. Seemed to be burning off energy from the front while traveling forward.  As the first group disappeared another group of 5 appeared coming from the same direction and maintaining the same course. They were grouped together at what appeared to be about half a mile from each other and maybe a half mile to a mile up in the sky.  We did see a steady flow, where there were at least 12 visible at the same time, at different distances, this continued for at least 15 to 20 minutes. We saw a total of approximately 35 bright to dark orange, round, orb like lights, no blinking lights on them, no headlights, just a sort of bright to dark orange glow.  Some of the ones we saw, when they were at their greatest distance away from us, moving toward us, looked like they glowed red at first then turned bright orange, then to dark orange, almost a rust color.  Later, around 11:00 p.m., me and 4 other friends were a half mile away at another house in the same neighborhood on Fisher Ave. and we saw the lights, same characteristics as the others, traveling  the same course.  We witnessed at least 15 more within about 10 minutes, some traveled individually, some in groups of 3, some were in a triangular formation, twice there would be one straight across from one other, a mile or so apart, moving the same speed and distance like they were connected in some way moving together. We did see 2 jets,  one with blinking white lights and one with red and green, flying over, way, way above these lights, from west to east, the jets lights were only tiny dots.  I have never seen anything like it. The people that I was with speculated on what they could be. Some said flares;  flares would glow brighter or flicker.  Some thought rockets, maybe from Williams Research; they seemed like they came from further away and if they were rockets we should have been able to see them as they went by, they disappeared almost directly overhead.  Some thought maybe we had launched nukes and were at war; there was nothing about it on the news. This was not NASA’s launch from Virginia. In all 16 people,  including myself, witnessed this event, discussed the same details and agreed that it was the most bizarre thing any of us had ever seen.  None of us could identify the lights. Unfortunately none of us had a good camera handy; someone tried to use a picture phone but the picture came out blurry.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,42.552853846153845,-83.48020769230769

In that general direction is Erlanger Medical and the Life Force helicopter is not an unusual occurrence. I watched this for a few minutes without comment. Then a second, much brighter round blue light approached slowly from further away to come close to the stationary white light. I said “what is that?” My neighbors stopped talking and turned around to look up at the two lights. We were all on our feet at this point, talking about how strange the blue light was. It moved like a slow helicopter with an atypical light, yet it was totally silent. The helicopters that fly around this area are never silent. Also, there wasn’t any traffic that night. It was quiet out and we couldn’t hear engine sounds. The white light winked out after six or seven minutes and the blue light flew away in the direction of North Chattanooga until it was gone. Roughly a minute later it flew back in our direction, performing a few maneuvers. I made an offhand comment that if anything ‘came out’ of the light we should all hightail it indoors and lay low. The blue light headed off again across the river until it was out of sight. I’m not sure what to make of this sighting. We have helicopters, a major airport in Brainerd, and the Riverbend Festival was still going on at Ross’s Landing. Nothing matches what we saw. The light was too back and forth to be a plane and too quiet to be a helicopter. And nothing at Riverbend is an airborne attraction.

However, the sightings around here seem to be tapering off a bit as I have not had any in the months of April or May, so out of boredom from a lack of activity, I submit this report.  On the evening of June 5, 2009 at 9:00 PM, I stepped outside my house to scan the sky before retiring for the evening. The sky was extremely clear and all the stars were visible although somewhat dim due a nearly full moon.  After slowly doing a 360 degree scan of the sky three times without seeing anything remarkable, I started walking toward my front door when I noticed an object lit up in the Western sky about 45 degrees above the horizon.  The object can best be described as appearing somewhat like a very bright planet Venus, except it was approximately four times larger. The object appeared to just appear out of nowhere in the middle of the sky as it was headed North. The object was brightly illuminated for two seconds and would then quickly dim completely out of sight for 10-15 seconds and then reappear brightly for two more seconds. This sequence was repeated three times. Each time the object traveled approximately 20 degrees across the sky before it lit back up after 10-15 seconds.  There was absolutely no noise at all outside during the entire 50 seconds or so of elapsed time of this sighting.  I do not believe this sighting to be a normal aircraft due to a total silence during the time of the sighting, a lack of strobes and directional markers, and the relative size would be much larger than a jetliner at cruising altitude. Also, the speed of the object would have been much faster than a conventional aircraft. I also dismiss the notion of this being a satellite, as it was much larger and brighter than any satellite I have witnessed before. Besides, I have never seen satellites turn on and off before either.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,30.241299999999995,-93.269

My wife had asked me to come outside because she saw a bright light in the sky that was not moving and she wanted me to take a look at it.  When I saw the light another light appeared just below the one already in view.  Approx. 30 seconds later a third light appeared on the right side of the second light.  After about 2 minutes of them staying in the same spot, the third light started to ascending upward and positioned itself with the other two lights to create what seemed to be a perfect triangle.  The lights stayed in this position for about 1-2 minutes.  It is at this time that the third light started to ascend again above the other two lights.  Then it started to proceed towards my direction while the other two stayed in place.  I watched the UFO go directly above my head.  I could not spell out the shape.  It looked as if it was a square shape but that was because of the light formation I saw from the bottom view.  It had one bright light in what it seemed to be each of the four corners of the UFO.  The lights looked as though they were symetrical to each other.  As one UFO passed, the second light that appeared started to ascend and also moved in my direction mimicing the first UFO.  As the second one passed above me, the first light that was visible also took the same exact path as the other two.

She went outside and spotted the object as well, noting as I did that it moved in an ever so slight wobble.  Being that it was around 29 degrees outside, she went back in to her home.

The object remained static for more than half an hour, then it started to move extremely slowly, and get a little closer. I then saw through the binoculars that it was a cane-shaped object spinning slowly around its own axis, with a frequency of about 1 minute. The object was visible with the naked eye, and was below mid-level clouds, so I estimate an altitude between 10,000 and 20,000 feet. When closer it seemed to be composed of strings of spheres, but that could have been an optical artifact. I saw 3 airline planes fly in the general area. I took my eyes off it for a few seconds and lost contact; I scanned the sky for 10 minutes and could not find it again.

I live in Pima County, AZ about half way between the northerly limit of the city of Tucson and Oro Valley to my north-west.  I am near the base of the south-westerly end of the Santa Catalina Mountains.  My ZIP is 85704, and my altitude is 2500 feet above sea level. This (Monday) evening I was sitting on my second-floor balcony enjoying the evening air and observing the night sky to my north-east.  I was not using binoculars or a telescope.  The sky in my view was cloudless and I could clearly observe Capella rising in my direct field of view.  I was wearing my distance nighttime-diving glasses to aid my view of the night sky; however, my un-aided distance vision is excellent. At 1910 hours I observed a dark object transit my field of view, traveling generally from a north-northwesterly direction to a south-southeasterly direction at a steady speed and course.  The angle above the horizon was about 35 degrees and the object passed well above Capella.  At first I thought it was a flight of geese in a tight ‘V’ formation of symmetrical shape.  However, the shape simply was too uniform and steady to be a flight of birds; unlike the shape of a flight of geese which changes in shape over even a short period of time.  I thought that I could see individual dark objects, perhaps 9 or 10 of them, forming the ‘V’ (a ‘V’ similar to boomerang-shape but broader at the center than the traditional boomerang shape). I observed this object for approximately 40 seconds - I have an additional view to the east and south-east which I can observe through a separate opening in my balcony.  So, I was able to observe the object as it passed through an arc of about 90-100 degrees. There was no sound and no light from the object.  I have no clue as to the object’s altitude.  However, my guess is that if the object was flying at 1,000 feet above the ground, its speed was about 120 miles per hour; perhaps a bit more.

(LOCAL)  A young woman was driving at 40-45 mph along Lake Cook Road, when her car suddenly lurched to the right for no reason that was apparent to her.  There were no cars within sight on the road, and she had not seen any pedestrian or animal near the car.  She stopped her car immediately, got out, and apparently was flabbergasted by the appearance of the left side of her automobile. The investigating police officer could not provide an adequate explanation for the damage.  He noted that there was no damaged paint, and no animal hair, feathers, or blood, evident on the damaged area of the car.   NUFORC has passed the case along to Mr. Sam Maranto, Illinois State Director for the Mutual UFO Network (“MUFON”), for follow-up investigation. We have no reason to believe that the incident was UFO-related, but we have no explanation for how the extensive damage to the car could have occurred.  If any of the visitors to our site have ever witnessed this type of damage to a car, we would welcome comments or suggestions.

I was driving 40-45 miles per hour heading north toward I-94 East towards Chicago on Lake Cook Road. While I was in the middle lane, I felt a nudge on the left of my car which made my car shift to the right.  I did not swerve out of the lane and gained control back quickly. I slowed down and as I got my bearings, I realized that my left side mirror was knocked off and so I turned right onto Revere Drive and put on my hazard lights. I got out of the car and saw that I had several dents on the side of my car.  There were two that were deeper and larger than the others; one was located in front of the rear wheel and the other was in the center of the driver door. I called 911 to file a police report and the officer said that I was side swiped by another car but, there were not any cars around me before or after the hit and also there were no paint scratches from other cars on my car.

It was approx 70 feet above ground, about 100 feet away, hovering with very bright lights flashing across the side of the craft.  I was traveling close to 70 MPH but slowed quickly to 55 MPH.

Early Sunday 9/20/09 at around 12:50 AM, my boyfriend & I were driving down S Frontage Rd in Vernon, CT & began to slow down for the 4 way intersection with Bolton Rd.  We were heading back to Boston after visting my hometown for the day.  At that time, we saw a white, greenish light moving in front of us at a speed we have never seen in our lives.  It began up to our left & was shooting to over to our right. It flew right in front of the car. It was really bright and moving in a downward motion very fast.  My boyfriend estimates at least 1,000 mph, I couldn't even guess how fast, in my 26 years it was the fastest thing I've ever seen move by far.  It flew over us within a matter of 3 seconds. It probably started at 500 ft high and when we lost sight it was down to 75-100 ft.  It looked as though it was going to crash into the woods nearby, but the trees to our right prevented us from seeing anything further.  We decided to go straight onto the highway instead of t! aking a right to follow its direction – it was scary. I don’t know how anything moving that fast in a downwards motion could not have possibly crashed. It would have caused major damage, it was probably the size of a car. I kept looking back at the woods to see if something had crashed, but I saw no indication, it was completely dark. It was by far the most unexplainable thing I have ever seen in my life. We didn't hear any noise come from it at all. If it was an aircraft flying that close to our car, you can bet it would have been very loud. For the few seconds I had my eyes glued to it, the best comparison I can think of - remember Homer Simpson's radiation bar that bounced around during the Simpson's intro? It had the similar shape, though we think the UFO was a little rounder. It had a whitish/light green color and a bright illumination like I've never seen. I wish I could find someone else who saw the same thing. With the direction it came in, it flew right over a high! way overpass so I feel like someone else had to have seen it, ! however there were no other cars on the back roads I was traveling, it was a very quiet night out there.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

Looking at the television, the door is reflected in the mirror on my dresser.  The weather had been stormy but was quiet at this time.  Directly behind my home there is a small protected wetland.  While watching the news I became aware of a bright orange light, past the patio, illuminating the glass panes on the door.  I first saw it through the reflection on the mirror.  I turned and looked at the door and could see it at an angle through the door as well.  I looked back toward the mirror as the view was more directly at the door and saw clouds of smog or fog drift in front of the orange light.  Both the light and the smoke disappeared briefly and then only the light reappeared for a few seconds and then it was dark as if nothing had happened.  At no time was there any sensation of heat and there was no sound.  The smoke/fog first moved upward, and then from left to right.  I have never seen or experienced anything like this.  I did not feel fear.  I thought to myself that it might be a premonition of a fire but the dismissed the thought. Oddly at one point I thought I should get up and look out - but then decided I didn't need to worry about it.  Very strange.  This morning there was nothing outside that looked amiss.  An internet search did not find any others reporting a similiar incident at the same time although there was a rocket on the east coast that caused some odd lights, but that is too far from me to be related.

Rose vertically At approximately 1835 hrs I was contacted by my mother asking if I had seen the colourful light in the sky.  I went outside but nothing could be seen, however I decided to sit out for a while  At approx 1845 two Orbs of light rose from behind the nearby houses.  One was distinctly ahead of the other. I would say these objects were no more than half a mile away if that, perhaps even a few hundred metres. They rose in the western sky. The lead UFO rose quicker than the other but extremely gracefully, heading toward my direction. Instantly I knew what I was seeing, this was no ordinary craft.  Suddenly to my amazement the lead craft stopped dead in mid air! It then backtracked for a second or two, then it rose directly vertically approx 200 – 500 metres again stopping dead.  There was absolutely no noise whatsoever and we live in silence in Mulbarton.  It appeared the lead craft was almost waiting for the other which as it came within 50 metres both craft headed off into the distance rising up eventually through the clouds. The best description of the ufos is as follows. The lead craft was slightly brighter than the first. Each was a colour that I will describe as orange, however they were more than that As they were so close at one stage I could see that they were made up of many merging colours that radiated outward. They were obviously emitting an extreme energy but in total silence. I would also say that gravity did not appear to affect them. They left no vapour trail. As they rose from such a very low level I believe it possible that they may of actually been on the ground nearby. I live very close to a very wooded area surrounded by fields. My wife is the biggest alien doubter of all time, however at the first sighting I shouted through our kitchen window to her to come quick. She to saw them and was amazed at what she was seeing. These were defiantly ufos, no doubt whatsoever. They were not aircraft with lights on head on. There is only one Venus, which was clearly visible anyhow. Also Venus is further away than a few hundred yards. And Chinese Lanterns is laughable. My biggest regret is that I could not video the event.  I believe the video would have been the utmost confirmation of the existence of ufos ever.  Nothing on Earth is coloured like that. Nothing can stop dead in the sky. Nothing floats like that in total silence.  These were real and I just want everyone to know it.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

My neck was getting sore from staring at it so long so I went into my house to grab a towel so I could watch it from a grassy slope nearby.

When the neighbor’s father came out, I acknowledged him and told him what we were looking at but when I looked back up to find the object again, I was unable to locate it. I watched it for about 15 minutes but it appeared to be at a good enough distance to only be a bright dot in the blue sky. The skies were clear except for the clouds that were over the mountains and the temperature was in the mid 70s. The area it appeared above was Mount Lake Terrace.

That day, we decided to follow a route via US 380 West towards the town of SOCORRO, searching for any available lodging on route. After securing a room at a local motel in the town of CAPITAN, we decided to go for a ride later on after dinner and check out the stars that night by the desert. We had experienced some overcast weather earlier in the day and the skies had turned clear enough to do so by evening. Somewhere around 8:00 pm we found NM State 234 on our GPS, and we decided to head for awhile on this road eastbound (and towards ROSWELL in Lincoln County). NM STATE 230 is a 2 way road which appeareed to be mostly used by local traffic during the day and not a very busy road at all in the night. There are no light poles to illuminate the way once you've entered the desert and sometime after dusk (between 8:45 PM and 9:10 PM) the night fell quickly, and eeringly dark. I engaged my vehicle's high beam lights in order to better see the road, road markers & reflectors, and also had to slow down sufficiently enough below the posted speed limits (45 & 50) in order to also avoid hitting any of the abundant indigenous wild life we encountered through out most of our entire trip that night. In the 2.5 hour ride we'd traveled on this road, no other vehicles were encountered in either direction (nor could any be seen at a far distance in the mostly flat landscape).  Sometime around 9:00 PM we reached an area somewhere in between mile markers 41 & 42 on STATE 230, at which point we decided not to continue any further in that direction. After doing a U-turn to head back westbound, I parked the car just on the shoulder of the road at mile marker 41. I turned off the engine, radio and lights, and sat we sat inside the car talking with my friend in total darkness & silence. We commented on how dark it had gotten on that crisp, clear and moonless night (up to that point...the moon rose up later on around 10:05 or so). Our plan qas to get our vision aclimated to the dark, and then get out of the car and look up at the constellations.  However, before we even got a chance to set a foot outside on the ground. At approximately 9:10 PM (and with barely a hint of western dusk light left on the horizon...the eastern skies were already dark & starry!), we both noticed an object about the size of a bayer aspirin traveling hurridly miles above in the skies. We couldn't make out it's shape or outline at all, as it had a very bright and steady glowing orange to reddish light. At first, I  thought it may have been either a lear jet, or military aircraft traveling typically in a straight path, with a north-east to east bound trajectory heading, at a 30 degree angle above both the barely visible horizon, and the distant western mountain range beyond.  I am well familiar with many aircrafts used by our military, having served in both the: USMC & the USCG.  So it seemed something rather odd that this craft was traveling that at night with no other type of fuselage lights ""ON"", nor did it produce any familiar distant sounds, like those from a jet or rotor engines.  I was just about to calmy say something to my friend, when at that very same moment he bursted out saying: ""What is that in the sky?""...""do you see it?"" No sooner did he asked... when suddenly the object disappeared,  vanishing in what we'd estimated to be 5-6 seconds. Then, suddenly it re-appeared again further along on the same path, at what seemed tome to be 2-3 clicks east of it's last position. Suddenly, the object cleanly splits into 2 (two) objects (each retaining its original orangish-reddish color light), both objects then travelled parallel to the other at first. Quickly separating or widening apart in a sort of an arc fashion, then suddenly both objects did something bizzare: each dove right into each other, rejoining and giving the appearance as if both lights had ""MELTED"" or morphed back into 1(one)single object---immediatelly after completing this ""maneuver"", it completely ""vanished"" into thin air and it did not reappear again anywhere in the skies.  There was absolutely no sound or echo indicating an explosion or collision, there were no visible trails, or ""hot"" sparks/debris falling anywhere on the ground landscape, nor could we see any surface fire coming out of the desert landscape below at that distance thereafter, which would've indicated any sort of accident happening in the skies and over that part of the desert.  My friend and I sat there for about 5-10 minutes both, perplexed and excited at what we'd seen. We asked ourselves a number of questions in an attempt to make sense of what we'd witnessed  (i.e.: was it fireworks?...was it a satellite?...could it have been spotlights...missiles?) but, we couldn't arrive at a rational answer on what we saw that night. The entire episode lasted approximately 30 seconds and although I had a digital camera with me, unfortunately I could not retrieve it out of it's case, and power it up quickly enough to capture the event in the limited time as it happened. Afterwards, we started the engine, and quickly got back on the road back to our motel.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,33.50664583333333,-104.45876666666668

The object was very bright and constantly pulsating. When I first saw it I thought it was a beacon light on a cell tower but I drive this way every day and there is no towers where I saw the light which is why I watched it so close.

I am a college security officer and was out patrolling the campus when I observed a bright light West of me.  At first I assumed it was an airplane with an extremely bright light and I thought to myself ‘that is a really bright light’.  The sky was somewhat cloudy at times but it was clear enough that stars were visible still – more like a hazy/cloudy sky at the time of the sighting.  If one has seen an airplane traveling through clouds before, one would have observed that the headlight is distinct and the light forms a triangular shape; this object I was watching was doing the same thing only it was at least twice as big as a light from an airplane.  Throughout the approximate 2 minutes I watched this light, it began to move South and I thought to myself ‘either that plane is about to crash into me or it is flying dangerously low’.  My assumptions that it was an airplane were backed by 3 flashing red lights beneath it (resembling a planes wingspan).  As it began to turn South from its seemingly stationary position, I thought that it could not be an airplane and that it must be a helicopter.  The only problem is that this made no noise that I could hear what-so-ever (when police helicopters fly anywhere near the campus, they are extremely loud and obvious, unlike what I saw).  As it turned I caught a very clear sight of the actual object on its side in the bright moonlight and at that point I ruled out the possibility of it being a helicopter.   The object most simply described was a large, dark, metallic sphere floating slowly in the air, possibly a few hundred feet above the treetops.  I was unable to assess how large this object was, but from my view, its size was about the same as the moon’s size from my view.  I even considered the possibility that it was some sort of remote controlled toy but it was too big and I thought that it would be ! silly fo r anyone to be playing with something like this at midnight.  It was heading out of my sight and about to be hidden behind a building and large bare trees so I ran to get to the other side of the building to get a better look but I could not find a trace of it anywhere.  I did see what seemed like an airplane traveling very far away in the distance but could not understand how it could have gone that far in a matter of 15 seconds or so.  But I am 100% sure of what I saw; a large sphere-like object with a single intensely bright ‘headlight’ on its side facing a downward angle and at the least 3 red flashing lights on its bottom side.  One housekeeping staff working through the night noticed a bright light in the sky not moving but did not think enough of it to watch it because it was too cold outside.  He went to throw out garbage but on his way back he noticed that it was gone.  One other security officer claims he saw red lights in the clouds above him not moving but did not see the actual object as I did as he drove around in the security truck but did not pay much attention to them.  The duration of time of what I saw was about a total of 2 minutes but I only saw the actual objects body for approximately 10 seconds.  Never in my life have I seen anything that could have been a UFO before today.  It clearly was what I said it was.  While speaking with the housekeeping staff witness inside of a building, we both heard what sounded like a rocket being fired.  An example of this sound is what the fireworks sound like during 4th of July celebrations as they are fired into the air.  But there was no sound following this whistle.  This is possibly unrelated but in my 2 years of working this shift at this job I have never heard anything like this.  After hearing it I ran outside to see if there was something to see but the sky was clear.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,39.07793837209302,-77.14956651162791

My wife was upstairs putting the children to bed and I was outside the house walking to our garage when I noticed the object. We live in an area where commercial airplanes are approaching for landing or taking off from our national airport on a regular basis, the airport is about 35km NW from my home. I know how to distinguish landing lights from an airplane from what I’ve seen that night. The orange glowing flying object was approaching me from the west heading to the east, I was in the garden at that point in time. It was approaching at a velocity very similar of an airplane. The object followed its heading on a straight course to my observation point. I couldn’t see the object itself because it was surrounded by a blurred orange glow, but the shape appeared to be cross shaped. It’s difficult to estimate the size of the object and the distance from my observation point, the outline of the object  appeared to be the size of a medium size plane (Boeing 737). My estimation is that I watched the object approaching for about 3 minutes, when I notice that the object turned its heading midflight. The “front” of the glowing object turned south and was hovering for 10 seconds before it took off almost vertically/slightly westwards with an incredible lift and speed. It was a cloudless night and I could follow the object visually reaching a very high altitude as it appeared to be no bigger than a star in the sky. That maneuver took no longer than 10 seconds, I was still tracking the object as it was suddenly moving eastwards at incredible speed and following a curve of its parabolic flight path to match the curvature of the Earth!

We saw planes go by late at night and they were planes.  I saw 2 shooting stars and those were shooting stars.  This object that I thought was a star until it started making these movements was, indeed, a UFO. It was the color of a star mainly.

This is Labor Day Evening, Sept 1, 2008 at 8:47-9 02 PM Central Time.  Looking up at a clear sky I notice what I initially thought was a Blinking STAR.  After a couple of seconds, it started moving.  I immediately assume it was a jet.  It had white lights, with a blinking red light in the middle.  It was at a height that you would normally see a passenger plane that was so high, all you could see was the lights at night. I was about ready to dismiss it as a plane, when it seemed to change direction. Initially it was heading in a somewhat Western direction, then it sort of headed left, but not really a left turn, simply sort of veered left. The best example I can think of is like when you were a kid playing with one of those old "" Etch a sketch"" toys. Until you got good at it, it was difficult to make turns or curves. It continues to go in different directions, left, right, then it seemed to stop for 5 seconds or so.  I knocked on the front window for my wife to come see.  She also noticed it.  She seemed to think that the red light was going in a circular direction, possibly clockwise.   We watched it until it was headed due south and disappeared over the neighbor’s tree line. I did not know who to call, so I hit Google and found your contact info.  Just prior to typing this report, I went back outside and sure enough, there it was again, in the exact same place as when I first noticed it as a blinking star.  It was moving back west again, but this time directly west, and seemed a bit quicker.  Again my wife seen it this 2nd time too. Although, I absolutely do believe in life other than on earth, I never seen a flying object that was this high, this bright, flying in erratic directions, and seem to hover, then a few minutes seem to be coming back and doing it all over. It is now just past 9:20 PM and it is once again heading in an erratic flight path, but in the SAME position as the 1st 2 time heading west.  Every once in a while, one of the white lights seem to blink bright enough to get your attention.  Then it disappears over the trees. Possible thoughts was a satellite.  It was way too high for any helicopter or smaller Cessna type plane.  Heading in too many weird directions for a large jet plane.  And unless there was several in a row, why was it retracing its direction at least 3 times.  That was when I seen it.  Who knows how long or many times it completed this exercise?

I was looking up in the evening sky, when I saw a faint looking star moving southwards.  I thought it could be a satellite, as I was watching this move, a flash came from the southeastern direction.  It was a quick white flash as if someone was trying to say ""hey I'm over here"".  My sister happen to be looking up at the time as well, and said ""was that a falling star or what"".  I said ""no"", I was watching that other star looking object, which was just north west of this flash, when this flash turned on and slowly turned off.  It wasn't like a falling star at all,it was if someone turned on a bright white light, then slowly it turned off. About 3 mins later I happen to look up, and as I did, I noticed object fly just above me heading north, it appeared to have a whispy orange glow which seemed to have two bright lights at the front of it, almost shaped like a triangle with rounded edges. I mentioned it to my sister who was sitting next to me.  I thought did I just imagine it, or was I just really tired. I was curious to know what this might have been, so I grabbed my binoculars Nikon 10x50, I aimed towards the area where I saw the flash originally, as I was searching the skies, this object flew within my view, it was huge.  It seemed to have two sets of lights in a row in what seemed to appear as a ""v"" shaped object.  xx     xx xx   xx xx xx xx   Not sure exactly how many lights were at on the object itself, however, I do know for sure it had two sets of lights in each row which outlined this object.  I watched it as it flew almost gliding throught the sky heading northest.  I was telling my sister to look up where I was pointing, I did not want to loose sight of this object within the binoculars view, she said she saw nothing. I am assuming this object must have been up pretty high for my sister not to see it, however, when I saw it looking through the binoculars it appeared to be large.  I would say it was twice the size of a jetliner. The best way I can describe this object is by comparison. Example:  Looking up approx. 1000ft at a 747 jetliner, through my 10x50 binoculars, the plane would appear to be the size of a nickle, and the bottom of the airliner would be difficult to see clearly as it is dark, and generally there are no lights at the bottom of the craft, perhaps a blue and red light at the wings and a white/yellowish light at the front of the plane. Now looking a this ""v"" shaped object it seemed like the lights were a whitish color, yet not blinding, and the object looked to be the size of a 50cent piece, quite large.  I couldn't tell you what altitude this object was at, as it could not been seen with the naked eye. Note: During this 15 minutes duration, my sister and I noticed the dogs next door were barking like crazy.  We thought ""those dogs are sure non-stop tonight"". It was getting annoying listening to those dogs. While viewing this object through my binoculars, my sister made a comment about the dogs, she said ""did you notice the dogs stopped barking"".  I listened and realized yeah, they did stop.  I am assuming that this could be because this object decided to fly away (heading south east).  Perhaps, it was lingering around the area above the skies unnoticable, then decided to leave.  I must say, the dogs were quiet after this thing departed. I wanted to know if anyone else had seen this object in the skies: September 1, 2008  approx: 9:51 - 10:15pm ish, Near Torrance, Gardena & Lawndale area of Los Angeles, CA.

Suddenly it moved, it looked as though it ascended very rapidly, a significant distance and then descended to about where it had began. I blinked my eyes thinking … After watching it for a few more seconds it began to move in a sideways motion. At that point I called to my wife and daughter for verification. They both joined me and verified what I believed I had been witnessing. As my wife and daughter observed I went inside to get our Video camera unfortunately the night sky was to dark and the object was to distant to produce any usable images. I then decided to try some still Photography setting up my camera on my tripod and using a wireless remote I proceeded to take still photographs most not showing much more than a point of light. The rapid movements of the object ceased within 10 minutes of first observation, but I continued to watch the object until about 0300 hrs at which point it was behind the tree line. Just a note that although the object moved somewhat from the first position observed, it did not move at a consistent rate relative to the rest of the objects in the sky. I’m not unfamiliar with the night skies and at the age of 50 have seen many different things but after checking the location in the sky the following evening, and seeing on a perfectly clear evening that there was nothing but dark sky where I witnessed the anomaly the night before, I felt the need to share this.

I witnessed a white round object travelling from the west at the distance of about 1-2 kms max. The background was a absolutely clear blue sky with patches of cloud and a heck of a lot of puffy, white chemtrail lines and even included ""X""s. (Crisscross) Watching this white light for about a minute with the naked eye. I pulled out my binoculars for a better view. As I viewed the object at a great distance with a amazement. I could also see through the binoculars to the west. Six or seven smaller white objects around larger one.Or the larger object was closer to me then the others. This could be the first multiple sighting for me this year. I continued to observe the closer object with now my naked eye again. Now I focused on the larger one heading towards me from the west. This strange object appeared ""brilliant "" white in color, no intense light now.It was perfectly round -360 degrees. Y! ou could almost classify it like a large orb.It moved like the Pac Man game. After 2 minutes of viewing with binoculars on and off. It got closer to me now to describe. I called a Fed X Courier Driver across the street to view. Within 10 seconds where I pointed straight south of us, he too could see the white round object with the naked eye moving across the sky. I passed the binoculars to let him have closer look. He had problems to focus through my binoculars and passed them back to me. We watched the object. as it got closer for another 2 minutes. It was travelling east.Now it was directly south of our position and to our closest point to view. This object travelled in a straight line.. What's also interesting is a large grayish-white jet flying in from the northwest towards the southeast towards the UFO. The jet was dispensing one hell of a chemtrail and talk about rainbows just behind the jets trail. This jet looked military with a longer wings span, travelling about the same altitude as the UFO. We watch the UFO continue east, as the jet intersected behind the UFO's flight path. The jet was slightly turning more to a southeast away from the object. Makes you wonder if chemtrails are used to blanket crisp clear blue skies in obstructing vision of UFO's. The good news is I snapped a picture, the bad news is, it's a disposable and there was no image found when developed. But at least I have a witness, and it's his first sighting. The speed of the UFO seem that like a Cessna, and lasted about 5-7 minutes.Following September 22 at approx: 11:00 a.m.,I noticed low flying black military helicopter over head flying due south and turning east. One thing to note was September 21, 2004 is on a new quarter moon. What was very noticable,  is that this thing, followed along a thick chemtrail line just quarter mile south and few thousand feet above. I thought to share this sighting due that it happened exactly 5 years ago today. I understand that a day later on Sept.22, 2004. That Cleveland, Ohio had many reports of UFO's. Witnesses there observed the military on the ground, as well the skies in the early morning through the day.  Could there have been a connection to my sighting here a day earlier ?

I use a pair of binoculars to see that it was actually spherical...sort of shaped like a hot air balloon, but not nearly that exact in shape. It was extremely bright even in the setting sunlight. There were scattered high clouds, likely 30 to 40 thousands feet high and this object was behind them at times. While the clouds were moving briskly towards the NE this blob-like light was slowly drifting westward. After about 15 minutes it dimmed somewhat and (again through binoculars) then tiny little lights, almost like embers started appearing below the blob. Each one only lasted for 4 to 10 seconds. These lights seemed to ""fall"" from the blob, but some moved laterally...they were very small, but a couple seemed to move upward briefly, before dimming out. I continued to watch as this bright blob for almost 45 minutes as it slowly drifted west and dimmed to a pale blue color as the dusk became night time. Only after a deck of clouds obscured it, did I give up the watch. I have to imagine thousands of people in central and west central Arizona saw this thing. Again, it had to be very large, because it was above the high clouds and at a very low angle for me. At it's brightest period it was not homogenous, it seemed to have some motling (sp?)some variance in it's brightness or on its surface. If it was some huge balloon. I don't understand why it was so bright and more importantly, how the heck it was going west when the upper air flow was out of the southwest.

At 7:40p I went out to grill, looked toward Sky Harbor and noticed a brilliant light toward the WNW at about a 40-45 degree elevation a couple thousand feet above some whispy clouds. I brought out my hunting spotting scope, and after focusing I saw it was cone shaped, upright, and clearly self-illuminated. I went out into the yard to look around to see if I could spot any stars at that time. I didn't see a single one. I went into the house, brought out my 7"" (dia) telescope and tried out various lenses. By this time the cone had gradually lowered in elevation, had maintained its brilliance, and moved slightly further south from where I'd seen it (total elapsed time about 5 minutes). It stayed in our range for about 45 minutes or so. Toward the end of its visibility, it quickly diminished in light intensity, to the point where it appeared to be a faint star. We then lost sight of it behind a tree, and I had a hard time tracking it due to its dimming. The light itself appeared cone shaped. The upper left corner appeared a bit rounded, the upper right corner was more squared. The light color itself I'd have to describe as what you'd see when looking at a fluorescent bulb; nearly a pure white. When looking through my Galileo telescope, directly below the bottom of the cone I saw a very small point of light. Unfortunately, because I had to rely on telescopes to spot the object, I was unable to get a photo of it. There was plenty of air traffic around, but I saw/heard zero fast-movers, and having seen flares fired from both helos and fighters, I can absolutely confirm this was no flare. My younger brother flies AH-64D's in Mirana. When returning to base tonight he heard several aircraft communicating with Williams Gateway tower explaining what they'd seen, and the word ""balloon"" was mentioned. Again, I've seen many balloons, to include both weather and hot-air, and this looked nothing like either of them.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,33.42126454293629,-111.772797322253

I pulled over onto a neighborhood street to watch the object and get on the phone!  I called my dad in Tempe, he had seen it in the sky about 15 minutes earlier and was watching it.  I called my mom, and after she spotted it, she grabbed the neighbors and they all watched it.  I called another friend, she and her boyfriend plus entourage all watched it while on the phone with me.  Witnesses are not a problem!  I watched the object for about 15 minutes before it disappeared.  It was far too large and bright to be a star or a planet, and it was completely motionless.  I was parked, and by comparing it to other stationary objects, houses, poles, etc, it didn’t drift or anything.  The white light was very bright, creating a sort of aura of light around it that was maybe double or triple the circumference of the central object.  In the center, it was looked like just a solid sphere of light.  After perhaps 15 minutes of watching the object, it suddenly began to look like it was moving away from my point of view.  It appeared to be moving slightly, and the white aura of light faded rapidly.  It became a bright orange color, like the color of Mars, and it’s size continued to diminish quickly.

It was moving slowly and ackwardly and moved out of sight. Then we saw what was the shape of a twin rotor army helicopter, but it was making a low drone noise and had two very bright red lights. When one light blinked the other would go out and visa versa. On this one, it could just have been an army helicopter. But, the lights were really strong...not the normal airplane/helicopter light. Either way, why would there just be one flying relatively low to the ground? Then 10-20min. later we saw another triangular craft like the one before, but it soon disappeared. And about 5min. after that we saw the strangest thing yet. A group of blinking lights that were blinking really excitedly. Going from dim to dark as they blinked. And it would jump from one place to another and make really weird flight patterns. Sometimes it would go dim and then go really bright and go up and down really fast and then appear somewhere else. (I have a short video of it where you can see it jump, but at this point the ship had stopped blinking. Where do I send the video?) Then it started turning left then right in a smooth zig zag type of pattern. It seemed to have a shape while it was turning, but it's hard to explain the shape.

The thing that caught my eye was the fact that it was a bit larger than a star and a lot brighter. I've seen this in the sky for the last few weeks, and I simply thought it was Jupiter or Venus or some other planet that I thought I had heard someone on TV talking about being in the night sky at this time in the year. Well, on this night and on the next, the ""star"" moved. I don't mean it moved a tiny bit, it really moved! If you hold your hand out at arm's length to measure the distance that it moved, it moved about 3-4 inches in any given direction. Sometimes it would perform a circle type movement, but most of the time it would just kind of ""float"" around, going from one side to the other, back and forth. I observed this for 40 minutes or so, until I could no longer see it (it seemed to sink in the sky as time went on). It would seem to be moving in a straight line at times, almost like it was deciding on a direction to take, and would travel in this straight line for a couple of inches (at arm's length) and then it would stop, only to move around aimlessly, without purpose again for a while. I'm not sure how many points of light there were coming from the object, but at times it seemed to have more than one, maybe three or more. Maybe it was disk shaped, because at times it would dim as though the lights were turning away from my direction. There were no flashing lights of any color, only whitish light.

He lives in the northeast US.  He claimed to have seen a UFO on two occasions near his home. Incident #1 Date:  Actual date isn’t exact though he remembers somewhere in mid January 2009. Time of day: approximately 7PM Location: My cousin was out in the yard playing with his 2 dogs, a golden retriever and a chocolate lab.  He claims that the dogs actually spotted (or heard? or sensed?) the UFO before he did which drew his attention to it.   He spotted a UFO hovering just below the tree line that was shaped like a “stretched cube” (rectangular block shaped) – the trees were approx 80-90 ft tall (estimated).  My cousin estimated that the UFO was about 1000 ft away from himself.   The grayish-black (charcoal) colored UFO looked like a “square house with rounded corners with lighted square windows all around it on every side except for the top and bottom which had smaller round white lights”.  The UFO then came above the tree line and started doing different flipping and turning movements.  He said it didn’t look like or act like a plane or a helicopter or anything that we know of or make in the US.  He described the pattern of bright white lights along the windows as going all solid and then flashing very quickly in an ordered sequence one after the other and then back to solid.  The lights on the top also flashed in the same pattern.  He claimed that after the craft went above the tree line that it was “watching him” and sort of “showing off” as it did its maneuvers.   He estimated the size of the craft as approximately 30-40 feet long and about 10 ft high.  He mentioned that it spun slowly 3 to 4 times on different axes (Y then X and then like a 45 (or 135) degree angled axis).  He noted that after spinning on one axis that it would very quickly move linearly to another position and then spin slowly on a different axis.  Both dogs were trying to get inside the house when the craft appeared.  They were barking and yipping to get inside the house and didn’t appear comfortable around the UFO.  This whole event lasted for about 3-4 minutes.  He didn’t hear any sound at all though because his dogs were barking loudly so that pretty much dominated any audio.  However he noted that he didn’t hear any loud jet-lane type noises.! He men tioned that while the UFO was in the tree line of pine trees that the branches were shaking and shuttering.  He only watched for 4 minutes and then went inside because it was unnerving.  And after inside the house he looked again quickly and it was gone.  He told his parents who didn’t believe him which is why I am penning this for him (Uncle Age 43) Incident #2 Then about 1.5 months later he claimed to have seen it again in the same spot though only for about 30 seconds this time.  The UFO appeared to execute the same maneuvers as described above in the first incident. He drew some pictures that depict the UFO and how it turned axially and also the lights on the side. My cousin gets good grades in school and isn’t lying about this. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2009-03-19T00:00:00,44.7262,-68.5995

Finally, at 21:30 the light dimmed to red and disappeared low in the sky to the West.  (2) individuals witnessed this event while talking to each other on cell phones.

The same (2) individuals while talking on cell phones in (2) different cars viewed the object in the same vicinity directly over Pflumm Road in Olathe, Kansas.  This time, the object was chased by car (1) in an attempt at a closer look to identify the object.  The light was again seen shining rays out the sides and changing colors in the same pattern as before.  The chase car turned West from Pflumm Road onto College Boulevard and several times stopped to look at the object through a pair of binoculars, however, the object was too bright to make out any shape. Several times it seemed that the car was getting closer to the object.  When College Boulevard came to an end near the Douglas County Line, the chase car changed to K-10 Highway and proceeded to follow the light West towards Lawrence, Kansas.  No longer would the light allow the chase car to get closer, several times it appeared that planes flew near the object, but it was followed only by car (1) through Lawrence until K-10 ended at Clinton Lake.  The light then stayed in the same location for 30-minutes. Now it gets really interesting.  With the light still in the same location, the chase car began heading East, back to Olathe / Lenexa at approximately 21:00.

This new chaser-being-chased event continued for 30-minutes!  Both cars proceeded to a parking lot at Shawnee Mission Parkway and I-435 where the object began a slow decent while still changing colors, now also changing to orange and red.  At no time did the color change flash (as landing or marking lights would), the color would just change from one to another in a random way.  The object now began moving back toward the west, away from the cars. At 21:30, both car (1) and now car (2) proceeded South on I-435 and the object began moving West/ South West again.  Car (1) exited on 87th street while car (2) continued South.  Car (1) came to a stop on a hill just West of a Kansas National Guard Armory.  The object was still in the distance and at the same low altitude, but becoming less bright.

I saw an object in the shape of a diamond moving slowly from east to south west at about the speed of a floats in a parade. I believe it was metallic because it reflecting from the sun. It had no wings, no stabilizer and no propellers, just a diamond like shaped object. I viewed it for about 25 seconds. If I stick my finger out at it, it would be the size of a writing pen tip. The time was about 9:00am. I didn’t have my video camera with me. It was in my other car. I normally carry a mini DV cam in my car.

It was, by our line of site, just above the tree line, and looked much like the heavy air traffic in our area except for the fact that it did not appear to be moving.  At first, we thought it was aircraft, because your perception can be “off” if the aircraft are heading towards you, but our object stayed put, moving slightly to our left only once, before moving back to its original spot.  The direction, from our observation point on our porch, would be in the south west direction. I went in and got our binoculars (we don’t have a telescope) and my daughter, and we all continued to observe the object for approximately 20 minutes.  Thru the binoculars, we saw it flashing red, blue, and clear or golden colored lights.  We all agreed that the object appeared to be round. We went inside and when we looked at the sky again, around 10 pm, it was gone. As I said, the location we live has heavy air traffic at all hours of the day and night.

My wife sometimes has trouble sleeping, and such was the case in the early morning of 09/02/08. She was laying in bed, looking out the bedroom windows, which face in a southerly direction. The windows allow observation of the tree line at the edge of our property, and the adjoining woods, which cover a hill which is about 100 feet higher in elevation than our house. Her attention was drawn to an unusual light in the sky. She left the bed and went to the window to get a better view of the object. Its shape was sharply defined since it appeared to be quite large, and was brightly lit with a yellowish white light. I asked her to extend her arm in front of her and move her thumb and forefinger apart to the approximate size of the object as it appeared from her viewpoint. She indicated a distance of about two and a half inches between thumb and forefinger. She further stated that the object was uniformly lighted, did not cast any discernible light on the wooded area below, and did not appear to have windows or other surface features.. She described the object as a modified egg shape. The small end was pointing toward the direction of travel. The bottom side was less angular in comparison to the top, and the rear was more square than round. The object emitted no audible sound and its direction and speed were uniform. Initially the object appeared over the tree line. It traveled slowly west to east at a downward trajectory of about 20 degrees; almost as if on a landing approach. As its altitude decreased, the tree line began to increasingly interfere with her view until the object was no longer visible. The object was observed for a total of about five minutes. We live in a more rural part of Vestal and there is very little man made ambient light. The sky was clear with no moon at the time of viewing, and sunrise was three hours away. The next day, out of curiosity, I called the Vestal police department and inquired if there had been any reports of UFOs, lights in the sky, etc., and the person I was talking to said he was not aware of any such reports.

I stopped for Sonic to eat before work. I live very close to the back side of the locale air port and 4 surrounding Military bases. I say this because I see lots of aircraft in the air at all times. I was in the drive up and I saw a strange pattern of lights on a plane or what looked to be a plane banking to the left to turn, but the object never turned and the light pattern never changed. I then saw a state police helicopter go in the same direction. I thought nothing of it at the time. I paid for my meal at the window and started driving to the base I currently work at as a Computer Systems administrator. I'm maybe a mile up the road still in town and I see the same object, flying very close to a residential area well under 300 feet in the air. I thought for a plane that’s close I sure don’t here any noise coming from it, so I rolled down my window and sure thing it did not make one sound. It soon dropped off of my vision and I keep driving. The road I’m on comes to a 4 way stop and is just off the back side of a locale air port and I see the same object coming from the direction of the air port and thought for sure this pilot must be trying to land or is having problems. I make my left hand turn at the 4 way stop and then a right on to the highway. The object at that time has stop in mid air just of the right of the highway I'm driving on. I'm coming up to the object and I see a row of well yellow lit windows so bright you can’t make out the inside compartment. But not a blinding eliminating light just well lit and yellow in color. I’m driving at about 30mph now and the object is to my right and I can see the underbelly it had green strips of lights all over the undercarriage of the craft and the body of the craft was black and blended in with the night sky so well I really could not make out the shape or even the hole size of the craft. It was very well triangle shape from the way the green lights were lade out on the bottom of the craft and! I rolle d down my window again and heard not one sound. At this time a second car had pulled over to the side of the road and started flashing its light and the object with out banking in any direction to the left or right to turn seemed to go back in the direction it came from towards the airport. I speed to the nearest cross section to make a u-turn and race to the airport with the object still in sight. I have to stop at a stop light and lose the object behind a set of buildings that a recently gone up in the last two or so years. Its very bright over buy the buildings as if the craft was hiding but the buildings are on a gated road I don’t have access to and I can' see the craft anymore. I'm leaving back towards work and I'm looking at the new buildings that I have never seen before and it seems there is a private run way and some indicator lights lighting up a run way path I've never seen before. And there seem to be an airplane hanger right behind this new building that’s just off the main run way to the locale airport, where I think this object my have landed and possibly if it was not a true UFO may have been stored away. Any way I tried to Google maps the location of the building and it seems they are brushed out of the picture or were not built when the photo was taken. I saw this craft up-close and for a very long time, I'm more then sure I'm not the only one in the area as it was flying very close to the ground and very slowly no aircraft other then a helicopter could have pulled off the speeds but not the maneuvers. I wish I would have had my camera to take photos. It was not any aircraft I have ever seen nor was it your typical UFO sighting as the object did not glow did not have over powering bright lights or laser beams. On the ride out to the baseI work at I saw what seemed to be more aircraft all NONUFO and very identifiable in the sky then I've seen in a long time it was as if they were looking for some thing.

As I watched it, it was in the sky at about 80 degrees from the horizon, and was traveling from North to South. Its flight was more like a glide, very smooth. It was different from the way planes and jets move through the sky. And while ""glide"" seems to be a bit inadequate, I am not sure how else to describe its motion other than with that word. After a minute and a half or so, 2 other objects joined it in flight...they had the same blue glow. All continued to head South. From my vantage point, I could not really tell if they were in any kind of flight formation or not. One thing that struck me was the flight path. Usually when I notice planes going overhead, they tend to follow the curve of the Earth, getting closer to the horizon as they move further away. These 3 objects did not seem to do that. As they proceeded South, they did not get lower on the horizon, but continued into the darkness of the sky, like they were going away from Earth.

It was not an aircraft of any conventional make that i have ever seen. I didnt notice any windows (perhaps because of the glare).

I was standing in my backyard having a smoke at roughly 21:20:00 on November 7th, 2008 when the sighting occurred.  It was a very clear night – I cannot remember the moon’s status but it was nowhere near the anomaly.  While looking to the north I saw what could best be described as a “flash ball”, or like that of a striking match head (completely white or VERY light yellow in color), streak across the sky above my apartment building.  I would have immediately felt fortunate to witness a shooting star or meteor but after traveling about 200-300ft it sharply veered off at an angle – basically flying slightly up and towards the left an additional 75-100ft before the fireball immediately disappeared.  The “flash ball” lasted 3-5 seconds and completed the described path in as much time.  It created a trail of smoke or exhaust that drew its path in the sky - yet this smoke was only visible in the light of the fireball.  I thought that I could make out a dark shape that continued along the same trajectory as the fireball vanished, but much faster – but in all objective honesty my brain could very well have just assumed a continuation of movement.  The whole event was over in seconds.  It appeared to be very low altitude, I think too low for a shooting star or comet/meteor.   I estimate it was only 350 to 500 feet in the air.  Very low, and I could hear a noise – but it did not sound like a flare or firework, close as I can come to describing the noise is a short whistle or an oscillated beep.  The brevity of the experience makes description difficult, but it was like a noise my computer from the late 80s would make.  There is most likely a plausible explanation for this sighting - like a meteor hitting Wonder Woman’s invisible jet and bouncing off at the angle – but I felt like the maneuver would otherwise be unlikely for natural phenomenon.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,44.86216021505377,-68.83885806451613

Thinking it was kids scoping out the yard/house for something to steal I sent my rotti out who did not react at all. Then the one sweeping light became two that were perfectly parallel and coming forward towards the house. I then thought it was intentional, and having an X with a restraining order, I thought for a moment he had someone out there and ducked under a glass table, that’s when the two parallel lights, about 10 ft off the ground, moving towards the house, went from a pinpoint white light, to a yellow silver dollar sized light, and I said, “ nothing does that, nothing moves parallel like that and comes at you!” my friend ran out and said, “there is nothing behind it!” I think meaning a light source. Still, my dog who goes off at squirrels, was not at all alarmed, and h! e’s 70% blind. There was no sound.  But the two yellow lights came about 20 ft into my fence line, and when my friend got to where it was, it just stopped and was gone.  We got a mag light and looked behind the fence for footprints, but there were dead tree limbs I threw out a week ago, that obstructed the path and there were no broken limbs, even on dried, dead limbs.  There was no way for someone to stand near my fence and with the dramatic angle behind my house for someone to shine any light up my 20 degree angled yard without being at the fence line aiming up.    There was no sound and my dog never reacted as if anything was out there.

Noticed redish tint, then green and blue blink off to edge and red again with white intermitting.  Went into house for binoculars; using 7 x 35 mm wide angle lenses, the image popped immediately into a sphere covered with a network of lights that were ""chasing"" in patterns across the exterior of this perfectly-formed globe.  I couldn't even begin to guess size, thereby distance, but it seemed to hold quite still for periods of time and as I saw it float gently to north, staying ever to my west, I ran to street, calling everybody I could think of at a rather late hour for most of my friends.  I found one who lived to the west of me about an hour's drive, approximately 45 miles direct route. I kept her on phone for moral and mental support as I went back to house, got in car and drove to river, one block away, parked and turned off all lights to get clear view.  It was a very visible globe, confirming the viewing of earlier, red, green and blue lights chasing one another in blinking fashion, much like chasing christmas lights; only with a peculiar pattern.  The largest band of lights was around the center of sphere, and that was red, never changing but at times dimming to what appeared to be a muted tone; nearly black and white in color.  Then green would appear in 2-3 rows on the lower left quadrant and blue was blinking in ring above and below the red ring, with a smattering of colors continually blinking about this globe.  Imagine the framework of a geodesic dome that is a complete globe and the intersecting pieces of framework would be the positioning of the lights.  They always traveled in this perfect web of lights but not in a pattern that I would be able! to identify was anything beyond random, with the exception of the repeating of the red blaze from right to left from time to time.  That was dependably consistent.  It then moved from due west to southwest once again and seemed to move from that point south, and away.  Around 11:00 when I went back out to climb on roof to again search, I found absolutely no sign of it. I know what I saw; it appeared to be a hollow globe, the shape defined and formed by a network of connecting lights on a grid.  I'm not sure if the illumination showed interior of globe or exterior.  Too far away and binoculars showed clearly the shape and color but not depth or distance.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,30.140599999999996,-97.3275

(I wish upon this same star everynight after work so it is always in the same place in the sky, at this time of year)  I joked to my friend to look at the UFO in the sky and he looked up and stopped laughing at me. He saw the same bright white light that I did and we stopped walking and witnessed it “bounce” across the sky.  There was no flashing lights like a commercial aircraft, no sound and it was not moving in a straight line, but bobbing up and down as it moved away from us slowly like it was going up and down on waves in the sea. After about 30 seconds to a minute of observation, we witnessed it just fade away. I thought I noticed it dip slightly and turn further to the east just before it faded. My friend thought it was far away and moved at high speed away from us, and thought it was outside our atmosphere. I thought it was much lower in our atmosphere, maybe only 5,000 – 10,000 feet up, as I am an amateur Astronomer and have looked at the moon and comets through both binoculars and a small telescope and frequently lie back and watch planes go over head, I know how high a plane is when it is flying the North Atlantic great circle route probably 35,000 feet up, you have to tilt you head way back almost to lose your balance, this object was an easy glance up, maybe only 45 degrees up from the horizon. The sun was fully down, so I don’t expect this was a reflection, I have never observed anything like this in the daytime or nightime sky before, my friend guessed it might be a flare if it was as low as I thought, but it was not losing altitude, it was maintaining it’s forward speed and altitude like a powered craft would.

We watched it till it dissapeared farther into the west, then another object that looked like the same one reappeared quite aways behind and to the side of where that had dissapeared. Almost like it had jumped a far distance behind where we saw the first object dissapear at. That one soon was out of sight. It was probably 10-15 minutes after seeing that, and 2 objects appeared almost side by side, no jetstream, both were shiny, had seemed to appear out of nowhere and began moving further away from each other. One headed south and the other moved westward. There was no sound, no jetstream,they seemed to just pop up in sight out of nowhere and I couldn't tell you the exact speed, but they were moving pretty fast. I thought I noticed one speeding up at a good rate and another that just was kind of floating forward for a few seconds or so. I really wanted to try and notice altitude and speed change variation but it was really hard to tell. Both objects were extremely shiny bright. Metallic I would say. And, I don't see it everyday but every so often I'll notice something like this in the skies in my area. Interesting skies down here. Thank You.

It moved without making any noise towards the North, coming from the South, at about 5 degrees from the horizon for about 7-10 seconds. The light seemed smeared as if the sphere left a slight train of light. At the same time the neon light was not even (about 2/3 of its volume was constant and did not change, however, the remaining 1/3 throbbed). It was like a pulsing reflection inside its surface. The angular size of the body was equal to the size of a helicopter observed from a distance of 800 meters, as if it cabin is see-through and filled with soft neon light inside,I thought so the first 3-4 seconds. The sun had set so the flying object was easy to distinguish on the brown yellow haze above the sunset sun. Subconsciously I was looking for a wing or a screw at the back of it but there was nothing. The object was lowering slowly and I thought it would cross the line of the horizon so that it would see in front of the hills which are 15-20 kilometers away from where I was, and if this had happened I would have been able to approximate the distance between me and the object but this did not occur. Visibility was very high, there was no dust or smoke. I could clearly see the ridge of the mountain 50 km south from here. On that day the atmosphere was crystal clear after the rain from the previous day. The projection of the object’s trajectory made it look like it was going to lower enough for me to see the mountains behind it, but this never happened. It disappeared, with a small slur before that. Right before it disappeared I knew this was about to happen. As soon as I could not see it any longer I went upstairs to get a better view but the object had long gone. I also thought possible of the disc making a horizontal circle and me seeing the trajectory that was closest to me because before it disappeared, its light became a little dim. It is also possible that the object is very far – its speed was like a meteorite’s. Noiseless, quiet and very quick, but it flew almost horizontally above the set sun (with a small lowering to the South). However, it had nothing to do with a meteorite because the disc was very volumetric filled with soft bluish light with angular size of about ¼ or 1/5 of rising or setting full moon. Actually, the terrain of the mountain hills was the same – going lower from South to the North so it is possible that the object was following the terrain of the hills. I am describing everything that I had in my mind for these few seconds and I compared it to things that I have seen before like helicopters or meteorites but I know it was neither of those. The place where I was standing has coordinates S 43.09605 degrees, E 2566973 degrees which is East from the city of Veliko Tarnovo. The object was on the West from my location and was flying from the South towards the North. For the 7-10 seconds that I saw this object moving, it had travelled 5-10 angular degrees. I directed Skyscout towards the point of the trajectory of the object and it displayed SAO141665 and HIP 85365. After 2 days of reflecting, I now think that it is more possible that the sunset played a role, i.e. the object reflected the sunlight for a few seconds. The question is what this big object is. Maybe it was a USA bomber B1, (which is a disc) but I have never seen those in the sky. If it was a B1, then many people would know that.

While sitting at the lake edge, watching planes and satellites pass overhead, I had seen one shooting star earlier.  I was facing approximately SE and my brother was NE toward me.  A bright white light, coming from the north, first caught my attention out of my peripheral vision as it passed by, approximately straight out over the lake, or at about 12 o'clock.  It was at maybe 40 degrees above the horizon, or two to three times the height of the hills across the lake.  Initially I thought it was a meteor, as I saw two successive flashes, as sometimes meteors will do if they break up of “pop”. But then, as the light proceeded south at roughly the speed of a fast moving shooting star, it continued to pulse in a very constant and rhythmic manner: pulse-pulse...pause...pulse-pulse...pause...pulse-pulse, etc.  I called it to my brothers attention and finally got him to turn around and look to the south just in time to see it (thank you!). Total time of incident was about 10 seconds, and maybe 6-8 two-pulse sets.  The object went from about a 12 o'clock position to just above the southern horizon in that time.  There was no sound heard during or after.  Object appeared to be moving in a straight line; however, just before disappearing it seemed to wander some, erratically and laterally.  Upon thinking about this a bit, it seems likely that this apparent lateral movement was most likely a visual effect of now looking at the fast receding object straight from behind, and that its path was not perfectly straight.  The lateral movement was only a degree or two at most. I have been a practicing geologist of 30 years and my brother is a university professional.  In all my years of star gazing, I have never seen anything of this nature.  In my mind this was clearly not any type of natural phenomenon.  Impossible to be a satellite by nature of its extreme speed.  It left no visible ionized trail as a meteor does and the rhythmic pulsing was dead constant like a strobe.  Would it be possible for a meteor to skip across the outer atmosphere, like a skipping stone on a pond and cause the observed effect?  I think that the rhythmic pattern of flashes eliminates this possibility and it went too far and for too long.  I have no ready and reasonable explanation what we saw.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,42.7128,-74.9173

It remained stationary about 35 degrees above the horizon. I used an old navy trick to judge degrees by extending my arm, fingers closed and parallel to the horizon. It measured 3 and 1/2 hands above the horizon which is about 35 degrees. I could not judge the distance but its altitude was under 3,000 ft. because that was the ceiling and it was below the clouds. The object, as seen through the binoculars, was extremely bright with a soft blue light that seemed to cover the top; a pale red glow showed amidships and the bottom and sides were bright white. It was silent and stationary. It's shape could not be determined because the pulsating light was too bright. A few other cars pulled over because they too saw it.

I have seen many UFO’S in Yuma for quite sometime, and have been always disappointed because I never had a camera at hand until today during this sighting. I was able to instantly recognize that this was very similar if not exactly what I have seen in previous times in Yuma. They are major military bases in Yuma, and I truly believe that these bases DO withhold technology from which you will see in my video. I have seen events of the space shuttles zooming across the sky’s at night, if you have seen that happen then you can DEFINITELY compare how this event looked extremely similar. It was a bright white light that floated across the sky, catching my intention, enough to run inside and yell at my parents at the top of my lungs to come outside and witness this. I was so sure that this is what I have seen in the past multiple times, I even told them that this light would zoom away at thousands of miles an hour once it reaches the outside skirts of Yuma. This light did just that. My father said that that was the most significant part of this sighting, because I predicted or just pretty much knew it was going zoom out of sight at supersonic speeds. Earlier this year I sighted what had been supposedly the space shuttle “Discovery” or “Endeavor”. Our local Yuma Daily Sun news report gave approximate times for the sighting of the space station flying past, and me being a constant observer of our skies I had seen this space station one night thinking it was a UFO later to find out it was “Discovery” or “Endeavor” that was flying by. I saw this light two nights in a row. Both nights sighting were extremely similar to what you seen is this video I took that I am now reporting to you guys. The only difference being between this sighting and the “Discovery” or “Endeavor” sighting is this video is shot while the sky is lightly lit. The sun was up enough to see the sunset on the horizon. This UFO was bee-lining across the sky at a steady, slow , floating pace. It was about 30 seconds later after this video ended, due to lack of memory on the camera, that the light zoom off at supersonic speeds right as it reached the outskirts of Yuma County. While I was shooting the video I was stating that the flashing red light was “BELOW”  white light. It “WAS” below the white light just before I shot the video. I did not realize the flashing red light from the plane had been coming toward us almost directly and had risen above the white light which you see in the video. The only conclusion I can get out of that is either this white light was below this plane and the plane gained altitude, or this white light is just outside the atmosphere and created an optical illusion even to myself. So the white light can appear to an observer to either be below the atmosphere in the skies of Yuma County or it was moving at incredible rates outside the atmosphere and floated across the sky very similar to that of the satellite. So let’s say if this object was in space then it being its size and the brightness of it, this object must be gigantic enough to reflect the sun’s light off it to appear so large. So one way or another the size of this thing is massive , and you can compare it to the plane flying past. Because the plane was flying by is going to make it much easier for you guys to study the size of this object and the direction its going. And myself living in Yuma since day one, and can bet my bottom dollar that the flashing red light was from a Jumbo Commercial Airliner, no doubt in my mind, that plane is heading right for California. The fence you see in my back yard it going parallel with North and South. The airliner is heading west. The light is Heading NW from what I observed. Let me make this very Clear. This Object did not have supersonic speed until it reached the outskirts of Yuma. AS SOON AS IT DID it zoomed up to supersonic speeds and the lightly gradually at a somewhat fast pace got smaller and kind of dimmed smaller and smaller. A satellites light doesn’t even dim out like that. Satelites that I have seen in our skies did not move at same high speeds as this. Had the white light actually be in space. If it were then this white light would beat any satellite up there in a race hands down. And that was when the white light was just floating across the Yuma sky, so theres no telling just how fast this white light took off at the end of its descent. I watched this white light come across the sky from the deep south of Yuma, and I could bet my bottom dollar it was in Mexico’s air space before it reached Yuma. Do our space shuttles travel from South to North? From what I understand they do not. I would love it if you guys could get back to me and let me know what you guys think of this and if this helps you with your research. Thank for taking the time to read this. Thanks a billion!",2009-03-19T00:00:00,32.7038626459144,-114.59088443579766

I'm a 31 year old Art Director with a wife and child. I was outside around 6:30-7:00pm on Friday after work playing with my dog, and b/c I live 5 minutes from the airport I happened to be looking up at all the airplanes in the sky. I noted just before the incident about what a clear night it was and how you could see almost all the stars. As I watched one plane that happened to be pretty low probably having just taken off and banking in a southern direction; going just under my clear view of a very bright Venus; I looked down at my dog. When I looked back up to find the plane to see which direction it was heading in, I noticed a single white light moving from the south to the north. It struck me as odd b/c I could see about 7 planes in the sky at one time from my vantage point and I noticed that all the planes in the sky had at a minimum of 2-4 lights on, and at least 1-2 flashing lights. I watched the single white light move north at a somewhat medium pace, wasn't fast, wasn't slow. As it got closer the single light started to turn pink, then changed to red then completely faded out. After I saw that I assumed that the object, presumably a plane, probably banked to the side and the light was hidden by a wing. So I sat outside for 10 minutes and watched the sky in the general area where the object was heading. I never saw a light appear in the area. I still saw several planes in the area, all with multiple light, and flashing lights. I also remembered to recheck the sky conditions for possible clouds... not a single cloud in the sky. I'm a natural born skeptic, so this is strange for me. I was so baffled by this, that I told my wife and of course she laughed and told me I was crazy.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,37.76999211048627,-122.42539404565002

Looked directly up and saw three spheres of light sort of clustered together. The bottom two spheres were soft whitish in color. Not really a glowing. Different from any other aircraft that I have seen in the night. The third light/sphere was situated above the other two spheres sort of in a ""club"" like formation. The sphere was approximatly 1/3rd smaller than the other two directly below it. The light color was a faint yellowish maybe kind of orange light. Movement was silent and moderate, but detectible by my senses. The altitude I estimated at approximately 200 to 250 ft. With my past military experience I would say this craft traveling at this low altitude is undetectible by radar. this instantly raced through my mind. I dont know why. The total approximate view time was approximately 10 to 12 seconds. It seemed much longer. I did a post mock-up this morning. Positioning myself and timing approximate viewing time. Not more than twelve seconds. The craft was moving in a northeasterly direction. Speed was approximately 300 ft per second. While viewing. At approximatly the 7th second. [Estimated on my post mock-up also]. The two lower light spheres suddenly turned off. Leaving the third smaller faintish yellowish light sphere. Still travelling at the same rate but, getting fainter losing light and shape, then totaly vanishing. I was'nt scared or startled. Just marveled,concerned, and sort of disturbed. As I feel presently. Finally. I have experienced seeing moving lights on different occasions. I always figured they have to do with the nearby airport and airbase. My experience last night was real and vivad. Recordable.

Here are the event details:  my husband and teenage daughter went out to run some errands.  I’m not exactly sure what time it was when he called me to see if I could see it from our house.  Indeed I could.  I studied it for a moment and concluded that it was not an airplane; I am familiar with the light patterns of airplanes, and this craft was flashing red, yellow, green and blue and seemed to be hovering in the night sky.  I grabbed my digital camera and took some pictures.  Looking at the craft with the naked eye, there were no “tails”, however, the “tails” were captured using the camera.  I then proceeded to use my digital camera to record a video of the craft.  In the video, we could see the movement: back and forth, up and down, and side to side, with no regular pattern.  My husband proceeded to tell me on the phone that he and our daughter were trying to drive to the craft’s location, but every time they got close, the craft would shoot to another location within view.  Duration of sighting was at least two hours.  Only one craft was sighted, its shape was hard to determine due to the distance, but seemed to be a bright light (extremely bright) with flashing red, yellow, green, and blue colors.  Its motion was sporadic at times, but seemed to hover in the same general area in the sky.  The weather conditions were as follows: very cold (approximately -20o) with clear skies.  It was evening (after 6 pm Central time).  The next day, January 16, 2009, a relative from Mason City, Iowa called to say that their family of three also saw the object in the sky (I posted the video on the internet and sent them pictures as well).  Our teenage daughter also captured some pictures with her digital camera, showing more erratic movement and green “tails”.  Distance was very hard to determine since the movement was not visible with the naked eye.  I was standing at my patio doors, filming above my h! ead slig htly.

There was a pack of 18 wheelers 1/4 mile in front of me and a group of about 15 cars 1/2 mile behind me. I looked up and saw something out of the ordinary. On I-95 there are towers with red flashing lights and are triangular in shape. The object I saw was very similar but had to have been at least 300 yards long. The object was about 50 feet high give or take. The whole object was straight and flat, there were no curves of any sort. It was shaped like a wedge with 4 lights on each side and 3 in the back all evenly spaced and rectangular in shape. Also there were lights in the top but they were only turning on and off. The lights on the corners wrapped around both sides. All the lights were red. The lights on the bottom were pulsating from dim to bright and the lights on the top were turning on and off all at the same time. The side walls of this object seemed to be metal.

I dismissed it as nothing out of the ordinary, figuring it was possibly the planet Venus. I returned to my activities on the computer but I started thinking about the light and realized that I had never observed Venus in that position in the sky nor had I ever seen a star or planet either as bright or as big.  After having pointed out the object to my brother I returned to my room, turned off the light, noted the time (20:46) and started watching the ball of light. It seemed to remain stationary but after a little while I thought I saw it move. To confirm that it was indeed moving I rested my chin on the window sill, braced my head with my hands and kept one edge of the window in my peripheral sight to provide a reference point. This is what I observed: 1: The intensity of the light changed, it would go from rather bright to fairly dim. The duration and brightness seemed quite random. 2: There appeared to be a background shape but I could not distinguish an exact form. 3: The light pulsed or throbbed red. The duration and brightness of the pulse was somewhat variable. It had a rise, peak and fall unlike an airplane strobe. 4: The light moved. It was moving westward (away from me) very slowly the whole time I watched, at times it would stop and stay in position and then in a very fluid but quick motion go either south or north a little ways and then either remain motionless in its new position or resume movement west. 5: I saw three airplanes at different times coming from different directions and altitudes but they all were heading in general direction of the light. 6: Toward the end of the time of my observation the light was pretty far away but it seemed to separate into three different points of light and then join back up into one several times.  The time I spent intently watching this was just over 45 minutes, but starting from when I first spotted the light it was in the sky for over an hour.  Two side notes, the first one, This isn't the first time my brother and I have observed strange lights in the skies over Gladwin, if anyone in the central Michigan area has seen any UAP or UAVs please report it here. Second, If you watch the skies remember to keep camera batteries charged or fresh ones handy. My camera was on the same window sill that I was watching from but the battery was dead and I didn't want to break away to get the charger, if I had my camera I could have got some good shots with its 10x zoom and probally some good video due to how long the light was in the sky.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,44.0747,-84.4347

As the smaller red light dropped away, the white light disappeared, but for a few seconds both the white light above and the red light dropping away were visible.

Maybe pilot reported. I am reporting this the day after the event. I was at a wedding last night and I went outside to smoke. I was with the security guard and we both witnessed what I would describe as a classic foo fighter. We both saw a small, simple, and typical private propellar plane being flanked by an orb that was definitely following it. It was on the left side of the plane and maybe fifty feet lower but moving at the same pace, as if observing the plane. It was glowing in a red-orange way but was not blinking. It kept following the plane over the horizon and then we lost sight of it. Intersetingly, a few minutes later a plane was in the same exact location (following the shoreline) was moving east (the opposite direction of the plane before). Possibly this story could be linked to a sighting given by the actual pilot. It is possible that the pilot was so spooked by the follower that the pilot went back to base. I am not really sure how I would verify it but if anyone knows I would suggest they check the exact time I have given and as a lead the plane might have came out of John Wayne Airport. As a side note, the security officer who watched the event with me, who works these by the beach weddings all the time, was not as excited as I was. I don't know the date, but he claimed that one evening, at about 9:30pm, the whole wedding party stopped and stared, including the live musicians, and watched a very strange object move through the sky that looked like a fish swimming. He said that this encounter was much more of an unexplainable experience. Personally, I have a lot more respect for people that claim to see really strange things, be they UFOs of ghosts, etc. I have no idea what I saw but I was really in a way feel blessed to have seen something so unexplainable in an age where things in general have mostly been explained. A side note: Of course no one at the wedding believed a bit of my story,even though I had a witness. They all assumed that I drank to much, but I was part of the entertainment and was sober at the time, as I can at best say about the security guard. I really have sympathy now with those that experience something bizzare yet get disfranchised mentally for reporting it. This is not the first time I have seen a UFO. Somehow I feel that this makes this story lose credence, but I am honest about everything. In 1993,I witnessed the ""Vulkin Crusier"". Sorry if I didn't spell it right but I don't follow Star Trek. It was the exact UFO that was seen in Belgium. I watched it with a witness for five minutes, and it was huge! I have seen stealth bombers while going through the desert and I was definitely way larger. It never did any strange manuvers, it just moved in a straight line though it was strange to watch as it slightly moved left to right as it glided by. It was pure gray, had three red lights on each corner that did not flash, and one additional red light on the center that also did not flash. There was no way it was a plane. It was way larger and it also made no sound. It eventually disappeared over a hill so I never saw a disappearance. Was it alien? Was it military? I have no idea. All I can do is report this as more UFO heresay.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,33.45240084388186,-117.6169088607595

Whitness had stepped out to put dogs out and was struck by appearance of rotating multicolored light. Object description - multi-colored light - white, green, and red, alternating – seemingly rotating over by Double Bluff area of Whidbey Island, WA. The object was probably a few thousand feet altitude. The light had shape, was not point source and the colors were not fixed position – either alternating position or rotating and encompassing a large portion of the object – the rest of the object maintaining a bright white light. From my house just across the Puget Sound in North Edmonds and without visual obstruction the light looked larger than an aircraft. The light moved East and North passing over a tower with a red beacon on the hill, traveling level and seemingly very slowly. After it was several miles North and East of the tower it turned East out over the Puget Sound and headed North towards Everett, seeming to fly over the middle of the sound. There was no noise detected and no other aircraft in the air at that time. The duration was between 5 and 8 minutes. As it moved far enough to be out of view to the North, another similar light appeared in the same location, maybe slightly to the East of the original position of the first object at approximately 5:53 PM. The second moved very slowly over the tower and towards the East, but before it got to the Puget Sound, it began gaining altitude. It picked up speed as it started upward, but the disappearance took several minutes. As the size decreased due to the distance, you could still detect the rotational aspect of the lighting. When it became a point of changing color, it was noted that there was at least one other object up near the one under observation, a little to the east and lower. It also displayed the same alternating color with predominant white light around it. These lights became discernable after a minute or two.

She and the ones she was with saw the same object as it seemmed minutes before I did. It is a very lucky situationthat we may have seen the same thing, but she claims to have seen the same thing. Dana Point is just north of the city of San Clemente, and as the object was moving along the coast, I surmise that she saw it a few minutes before I did. That would make the total of people that saw this at least five. Most interesting is the security guard I witnessed the UFO with (I saw this at a wedding reception where he works) and he said that he had seen stranger one night in the past. I was at Ole Hanson in San Clemente. It is an older place that offers a place for weddings and has a pool for public swimming. Anyways, he told me that during one wedding reception everything stopped, including the music, because in the sky there was something he described as an organic, moving like a fish swimming, object that moved across the sky. He said that was much wilder than what we shared. So, I know this is not the best encounter, but I hope you mention it as maybe others have seen both my experience and the one the security guard did in the past.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,33.45240084388186,-117.6169088607595

I at first thought it was a plane but then the object stopped in mid-air, hovering. It had at least 3 bright white lights on it, and 1 red blinking light (thus I thought it to be a commercial plane at first). The shape of it seemed to be pretty thin, shaped kind of like a saucer. It looked to me like it had a flat top and the edges came out at slight diaganols pointing towards the ground. I was not able to get a very good look for long because I was driving and was literally just about at my exit, though I did brake to slow down and get a longer look.

The light was as magnificent without the binoculars as it was with. Brighter than any star and certainly not a plane. I watched this pulse and orange to red glow for a good hour. I changed vantage points so that I could balance the binoculars on something solid to reduce the shaking. At this point it was a lot easier to see. Bright pulsing orange fading into red. Then it suddenly turned greenish/blue and faded out. There were no clouds or trees or any obstructions to accomplish this. It seemed to distinguish itself or disappear.

I went outside at 3 PM and immediately noticed the unusual low flight of what appeared to be a small military fighter jet. (This was unusual because of the low altitude over a residential area and the fact that not many military aircraft are ever seen in the area). The jet appeared to be circling the area instead of just passing through. I continued to see many low flying aircraft flying low in the area which were likely military aircraft as well, as they appeared to be very large turboprop aircraft and one large helicopter. Around 5 PM, a large orange/white plane that appeared to be a Coast Guard twin engine turboprop aircraft flew directly overhead. (The first that I have ever seen in the area). At 5:22 PM, a stationary object was observed to the West/Southwest about 60 degrees above the horizon. The stationary object could best be described as appearing star-like to the naked eye except that it was too bright and in the wrong part of the sky to be Saturn or Venus, which were not visible at this time. Already having binoculars in hand due to the ""air show"" that had been taking place for the past two hours, I took a better look at the stationary ""star-like"" object that looked very unusual and bright to be a star, and appeared to reflecting the sun. Immediately upon looking at the object with binoculars, it was apparent that the object was not a star, planet, or a moving object. The stationary object was totally dark or gray on top and extremely brilliant like the sun only on the very bottom underside of the object. The object appeared to be round. Thinking the only ""logical"" explanation for the object might be that it was a balloon sitting still with the setting sun reflecting off it's underside, I decided to watch the object to see if I could tell if it drifted any like a balloon. I braced my elbows on top of the frame of a patio swing to ensure I had a stable view of the object. After locking down my binoculars on the object for about ten seconds, the object shot off due South barely visible due to the high speed of it's acceleration. This makes over a dozen unusual ""sightings"" that I have personally observed in the Westlake, Louisiana area in the past six months.

Within Google Earth the location of the object was ( 47°25'21.60""N, 82°49'55.44""W) and the area from which I was watching was roughly  (47°32'9.03""N,  82°50'28.40""W)  I had decided to take a walk to the shoreline to get out of the treeline and get a good look at the stars because there were so many that it amazed me. Well on this night I noticed directly across the lake, there was a star that was as bright as the Northern Star. The difference was the fact that this star was sitting just above the tree line.  I observed it for awhile and asked my uncle to come look at it because I have never seen a star sit that low in my life. He came and looked and agreed that it was strange. We both tried to rule out a radio tower because the light in the center remained white, but out of nowhere there was this red light that seemed to circulate around the white and almost seemed like the colors blended together.  I thought at one point that I saw smaller little balls come out of it, but I couldn't be sure from the distance I was away from it.  We stood and continued to watch the colors like a light show and then all of a sudden there was a quick burst of white lights, as if the object swelled in size and then went back to the same state again. My uncle asked me if I had seen that and I said yes. The flash of white light reminded me of the sensation of a bolt of lightning. He was weirded out and went back to the camper. I continued to watch in amazement and then all of a sudden I saw the object move. I called my uncle to come back and watch to make sure my eyes were not playing tricks on me because I was watching for awhile. When he came back to see, the object moved again. We both decided that ruled out the possibility of it being a radio tower. I continued to watch. The first movement was from left to right at a slanted invert, maybe 35 degrees. Then the object came back on the same path to it's original position. It then went from the left to the right again in a direct line and then make a movement in the shape of and N. I do not know of any Aircraft that can move in that way.  The object did go back to it's position and remained there for a few minutes and my uncle left again. I had a big flashlight that shone a ways out and decided to try and flash towards the object in a signal fashion (On and Off and On and Off). I noticed that when I did this, the object would start to move again. The best way I could describe the patterns of movement was in the fashion of a diagnostic, but It would always return to the original position it started out from. I then decided to shut the generator off to kill all the lights at our campsite and get an even better view, seeing as I was the only one still up at this point. The part that made me a little nervous was the fact that within 30 seconds of turning off the generator and all of the lights, the object started one last motion from left to right, in an upwards direction of about 35 degrees again just like the first motion I had seen, it then disappeared in the blink of an eye. At this point I figured I should go to bed and that's what I did. Now it got a little bit stranger from here.... I was sleeping in the cab of the truck, in the back seat. The truck has slightly slanted windows so you can see the sky when you lay down. As soon as I laid down and noticed the stars directly above me, I noticed one of the stars moving. This star was just a white light and not as bright as the one I watched from across the lake. This star did follow similar patterns, but the movement reminded me of how a Water-Spider moves on the water. I really didn't know what to think at this point. The only conclusion that I could draw from the second object I saw was the possibility of it being a GPS Satellite, but I'm not sure what movement patterns they would use or whether you can see a GPS satellite in Space?  I did watch the first object for almost an hour before it left and then laid in the truck and watched the second object for over an hour before I got out of the truck and went to the lake again to see if the first object came back. The first object never did come back. When I got back to the truck the second object was still directly above the truck and continued to move in random patterns until I eventually fell asleep. The second object I do question was it was because it remained but the major differences between the two was the fact that the second object I observed was outside Earth's atmosphere and the first object was definitely within Earth's atmosphere. I'd say only several hundred feet off the ground. The next night was my final night at the lake and unfortunately I was unable to follow up to see if either objects we're back or still there because a storm front came in and the entire sky was overcast with clouds. I guess I will be haunted for the rest of my days with not knowing what I really saw, seeing as I didn't make out a specific craft or anything that would allow me to identify either of the objects. I'm not forcing anyone to believe me, but I know what I saw and that's good enough for me due to the fact that I now have no doubt in my mind that there is intelligent life out there or man has created something that is truly amazing and that should be shared with the rest of the world. Either way, I felt I should share my experience and I hope this may get other people that will be in the area to keep there eyes towards the skies at night because it was confirmation that I've waited my whole life to see and be able to put all doubt outside of my mind.  I thank you for taking the time to read this and sharing my experience with me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The sky was hazy and only 2 bright stars were visible. I saw a light moving rapidly and silently from east to west. It appeared at first to be a very bright satellite but they usually travel north and south so that is one reason this caught my attention. It was moving fast and was about the same size and brightness of the two stationary stars. About the time it was directly overhead and forming an obtuse triangle with the stationary stars it came to a complete and instant stop. Now I was really interested because that seemed impossible to me. Next it started to move west again and very slowly. Then stopped and came back east and then turned north and took off so fast I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It stopped and came back south. It reminded me of a humming bird the change in direction was so quick and effortless. It seemed very high in the sky and that is why at first I thought it was a satellite or some very fast and high airplane. If this is something the government (ours or someone else) is doing then there are flying capabilities way beyond what the public know about. I am a pilot and have flown for many years so I am used to looking at flying aircraft and tracking them. This was not an airplane. Maybe a small helicopter flying at a lower altitude but in that case it was silent and I don't see how it could have traveled across the sky so quickly since there is a limit to how fast a helicopter can travel (~200mph).,2009-12-12T00:00:00,42.5103,-84.6637

It was so strange and scary I didn't know what to do so I called the news no answer I called the Air Force they said it was nothing but yet 2 minutes later 2 jets flew over. I was pregnant at the time and you hear so many stories I was afraid that maybe they were here for the baby. I stayed up all night alerted by every sound not knowing what it was. By the morning no news of any sightings were on any news channels. I did not go to work because I started having light contractions. Me and my children were the only ones out there and the next day I gave birth I was still worried about so called abductions when I was sent back to my room my baby wasn't with ne I started to panic and asked the nurse said the doctor would come talk to me. I was terrified not knowing until I asked to see my baby he was in ccu he had a few medical issues water in the lungs and would need to stay a few days. I always wondered if it was because of that night. My kids tease my son that he is an alien baby or we call them our friends now. Tonight my dog made a weird noise that made me look out the window and the object is up there I went outside to get a closer look because it had moved to fast and it was gone. I still see some flashing lights up in the sky and wonder if it's the same object. It looks like a sphere flashing red lights with white like whe a firework is set off and it spins. I know that there are lots of weird things but this time I don't know I wish someone else shared the same sighting.

I and four of my family members were sitting in the back yard talking, when something caught our attention through the trees.   Our home is more or less in the country, so we do see many stars but this particular object sat directly between a group of trees.   We discounted this as an airplane due to the fact that there is a small rural airport and of course the Air Force base.   A moment or two past and we noticed that the object did not indeed move but seemed to be getting a tad larger and was a glowing orange.   At that point, we all began to watch the object for the next four or five minutes.  At that time, the object began to slowly move northeast.   It crept along with our line of sight through the trees until we were in the open field section of our acreage, where it zipped through the sky and disappeared.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,,

On Saturday morning, January 17, 2009 I was leaving my house to go to work at 6:25 am.  I backed the SUV out of the garage and once I was in the street, facing Northwest, I immediately noticed a large bright yellowish white ball of light in the sky low on the horizon.  I had absolutely no clue what it could have been, but I wondered if it was a plane on fire or maybe a large plane with its headlights pointed toward me since my subdivision is on a flight path to and from Cincinnati Northern Kentucky airport.  I pulled up to the stop sign at the end of my street watching it and soon realized it was getting closer and flying toward the southeast at the back of my subdivision.  I turned left and stopped at the next stop sign and looked to my right and realized it was still flying low and moving very slowly.  I turned left and headed to the end of the street to exit my subdivision so I was driving Southeast too and could still see the light out my driver side window.  It was now to my left.  I hurried up and turned left onto State Route 48 to see if I could intercept it, and now I could see that the object was no longer a single large bright light but actually a solid object with multiple lights on it, and that it was flying very slowly, maybe only about 20 or 30 mph!  It was coming toward me now so I stopped the truck and put my window down to get a better view of it.  I couldn’t believe how close it was to the trees that are about 30 feet tall.  It was probably only 25 or 50 feet above the trees.  I watched as it approached me and it had several bright white lights across the front of it.  I opened the door and stepped out of my vehicle but stood right there, and I could hear this sound coming from it that I’m finding hard to describe.  Sort of like the sound of a jet engine with the volume turned way down, and this thing flew over me so slowly that I could now see that it was shaped like a triangle but with rounded edges, and was about the twice the size of my SUV.  There were no wings and! it had several white lights on the bottom and on the corners of it.  I saw a car coming up the street behind me so I hopped back in and put it in drive and tried to keep it in my view but was unable to.  I didn’t think to use my cell phone to take pictures of it!  I searched the Internet hoping to find something similar and I am uploading the two photos I found that are VERY similar to what I saw.  The first picture is the bright light off in the distance, and the second picture is one of a triangle but the one I saw had more lights under it.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,39.2689,-84.2638

It is a very bright, deep red light that does not strobe or blink in any way. Recently at 4:30 AM 01/17/09 I noticed my wireless internet abruptly cut out, and I went to the window to see if it was there, and sure enough it was.  This frightened me somewhat, being as that it keeps coming back, and this time it seemed to directly contact me in getting my attention by knocking out my wireless internet so that I would come to the window.  It was less than 100 yards from my house, and I know this because my road curves at around 100 yards, and it was clearly In front of a driveway no more than 100 yards away because the road curves there.  Clearly it was at eye level also because it was clearly a driveway. The past two times I have seen this bright red light it has stayed completely stationary.  The first time (around 01/09-13/09) it disappeared when a car was starting to come around the bend 100 yards down the street where it curves.  It simply just vanished instantly, like at the speed of light.  Absolutely NO FADE OUT.  The second time, it was like it directly contacted me and got my attention, knocking out my wireless internet!  I feel like I somehow knew it was there so I went to my window and sure enough, there it was, in the EXACT SAME SPOT as a few days ago.  It started to make me somewhat scared so as I was looking at the bright red object I simply told it  “You are kind of scaring me a bit, you know...”  So after observing it for about 30 seconds, Within 2 or 3 seconds of saying what I said looking directly at it, it disappeared!  It’s as if it was being considerate, and obviously showing signs of intelligence???  I live on a very suburban dark street with minimal street lighting and lots of retired folk, and almost everyone is in bed on my street at 4:30 AM I would assume except me because I am a college student still living with parents.  From now on I am going to keep my powerful Panasonic 10mp camera with me at all times if I am up early in the morning so hopefully I can get pictures of whatever this is… I have a feeling many others have seen what I am seeing, especially the Puget sound case in 2007, but not nearly this close… It is as if it is trying to make contact with me.  Hopefully from now on If it comes back I will be able to take high quality pictures and re post with an update.

As one who has always been a sky watcher, and who takes photos daily & nightly, I know what I am seeing.    These objects are at lower altitude than a planet, or star, and block our view of these natural objects. I've been watching & photographing them for months. Description:   The SW object changes shapes which can be seen visually, and the lights appear to change colors.  It also seems to react to being photographed with more light pulses, brightening.  The object in front of Sirius shows the same characteristics. Both followed the natural path of Venus and Sirius across the night time sky.  If you get a camera on them, they are no further up than the usual low altitude UFO's that glide above many of our neighborhoods at night.   I would estimate the faux Venus object to be about 1 mile up, at most.  The faux Sirius object is probably 1 1/2 to 2 miles up, judging by it's size when video'd. This west side of Houston is a little known hot spot, with activity most days & nights when the weather is good.

Date & time:	18 January 2009 at 00.00 hours GMT-2 Vessel:		Yacht - Kiwi Time, a 37 foot steel sloop with 3 aboard. Position:	17°16´N, 44°W (mid-Atlantic) Heading:	278° Weather:	Partly cloudy (+/- 25%), before moonrise (in the SE). Notes:		Navigation lights were off because there was no other shipping. Report: I had just been relieved on watch and saw what I initially thought to be lightning contained within a small orb shaped cumulus cloud, approximately 5 nautical miles to the NNW. After 5-10 seconds I realized that it was not lightning because 1.  it did not appear to be a rain cloud, 2.  there was no arcing, 3.  the light reverberated, unlike lightning which flashes intermittently, and 4.  the sky around the cloud and adjacent clouds were not lit or affected in any way. As the reverberating light in the cloud began to fade, a brightly lit craft emerged out of the eastern side of the cloud, accelerating slowly. The craft was undoubtedly the source of the light in the cloud, although now the craft emitted a constant, very bright, slightly bluish light. The craft was cigar shape from my perspective, therefore possibly circular. It was estimated to be 2-3 times longer than a 747 but, due to the distance and intensity of the light, I could see no markings. After 5-10 seconds I saw a 2nd, identical craft approximately half a nautical mile to the east of the 1st craft. The 2nd craft was traveling slowly westward, i.e. towards the 1st craft. The 2nd craft seemed to appear suddenly, as if it had “switched on”, or it is possible that the 2nd craft had emerged from an adjacent cumulus cloud, but no light was seen within the cloud beforehand. At about the same time, or a few seconds later, I saw a 3rd similar craft slightly further north than the 1st and 2nd. This craft was much dimmer than the 2 others. It was not a reflection on a cloud, as it was in open night sky. The three craft accelerated together towards the northeast, slightly gaining altitude before disappearing behind a large bank of cloud. After several minutes observation they did not reappear from behind the bank of cloud. These craft were definitely not aircraft, balloons or ordnance. At one stage it was thought possible that the 1st craft may have been a rocket from Cape Canaveral on a low trajectory from earth. But the appearance of a 2nd and 3rd craft, and the direction and distance of Florida, discount this suggestion. The person relieving me from watch admitted to seeing the reverberating light in the cloud, but not the craft (he was not wearing his spectacles).",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

I got my camera gear out and got it all set up so that I could be ready for anything. I sat down in my easy chair until it was time for the stars to start showing themselves to the world. One by one they appeared. If you are not fast while you are watching for the stars, they will sneak up on you. Looking at the First Quarter Moon that was to the south of my vantage point, there was a bright star/planet that showed up to the east of the moon, and just a little higher in the night sky compared to the moon. It was very bright and steady. I turned around only to find a brighter star/planet on the horizon where the sun had just set. When I turned back around, there was a second star even farther east of the star that was near the moon!  It too was bright. I started my scan around the heavens to see what was appearing and by the time I got back to the bright star/planet east of the moon, I noticed something very odd. The star/planet to the left of the one that was near the moon was now GONE. One minute it was there and the next minute it was gone. I know it was not a plane as it just sat there in one place when I first noticed it. As the evening progressed, I noticed two objects passing on by. One of them looked like it was headed towards LA and about a half hour later I saw one that was headed north away from LA. Ordinarily I would suspect that they were planes, but there were no strobes on these two objects that looked like stars passing in the night sky. Even though there was no strobe to them, I just noted them as planes. Same speed, no deviation whatsoever. It was about 8:30pm when I looked to the north and off the big dipper to the right, I noticed this light. This light started to get very bright and all of a sudden, I had surmised that this thing was coming right at me. It just kept on getting bigger and bigger. I turned around and grabbed my camcorder and stand as a complete unit, and when I turned back around, I had to say to myself, what is the use. It, by the time I turned around started to get smaller again. So I just stood there watching it as it eventually disappeared.  This object did not go up, go down, go from side to side or anything. It was as if there was a very high candle power light that was being turned up and then back off. This lasted for about 15 seconds.

I was working in my garage and was heading across the yard when I looked up to see what at first I thought was a really bright star. My daughter (16) and I stop to look at it when we realized it seemed to be moving. It was some distance off to the west and would only periodically move up and down and sometimes to the north. It would move in a sudden motion and stop as quick as it would start. At this point my wife and other two children came outside to look at it. The light would get extremely intense and fade sometimes turning an extremely bright green. This was much brighter than any landing light I have ever seen. At one point it seemed to move to the west at an extreme rate and disappeared in about 1 second. After about 30 seconds it reappeared even brighter than the first time and would occasionally seem to project a light straight forward. The characteristics were not that of a landing light or search light on an aircraft. There is a small airport near my home and I'm use to seeing landing lights on a daily basis. We watched this object come in and out of view several times over the course of 30 minutes and at no time did the maneuvers our intensity of the lights make any sense. I have never seen an aircraft that could maneuver in this fashion. If I had to guess at approximately where the object was I would have to say close to the T.V.A. coal power plant in New Johnsonville about 6-7 air miles from my house. The object left to the west and what seemed to be upward and then it was gone.,2009-01-10T00:00:00,36.0298,-87.8195

My Mother and I were just about to lay down on our pool deck for a cigarette and star gaze as we usually do after dinner.  As I lay down on my lawn chair (which are facing west) and looked up I saw an “unusual” object moving in the sky. The reason it caught my eye was because it was very bright but seemed to be very far away. The first thing I did was yell to my mom, “What the hell is that?” She looked up just before the object moved behind a small cloud. As it came out on the other side of the cloud it was no longer as bright as it appeared. It kept moving North (so as we lay there it look like it was moving left to right) just a little bit above Vega. After traveling for about 7 more seconds it slowly disappeared. At this point we thought that we were just looking at a satellite that, for some reason, appeared to very bright (a magnitude grater than -1) for those few seconds above us. To describe the type of light that it was giving off I used this analogy. When you are driving at night and cars are coming toward you, you notice that the head lights are sometimes a yellowish and on newer cars are more of a “neon white” if you will. The object in the sky looked more like the “neon white” headlights and the typical star and satellite look more like the yellowish headlights. Approximately two minuets later at 19:02 the same bright “neon white” object appeared right above us again, but his time was going the opposite direction so more towards the south west. It then looked to change its course again so now it was heading almost directly South. At this time my mom and I started to really question what we were seeing because satellites do not change their direction from heading north to heading south. As we watched the object  move “down” we kept saying to each other “what the hell is that?” it finally went out of sight. My mom told me that she was going to go get her binoculars, but I said, “screw that we needed a video camera, my phone (to know the time), and my journal (so I could write down what I was seeing while it was still fresh in my head), and a blanket. She was gone for about 5 minuets. As she was walking up the pool deck stairs, at about 19:08 now, she asked me if I had seen it again and just as she asked me that I was looking off into the western sky below Vega but above Hercules and saw a much dimmer object that looked more like a satellite but it would appear then disappear and it did this about 5 times before it did not reappear again. What was strange was the time intervals in-between the appearing and disappearing was not constant and the light was more of a reddish light not the same “neon white” as before. After watching this object and its many different behaviors, I can not say that it even remotely resembled anything that I have ever seen in our night sky before. It was not an airplane because airplanes stay on one direct path, it was not a satellite because however satellites do sometimes seem to be going in and out of vision, they do not change there apparent magnitudes as drastically as this object did. I think that it is also notable that from the time my mom and I were on our pool deck (19:00 to 21:00) we saw 4 big meteors and 1 huge meteor in which we could see smoke and debris on its tail. I am a college student here in Austin and spend a lot of time studying the sky and weather I believe this was an “alien space craft” or just an object that I myself could not identify, is in my opinion, irrelevant. But if there is a rational explanation for what my mom and I were seeing I would love to know.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

This morning was no different when I received a flat tired just a few hundred feet away from my office area, so it was not too bad. At the end of the working day which is normally 6pm but today I stayed behind to finish up a new user account creation at one of our client sites, for some reason it did not work whilst I was on the phone with the customer so I retried at 6:00pm and it worked and fired off an email from the new mail box which I accessed over outlook over web cc ing our support@ email address. Any way sorry but I'm tired and I'm taking the time to write this so any way I fetched my bike and to be totally honest I downloaded a number of mp3sand  put them on my mp3 player, I  unlocked my bike and started the 20/25minute walk home slowly with player on etc, nothing was really on my mind and I was just thinking about my outside of work endeveiours, I am successfully at a form of homework I do similar to trading. I reached the corner of what appears to be wordsworth gardens and felt a slight pain in my stomach (as if confronting some thing)and I looked directly to my left and saw a large ginger cat under the tree , I made eye contact and given I grew up with two cats and can make an excellent come here sound I attempted to beckon towards me the cat so I sort of sat down holding my bike up with my right arm (see image marked with x), the cat just stared at me and I got the general idea that he was not interested in moving his fat arse over to me for some affection which is fair enough. Ok so this is when I saw the object, when I got behind the second car in the picture walking along the normal path I take(normally on my bike on the actual road path not left foot path) I looked up and saw a sort of silver object, I very often do double check most objects as I was interested in ufos in the past and have listened to rense . Because of that I am able to give the rough elevation of the object. My first few seconds looking at the object progress as such. That's a funny looking airplaine. Yeah I've seen this before, The airplaine can be at a certain direction or facing a way that makes it look strange or funny.(and not like a plane should etc) Wow it's not moving. Ok Its not moving because it's so high and when it's that high you can't tell unless you watch for longer than normal, if its lower you can tell it's moving , its more obvious, how high is that, wow if thats so high that its difficult for me to tell the height and I have been looking at it for a good few seconds it must be plus 50k feet? but it's not moving even a small bit, not even a fraction of a bit of sky. I then concentrated on the movement issue a lot and tried to detected any movement at all going so far as to maybe walking from quite slow to really hardly walking in step and being more mindfull of my movement vs its movement so as to lower my movement so I could focus in on this point, it was not moving at all was my conclusion. I then reconsidered the shape and size of it and it was very difficult to make out what it was, it did not seem to have wings but it was not a clearcut shape but square with silver to the right maybe some kind of silver metal beam, yes there was definitely solidness to it and a part of it which mimicked the appearance of a wing but not in the configuration or direction which a normal airplane will exhibit a wing, sort of off and to the left. It was very hard to tell what it was or its correct shape to describe now. I then continued to look at it for maybe a few more seconds before I reached the end of the long red line (see images) and I put my head down and stepped off the small curb and to the left as this is the direction to continue my walk home. No sooner had I put my foot down,  of course I wanted to look straight back up at this weird thing but it was gone, my head then sort of went on a instant out of control sweep.  I then felt like someone had pulled the rug from under my feet or someone had stolen something from me and I was a little bit pissed off about the fact it was gone. One point I wish to add is that the visibility was 100% with zero clouds and due to the layout of the buildings my vision of the sky was  very wide, I don't know measurements or scale of what I can see but I can / could pretty much see the whole open sky and yet it had disappeared, that was a total impossibility I can state 100% there is no way at all it could have moved any were more than a short distance at the height it must have been if it were the size of a craft, to disappear is totally impossible. The rest of my journey home consisted of me pulling my mobile out and calling my parents to say what I had just seen and scanning the sky. but I got through to voice mail so I hung up. The only additional points of interest are the moon was out but it was to the left and back of me or 7/8 o'clock when walking down the attached path. Around 10 to 15 seconds after the object disappeared I saw quite a number of other aircraft one coming from directly ahead and to the left going to my 4oclock, and further along my walk another two Plaines going whichever way they were going. Regarding how high it was if looking straight up is 12oclock and straight ahead is 9 clock , then my eyes were looking up at an angle of just below 11oclock, you could not look at it with your head in a normal position, and it was not bang between 9 and 12 o'clock it was slightly higher than that. My final submission now that I can talk freely is that the biggest thing that hit me was when it was gone, it was there 100% whatever it was but it was when it was gone that was the impressive thing, that it could be there and in under 1 or 1 and a half seconds it could clear out from someone who had such large visibility. That is what I will remember from this, this was the unusually factor and light had not yet fallen I could see the whole sky in close to normal daylight. Additional points : When I got home I told my housemates about it, I have a lumix Panasonic dmc fs4 digital camera and felt it important to get out there to document the site I saw the object and also see if it was there again in the sky. I will inspect this part of the sky tomorrow at the same time to see if it returns.  Please let me know if anyone else has seen it or if there is a valid answer for what it was. I was not so impressed with the object but more with its ability to disappear like that, that it was solid there and then gone, it upsets me that it went when I looked away and i did not see how it went.  Images This is a map of the location spoken about above with the red line indicating the path I took. http://i38.tinypic.com/nnl8c3.png  This is the location just before I looked up, I bent down at point 1, then moved off to point 2 looking up at around, 6:45pm by my watch, checking my time now against the internet shows my watch is off by +8minutes *source Google gmt time keyword search and compare. http://i38.tinypic.com/smye0l.jpg  I first saw the object when looking up at the sky straight ahead marked between the yellow lines around here, I was somewhat focused on it at that point but that is a good estimate. http://i34.tinypic.com/2iji4xj.jpg  I then kept my eyes firmly glued to the object without releasing it from my view along this length of footpath, I retraced how long this is in time and at a slow pace is around 45seconds. Regarding the size of the object it was very small, this is why I felt it must be so high as I have viewed air craft which is so high or very high and it is also very small when so high, if you make a square with your fingers like I have done, that's a rough size, the square, quite tiny. Its apperiance was of white with solidness to it being silver. http://i37.tinypic.com/2vx58c7.png   I do not wish to be contacted unless it is extremely urgent, I am willing to discuss this but all facts of the matter have been reported here. I do plain on carrying my camera for the next month for my return trip from work. My wish is that this report is used against someone else having seen it or that this report is helpful in some other way, such as this report confirming something regarding another report or sighting. This is true and correct as best as I know how and I am not aware of any reason for this event other than something being there and then not being there, or in other words I do not take drugs or drink and my vision is clear enough to see being I am only of 33 years of age. Please email me if there is an update to this. thanks. End report.

The first witness noticed a flashing red light in the western horizon at approximately 21:15. Initially thought it was a planet because of the red color.  Passed it off as a star and didn’t say anything to anyone in the party. Next witness brought attention to a red, white, and blue alternating colored light that appeared to dance above the tree line.  There were seven of us sitting around a campfire and we moved farther out into the yard to look closer. We got a pair of binoculars out and took turns reporting to each other what we saw.  Each of us saw a circular pattern of multi-colored lights that erratically moved while seemingly changing shapes.  Two of us described it to look like a Ferris Wheel in the sky or what Hollywood has depicted as a UFO in several movies. One witness documented the times and duration of appearance and disappearances as follows:  Started 21:15 to 21:39 very bright, distinct and vivid rotation could be observed.  It was at its highest point.  Also during this time period, 4 people witnessed what appeared to be a shooting star in the same general area. 21:39-21:45 Object disappeared from view. 21:45-22:01 Object reappeared, lower in the sky, appearing farther north somewhat less vivid. Telescope was used to tract objects movement. It was obvious that the object was moving by the way it moved from the center of the telescope’s viewfinder within seconds. Another shooting star was witnessed by all seven of us. One witness was viewing the lights through the binoculars when it just vanished. 22:01-22:06 Object wasn’t visible. 22:06-22:12 Lights reappeared, even lower but still visible. During this time five witnesses saw a flash of white light appear above the object.

I noticed 3 lights in a triangular pattern hovering up in the sky.  Just after I saw them, the lights started shutting down one by one pretty quickly.  The entire event lasted approximately 4 seconds and she was not able to look up fast enough to see it.  The lights seemed to be emitting from very large recessed pockets.  Similar to light protruding from recessed ceiling lights. I could not see the craft due to all of the light pollution.  It was a clear night, so there there were no clouds for the city lights to reflect off of which would have made an excellent background.  I could not give an estimate of the size of the lights or how high it was hovering since it happened so quickly.  However, they came across as very, very large.  If I had to guess the shape of the object, I would guess that it was a triangular shape due to the positioning of the lights. After the lights disappeared, I quickly turned into the Braum's parking lot to scan the sky.  After not seeing anything for roughly 10 minutes, I turned around and drove through exactly as I had just done to make sure I wasn't seeing a reflection on my window or a streetlight or something.  Whatever it was, it was hovering in an open area that could not be mistaken for anything.  I used Solidworks with Photoworks to sketch out what the lights looked like before they shut off.  I also used Google Earth to show where I was driving and the approximate location of the lights.  I will email those to the address listed below.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,35.4656,-94.199

I was standing at my living room window in the Sunset District of San Francisco watching the sunset over the ocean when I saw them.  As they approached I questioned if in fact they were planes. They were absolutely quite.  It seemed one was following the other.  They moved in a straight line almost directly toward me.  One got close enough that I could see four lights, one red, one yellow and 2 white lights.  The lights were pulsating.  Then I moved to my bedroom window trying to get a better view.  They were both still there after I transitioned rooms.  My bedroom window also has an ocean view looking west but is more south than my living room window. Then it seemed they were out of view so I went to my back decks on the east side of my building and saw them again.  They were still heading southeast and seemed to be heading toward a third object that looked like a star.  At the closest the larger one seemed the size of an eraser on a pencil. Then a fourth one came from the southwest and seemed to be heading north not following the others.  That one was quite big also, in that it was just over the rooftops and could not have been a star in that case. It also had 4 pulsating lights red, yellow and 2 white lights. It seemed a bit closer than the other two that seemed to pass overhead of the building I was in. All in all it felt like I watched for a good 10 to 15 minutes.  There was no sound at all and no trails of any sort.  I was not able to see any of them by the time the sun set. What did I see?  Today is 6/14/09.  It is now 10:14pm.

He pointed high up in the sky to the northeast of Milford towards a position I would have to say was very nearly overhead the city of Manchester.  As I looked I saw an object that had to be at an altitude of 70 to 80 thousand feet in altitude hovering over the Manchester area.(please keep in mind that we are both experienced pilots used to making accurate judgements of an object's altitude.)

Being an Astronomer I often keep my eyes on the night time sky(with or without a telescope). Over the last couple weeks I've continued to notice multiple balls of lights rising in the Eastern horizon,the lights seem to be rising out of the Bull Run Battlefield in the Direction of Washington DC. These multiple lights will slowly rise than after a few minutes they would have risen so high you could know longer see them. I figured they were airplanes and since I couldn't get a closer look I wasn't convinced these lights were anything unusual and certainly not paranormal. That all changed last night when I was finally able to get a closer look at these amazing lights. My wife and I decided to take a walk since the temperature had cooled from the heat earlier in the day. Just as we got to the top of our neighborhood(an area that is very dark and gives you a excellent 360 degree view of the night time sky)we noticed a very bright amber light rising from the NE Horizon. The light raised straight up, I would estimate approximately 5,000 feet. When the light raised to the estimated 5,000 feet it stopped and remained stationary for several minutes.  The light then started drifting slowly towards the SW. Since it was dark we brought along with us a small flashlight. Coincidentally the flashlight had a small red laser light attached. As the light drifted and was now due East from us I got the laser light and flashed it a couple times towards this anomaly. This is still difficult to fully understand but as soon as I finished flashing the laser light the light in the sky stopped. It completely stopped and was just silently hovering due East from our position. I said to my wife ""you don't think the light stopped because I flashed the laser do you"". As we stood their stunned and watching the light I decided to flash the laser a couple more times.  Any skepticism that I had prior to this sighting all ended when this light unbelievably flashed back at us in four bright intervals-Flash-Flash---Flash-Flash. Unable to believe my eyes I flashed my light again at the light.  At this point the brightness of the light which was still stationary started to dim to where we could barely see it. The light then started to move directly up and continued on this path until it was know longer visible. This was an unbelievable experience and one that will be with me for the rest of my life.

The event occurred as I was on the north side of my home just gazing at the night sky directly to the east of my location.  There were a few visible clouds in that direction but I would not be able to tell how high they were but they were not low clouds..perhaps a couple miles or more in altitude.  As I was scanning the sky, I noticed an minimally bright object maybe a bit brighter than the clouds themselves against the night sky.  It was moving perhaps 2-3 times or so as fast as satellites I’ve seen but in a north-northwesterly direction.  I could not tell how big or how far away it was but it seemed to go behind a cloud (as it dimmed).  The cloud seemed thick enough to obscure light though but I could still see the object.  It seemed to be a perfectly circular shape about the brightness of a cloud with fuzzy, out-of-focus edges.  It was about the size of a pencil eraser in an outstretched hand.  It moved quickly, in my estimation and then slowed a bit and changed to a more west-north-west direction and then appeared to speed up and head North-northwest again and it went out of my line of sight over some houses.  I had wondered if my vision was fuzzy initially but I changed my mind about that almost right after I saw the object because directly below the fuzzy circle (at a distance of about 1-1/2 to 2 diameters of the circle) was a small, intermittently flashing amber light.  It did not seem to flash regularly and if I were to guess, each flash was between 1 second to 5 seconds apart.  It seemed to be the same color of amber that I have only seen once before.  After 9-11, the Twin Cities skies were devoid of all aircraft, of course, but I went to look at the quiet sky a day or two afterward and remember seeing the same color of amber light flying above us in the night sky.  It was a couple F-16s patrolling the airspace around us.  We never see F-16s in this area of Minnesota so when I saw that deep amber color and read that F-16s were in the area, I knew it was a special military beacon.  I heard no sound from whatever I saw.  My first thought was that I would describe what I saw as a fuzzy white, circular balloon with an intermittently flashing amber light beneath it.  I am curious if anyone else has seen something like this.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,,

It was a very bright light and it was still stationary about 40 degrees over the horizon. I sat outside and watched the light, comparing it to the few other stars that were shining.  I then noticed it was moving slowly upward.  The light stayed the same size but now it started to move faster and even looked like it was heading towards my direction.  Within 4 to 5 seconds it had moved almost directly over top, but slightly to the north of my house. The object moved passed my house and was headed almost directly west.  As it was going past my house I could clearly see the object.  It was a solid triangular shape object with lights underneath. It was not a smooth bottom, it had some kind of curved ridge along the centre underneath.  I could clearly see the shape with the binoculars.  At first I thought it was a stealth plane as I could hear a noise as it passed over. Within 20 seconds I could see jets coming.  I usually watch jets at night but these were not the usual pattern.  One came from approx. NE direction and the came from a more easterly direction.  I could hear them coming and see their blinking lights.  As they flew over, I could barely see the wing pattern.  They were clearly following the first object and moving very fast. If the jets were at the same altitude as the first object then I would have to say the first object was massive.  It is hard to judge the height the object was flying. I am submitting this report because I had a weird incident on Friday, June 12/09 at almost the exact same time of night and almost the exact same starting location in the sky.

I called my husband out to look but he is a Detroit Red Wing Fan and the final game was almost over and he didn't what to look.  He did come out the house and said, Yes, Its a blinking light and then went back to his game. I got the binoculars and looked at the light. I could clearly see it was a round object and had rotating lights. The lights rotated quickly but not so quickly that I could see the different colours.  Red, blue, green, yellow/white lights.  The lights rotated from left to right. I watched the lights for about 10 15 minutes and then it started to fade outward but appeared to be in the same location.

He described a light like a star, but changing color abnormally, and dropping other lights out of it. I was skeptical, but the sound in his voice unnerved me. I decided to take a look for my self. he described the location to me, in reference to the big-dipper. At first i didn't see anything, but soon had a VERY clear visual conformation. All the hair on my head was standing up, and I could barely maintain my composer. A bright light in the western sky, moving around in circles and lines. It was creating shapes and changing color. also little red lights would occasionally fall from the moving light. About twenty-five minutes into the colorful display, a helicopter from a near by hospital, flew near by where I was. This gave me a nice compairssion. This was not a helicopter, and was not that far away. At this point I was kinda scared. The next thing to happen really freaked me out! A small light appeared a good distance North from the original object. I saw it first, and asked my friend if he too saw this new light. As soon as he saw it it burst into a massive bright light.

After looking for 10 minutes we hadn't seen the bird, but as i was looking to the ocean(West) and my friend was looking the opposite direction(east) when he says ""dude look at this shit"" so i turn and i see it.  Above the 101 Freeway, not that high up in the sky, low enough to get a very very nice view of it, was a triangle shaped craft. It was not a solid triangle, there was nothing in the middle. Just the shape of a triangle, and each corner has a piece that stuck straight up.  The craft was silent, small planes frequently fly over my house sometimes lower than this and you can hear them so well they shake the windows of my house. This craft produced no sound and just ""glided"" smoothly across the sky heading north. It had a gray color, and shined a tiny bit when the sun hit it right, but not like a normal, it just looked different the way the light reflected.  I was going to run for the camera but it was heading towards two small hills that would obscure it from view in a matter of seconds so we just watched it cruise on by and dissapear behind the hills.  Later on, about 20 minutes later a third friend arrived and we told him what happened, so we went out back again to look for my bird a little more. We ended up going onto my roof with a pair of binoculars and scanning the sky for my bird. I looked up and saw a small white dot, not moving, just sitting there, directly above the area we had seen the triangle craft earlier.  When focused on in the binocluars it looked like a silver metal orb, but it was so high in the sky that no detail could be made out. All three of us saw this second object, and it remained there for 15 minutes or more until it finally moved away in the same direction that the triangle craft had went earlier.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,34.1702,-118.9558

Unfortunately, my little brother, his friend, and my step-dad had just went inside. In any case, the object looked like a plane at first, but without wings, and it was traveling way to fast, stopping, and going again. It looked like the path of lightning, but the object did not have a tail. It was headed NE about 5 miles East of me when it passed by. It disappeared just above the tree line and was gone. After  I thought it was a plane, I thought it may have been a dandelion petal, because we have dandelions in our yard, and some of them are in bloom. However, it was traveling too fast, and there was not a strong enough wind to carry it. Also, after seeing a commercial plane fly by headed north, I could estimate the crafts speed at anywhere between 2,000-2,500mph. It went roughly 4.5 times the speed of the jet. I haven’t told my family. This is the first time I have seen a ufo, but my dad did once over the water in Tampa Bay.

Craft not recognizable. At approx. 18:45 hours (1.5 hours after sunset) on January 18, 2009, I observed a ""fuzzy, bright"" object in the northwestern evening sky. It caught my attention because it was stationary, but wasn't of a shape I recognized. It was not a helicopter or other familiar aircraft. The object was fixed in the west-northwest sky, at approx. 60-65 degrees above the horizon. The weather was clear, warm, and no other flying objects, aircraft, or stellar phenomena were visible in that part of the sky. I used binoculars (10x50) to get a closer look, and was startled to see a grayish-gold oval with small red & green lights, one on each side of the object, plus a white ""headlight"" - small relative to the object's size. It seemed to be oval, but it also had an oval ""ring"" or projection at the bottom. The ""skin"" seemed to have large (relative to the overall size) markings or texture. I figured the sunlight from over the horizon must be reflecting off this thing, so its elevation above ground must have been quite high to catch sunlight this late. I could not venture a guess as to the object's actual dimensions, due to the lack of background reference points. I thought it was an aircraft - this due to the fact that aircraft typically display a red light on the left wing, and a green one on the right. I retrieved my digital camera, zoomed into the area where the object was located, and took three photos in succession. I had to guess at the location, because the object was too small to be seen in the viewfinder. When I tried looking at the display, I thought I had taken photos of black sky, as I could not make out anything. It wasn't until I downloaded some other photos from the camera this weekend that I saw the two good images from that evening on my computer screen. As I checked the pictures I had taken in the camera's viewfinder, I noticed the object start to move. It moved from its initial location to out of sight (into the western horizon) in less than five seconds. It flew roughly parallel to the San Gabriel Mountains, visible to me as the northwestern horizon from my back yard. The entire viewing and photocapture, plus the object's disappearance, spanned less than 10 minutes.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,34.1066,-117.815

Close inspection of the objects seems to reveal different angles of flight by the objects, and some reflectivity consistent with the position of the sun is present. The image is one in a series of four taken within seconds of each other, and the objects do not appear in the other three images, which presents fairly strong evidence that the objects are not the result of dust on the lens.

I was staying with my friend’s house in Baton Rouge, because they were lucky enough to have their electricity restored after hurricane Gustav. I was standing out front of my friends house, for a smoke break, around 10:00 p.m. or 10:30 p.m. (I am not sure of the exact time). It was a very quiet night due to the fact that after hurricane Gustav most of the city doesn’t have power and also we had a curfew that no one should be driving or out cruising starting at 8:00 p.m. The only sound you could hear were the sounds of generators in use. So, the sky was clear, stars visible, but dark, that eerie dark without the glow of street lights and house lights. I was looking up when I noticed out in the distance what looked like a flock of white birds, in a V formation heading my direction. It caught my attention for how white the birds were. But as they were flying overhead to where I got a better look, I realized they were not birds but rather something I don’t know how to explain. It was a V formation but it was, not necessarily lights spread apart but more like a reflective surface? If it were lights they would just have to be very dim I suppose. Not anything so bright that would have made it stand out in the dark sky. It was probably 1000 ft up, but honestly I could not gauge the distance because I was still trying to figure out what it was I was looking at. Also, noticed that it was a solid mass between the ""lights."" It moved at a good pace and made absolutely no sound. After it flew over me and crossed over the neighbor’s house it was gone.

After that I called my sister and told her where are you, there is something trying to land on the other side of the street. My mom was also in the car with my other two sisters as well, and she was the one who picked up the phone,she replayed what are you talking about. So I replayed something is landing, and hanged up. I was looking at it and it was trying to land a yellow bluish light came from the center of it but there was no sound, and they aborted the landing. At that time I tried to run about a block to the gas station,I must have run about 10 feet and there it was again trying to land. So I ran back to the garage again and called my sister again and asked them where are you guys, they replayed we are six blocks a way and we see a light it must be a helicopter or a airplane, and they said it's moving away. After that they came and picked me up. As soon as we got of the driveway and on the street all of the sudden the round craft was hovering over the building where I work and half of the four lane street, and it was pulsating red and blue lights and no sound. So we drove away as fast as we could from there, and after a few seconds it vanished out of our sight. I will ask at work tomorrow if they have recorded anything on the surveillance cameras at the building.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,34.081520982142855,-118.40547678571428

These lights were moving in unison with each other and were moving slowly to the southeast, I ran inside and woke up my girlfriend and had her come out to see them as well. When we came out the object was still in the sky, but started moving more in a southern direction. Within a minute or two the object did another series of slow turns, first east and then again in a southbound trajectory, flying away from us. Then the lights went out, first the front, then rear left, and finally rear right. The object itself could not have been made out without the lights. It made no sound. It seemed to be flying very high, and the lights appeared as satellites do in the night sky. One could have even mistaken them for stars at a glance. The three light seemed to be fixed in that pattern the single light forward and the others in back relative to the direction it was traveling. There was only deviation in the pattern when the object changed direction, giving the appearance of ""banking"".

However, this light was joined by 2 others, and all began rising slowly. We watched as 4 other reddish lights appeared, moving slowly from left to right whilst rising. These four eventually formed a triangle with one light in the centre and three others placed at 0 degrees, 120 degrees and 240 degrees. All rose together and then faded slowly.

First sighting, object was in the North Westerly sky.  Very Cloudy night, so much so that you could not see thru the cloud layer to the sky above it.  This object was slowly raising straight up at a pretty constant pace.  It can be described as a oval shaped, that had a fiery apprearance.  The object did not make any noise, nor did it emit any smoke, or anything that would lead you to believe it was actually on fire.  The color resembled a molten lava appearance, flickering similar to a candle.  It did not have a strobe light, or any flashing lights visible.  This object slowly raised, almost hovered, until it raised thru the cloud line.  About 45 minutes later, we seen the object again.  This time, the clouds in the sky had broken up a bit.  Still mostly cloudy, but you could see patches of stars between.  The Object was coming from the direction we had previously seen it.  H! owever, it was not rising up, but rather traveling in a Northwest to SouthEast direction, eventually traveling pretty close to over our heads.  At no point was their any audible sound from this craft. The object was moving much quicker this time, but still had the same, Fiery, flickering appearance.  Once this object traveled over our heads, it actually picked up speed traveling to the South.  It then actually made a subtle dart from left to right at one point, making all of us watching actually scream ""did you see that"" at the same time.  The most amazing part was still to come.  As we all watched this glowing fireball pick up speed, there was a patch of clouds ahead of it.  The object then appeared to ""turn off"" or change to a jet black appearance.  It could be described as it turned into a shadow, darker than the actual night sky.  It was at this time you could really see the oval shape of the object. When the object turned black, it was only visible for about 4 or 5 sec! onds more before it was out of our viewing range.

While keeping my eyes glued to the 2 craft, another set of lights came into my peripheral vision from the left( also traveling from NE to SW following the same path as the previous 2-which were still visable to me). This time there were 4 lights in the shape of a square-with one light on each corner. The 2 leading lights were yellow and the 2 back lights were red. These lights did NOT blink and the square between the lights covered up the stars it passed. Again, this object measured 1/2 inch holding my hand at arms length.

At one point they almost seemed to light up rapidly in a 'band' across the width of the object. It looked slightly grey against the deep blue sky, and it appeared to have an elongated point at it's head and possibly two shorter points at its end with a concave bottom - possibly chevron shaped (it may have had more points to it, but it was very unclear). All the blinking lights were no bigger than most of the stars around the sky.

Then smaller white lights began shooting away from it one & two at a time in all directions, going away up to about 5-6 inches. It still had a main white light, brighter than the rest, which continued to blink at erratic but consistent intervals. We watched it do this until it was very far south, to the distant tree line.

I happened to look up into the sky as I usually do and noticed an odd shaped object moving from South to North at a fast pace. I wouldn’t be able to give an actual figure as far as it’s height off of the ground mostly because it was a densely dark object. One thing that intrigued me is that it was running silent and had no blinking lights whatsoever. Also, due to the fact that it was dark, it was fairly invisible in the night sky. The only reason I was able to notice it and distinguish its shape (fairly triangular) was because it flew just under some glowing night-time clouds. It flew right through a known air traffic lane. So soon after it passed the clouds it became invisible once more and then a passenger aircraft flew through the same airspace at approximately the same altitude, which allowed me to guess its size as roughly that of a large truck. It all happened very fast.  It was a partly cloudy night, so had it not been for the small cloud it passed under I would guess that I wouldn’t have noticed it at all.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

The white lights were fixed on each corner of the object. The object was very low, slightly higher than the tree tops. It was hovering in the same spot as it rotated. As it hovered I noticed a very faint hum. Other than this slight hum it was silent. After the object rotated one time it slowly began to move South/Southwest. As it began to move is when I yelled for my partner who was still in the house. He came out in time to see the lights pass over our house. The three lights did not blink and seemed to be on the bottom of the object. As the object flew away it began to gain speed and altitude. The object turned and banked several times.

Around 23:00 on the beach in Jacksonville Beach, Florida me and a friend witnessed a bright cigar shape craft move like nothing either of us had seen before. We had decided to go out for a quick stroll on the beach since it was a relatively clear night out compared to the previous week. After a short walk south my friend suddenly stopped and was peering south south-east slightly out towards the ocean before I could ask him why he stopped  a bright orange glow took hold of my attention in the direction he was staring. Both of our eyes were affixed to this point where this glow took up a good chunk of the sky it looked as if a bomb had gone off. At this point we both realized this was right around the same place in the sky that shuttle launches could be seen from the Kennedy space center which we had witnessed many times before. As we discussed this a bright almost glowing light orange or dark yellow cigar shaped object appeared in the orangery haze. The object slowly started moving vertically about the same speed as the shuttle. Me and my friend assumed we were watching a shuttle launch and were both pretty surprised that neither of us had heard anything about it and that the beach was vacant except for us. With a shuttle launch it seemed almost impossible that we would be the only ones out to watch . Although surprised we continued to watch the object astounded that we were the only two watching this great event. About 2 minutes in to the object rising vertically it seemed to be slowly moving  north towards us no longer gaining altitude. The bright glow kept growing more intense as it moved towards us. Suddenly we realized this object was leaving no trail of smoke so the idea came to me that maybe this was a helicopter but there were no blinking lights just a steady light orange  glow. I attempted to take a picture on my phone but it was so dark that nothing came out. The craft now around 45 degrees from its first appearance then appeared to move west out towards the ocean and over the ! period o f around 2 minutes the once intensely bright light slowly dimmed. Then the craft about the intensity of a star slowly moved south and over the period of a second faded away as fast as it appeared. I have never seen any object emit no trail, have no blinking lights, and be absolutely silent. Throughout my entire life I've never witnessed Helicopters, planes, balloons, shuttles, or any other type  of aircraft behave the way this object did. Me and my friend have an open mind regarding UFO sightings but were pretty skeptical of what we were witnessing and were wondering if anyone else may have witnessed this event  being easily in the view of the entire coastline. Any information could be helpful to aid us in figuring out what we saw that night.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,30.280529411764707,-81.40465

These lights were traveling in sync with each other and I could not figure out what it was. The lights didn't flash so I don't think it was a plane, and it was completely silent, but seemed much closer than any planes should be flying. It went across the sky faster than any 'normal' plane would have. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like it.

It wasn't anything scary that would spook anyone looking up at the night sky, but it was definatly not normal.  As I was studying for my ccna exam early this morning (my test was today btw.. and I failed in case you want to know...)I decided to take a break and smoke a cigarette outside.  I work nights so I do this all the time. When I go outside, I usually love to look up at the night sky.  Especially during this time of the year when the nights are cool and the skys are clear.  It allows for very clear viewing of the night sky and all it's glory.  Sometimes I can make out clusters of millions of stars if the night is clear enough.  Needless to say I enjoy looking up at the wonders of the universe. While smoking a cigarette last night, I observed an object shoot across the sky from left to right.  I was facing North as it moved across the sky. I've witnessed shooting stars as they attempt to enter the atmosphere and burn up.  I've also witnessed comets and what they look like before (not in person, but I've watched enough National Geographic to know what it should look like).  The thing that got me eerie about this experience was the way this light traveled across the sky.  If it was a piece of rock burning up in our atmosphere, it would have traveled much faster across the sky and been in a straight line. This light that I saw was VERY VERY distant.  In fact, if it were standing still, I would have said it was probably a star or a planet.  As it was traveling across the night sky last night, it did something that from everything I know about physics, should be impossible.  This light traveled across and made a sharp and immediate change in course perpendicular to the initial line that it was traveling when I first spotted it.  Then it made another perpendicular turn to keep going in the direction it was headed when I first spotted it.  What scared me the most was the way it shifted the direction of travel.  I'm pretty sure this light that I saw was not anything in our atmosphere, and because of the faintness of the light, I think this was out in space. I have drawn a quick diagram using just hyphens and pipes to show the trajectory of the object.  Again.. what scared me the most was how this light went from going in one direction to a perpendicular direction IMMEDIATELY.  This object did NOT leave a trail This object did not have any aura around it The object did not emit any other colored lights, didn't change color In fact, like I said earlier.. had it been still, I probably would have thought it was just another star or planet. ------| | | |-------- ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Between September 1st & 14th, 2008 (can’t remember exact the date though it wouldn’t have been a Monday or Wednesday) my grandson, 12 years old and a straight A student currently in the sixth grade and I, a 53-year-old business owner, were about to turn into my driveway in Palestine, TX between 4-7PM.  It was a clear day, very few clouds, and the sun was not in our line of vision.     I was headed due north and we saw an object coming from the northwest or about 10:00 going upward from the tree line …We thought at first it might be a jet or weather balloon but it had an upside down white V shape coming from underneath and the shape did not vary or leave a “print” in the sky like a jet and a balloon is usually like an upside down teardrop and clear. As we watched, it came directly over us, moving steadily and seeming lower than it first appeared to be and moving toward the southeast or 5:00 direction. When it was over us we both thought it looked like an upside down lady bug in both it’s shape and as it was red with a black area like a dot on it and the “V” was still very clearly visible and exactly the same.  The bottom of the “V” never varied in its length. The V was thicker or wider, right under the object and seemed to come to a point on each “leg” of the “V”.   We had the windows down and I turned the car off but we didn’t hear any noise. The trees in the yard started to block our view as it moved through the sky somewhat behind us so I started the car, did a quick 3 point turn in the driveway and moved to the end of our little road, about 200 yards.  The object was totally gone. I usually don’t think much about this sort of thing as we live close to the balloon base but I checked the calendar that night and there were no scheduled launched.  I was very peculiar to us in that it was red and the white “V” was so stable. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

For the distance this object seemed to be, it was much larger than a 747, about 80% longer and 40% wider, again with no wings or tail. The object was very shiny & metallic in comparison to typical aircraft. It appeared to be cylindrical due to the shadow and shading that implied a curvature of a cigar-shape. I watched it fly horizontally into light clouds. At this time, I had slowed down to watch the object pass and waited for it to exit through the clouds, which were sparse. I did not see it emerge. Given the time I saw it traveling, the object would have appeared relatively quickly from the cloud. As I was driving northbound and the object was ahead of me at about 1 o'clock, I had time to check the cloud as I approached and passed it.

The entire shape was colored bright orange.  We saw this for perhaps five to ten seconds, at which it appeared to turn right, and in so doing, it revealed a circular view, which glowed a bright whitish-yellow, perhaps magnesium flare type disc, and quickly went out of vision.  This was an awesome experience and is as clear in my mind today as it was then. This occurrence was widely reported in Eastern Washington, all the way to Montana.  The approach of this vehicle was so close, that the occupants of the airport control tower, located at Geiger Field at that time, were concerned for their safety.  The object was, to my recollection, clocked in Montana at 18,000 MPH.  I cannot recall hearing any substantiative follow ups on this event, though I am sure that the U.S. Air Force had nothing that could clock 18,000 MPH.  I was 19 years old at the time of the sighting, and 77 years old at this writing. To follow up, I had The Spokesman-Review, our local newspaper, search their archives from July 1950 to 1952.  Several reports were found, but one, dated July 3, 1950, was right on with my experience, except that this sighting was at night and ours was in the early afternoon.  I cannot tell you if our sighting was before or after the reported evening sighting.  It appears, by virtue of the 12-hour lapse, to have been two separate events.  Incidentally, the distance fro Spokane to Missoula, Montana is such that ""only a few seconds later,"" (the viewing lag between spotting the UFO in Spokane and Missoula) would be about 14.5 seconds at 20,000 MPH, which is not far off from my recollection of 18,000 MPH.

A high flying airliner was nearby and was below this object which in my estimation had to make the object we saw at least as large as the passenger jet. The object was moving in a strange sort of s-pattern, changing directions a number of times in a short distance. Next it seemed to go straight up, as it became suddenly smaller and then disappeared. We observed the object for less than one minute. Neither of us had ever seen anything in the sky behave in this manner before.

Stealth flying craft were not developed until many years later.,Naha (Japan),,,circle,3 minutes,"Occurred : 6/26/1963 23:40  (Entered as : 06/26/63 23:40) Reported: 8/2/2008 7:02:04 PM 19:02 Posted: 8/12/2008 Location: Naha (Japan),  Shape: Circle Duration:3 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64958.html,"Stealth flying craft were not developed until many years later. June 1963 Naha Air Base, Okinawa, Japan. During my tour of duty at Naha Air Base, Okinawa, sky watching for aircraft arrivals and departures became a favorite pastime. On one clear night, my Airman buddy ((name deleted)) and I raised our binoculars scanning the skies for aircraft. From experience, we could accurately identify most aircraft. Standing on the second floor sundeck of our barracks, we had an unobstructed view of the runway and skies over the air base. Although we sky-watched for over an hour we saw nothing. Nearing ten o’clock, we became bored, so we opted for stargazing. Frank had much knowledge about the regions of the stars in our galaxy. He had just begun pointing out a few of the more common constellations when it happened. Something strange appeared out of the corner of his left eye. It was a UFO. “Look! What the hell is that?” Frank yelled. “Marty do you see that?” “Yeah Frank, I see it. Holy mackerel, what is it?” Scared and grateful for Frank’s presence, my first instincts told me to get the hell away from there. However, despite my tendency to panic and run, I had a strange and intense compulsion to keep on watching. At the same time, I was ready to bolt back into the barracks for cover. It looked like nothing we had ever seen before. I positioned my binoculars for a better look. We did not use the term “UFO” at that point, but we knew the craft we saw did not match anything in the Air Force’s aircraft inventory. We saw a large, slow-moving disk traveling in a steady northerly direction--right smack over our base. We did not see the usual flashing navigation lights or red and green wing-tip lights.  All pilots who fly at night must have their aircraft’s navigation lights turned on. It was not just an unusual cloud formation, flares or a weather balloon. In the Air Force, working as communications specialists at control towers and around busy flight lines, Frank and I became knowledgeable about most types of aircraft in the military inventory. It traveled at an estimated speed of one hundred knots. The craft held a steady altitude of three or four thousand feet. It had a diameter of about seventy-five feet. We saw no antennae, dome, windows or markings. It was silent and produced no engine noise. Having a disk shape, it looked as flat as a quarter.  The craft’s outer surface appeared smooth, constructed of a dull, yet reflective metallic material. Its outer edges appeared razor thin. ""If it turns toward us, I’m out of here,"" I said shaking all over. ""Me too,"" Frank agreed. Our fear level started to dwindle once we realized that it continued moving away from us. To afford us a better view, we climbed up the building’s fire ladder to gain access to the roof. First up the ladder, I hesitated at the top of the ladder and peered out to see if it was safe to advance. “Hold it Frank!” I said stopping to look and be sure the craft had not made a turn toward us. Since it continued moving away—“Let’s go Frank!” I said. “It’s still heading north.” I had an eerie feeling that we were about to place ourselves in a vulnerable position on the roof. However, seeing it continued to move farther away from us, our first fear that alien creatures might spot us subsided. Raising my binoculars again, I noticed that it had reflected a noticeable degree of light coming from Naha City, found a few miles to the north of our base. We watched it until it faded away out of sight. The entire sighting lasted for about two and one-half minutes. “We’ve got to tell someone,” Frank said. After scrambling down the fire ladder, we sprinted to a staircase leading to the first floor. We reached the C.Q. or Charge of Quarters room to use the barracks phone. We had to tell someone in authority. By then, Frank had begun to hyperventilate. I told him to sit down in a chair and stay calm while I called the base control tower operator. From frequent visits to the control tower for communications equipment issues, I intuitively remembered and dialed the correct number. “Tower—Airman First-Class Bernard speaking.” His voice had a calming effect on me. I knew Airman Bernard by his first name, George. Since he occupied the same barracks as we did--ate in the same mess hall and from my many visits to the tower for communications repairs, he knew me as well. “George,"" I said, trying to catch my breath. “This is Marty from the Communications Squadron.” “I didn’t put a call in for any problems,” George said. “How are you? Wait a minute—let me turn off the phone recorder.” His first impression was that my call was for something unrelated to tower business--perhaps it referred to a question about stereo equipment—one of his favorite hobbies. “No George,” I suggested. “You better leave it on for this.” “So, this is official business huh,” he commented with an official sounding tone of voice. “All right, I turned it back on. What’s up?” “Did you see it?” I asked. “See what?” he replied. “That huge disk-shaped object that flew over the airstrip just two minutes ago.” “I didn’t see anything. Are you sure?” he asked. “I’m sure George. Frank saw it too. We watched it from the roof of the barracks.” After I described what we saw, Bernard paused for a few seconds considering his next action. “That’s weird,” he said. “Hold on while I check with the radar center.” Waiting for Bernard’s report, I noticed that Frank had calmed down while he listened to my conversation with the tower. The minutes seemed like hours. We were dripping wet since the temperature inside barracks was at least ninety degrees and the humidity at ninety-eight percent. My imagination went into overdrive as I waited for Bernard to come back on the line. I thought that at any moment we would hear the roar of afterburners from our F-102 jet fighters as they went scrambling into the sky in pursuit of whatever it was that we reported. Perhaps the Base Commander would come on the line to ask us for more details about the sighting. We might soon hear the shrill of the base’s alert sirens followed by the sight of speeding trucks carrying frantic troops to their battle positions. Instead, Tower Controller Bernard came back on the line. “Airmen,” he said, “I hate to tell you this, but the radar people have had no contacts for over an hour.” “Impossible,” I yelled. “Did you check with Kadena Center?” “Yes I did,” Bernard said, “and the Army NIKE site too. They also said they had no recent radar contacts.” His response was shocking to say the least. Controller Bernard suggested that we file an Unidentified Aircraft Report. Heads shaking back and forth, “Thanks anyway,” we told him. We decided--how could we file a report on something we saw without physical evidence to back it up? We understood we would have needed at least radar reports, photographs, or more eyewitnesses. We never did file that report. We hoped we would hear others talk about spotting it too, but no one ever came forward. For weeks, I spent my free time watching the night sky and hoping for another sighting. I even bought a Nikon 8mm camera. I carried it with me wherever I went—just in case. My hopes of seeing it again began to fade after several weeks. However, just as I started to think the earlier sighting was just a onetime fly-by, I saw it again. Returning to my barracks from a second shift tour at the Communications Center, I decided to relax for a while. I sat in a chair on the second floor outside landing. Propping my feet up onto a railing, I began reminiscing about the first sighting. Since I was alone, the thought scared the hell out of me. Just before 1:00 a.m. I was about to call it a night when it reappeared. A craft similar to the type Frank and I saw one month earlier. In an instant, my mind switched from a relaxed state to one of “fight or flight.” My body froze and my adrenaline level skyrocketed. My hair hackled. My heart raced. I could not move my legs. My camera—I left it in my room. In my mind, I calculated the best course of action. There I was, sitting alone in the dark outside my barracks with no one else around, except--what? Common sense soon prevailed. No light beams were shooting down at me from the craft. It became clear that it took no notice of me and was moving northward away from my position. Thank God. After a few seconds, my brain regained control of my body and I was able to move my legs. I stood and took the next logical step, I ran like hell. Sprinting down the long hallway to the center of the barracks to get to the stairs, I thought it best not to look back. I did not. Reaching the stairway, I made it down the thirteen steps to the first floor in three or four leaps. At the bottom, I turned and ran straight to the C.Q. office phone. The Charge of Quarters had been dozing at his desk when I grabbed the phone to report the sighting to the control tower. Airman Bernard answered on the first ring. “Tower, Airman Bernard here.” “George, this is Marty from the Communications Squadron. I just saw it again!” I explained. I was nearly out of breath and spoke with a nervous stutter. “It looked the same as the last one.” Bernard must have heard me breathing heavily and sensed that I was anxious. He told me to be calm, relax and tell him what I had seen. I recounted the event as it happened. He put me on hold as he checked with three different radar sites scanning the island’s airspace. The C.Q. awoke hearing my conversation with the tower controller. “What’s the matter?” he asked. “You look as though you just saw a ghost.” “No, not a ghost,” I answered, “I’ll explain later.” After what seemed like hours, Bernard came back on the line. “We’ve had no radar contacts for two hours,” he said. Again, he advised me to fill out an Unidentified Aircraft Report. I did not bother. For the second time, I declined. I felt that no one would believe me without proof. I thought if only I had brought my camera with me.",,,

It appeared as I said as if the sun itself had fallen from the sky because of its massive size and the circular diameter of the sphere, it made no sound and nor was there a sound previous to its appearance to indicate a major explosion of some magnitude coming from that region of the countryside, it appeared as though it was approximately 10 miles or so from the street we lived on that ran parallel to the trajectory of the object in question and that of the river the other side of the forest itself, it was heading in a north, northeasterly direction after reviewing my homes position to that of Hartford and the River that divided us, the Smith Family lived directly behind our house on the next block, the Zimmerman family a few more streets over from them.  The silence of such a huge sphere ROLLING across the tree tops and emitting whipping flames from upon its surface gave you the feeling that the core of this object was solid while its surface was entirely engulfed in a all encompassing mass of burning gases and surface material, no wind, not a whisper of the massive flight of this globe of fire could be heard as it passed, no crash, no explosion, its as if it was headed toward the coastline and gravity had no effect on its elevation as it traveled the distance from which I was could visually detect and remain captivated by its enormous size and silence as it moved through the evening sky to a destination I had no indication would be anywhere close by as it disappeared in the evening sky. I'd like to mention yet another personal experience, that wasn't so personal when you consider all the news at the time that was generated in the Community of Great Falls, Montana shortly after the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II. It was months later and I had contacted a local priest from Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Great Falls. This priest has since been removed from active service with the general public, he has suffered a stroke on the left side of his body and his memory isn't exactly what it use to be. In the early 1980's, maybe around May of 1982, during that late spring month my wife and I was awakened by a glowing light from the back yard of our home that was hovering over our very large weeping willow tree, it was as if it had landed and was gathering information or discharging a genetic message. The air was still and the sounds in the distance echoed as if you were inside a tunnel. Across the alley, on the next block... 2606-5th Avenue South a police car was parked in the middle of the street looking directly into our backyard, the sound of breaking glass could be heard for a very brief second from that location, the whole area of the neighborhood was as if it were in a vacuum and echoed each sound as if you could detect a pin drop from down the street, the engine on the patrol car was silent and there was no other vehicle traffic that could be detected in the general area that was mobile, only the flashing lights of a police car setting in the middle of the road out back and it remained throughout the night. Above our tree was a cloud that resembled a Maltesse Cross, its four triangular shaped inner arms were of a stewing blackness that could only be understood from the depths outside our planets atmosphere, this is what's really particularly curious in relationship to the Enfield Connecticut incident where a report of a 4 pointed cross was reported earlier in the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania incident which I believe is one and the same in more ways than one! Very interesting coinci! dence in deed!!!    The other portions of that Maltesse Cross between the cross figure itself was pure white and just as luminous as the light of a full moon on a clear night, even that of a bright florescent blub. It hummed as though vibrating as though it was discharging a message or extracting a source of matter that had called it forth in that midnight hour. Maybe from beneath the earth at the roots of that tree a line of communication was being established with the earth itself and its inhabitants, maybe it was answering a question that's fimilar to us all. This experience has vanished from most all records in the area after a military investigator came to the area and researched the sighting that many residents of Great Falls had reported to the Great Falls Tribune and to Military officials at Malmstrom AFB the days following its appearances, this phenomenon occurred during a period when I was employed for about a 6 month period as a supervisior at a local Sambo's Restraurant. The incident was centered at 2605-6th Avenue South in Great Falls , Montana . I still own the property there, for some reason I still feel attached after that experience, who wouldn't feel such a bond? This is yet another unexplained event that now appears to be totally erased from the record books because of government involvement. The priest I mentioned earlier is in a housing facility run by the church for aging priests in Great Falls . This priest was contacted by me the morning of that Maltesse Cross had hovered over our tree. I spoke with Father Hersinko a number of times about this event and told him that for some reason or another I was certain that Light would remain in the area for three more days and could be spotted above in the evening sky's canopy in its original shape in a northwest trajectory as a group of distinguished cloud formations resembling that Maltesse Cross or wheel with spokes; you think that during that time satillites would have detected this formation, maybe the military did! I expect the Great Falls Tribune that had front page coverage of this event from so many callers would still have information on this case in question, I think they do, but find it very difficult to locate. That priest after that event was over was removed from his position at Our Lady of Lourdes Church and placed in a small church about 30 miles out of town on Highway 200, I believe the town was Fort Shaw that serves about 150 perishioners. I found that strange seeing he was only in his earlier fifties and was the priest in charge of not only the church services, but the grade scho! ol it op erated in the community of Great Falls . Well, that night of the Maltesse Cross incident I told my wife as we stood 30 feet from that tree looking up at the swirling mass of black ink and that extremely white soft halo that divided the two prominent features into very distinct patterns that I should go and venture up to the tree and climb-up and see what if anything would occur... she ruled against it and seemed only interested in going back into the house and finishing her sleep. The police car was still parked in the middle of the street watching the figure with, I suspect, much interest. I imagine the police report was sanitized, as well in this actual case of multiple sightings that week, it shouldn't have been. Maybe you can further investigate and inform me as to what your findings were! Another aspect of this event which was discussed with the priest was the Montana State License Plate on my Vehicle, "" Sacrum"". I had mailed one of these license plates to Pope John Paul II with a note that his life was in immediate mortal danger, that was 7 days from the attempt on his life where he was shot and a bullet struck his sacrum bone, go figure... I had never written a letter like that to anyone before, quite a coincidence, I had never communicated with the church prior to this event, but I did have an undeniable urge to get personalized license plates earlier that year... it was a plate that caused some interest with local officals, I retired that license plate after that incident. I was mostly consumed with getting my wife pregnant, my doctor told me forget it after numerous visits to his office... around 9 months after the Maltesse Cross incident we had a son... in 1983. His eyes were as if oriental, that's always puzzled me a bit. He's a good son, he works two jobs, has graduated from college with 3 degrees in business, I feel I'm very blessed to have him. It's funny how life evolves, it's amazing the mysteries that sometimes make those blessings seem all the more important in our own particular lives! . If you find the information concerning this event in Great Falls during that time frame drop me a line, at the time I failed to document this important event in my life seeing it was all over the news at the get go.

For the most part I have kept this information to myself. I was home on leave from the Navy in February 1966.  I had just left my girlfriends house at about 0100 hours in the morning. Driving east on state route 224  where I connected to state route 44  going northbound through the small town of Randolph, Ohio.  This is a rural area and I was the only vehicle on the road at that time of the morning.  There was snow on the roadway and ground which my headlights lit up in front of my vehicle. All of a sudden in the black night sky I observed this egg shaped object through my windshield.  It came out of the night sky from the east.  It was the most amazing thing I have ever witnessed.  This UFO came into view with the speed that nothing on earth could match.  As it came into view it stopped just as fast in mid air right over the road I was traveling on.  Seemed as if it had spotted me and stopped to take a look.  It was only stationary for what seem like five/ten seconds.  Then, with the same blazing speed from a standing stop it took off toward the west and was gone in a split second. This egg shaped object was out in front of me and was just above the tree top level.  I would estimate it was down range from me about a mile. I observed the UFO was the color of a red hot poker with the yellow, almost white hot color, being in the center.  The blue color being on the outer areas with the red and green colors being closer to the center.  Now here is the odd thing.  This UFO had two other smaller ROUND objects following it and they were the same color.  It appeared as if the smaller objects might have been attached. The smaller objects were approximately at a 45 degree angle to the rear of the larger UFO.  The smaller narrower part of the egg shape was the rear of this UFO which, of course pointed east. I was not drinking nor do I drink.  I finished my enlistment in the Navy.  Upon returning home I went to college obtaining my Masters Degree in Education an I'm a retired police officer after twenty plus years of service. I know what I saw that night many years ago was REAL.  I'll never forget it.  What ever it was is not of this world.

Subject: RE: Html Form Submission... another troubling episode that has been even harder to explain when considering aspects of the Kicksburg, Pennslyvania UFO Reported Sighting. Peter Davenport,    I want you to understand that the date of this FireBall  streaming across the treeline from my position facing toward Hartford in the south and to the existing river coming from the northeastern sector of the state from the other side of the forest just outside Enfield, Connecticut was the exact path this Orb took heading in a northeastern direction. It appeared as I said as if the sun itself had fallen from the sky because of its massive size and the circular diameter of the sphere, it made no sound and nor was there a sound previous to its appearance to indicate a major explosion of some magnitude coming from that region of the countryside, it appeared as though it was approximately 10 miles or so from the street we lived on that ran parallel to the trajectory of the object in question and that of the river on the other side of the forest, it was heading in a north, northeasterly direction after I reviewing my homes position to that of Hartford and the river that passed along side of Enfield and headed directly toward the Hartford vicinity, the Smith Family lived directly behind our house on the next block, the Zimmermans a few more streets over from them, if my bearings are correct. The silence of such a huge sphere ROLLING across the tree tops and emitting whipping flames from upon its surface gave you the feeling that the core of this object was solid while its surface was entirely engulfed in a all encompassing mass of burning gases and surface material, no wind, not a whisper of the massive flight of this globe of fire could be heard, no crash, no explosion, its as if it was headed toward the coastline and gravity had no effect on its elevation as it traveled the distance from which I was could visually detect and remain captivated by its enormous size and silence as it moved through the evening sky to a destination I had no indication wwas close by. I'd like to mention yet another personal experience, that wasn't so personal when you consider all the news at the time that was generated in the Community of Great Falls, Montana shortly after the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II. It was months later and I had contacted a local priest from Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Great Falls . This priest has since been removed from active service with the general public, he has suffered a stroke on the left side of his body and his memory isn't exactly what it use to be. In the early 1980's, maybe around May of 1982, during that late spring month my wife and I was awakened by a glowing light from the back yard of our home that was hovering over our very large weeping willow tree. The air was still and the sounds in the distance echoed as if you were inside a tunnel. Across the alley, on the next block at 2606-5th Avenue South a police car was parked in the middle of the street looking directly into our backyard, the sound of breaking glass could be heard for a very brief second from that location, the whole area of the neighborhood was as if it were in a vacuum. Above our tree was a cloud that resembled a Maltesse Cross, its four triangular shaped inner arms were of a stewing blackness that could only be understood from the depths outside our planets atmosphere. The other portions of that Maltesse Cross between the cross figure itself was pure white and just as luminous as the light of a full moon on a clear night, even that of a bright florescent blub. It hummed as though discharging a message or extracting a source of matter that had called it forth in the midnight hour. This experience has vanished from most all records in the area after a military investigator came to the area and researched the sighting that many residents of Great Falls had reported to the Great Falls Tribune and to Military officials at Malmstrom AFB the days following its appearances, this phenomenon occurred during a period when I was employed for about a 6 month period as a supervisior at a local Sambo's Restraurant. The incident was centered at 2605-6th Avenue South in Great Falls , Montana. These kinds of personal experiences for some reason attach themselves to the psychi of those individuals and never let go, who wouldn't feel a special bond to these events that defy logic according to investigators that remain true to their integrity? This is yet another unexplained event that now appears to be totally erased from the record books because of government involvement. The priest I mentioned earlier is in a housing facility run by the church for aging priests in Great Falls . This priest was contacted by me the morning of that Maltesse Cross had hovered over our tree. I spoke with Father Herinko a number of times about this event and told him that for some reason or another I was certain that Light would remain in the area for three more days and could be spotted above in the evening sky's canopy in its original shape in a northwest trajectory as a group of distinguished cloud formations resembling that Maltesse Cross or wheel with spokes; you think that during that time satillites would have detected this formation, maybe the military did! I expect the Great Falls Tribune that had front page coverage of this event from so many callers would still have information on this case in question, I think they do, but find it very difficult to locate. That priest after that event was over was removed from his position at Our Lady of Lourdes Church and placed in a small church about 30 miles out of town on Highway 200, I believe the town was Fort Shaw that serves about 150 perishioners. I found that stra! nge seei ng he was only in his earlier fifties and was the priest in charge of not only the church services, but the grade school it operated in the community of Great Falls . Well, that night of the Maltesse Cross incident I told my wife as we stood 30 feet from that tree looking up at the swirling mass of black ink and that extremely white soft halo that divided the two prominent features into very distinct patterns that I should go and venture up to the tree and climb-up and see what if anything would occur... she ruled against it and seemed only interested in going back into the house and finishing her sleep. The police car was still parked in the middle of the street watching the figure with, I suspect, much interest. I imagine the police report was sanitized, as well in this actual case of multiple sightings that week, it shouldn't have been. Maybe you can further investigate and inform me as to what your findings were! Another aspect of this event which was discussed with the priest was the Montana State License Plate on my Vehicle, "" Sacrum"". I had mailed one of these license plates to Pope John Paul II with a note that his life was in immediate mortal danger, that was 7 days from the attempt on his life where he was shot and a bullet struck his sacrum bone, go figure... I had never written a letter like that to anyone before, quite a coincidence, I had never communicated with the church prior to this event, but I did have an undeniable urge to get personalized license plates earlier that year... it was a plate that caused some interest with local officals, I retired that license plate after that incident. I was mostly consumed with getting my wife pregnant, my doctor told me forget it after numerous visits to his office... around 9 months after the Maltesse Cross incident we had a son... in 1983. His eyes were as if oriental, that's always puzzled me a bit. He's a good son, he works two jobs, has graduated from college with 3 degrees in business, I feel I'm very blessed to have him. It's funny how life evolves, it's amazing the mysteries that sometimes make those blessings seem all the more important in our own particular lives. If you find the information concerning this event in Great Falls during that time frame drop me a line, at the time I failed to document this important event in my life seeing it was all over the news at the get go.

Familiar with the flight patterns of the small planes, passenger airliners, helicopters and the normal air traffic. Did not notice anything unusual in the surrounding area. The witness was on his normal patrol that evening. The witness was walking do west and notices a light that resembled the normal police helicopter with it spot light on. And coming from the north, North West over the San Gabriel Mountains heading east. It appeared to have swept over the mountains then came lower into the valley. When it approached and was closer, the object looked more of a ball or sphere of light. A super white florescent light with a hint of blue, it had a slight haze around it. Just like the planet Venus in the sky. The witness was expecting a helicopter sound but there was no sound at all. Planes and helicopters at that altitude make some noise at the least. There was no tr! ail of any kind either. The altitude was an estimated 2000 to 3000 feet when over head. Could not tell exactly the size of the object for it was as big as a small plane at 2000 feet at the point the object was over the witness. The witness had a flash light in hand and begins to flash his light at the object. After a few flashes the object or the ball/sphere of light was wobbling erratically up and down as if the object was reacting to the flash light. It soon starts gaining altitude and speed. Heading east then turning south. At that evening and time it past in near the moon and the planet Venus and the object was three times the size of Venus. And it was well gone at that point about 40-50 miles away from the witness. After the object was not seen it was about 19:50 hours. The objects flight path was do south east and seemed to be moving fast. Then do east and slowed down above the witness. Then slightly turned do south and speed off as well as gaining altitude.

The video and picture is of bad quality do to the darkness of night and the bad camera phones performance. The witness called his wife to notify her of the event. At 19:52 hours, the witness went to finish his patrol when he was feeling ill. The witness did feel like he was affected by the object as he felt dizziness, confused and disorientated as he was walking. The symptoms last for an hour. But wearing off and getting better as the hour progressed. Nothing else happened that evening. The witness is 99.99% sure that It (the object) was not a plane, helicopter or any other conventional know flying object but an unknown flying object that was in good visual detail to make an observance.  There was a similar object the passed by before in the same flight patter but do east only. The object was similar in size, color and shape. And it happened just as the station fire started.

It at first appeard to be an airplane since an airport is nearby and other aircraft were simultaneously visible, however as it went overhead there was no noise and we noticed a wobbling effect every couple seconds.  I should also mention that these aircraft were likely commercial or private and weren't pursuing this object.  There were also a couple satellites tracking across the sky high up in the background moving in varying directions, they were MUCH smaller and appeared to be moving MUCH slower than the object in question. This light headed SE from NW and would suddendly wobble left and right, in a predictably rhythmic fashion every couple seconds or so.  It wasn't changing course, instead, it appeared to rattle and continue straight... then over again, similar to wathing the line on a heartbeat monitor.  It eventually faded out of view. I've seen this object once before around the same time of evening on what appeared to be an identicle track, size, and brightness however there was no wobbling on the first occasion.  I chalked the first sighting up as maybe a VERY LOW flying satellite if a type I've never seen.

The objects covered approx. a 45 degree angle of sky from my position in about 15 seconds.

I was looking at the landscaping of the backyard with my brother, sitting on a patio chair facing South. There was very little moonlight and the stars were very clear and beautiful. All of a sudden, in my peripheral, I saw a bright light up to the upper-right of my eyes. I looked and it was very fireball looking like the brightest star in the sky which I knew I hadn’t seen before as I had been star gazing for about 30 minutes. The light was circular and dimmed out very quickly as it moved in an upward/southern/away motion on an xyz plane and looked as if it was moving slower and slower as it finally, slowly went out of sight. This lasted ~15 seconds. I had seen 2 other very same instances of the very same way which one happened in the very same place (at my new home and in the same area). The other instace was ~3years ago, only this one looked like a satellite moving across the sky from north to south and I was looking Eastward. It stopped for about 5 seconds, then slowly lowered for about 3 seconds and stopped again. It right away seemed to get much brighter like a spotlight looking left of me (northwest). It rotated 3 seconds until it finally seemed to be facing directly at me. I called my friend to look which was running from the patio which was about 50 feet away, and right away (coincidentally as if it heard me, just like when I called my other friend to look at the most recent siting), the object went in the same motion only moved SouthEast; then was as dim as original brightness. It began moving in the same direction as originally with what looked like the same angle of height (about same as other sitings) for about 3 seconds and when he finally got to me, the light was faded out of sight.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,,

Friday, June 19, 2009, 9:15 am I was driving, 60 miles per hour, to work on Interstate 80 heading west just South of Salt Lake City, from about the 700 East Exit to the State Street Exit, approximately one mile in distance I viewed the following.   In the distance, some five miles away, an airliner that had taken off from the Salt Lake International Airport heading due south and slowly gaining altitude when I noticed two aircraft flying parallel to the airliner but most likely closer to my position.    The two craft, in formation, then made a right 90 degree turn and came directly east towards my position and then made another hard 90 degree turn and flying due north over me at maybe 200 to 400 feet, at about the State Street Exit. The time I had to view these craft including paying attention to traffic and observing was at least one minute. The craft appeared to behave aerodynamically.   They seemed to cover quite a bit of territory in a short time, at least four to six miles.  When they made their turn just before passing over me, they must have been near a stall speed to make such a sharp turn and for me to view them in as much detail. I heard no engines, prop or jet.   The Craft were approximately the same size as a military fighter plane, or smaller.   My window was down, but I think I would have heard something over the noise of the traffic.   I-80 is under construction and the max speed is 60 mph, and the traffic was light. The odd appearance of these craft is the reason for this report.  The fuselage was long and cylindrical, coming to a point at the front and rear in the usual aerodynamic configuration.   The wings began about mid point of the length fuselage shaft.    The appearance of the wing configuration, in plan view, is that of a bird with wings spread out.   The leading edge of wing seemed to sweep forward and then back again at the end of the wing, with the rear of the wing flaring back toward the fuselage.   The color was a white or silvery white.    I couldn’t remember seeing any secondary wing or tail stabilizer in the rear.    There was no forward secondary wing in front of the shaft as one would expect of so long of a forward portion of the fuselage.    No cockpit canopy could be seen. Upon reviewing what I had just seen, the wings appeared to have a wide black line that followed the contour of perimeter of the wing, and set back from the edge of the wing. I latter called the Salt lake City Airport and talked to the air tower representative and described what I had seen, At first he stated that these craft could be from any number of different government agencies, he then stated that they were most likely VFR craft used in mosquito abatement.   I said they had pretty sophisticated equipment for crop dusting. I will send a copy of a sketch that I had drawn.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,40.704464857813726,-111.88213884685625

I estimate the time of the event to be around 22:30, though I may have been mistaken since we had just been hanging out all night and not paying attention to time. My friend and I were outside smoking, and she looked up in the sky and pointed out to me what we both thought was a satellite. It was moving south-southeast We watched it briefly (about five seconds), only to see it stop mid-flight, jerk to the northeast (diagonally up and left from its position), and begin flight again. The object continued this pattern of stopping and re-starting for the next thirty to forty seconds. Its timing was very sporadic as was the degree to which it adjusted its flight path. When we started losing sight of it, I climbed up on top of my chair, but could not see it anymore due to the light pollution on the horizon. I walked inside and told my boyfriend, who was sitting on the sofa watching tv, exactly what we saw. My friend confirmed everything. My boyfriend told us that he had seen objects like that in the sky over the beach before. Neither my friend nor myself could discern a specific shape or color to the object as it was very high in the atmosphere. The area in which the sighting occurred is close to the Canaveral National Seashore, so there is a possibility that it was some sort of government intelligence. My friend and I are both twenty years old. She and I were room mates at the University of Alabama for one semester, after which I moved to the eastern Florida coast and she moved to a suburb outside of New York City. We're both hard-working students. My friend is pursuing a degree in nursing, while I'm busy studying chemistry so that I can do research someday. I'm also a waitress in a local wine bar. My friend had been working at a Red Lobster part-time. My boyfriend has a bachelors degree in economics from the University of Florida, but due to the economy he works at a local restaurant on the beach.

I waited, and soon it flashed again. It was positioned ""above"" Orion's Left ""shoulder"" (West-North-West+-) or the right side of Orion as you look at it (Orion was lying on his right side). When it blinked again I began to count. I counted to seven between blinks, some were dimmer, some brighter. I went inside to try to find a place to report it or look it up if it was a satellite, to no avail, for half an hour. When I went back outside it was no longer visible (8:15). It did NOT appear to be moving, or, it may have been moving VERY slowly. I've watched satellites before, seen them traveling West to East and North to South. I know there are geostationary satellites, but I've never seen a blinking one before. My best guess is a rocket booster that became geostationary (since others have seen it in the same position) and as it turns end-over-end it also spins and some sides may reflect better.

It looked spherical, and was scintillating, and curiously, the air around it seemed to shimmer - it was hard to see its edge, that's the only way I can describe it. It moved silently from my left, and I was thinking to myself that if it stopped it would have be a UFO. And then, as if it heard my thought, it stopped directly in front of me! I just stared at it, and I had the most curious feeling of being watched, hard to describe, just felt as if it realized I was looking - so I waved at it.  It then started to slowly go up into the sky. As it was going up, its color seemed to change to a whitish metallic, almost like sodium. And then, it began to flash. A bright, neon green, then pink, and yellow. It also - sounds weird again - seemed to phase in and out of the air. It would seem to disappear, then I would see one of the flashes, and it would appear again at some distance and disappear.

We were traveling East on State Route 40 when one of us, (I can't remember who saw it first.) noticed the object in the sky, to the right.  It looked as if it was some distance away.  It was approximately 5:30 or 6:00 PM, and still light outside but there was a lighter oblong shape in the sky.  I've always said it looked like an ""opening"" in the sky. At the bottom end of it small (looked small to us) black frisbee shaped object would come out, and fly around close to the area it seemed to emerge from and fly back in.  When it went back in it would disappear from view. I think there may have been three or four that would be visible at the same time, and they would disappear into the end of the oblong lite and come back.  Maybe the same ones; maybe not. We continued to watch it, and made a turn back into Cambridge,  To be honest I don't know when we lost view.  I was surprised that no one else said anything about it, as there was a lot of traffic on the highway that night.  We decided to drive back into Cambridge hoping to keep the objects in sight.  Upon entering  the city saw to the left of us a large blimp like object, black or dark gray, which seemed rather close to the ground, seemingly not far above tree level.

I had been out for probably 30 minutes when I had a sudden feeling that I should look up.  I will never forget what I saw.  It was a single disk shaped craft, directly overhead.  It flew at an altitude that could only be described as miles high.  I would guess 25 or 30 thousand feet minimum.  It was very large.  Approximately the size of a dime held at arm’s length.  It was traveling from south to north appearing to have just flown over Carson City NV when first seen.  It traveled from directly overhead to out of sight on the horizon in the direction of Reno NV in about 20 seconds. On the off chance that this could be confirmed in any way, I could lead anyone to within a couple of hundred feet of where the encounter took place and demonstrate the movement of the craft.

The entire school witnessed this event, including teachers and administrators est at 700 people.   Why this concerns me is that I had an Uncle that lived on Opa Locka Blvd at that time.  He could not get home for lunch from work via his normal route because the roads were blocked and detours were set up.  He saw something but would never talk about it to me.  All that he may have talked to have since passed.   The way I remember what happened is that the UFO actually landed.

I am reporting my experiences having noticed the heightened awareness of UFO’s, i.e. the History Channel.  Therefore, I am submitting these events purely for the sake of your collection of data. I'm sorry but I prefer to put all reports into this one, I hope you don't mind. Experience 1 of 3 It was in 1967.  I was 12 years old living on a farm in Kansas.  I was on the second floor in my bed about midnight or after, not sure.  I awoke to see flashing lights, like an ambulance, coming across the corn field hovering just above the corn. It came into the farm yard and hovered making all sorts of loud noises like sirens.  A bright light lit up everywhere and that was the last I remembered till the next morning when I ask everyone at breakfast, “What was that big light and all those sirens?” Nobody new what I was talking about and it was accounted to a dream.  Of course to me I felt I was not dreaming at all, however, it did stop after the bright light peaked. So I concluded maybe it was a dream, but really didn’t buy it.  I let it go nonetheless. The interesting thing about this experience is what happened 25 years later. For some reason it started to bug me that I never resolved that experience I had at 12.  I had insurance and wondered if I could get hypnotherapy  to recall what really happened.  To my surprised I was able to see a license hypno-therapist.  It became legit because the therapist said it was most likely some trauma that caused the experience and I suppressed it to this particular memory. He put me under hypnosis and regressed me back to that night.  I recalled the story as it unfolded while in my regressed state.  The story was very similar to the memory I had except that I was able to see more of what happened in the farm yard.  I was up out of bed and looking out the window.   I saw two lights whirl around in a gyroscope fashion.  They kept doubling until there was nothing but a ball of light and then the white out happened.  When the session was over I ask the doctor what he thought about it. He said, ""I have no idea, perhaps a dream (?), but I don’t really no for sure.""  He did say there was no sign of trauma, however. One further note, after this session I found I had a very difficult time talking about it. I even wondered if the doctor, while having me under, put a notion in me to not talk about it.  Because every time I tried, I’d wind up saying, ""forget it, I can’t talk about it.""  I would even get like a lump in my throat and words just wouldn’t come out.  That was 14 years ago, it’s only been in the last 5 years or so I’ve been able to discuss it as before. Experience 2 In 1975 I was traveling with a friend in my car returning home from a day trip.  We were just coming to the west end of our town.  We both saw at the same time a green object with a sort of florescent light with a red light on the bottom. It zoomed across the sky going at least several thousand mile per hour.  It went across the eastern sky, about the altitude of a jet, at about 45 degrees in about 2 seconds.  It left a green florescent trail behind it that faded quickly but stretched pretty far.  I stopped immediately in the middle of the highway (two lane road really, HWY 56 in Kansas).  We got out and could see nothing.  Both of saw and described the exact same thing. Experience 3 This was January 1, 1997.  I was backpacking in the Mark Twain Forest of Missouri.  It was about 11pm.  I was sitting on a rock in the middle of a clearing watching the sky and saw 4 lights.  If they had been motionless they would not have been detected because they looked exactly like just another group of stars.  They formed a perfect box shape at first. They moved exactly together.  Making squares, diagonals, all sorts of movements in all directions and most of the time staying in this box formation, but varying it a little. I watched this for about ten minutes, same thing over and over. They were very clearly there.  Then all at once they stopped and about a half a second later, they broke formation and all spun out in weird spiraling ways in the opposite direction until they were gone out of sight which only took about another half a second.",,38.2389,-96.7512

Over these many years one sighting and an historical event that followed have haunted me and I have never known what I should have done at that time.  Heck I was 17 years old, driving home from cheerleading practice.  I questioned my own credibility that day.  Who would believe me? I told my mother when I got home that I saw a flying object that I couldn’t explain.  She had little to say other than, ""I don’t know what to say about that.""   For what it is worth, here is my story:  April 4, 1968.  I remember the day because it was that evening that Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated.  The events of that late afternoon coupled with his tragic death colored my world view forever.  I made a promise that I would remember everything. I left the Gainesville High School gym at about 4:15 pm.  My family lived in a small brick ranch house on Lake Lanier about 6 miles outside of Gainesville, GA in Hall County.  I headed east on the Cleveland Hwy while listening to WDUN radio.  At that time the Cleveland Hwy. was a winding 2-lane road lined for most part by large trees and small residences sparsely spaced out. There was a restaurant called The Big Bear at a bend in the road.  It was noted for the cage in the parking lot that housed a large bear.  (In hindsight this was a cruel thing, but in 1968 it was just a promotional gimmick for a dingy old restaurant.)  Once I cleared the bend and lost sight of the Big Bear, the landscape opened up.  Trees had been cleared years before to make room for Riverbend Baptist Church on the left and a small strip mall on the right.  The sun was very low and bright behind me at that point.  I recall that my rearview mirror caught the sun and I slowed down because its reflection in my mirror temporarily made seeing ahead more difficult.  I adjusted the mirror so I could see, but I still was going very slowly. At that moment in front and above me I saw it.  The object had suddenly appeared from the south or southeast.  It came to a dead stop.  It did not waiver.  It hovered silently above the highway.  I looked in the rearview mirror to see if anyone was behind me and there wasn’t.  I wanted someone else to see this.  (There weren’t a lot of cars on the road because most people didn’t get off from work until 5 so I saw few cars in front or behind and passed few cars traveling in opposite direction.)  I slowed to almost a stop while my eyes fixed on what hung suspended ahead and in the air.  Its size I could not begin to guesstimate.   Its altitude I couldn’t say.  But I can say that it was metallic silver because the sun that had so bothered my eyes fropm the west reflected on part of the object. I thought at first it must be a jet the military was testing.  But there was no noise, there were no windows or markings and I saw no lights.  It was daylight and if there were lights they had to be white and were indistinguishable from the sun’s rays that bounced off the right side of the cigar-shaped object.  I knew I was looking at whatever it was from the side.  It could have actually been a disk.  Its smooth shape was almost too perfect. It stayed there for a number of seconds, but it seemed like minutes to me because of all the thoughts that raced through my head.  My body felt as though something passed through it.  I vowed to remember every moment.  Maybe one day someone would want to know when I first saw an UFO. All of a sudden it catapulted to my left and was gone.  Not a trace.  Not a sound. It was as though it disappeared, but for a nanosecond I did see movement and I know it headed north or northwest.  I simply don’t know which because the road twisted and turned often. There was another strange occurrence at that moment it left.  The radio DJ or news reporter commented on Martin Luther King, Jr. being in Memphis.  I distinctly remember something about a garbage collectors strike.  Now I had given very little thought to King in my short life.  I heard the things my parents said and I had listened to the ""I Have a Dream"" speech which greatly impressed me.  But heck I lived in the Deep South and there was controversy that swirled around him.  Back to the story.  At the moment I heard the radio and saw the object disappear from sight a thought passed through me, MLK was going to die that day.  Now this thought came to me between 4:30 and 4:45 EST.  King was in Memphis and was shot at 6:01 pm.  It hadn’t happened yet. When I got home and after I told my mother about the UFO, I asked her if she had heard about King being killed. The question was asked because I thought it was strange that I was aware of his death and yet the radio announcer had said nothing.  I turned on the TV to see if there were any news bulletins.  During those times there was no 5 PM news.  There were no bulletins.  So I thought to myself, ""You are crazy.  That UFO has rattled you and crazy stuff is going through your head.""  I plopped down in front of the TV and was the typical teenager. At some point that evening a news bulletin did come on and said King had been killed. My first thought was, ""Why did it take so long for the news to announce this?""  Then Walter Cronkite (I think it was him) said King was shot on the balcony of the Lorraine (sp) Hotel at 6 pm.  My heart started pounding.  That was wrong. He must have died earlier. You can’t imagine how I felt.  I had known something was going to happen to King, but I couldn’t interpret my instant knowledge at the time it was revealed to me.  I wouldn't have known what to do.  I thought I was crazy. Over the years I felt such guilt.  I could have stopped it.  I could have called the radio, but I was so young and had never had anything happen to me that could be classified as weird.  The UFO sighting and the knowledge that King was going to die occurred almost simultaneously.  I didn’t sleep well that night. So as you read, these two things are entwined for me.  I can never separate them.  Everything is so clear from that afternoon and evening and yet it was 40 years ago. Since then when I hear about UFO sightings, I don’t doubt that some of them are true.  Over years I wondered what it was I saw.  Funny, I never thought of the object being piloted by aliens, at least not aliens of a hostile nature.  At some point during my college years I found peace about what it might be.  I came to believe that the UFO was piloted by the descendents of humans.  Maybe this seemed plausible because as a young child I loved science fiction.  I have always chosen to believe that time travel would one day be possible, far off into the very distant future.  When the technology exists to transcend space and time, our descendents, whatever they are like, will come back to witness history.  I don’t believe they will or can tamper with us very much because if they do, they could be destroying themselves.  Their mere existence hinges on us.  The desire to understand from whence they came, what we looked like at this primitive stage, how we lived, and what formed our values is certainly things to study.  They are looking for themselves.  No, I don’t believe in aliens that truly are alien to us.  I believe in beings that have evolved and long left earth.  They have populated other celestial orbs.  They won’t bother me or anyone else.  I am one of their ancestors.  I know that my story is in the distant past.  Before the Internet I didn’t concern myself about what or who I should tell my story.  It was shared over the years with only a few close friends.  Still before I aged anymore I wanted to tell my story for the record.  I saw something I couldn’t explain. It flew at a speed I couldn’t comprehend.  I don’t know why it stopped there or why I was the only car at that point past the bend.  I have wondered if anyone else saw anything that day in North Georgia, but I never heard any stories on TV.  I presumed that either I was it or the others were like me.  It couldn’t be explained and people questioned their sanity.  It still amazes me that NO ONE has taken a credible photo.  When these things appear they are often too far away to get clear shots.  No pilots who have claimed to see them up close even had a camera and could record it.  There have been so many hoaxes over the years that the few that have credibility are questioned.  I didn’t have a camera that day and even if I did, the event passed so quickly I could have never gotten a shot off.  Surely someone at some point with get a verifiable photo that can be blown up and will make it evident to everyone.  We are out there. By the way, I have never seen another.  It was a one-time thing, but I still look up and hope that before I die I can see another.  If I do I won’t wait 40 years to share it with you.",,34.31321771217712,-83.80587490774909

I have no memory of nine hours and my friend gets frightened even to this day should I mention it and will not talk about it.  I know aircraft and this was nothing man made, it moved much too slow and too fast.  The event did not scare me and I would like to know where the nine hours went,  I think. I have thought about regression hypnosis but do not trust it.  Perhaps I would be afraid if I could remember.  I do not talk much about this as everyone thinks it's crazy but I have seen them on more than one occasion and with other people, one being a pilot who will not talk !!!

I don't know how else to describe it. Once inside the house, we immediately started telling the other adults there what we had seen.  Of course we were met with jokes and sarcasm.  My ex couldn't take the ridicule and so he did an about face and said he really hadn't seen anything.  As you can imagine, I was furious with him for not standing up and telling them the truth. Years later, after we divorced, we met for drinks and he admitted to me that he had seen what I had seen, but could not take the ribbing from the other men in the room.

The yellow box in the diagram represents our house and the ""X"" is where I was standing when I saw something over the Coca-Cola plant across the street.

I ran inside to get a grown-up to come look at it, but by the time we came back outside it had already disappeared. Since it was just before dusk they told me it was probably the sun playing tricks on me.
